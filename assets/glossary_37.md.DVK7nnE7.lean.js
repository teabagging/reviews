I thought it was extremely original, literate, and well-written, with good atmosphere and a great aura of mystery. The second book, \\"The Fall of Hyperion\\", just seems so *ordinary* in contrast. I've read a hundred other books just like it, all equally forgettable. By the time I reached the last third of the book, I was already completely disinterested. Threw it in the trash when I was done. I won't be reading the next one, cause I just don't care. I'm not saying it's a terrible book... just terribly average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyperion Fell","review":"Hyperion was an inventive, deep and delightful read. I was blown away by the scope, depth and detail of this universe, and by the subtle but powerful literary allusions strewn throughout the book (Hyperion's structure is lifted from the Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and the poetry of Keats infuses the book with soul).The Fall of Hyperion lacks all of these qualities, going instead for a pay-by-the-word space opera. Simmons did maintain the integrity of some of his characters, but it's apparent that he decided against doing the heavy lifting of evolving, transforming and revealing the hidden depths of those characters, something we know he can do by reading the original novel. Instead, he provides a perfectly readable, interestingly plotted but ultimately unfulfilling sequel to one of the best novels of the decade.Read Hyperion. Skip the Fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at the same level as Hyperion","review":"This book concentrates more on action that in the psycological and philosofical explorations that are essential to Hyperion. Kind of a let-down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long in the middle, but pretty good","review":"I'm somewhat hesitant to give this book 4 stars, I found it excruciatingly painful with the addition of a new character symbiotically related to whom this book is dedicated. Well, I know more about John Keats than I'd ever planned on knowing now. Although I found this book well-written, there were a few flaws that would make me reconsider my editor if I found them in this book. I saw a few other reviews mention that this book is long in the middle, and I agree. I also detected a slice or two of American cheese in the ending. Other than that, you won't be too disappointed if you read the first novel with its ultimate cliffhanger -- each of the questions in Hyperion are answered here."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rocks!","review":"Hi, I was only 15 when i read this book last year, and it was the best book i ever read! It was great, and even though it was a bit difficult at first (since i haven't read the first book) after a few pages, i began to understand what was happening in the book. I totally enjoyed it, and it's about my favourite book ever. I totally recommend it to anyone. The book just keeps going and going.........like when you feel a book is about to end, and then it takes another turn, throwing you in further(kind of like this review)............ It did that about a zillion times to me, and i began to wonder if the book was ever going to end........ in short i could have said this in 10 words:I am God, i command you to buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but a bit convoluted","review":"Basically, it didn't flow very well.

I found this to be just as enjoyable as the previous novel in fact I certainly wanted to know what was going to happen to our pilgrims ending the first book heading down into the valley of the glowing tombs singing \\"off to see the wizard\\". There were some parts of the book which dragged a bit but overall there was enough of a compelling plot to keep you very interested.

I held off for two weeks before watching the episodes because I wanted to find a time when nothing better was on. Once I popped them in my DVD I watched them all in one weekend. The humor still made me laugh and the music still kept me spell bound.As an added bonus, I noticed small glimpses of history, such as small hints of their fighting and Jerry's early fund raising for Muscular Dystrophy.I only have one drawback to report. These shows date back to before the time that TV camera angles changed every few seconds. The skits sometimes seem to drag on about twice the length of modern skits. This didn't bother me, but a person with pronounced ADHD might not sit through them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Back Memories","review":"I'm 18 and this CD brings back all the memories of when we were all growing up.

I reached the conclusion not by my feelings or traditions but by research. this book has alot of info on the topic and details of historic debates concerning the verse, however i do wish that textual critics would not be so harsh about this with other very few critics who do accept the verse, i end in the words of Cyprian in 250 A.D : the lord says 'i and the father are one' and likewise it is written of the father and the son and the holy spirit.

Living a simple, hermit life, this writer gave up the modern dream of accumulating fame and fortune. Lax attempted to bring attention and love to the world every moment of every day.This poet's slowed down, minimalist style intrigued Europeans long before his fellow Americans.

I was on a weekend expedition with a group of folks doing some sea kayaking and a woman on the trip had the same bag, she had just bought it, at full price. It was represented as being waterproof by the dealer. A wave caught her and she went over, and when she came up the bag was filled with water and she lost her cell phone and camera. It is really a splash bag, and if you carry anything of value you must put it in it's own drybag.

I stayed up all night reading it, it moved me that much. It's well written and he describes in detail his travels with his 15th Century Tibetan Spiritual Mentor Rebazar Tarzs. He's either got the greatest imagination ever or as I truely believe it's an accurate account. If you read it with an open mind it will rock you from long held beliefs about life in the worlds beyond the physical. It's fascinating, enthralling and in the class of the best spiritual books ever written. It's right there with Gibran's works, Yogananda's, the Dali Lama, etc. Best read of 2003 for me.

Later, under Lancer Publications he reprinted it, calling it a first edititon but changed the name from Kirpal Singh to Sudar Singh then finally to Rebazar Tarzs.After Paul Created Eckankar early Eck literature has his master as Sudar Singh. Later he changed the name to Rebazar.Now and then the old Orion magazines pop up on Ebay. Find them and read what Twitch said about his experience and whom he called 'Master' then.Tiger's fang is a fictional novel to get Paul's name and face into households, and beef up his bank account.

The only way I was able to fix this was by using a converter that took the KB and Mouse PS/2 connections from the kvm cable and turned them into a single USB connection. $50 for two of these to fix a problem that shouldn't have been there in the first place. Cheaper than a new KVM I suppose.I also have a lot of trouble using the KVM keyboard shortcut in Windows 2000, causing me to have to reach across my desk to hit the button on the KVM to switch to another computer, rather annoying.It works fine with my monitor though, even at 1600x1200@85Hz, which is how it gets two stars instead of one.My recommendation is to avoid this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good book, with some pretty good stories and poems.","review":"The book is great.

If you enjoy poetry, the book is about 1/3 poetry. If you're seeking enjoyable, passion-filled stories about vampires, you may be disappointed.Not a fan of poetry, I concentrated on the stories. Quite a few got bogged down in excessive narrative and/or description. Others are brief excerpts from stories or novels, so there's nothing to satisfy a reader. Some are about vampires in only the loosest sense: one \\"vampire\\" is a plant.I found the offerings by Anne Rice and Alexandre Dumas the most readable, but both are romantic stories, which may not appeal to everyone.I read vampire stories for passionate characters and situations.

I consider The French Lieutenant's Woman and The Magus to be two of the best novels of the 20th Century. I've read both several times. But I just can't say the same of Daniel Martin.It started off so well, with it's scenes from the war. But then Daniel grew up and became a painfully self-absorbed creature. Daniel may represent Fowles' picture of late 20th Century man, but it's not mine. Because his portrayal rang so false, I found the book to be merely a well written slog through the angst of the 20th century (sorry--I should be ashamed of that last phrase).A noble effort, but false in the end. Worst of all, a lot of it is just plain boring.I continue to hope that Fowles will write another book that will capture my heart and mind like The French Lieutenant's Woman. (Sigh!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten, dated, bloated, but reflects a certain zeitgeist","review":"Daniel Martin runs through life, jobs and women with clumsy fecklessness, shredding the lives of those around him. If ever one needed to study how far male-female relationships and identity have progressed since the mid-1970s, reading this farraginous book would do it. Martin, adulterous, smug, opaque to himself, lost in a fog of alcohol, is a sort of man who thankfully no longer exists. The women in this novel would all have been more fortunate to have been born 40 years later, so as not to have to protect themselves through liaisons with this shabby character. An oppressive sensation held me throughout the book, a desire to excuse myself from the fustily chauvinistic world of Martin. Unless you are writing a book on how gender and power relations are represented in Fowles, avoid this pointlessly preening and overlong novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writer, boring story","review":"Loved The Magus. Kept waiting for this one to take off. Save for the one chapter on his first love - about three-quarters of the way through - I found little worth hanging onto.

But, sorry, none of it worth the 600+ page plod."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as you know Fowles can be","review":"I fell in love with the Magus. It is my favorite read of all time. Looking at Fowles' book list I thought I would have years of reading pleasure at his hands. Then I read A Maggot and was horribly disappointed. Daniel Martin does not disappoint!

I have a 40' section of wall 7' high and one light can illuminate about a 4-6' section. I'm planning on getting a few more to fully light the wall. I also just built a second story deck and they worked great for lighting the columns of the deck to below. Not sure if I'm going to use them for top down lighting or bottom up.

It's loaded with self-promotion and personal drivel not related to the game of euchre, and it does not even lay out the rules for two-handed euchre or euchre solitaire.Not to mention the 24 example \\"Classic Hands\\" that take up about a third of the book.

All I can say was I was not dissapointed!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the weirdest movies....","review":"There are people out there who gave this movie 5 stars. 5! And they said this was scary. This is actually one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen. It is filled with tons of sexual innuendo. Everything from pedophilia to lesbianism. If that what people find scary, then perhaps it is. The person who played LEMORA looks like some dude with a mild case of acromegaly. And not surprisingly, she has never been in another movie. The people who gave this movie 4 or 5 stars are either NOT horror movie fans, or are basing there reviews soley on nostalgia. Perhaps this movie was scary some 30 yrs. ago, but today it only comes off as weird.

Bruce Franklin has assembled a remarkable collection of prose and poetry from America's most silenced corner. As a survey of prison literature (both poetry and prose), it educates and questions; as truth from America's most oppressed class of citizens, it is soul-shaking and heart-rending. The selections expose the ugly face of American justice, but also put human faces on its many victims. These days, it isn't popular to want to give prisoners anything, even credit for writing such powerful words. Yet their power cannot be denied. The men and women whose work appears in this book write to communicate their shattered lives with all the passion of any writer in the free world. Their words, sharp as razor wire, are hard to forget, and I commend Mr. Franklin for putting together such an unusual and revealing anthology. -Jeff Evans, Author of Undoing Time: American Prisoners in Their Own Words"},{"rating":"1","title":"Franklin's obssessive thoughts have skewed the literature.","review":"As usual, Professor Franklin's interpretations are off-base due to his obsessive-compulsive readings of the texts. While many of the works collected herein are deserving of attention and can stand on their own, Franklin's one-note thought process and style ruins one's enjoyment of them. Apparently this is a problem for all of Franklin's works, and the courses he teaches, which often ignore the text and the human reality in favor of his (frequently cardboard leftist) theory du jour.This is no way for a humanist to behave, and of course ultimately it hurts the causes he himself espouses. And most likely the humans he hopes to help. Criminals, after all, are not cartoon cut-outs who spout whatever it is Franklin wishes to hear.A reader/professor based in Cambridge, Mass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice light, but made in China (?) not Germany (?)","review":"Neatly packed, comes in a box with a booklet showing different types of lights. I would have giving this light 5 stars but in the product description it says German-engineered, but it has stamped made in China on on the box, so I would guess the light is also made in China, otherwise it seems the box would also have German engineered on it. Product description is rather misleading. Price is good, better than other sites which could be twice as much, but could get a similar bright light made in China for about $3 to $5. Otherwise, it is attractive, the right size, and it does have a nice bright light, so far, which is great.

Professor of Astronomy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, James Kaler reveals the extraordinary physical forces that are involved with the birth, growth cycle, and death of stars. A constant reference throughout this informative little volume references our own Sun and solar system. The Little Book Of Stars is a superbly written and presented introduction to neophyte astronomers and the non-specialist general reader with an interest in the nature of stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!

So one can see the significant advantage of reading it on a Kindle DX. However, there are two major disappointments with the Kindle edition.1) NO ABLE OF CONTENTS. Are you kidding me? 1,100 pages, SEVENTEEN chapters, divided into sub-chapters, plus (wait for it) Appendices and no ToC? We know the Kindle does not use page numbers, so how is one to navigate this extensive work?2) AWFUL MAP RESOLUTION. Massive fail publisher. The maps are very difficult to see / read, even on the 9.7\\" Kindle DX display. AM I supposed to keep the print edition handy in case I want to reference a map or one of the appendices?

But that's not what this is. This really isn't a love story at all -- despite the title. I wasn't really feelin' this at all. The story is completely unrealistic -- which can be fun -- but this plot line had so many holes in it -- it was just annoying.

Considering the way computers are taking over our lives, this film is ingenious in the way we are shown how a computer can change your life and even help you become a better person in the long run.

The plot is simple and sweet. A nerdy guy who falls for his beautiful upstairs neighbor but the problem is that his computer has the same taste in women.

If you don't know those songs, get them on MP3 using WinMX - you won't be disappointed. :-) Good plot too, with funny and ironic twists. Home computer technology is showing its age, but it actually raises some interesting issues about biological versus technological lifeforms (a fascinating topic in itself - go study cognitive psychology or robotics).

But the color format must be NTSC, or it won't play!!!Why don't the media companies know those things? Why do they mail out DVD's knowing that PAL will NOT play here in the US?

The video quality is EXTREMELY BAD and there is no information on the DVD or its packaging to tell you who released it in Australia. My old VHS tape of this movie that I copied off of cable (24 years ago) still looks better than Australia's horrid DVD.They claim it's new (on eBay), and factory sealed. The sellers all say: \\"We do not sell PIRATE, BOOTLEG, ASIAN or ILLEGAL COPIES\\". But it's still got to be illegally made.The cost of postage to send this back overseas is just not worth spending the time or the money even for a refund of half as much so the purchasing of this DVD from Australia is just one great big BAD experience. Has anyone else bought this crappy thing from Australia?I threw it away. With disgust, I just broke it in half and just threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, especially for oldtimers","review":"I loved this book, George knows the game maybe better than anyone.His practice routines will sharpen your game, but I especially liked the stories from the individual players on how they got started and played through the years. I'm sorry to hear a couple of them passed away recently.I'm 62 and they are all older than me. I remember playing against some of these guys in New York in the late seventies.They used to come into the bar I played out of in Queens to practice for the big tournaments in the area. I'm not so sure the younger crowd will enjoy it as much as I did.If your an older dart player like myself you have to have this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book for people interested in darts","review":"This book does a good job of describing the basic equipment of the game, and the rules of the most popular games. Silberzahn then gives a concise description of proper dart form and technique. This makes it a good starting point for beginners. Any new player following the advice in his book should improve. He follows it up with a discussion of strategy and practice routines. Again, this is helpful for novice and intermediate players seeking to improve their game. Where the book excels is in its \\"Legends Speak\\" section. I disagree with the prior reviewer's opinion on the value of advice from acknoweldged masters of the game. Advanced darters will appreciate the professional tips on tournament play from people who have \\"been there and done that.\\" Also, the \\"Legends Speak\\" section adds some human interest to the book, which is a quality lacking in many other works I have read on improving dart play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid advice with real experiences","review":"Great book.Simple, direct instructions for techniques to improve your game that work.

However, instead of putting out a new revised edition of this, he expanded the book and changed the name to DARTS: Beginning to End. This covers the flight school regimen and encompasses everything that is in this book. Buy this instead. It gets 5 five stars and is essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been done...","review":"This documentary is nothing new even though it purports to augment the Valkyrie plot story with details.

They do what they need to, fast, and leave. But unlike ninja attacks, these songs (which include classics like \\"Jeru\\", \\"Venus de Milo\\" and \\"Boplicity\\") are not painful in the least. The arrangements are tight and the songs are melodic, slightly Hollywood-esque but quite beautiful and well-performed. The songs themselves are also quite brief, as I implied a few sentence back - nothing over five minutes, in fact. The nonet plays together quite well, complementing each other throughout. They all have the mellow sound down - the album kinda sounds alike, but with great songs like \\"Rogue\\", \\"Rocker\\" and \\"Israel\\" on hand, who can complain? Now the only song I don't really like is \\"Darn That Dream\\", which falls in my list of Ten Songs We've All Heard Too Many Times Before. As for the rest? Get it.

Again, I am not an avid fan of jazz; I do not have the background or education of a jazz fan, but the reason I have such a deep Miles collection is that his music, by and far, is very moving. Not this album. Though technically proficient \\"Birth of the Cool\\" does not have a mood or \\"feel\\" to it that I associate with Miles Davis.

When we took it back to Toys R Us, the store manager told us it was the second return of this model that day, and that they were going to quit carrying it. we went to Target and bought an Eddie Bauer model with a five point restraint and no styrofoam anywhere.Alot of reviewers like this model, and if I hadn't have discovered the thin styrofoam, I might have, too.

Also after a couple of months of use I felt something crack on the side headrest and when I lifted it up the padding was nothing but styrofoam, that doesn't seem safe or comfortable.

I won't reiterate the comments below, but I wanted to post this caveat ---Some of the new artifacts in this expansion are quite overpowered. When players complained about how overpowered one of these artifacts in particular was, Mythic reduced its power. However, they reduced its power so as to make it useless.So if you're considering buying this expansion, and are willing to spend the hours finding your dream artifact, and the hours sitting around waiting to find the scrolls that activate your artifact, and the hours levelling up your artifact, beware --- it may very well be that Mythic will decide, after you spend all that time, to make your artifact useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly NOT recommended","review":"If you are just starting this game, this expansion pack is most definitely not for you. You cannot start Trial 1 until you are level 40. Frankly, if you go to TOA before you are 50, you will end up losing alot of gold and xp. I have several level 50's and die frequently in TOA. The main reason *NOT* to get this expansion is that you will be extremely frustrated. You will not be able to find a group to help you complete the trials. Why? Because they have all moved on to the higher level ML's. No one..I mean NO ONE..is going to repeat any trials or help you complete them. So all in all, you're paying for a slight graphic upgrade. The trials themselves are worthless. You need HUGE groups to complete them and if you are somewhat casual gamer, you won't get them done for all the reasons I stated above. This expansion turned a nice game into a horrible game. Many people are leaving due to this expansion. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This expansion damaged the game","review":"I've played DAoC since it's release. i had a great time - original RVR was a lot of fun, and my friends and i could always find a new distraction to keep us occupied. trials of atlantis, coupled with the updated new frontiers ruined DAoC. atlantis is centered around gaining artifacts, earned through absolutely tedious encounters that often require several groups of players. then, you still need to collect three scrolls to activate the artifact - these drop randomly from some creatures, calling for camping toa mobs endlessly. some of these artifacts are so overpowered that they've made players who don't get them obsolete. also, player crafted armor and particularly weapons have taken a serious blow. they can't compete with the perks on toa drops and artifacts. this expansion has pushed many original players, like myself, to walk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruddy expansion for great game.","review":"If you're thinking about playing daoc, buy the platinum edition, it includes all the expansions currently available for $29.xx and you won't regret it. If you've already bought gold or classic, you don't need to even think about ToA until you're close to level 40. (for those of you who haven't played, levels top out at 50) If you are a casual player (have a life, or don't have time/money to level 2+ accounts to 50) don't add ToA on, it'll be months before you see any benefit, and it's just not that fun. The rest of the game is very enjoyable, and you don't need this annoyance to enjoy it. Good graphics though, and it has a slightly upgraded standard interface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought, but rarely use","review":"Have several level 50 toons, and got this expansion because as many have said it's a \\"must have\\" in order to survive in RvR - the main/only \\"end-game\\" to DAoC.Main reason I don't use it anymore is they enormously sacrificed performance for eye candy. Using a 3Ghz, 1M, Nvidia system it's still a totally porked out lag-fest. Just try walking through Camp forest without looking at the ground and you'll probably lag all the way to Sauvage before you rubber-band back.I only load ToA to assist guildy's with their quests, then go back to the much more fun and much faster SI engine for regular game play.I'd only recommend this xpack to well developed characters. New players don't need it and would cause more frustration than fun. If your new to the game, get SI and have a blast. When you're 50, get ToA to do the quests, then go back to SI to enjoy the game again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your idea of fun is a root canal, buy TOA","review":"DAOC used to be a good game. Read these reviews and many will agree. With the introduction of TOA, Mythic(nerf-champs) has completely ruined DAOC. See the 1.5 star average? That is because so many people are ticked off at TOA they quit and came here to warn potential buyers. People are leaving this game daily with more to leave soon. Do not buy TOA. Do not buy DAOC as you will never ( I repeat, Never) complete any of the trials because once people have them done, they would rather stick a fork in their eye than help you do them again. Stay far far away. Wait for World of Warcraft or EQ2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This expansion took what was left of a possibly good game, and ruined any chance of DAOC ever being balanced. It's just another time sink that's now an absolute requirement to be able to play the game like you used to. In the past, casual players and die hard gamers could compete somewhat evenly in realm warfare, but that idea is completely dead with this expansion. If you don't put in countless hours getting the new items and abilities only offered with this expansion, you are at a significant disadvantage. You also have to go through and put in all that time for _every single one_ of your characters if you want to stay competitive. Don't waste any more time on this game, it's just going to go more downhill from this point on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killed DAoC","review":"This expansion has killed the game for me and a majority of my friends. I'v been playing since release, I beta'd SI and have many level 50s. I played TOA for a few days, and cancelled my account. There is so much wrong with this expansion its not funny. It was never needed, the game had tons of unused content, yet this bug fest of overpoweredness PvE'ness has turned the game into a shell of what it once was.Let me give you a little look at how good ToA is, SINCE RELEASE, Mythic has spent every single day pathing, hot fixing, and fixing the bugs in ToA. To this day the bugs are rampant and patches are 90% bug fixes.Mythic has gone downhill. They are by far one of the worst MMORPG companies. Dont buy this, you'll save alot of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great game gone bad","review":"DAoC was a great game until ToA came along.

Almost everyone with any sense has already jumped ship...& await upcoming MMORPG game releases that will hopefully be treated better by their creators than Mythic has treated poor DAoC.

Mythic is totally out of touch with its player base. For two years I played this (formerly great) game, had 50's in all realms, and tried to get my friends involved.Now I'm telling everyone to run, not walk, away from this game.DAOC is nothing but an exercise in futility now. Wait for World of Warcraft and save yourself a lot of time, money and unnecessary pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, it ruined the original game...","review":"I've been playing DAOC since it was released, and considered it the best MMORPG to be released so far.Then comes TOA. Very EQ-like PvE, there's no more flexibility that made classic DAOC so good, you need to do all these trials and equipment hunts with very demanding group requirements. If you don't like it, maybe you're just not interested in zerging these super mobs, or play offpeak, on an underpopulated server, or too briefly to be able to find good solid balanced groups or small armies... too bad.What really makes that terrible though is that it ruins RvR. Now, if you're the unfortunate type not to benefit from TOA's rigid progresssion system, that's depressing enough, but also, your character won't be up to par anymore. You can still do fine running with zergs, that's a great equalizer, but it's not much consollation for those of us who just hate feeling gimped like that. It really killed the game for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"If you are looking for additional stuff for DAoC for the casual gamer, don't waste your money. The only thing that makes this expansion even remotely worth it is the new graphics. The content stinks, Master Levels are impossible for small groups and if you don't have a level 50 char, don't even bother going. Most groups won't take chars lower than 50.All in all, if I had it to do over, I would not buy this expansion."},{"rating":"1","title":"How a Expansion Pack can kill a good game","review":"Camelot was a fine game. The game was geared so that a normal players or fanatics could compete on an even playing field and enjoy the game whether they played for an hour or 8.This expansion pack has introduced an environment that is totally unenjoyable to the casual player and has replaced 'tedious and time consuming' tasks for what was once fun.

Mythic, the makers of Dark Age of Camelot have ruined the game with this expansion. If you do not have this expansion you might as well quit the game since you will never be viable on realm vs. realm fights. With the expansion prepare to spend weeks getting Master Level abilities and Artifacts.Once you have spent the weeks and weeks getting the MLs and Artifacts (if you can stomach the bugs and unbelievably long camping times) you will be... exactly as powerful as you were before Trials of Atlantis to those who have also gotten them.This expansion is a real real real stinker. The only good thing is that it has a very nice graphics update. Aside from that people are so annoyed with Mythic over this expansion pack they are quitting the game in droves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total POS","review":"This game emcompasses everything DAOC players didn't want and hurts or ignores everything DAOC is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Odd Change in Direction","review":"Long boat rides, additional PvE levelling, large PvE raids, camping a spawn, long spawn times, kill stealing, slow character movement in water, and more. Everquest? Nope, this is the new Dark Age of Camelot.Mythic appears to be taking DAoC in a direction none of its long-time subscribers are likely to have guessed. One that would move the game away from its RvR roots (DAoC's excellent team-oriented PvP). This change might have been interesting to me had it been innovative and offered something unique. Unfortunately, most of what I see has the feel of something that's already been done elsewhere. Combine that with the fact that this expansion offers no new RvR content - no new RvR zones, no new RvR objectives, no new keep floorplans, no new seige equipment - and it gets a very low rating from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst expansion ever","review":"Let me start with the good part. The graphics engine update is nice looking.Now the negative:1) New graphics engine is a memory and processor pig, and may impact your playing experience.2) Requires high level characters to do anything. You need to be level 40 to even bother loading the expansion.3) Don't expect to do anything solo. This expansion is all about finding lots of other players to perform the same tasks. Group delays are mind boggling (hours in many cases)4) Quests (and MLs) are hard and often very frustrating.Over all, if you have money to burn and want the better graphics, then buy the expansion. Just don't expect the same fun experience in the module as previous offerings from Mythic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"They managed to take all the things bad about EQ and stick them in one neat expansion.

The expansion is filled with countless broken quests, non-working artifacts, as well as many other bugs and problems. Master Level abilities seem as if they were rushed out the door, as evident by the recent changs to the various Master Level abilites. However the problems do not stop at the game play. Mythic's poor in-game Customer support further frustrates gamers. It almost seems as if ToA is still in Beta, except it's an open beta test where you are paying $9.99, plus $12.95 a month, to help Mythic test ToA.

BIG mistake.I am so disappointed in what Mythic has done to Dark Age of Camelot by releasing this exansion.The expansion assumes you will have 8 or more friends online running with you, or you can't really do anything.The quests and objectives are tedious, take a lot of time, and highly frustrating. Expect to spend most of your time waiting for other players to group with you, or waiting on steps to reset, or recover from dying again and again. You will stand around a lot doing nothing but wait.Hats off to the power gamers that put up with all of this, but it isn't for me. Next time I will listen to what others are saying about a game before I buy it.Purchasing \\"Trials of Atlantis\\" has led to me canceling my account with Mythic, yes it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperate expansion to milk money","review":"This felt like an EQ release, all the bugs, long hours, camping, etc. If I wanted all that, I would still be playing EQ. Mythic went against everything they were saying from day 1 and turned into another verant.The content isn't even unique for the 3 realms, smallest expansion in terms of content and crappy programing/quests. Makes the item system like EQ, the haves always win and the havenots always lose.They went from equal footing in RvR to the people that play more will always win because they have more items/abilities. Endless grinds and camps are the norm in ToA, offers 0 content for the casual or low lvl player.I quit after playing ToA for a week and many others have done the same. Good job mythic, now you are just another failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was supposed to be an expansion, not a new game","review":"Most of the other ranters have hit the flaws with this game on the nose. My point is simply that if Mythic wanted to totally change game dynamic, perspective, and approach, they should have made a new game instead of trying to do it with an expansion pack. Expansion packs are designed to do just that, expand on the game in place, and not dramatically change it. As a result they have alienated their players who came to love and applaud the game they signed up for, not the one Mythic tried to change it into. If you want a different game, why don't you make a new one? It would have been much nicer to see Mythic address class and realm balancing issues as well as clean out some long term bugs with the new XP rather than add to them. As a result, Mythic is frantically updating their XP to try and accommodate for the drop in subscriptions.On the plus side the graphics really are quite impressive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. I paid $30 for a graphics upgrade.","review":"That's all I got out of it, a graphics upgrade. Great for PvE... if you roll deep with 15 friends.

It is also the first movie that Connery is seen in. In fact it's the first Bond movie. This movie is great. I like Connery the most because he's not as formal as most Bond's are. The only problem was that the villian should have been in it more. It also drags at parts. This is a Bond film worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie except for a few things","review":"For the most part I would suggest seeing this movie. Except that for one thing it is a slower paced bond than any others. Another thing is the audio track is not that good.

Certainly not one of the best James Bonds but certainly not the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect layout for a great series","review":"While it's not all here, and has a few flaws, this is a perfect layout for one of the best series ever made.

For now 40 years of action/adventureJames Bond has been thrilling audiences worldwide...Dr. No is an thrilling start, nevertheless only Sean Conneryis the man who brought Ian Fleming's character to life.Although 40 years of vintage, the first 007 film has allthe right ingredients who should please any Bond fan.Exotic locations, beautiful women, slang-bang action scenesand really evil villians. Made with a \\"cheap\\" amount of just900.000 US-$, Dr. No amazed viewers around the globe, andthis was merely the beginning...Great fun, even after 40 years, highly watchable, due to effective directing, splendid acting (Sean Connery, J. Wiseman),and of course tongue-in-cheek humor.jw"},{"rating":"2","title":"My name is Bond. James Bond","review":"Dr. No is the movie that introduced James Bond, and I believe it is a great movie. Since it is the first in the series, it lacked gadgets and a famous theme song(other than the bond theme), it made up for it in suspense and an amazing Bond girl(Honey Ryder).Some great moments of the movie is the first gun barrel shot of James Bond, the car chase, the spider crawling through 007's body, and the final showdown with Dr.No.Some weak(mostly irritating) moments are the errors. When Bond visits Miss Taro, we are given 2 different address. All the voices are from the same actress in this movie, except for Moneypenny. And during the island part, it got so dragging that I was tapping my foot, wishing it would move on.But other than that, a great movie to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first 007 flick has a few trademarks of its own","review":"You'd think the first 007 movie ['Dr No'] would have been the undeniable best but it is not. The best one is 'Goldeneye', 'You Only Live Twice, 'Goldfinger' and 'The World is Not Enough' all in sequential order. Dr No has a weird beginning as is the only Bond film without the classic opening shot with Bond as he takes a gun and shoots it as the screen then quickly turns red. It is also the only one without Q, still is a great movie but not all suspenceful but filled with plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr No","review":"This product is defective.

Sean Connery YES, Absolutely!!","review":"Film was vivid even on my Kindle Screen. This was my first James Bond movie (thought I'd start at the beginning) and it could not have been more of a treat. The humor holds up well over time. And, my god, Sean Connery. In addition to a clever and engaging performance, that man was sex on the hoof. All in all, Dr. No is great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond: The Beginning!","review":"Here is where it all started! Sean Connery at his roughest and toughest as Bond. \\"You've had your six!\\" Ursula Andress is THE classic \\"Bond Girl\\"! \\"Looking for shells?\\" \\"No, I'm just looking.\\" Joseph Wiseman a forboding presence as Dr. No. This time the Bond Baddie didn't need a superhuman henchman. He had his hands! Of course, this is basically just a modern day detective story. The exciting action sequences are rather sparse in this one. Still lots of danger, intrigue, suspense, and good character development to get this action film franchise off to a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond Arrives","review":"The distinction of \\"Dr. No\\" is that the first moment that Sean Connery utters \\"Bond, James Bond\\" with the cigarette dangling from his mouth at the baccarat table he has totally morphed himself into the character. Sean Connery is James Bond. That said, being the first in the series and working on a limited budget, \\"Dr. No\\" still has some kinks to work out. The title character as assayed by Joseph Wiseman is not that menacing. Ursula Andress, stunning as she is as she emerges from the water in that white bikini, is a bit wooden. The film's energy is derived from the magnetism of Sean Connery. The film also contains the best portrayal of Felix Leiter by Jack Lord. See this film as the introductory salvo of a great film series but it was not until the next venture, \\"From Russia With Love\\" that we really start cooking with gas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent transfer of a classic film!","review":"Dr. No, the original James Bond film with Sean Connery is a classic. Quality entertainment, if not necessarily a \\"great\\" film.The more relevant feature to this review is the quality of the BD transfer. It is amply evident that producers went to great lengths to ensure a top quality production for this blu-ray disc. The colors are vibrant and clear, and though the BD exceeds the absolute resolution of the original film stock, and thus one can see the grain, the picture is always crisp and pleasing to the eye. Audio too is clear, though it can hardly compare to the best new BDs. All in all, a worthwhile upgrade from the DVD, if such things matter to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second best James Bond movie of all - with the best James Bond!","review":"Hawai'i Five-0 fans will be proud of the futureSteve McGarrett (Jack Lord) in here.

SAY NO TO THE DR.","review":"Being a James Bond fan for over 20 years I view each installment with an impartial eye. Although Dr. No began the series it pales in comparison to the subsequent films. All 007 movies are approx. 2 hrs. long. Dr. No is one of the few that feel that long when viewing. This film is drawn out, lacluster and out right boring.Furthermore, Sean Connery is a pathetic actor. Much like Al Gore his persona and performance is robot like. Besides that, he's Scottish. Why in Gods name would he even be an option when casting. He can't even imitate a proper British accent. ... Just because an actor has had a long career does'nt necessarily mean he is talented. For Example: Kevin Costner"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I'm a very big bond fan. Since dr. no is the first oo7 flick, you'd think it'd have all of james bond's trademarks- fascinating villians, beautiful girls, exciting chase scenes, cool gadgets, and the inevitable twist-in-the-plot. But strangely, this movie is a pale shadow of the others. The caracters seem under-developed and you hardly get to know the villain. What is more, the antagonist doesn't really seem that cruel, which I think is quite important in a movie like this. Long story short, if you want some classic james bond films, try renting thunderball or goldfinger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff","review":"This is a ripoff. First off the steel packaging is exclusive from Best Buy. And secondly Best Buy is selling the movies with casing for $29.99. Don't waste your money.On the other hand the steel cases are amazing as well are the blu-ray transfers even on the older films.

I'll never forget the first glance we see of Bond as the theme music begins and he says his immortal phrase \\"Bond...James Bond\\". This film has great characters, car chases, beautiful women, and a fast pace from beginning to end whcih will leave you cheering for our hero, who is trying to stop Dr. NO from destroying the U.S. space program, and setting his eyes on world domination for Spector. This film stands out from the rest because of its simplicity and uniqueness. This is a classic film that changed movie making forever and startd a collection of great films to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much with so little","review":"If you watch Dr. No expecting a super production Bond film like the others, you might be a bit frustrated. The film is very good, but by what it is - a very good film, nicely crafted and the real silver screen test for 007. By this I mean it didn't had 100 millions on the shelf to be spent on it. Amazing how so much was done with so little.Will you see Titanic with the same interest in 2040? Maybe for its special effects. But you don't watch Dr. No today, after almost 40 years of its release, for its special effects. That's what makes this film such a classic. It has a story behind it. And an interesting and entertaining one, you might bet.The DVD has 2 documentaries, audio comments, TV ads, Trailers and more. Whatching the creation of a classic is great. So is to hear the famous \\"Bond, James Bond\\" presentation being said for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr No Blu-Ray","review":"As a 007 and Sean Connery fan, I've seen Dr No several times and it's as timeless and action-filled as ever, so this is really more a review of the movie itself because I saw no discernable difference between the Blu-Ray version and the regular DVD. Connery got the action-adventure genre rolling with this movie and the storyline would be just in place today as it was in 1962. To me, there's only one Bond, and that's Sean."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Bond Movie and Extras","review":"Simple plot, in the best sense of the words, not gadgetry, drives this movie. Super hero, yet human, Bond is suave, intelligent, sophisticated, cold, calculating, brutal when brutality is needed. He is brought to life by stunningly rugged and handsome Sean Connery whose very appearance causes women to stare hungrily and nearly to pant! He is both wonderfully protective of the innocent and particularly effective at inflicting pain and death on villains who would harm the world. The extras on the second disc, however, I found tedious and not worth watching. Others may feel differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Oldie but Goodie!","review":"This is the original Sean Connery (James Bond) film. Movie making technology and techniques have improved over the last 50 years. However, this film set a standard and established a new genre of film.

This also means it's a heck-of-a-lot easier to play than the other books (maybe this is a good thing for you?)Still, it's Ben Folds, who pwnz all things piano and the piano ballads (Luckiest, Fred Jones Pt. 2) are sure to please."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST!!!!","review":"Personally, I believe this is one of the best detectives book I've read.

It is cheap but that doesn't mean you should be defrauded of your money. Product barely worked few times. No power at all and battery does not hold charge.

Even beyond the quality of the information conveyed, the writing style is wonderful and the author makes an otherwise abstract and cumbersome topic quite readable and quite approachable. This book is regarded as the Clustering Bible worldwide, and I've seen copies placed prominently in the bookshelves of individuals in Beijing, Tokyo, Paris, and the US.

And while the music is pleasant enough (like the jazz in outer space of \\"Cyber Spies\\"), the general niceness really lends itself towards blandness, and Kenji doesn't quite overcome this. \\"Spaceship Earth\\" utilitizes samples from the moon landing -- a techno cliché at this point. So do we need further launch countdowns on \\"Discovery Launch?\\" \\"Dimension\\" lets the rhythm get a little more aggressive, but nothing that would get you too worked up.

WOW!!! What a great story. I have never read a book that literally moved me to the point of tears, as \\"Between Sisters\\" did.(Truth be told, I was sobbing like a baby).I was so impressed with this book, I ran out & purchased many of her other titles.

This was my first Kristin Hannah novel and definitely won't be my last! I laughed with these characters, I cried with them and I also rejoiced with them. I'm amazed at Hannah's ability to make you to feel what her characters are feeling. In fact, I really feel like I know them personally now and I'm sad that the story is over. This book was a fun read and a fast page turner. I really didn't want to stop reading once I started. Read this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, left me wanting more","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - all the characters were interesting,although their inability to figure out the common people in their lives until the end was frustrating.I made the mistake of reading the editors review while I was in the middle of this book so I knew everything that was going to happen. I still found it difficult to put down, however. I was so caught up in the characters that I found myself laughing, crying, frustrated, disappointed and happy at various points.My only disappointment was the ending - she wrapped up the sisters story well but left me wanting to know a lot more about the other key relationships and how they got to where they were in the final chapter. I hope Kristin Hannah develops these characters in a future book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty mundane reading","review":"Kristin Hannah is a good writer.

Both speakers work when listening to the radio though...go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coby Vertical System","review":"Looks nice except the speaks are shoddy--really cheap-looking. I ended up using my old ones from a Brookstone vertical whose main unit broke. This unit makes background noise--a friend said it's probably because it has cheap transistors. Mostly noticeable when volume is low. Also, the remote doesn't work right--sometimes I have to press buttons two or three times. I guess you ultimately get what you pay for. I loved the broken Brookstone I'd had for years for $250, but it's now about $400. The Brookstone had a better design, as on this one the radio and buttons are on the bottom--makes more sense to have them on the top where you can see them. Also has no clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound for the money","review":"For under a hundred dollars, this system sounds great and certainly looks great. The three towers (2 speakers and CD player) give it a powerful look. 3 cds are enough to last an afternoon or evening.

Wodehouse is like vintage champagne","review":"Reading P.G.Wodehouse is like going through life after drinking two glasses of champagne. His world is one where everyone would like to live, he is as absurd and as hilarious as life itself.

I go back to it about once every six months as I would go back to look at a yearbook. I recall the small incidents (such as the sexual prank that opens the novel), the emotions (like Deanie's 'second' sexual awakening) and the people (especially Sam and Deanie 'The Mutant')with such a vivid recollection that I'm swept right back into their world as I turn to page two. Tabitha King has created a masterpiece that has affected me in such a deep way that I cannot even fathom. Seeing that it is out of print is disheartening. I would dearly love a copy. MESSAGE TO PUBLISHER: PLEASE REPRINT! Not only do I want a copy of my own but I'd like the rest of the world in on the secret...

Some of these puzzles have multiple answers or are ambiguous. One example is early in the book. The puzzle 'Leftovers Again?' says that students are taught to turn a 1-ounce bag of clay into a statue. The quote in the book says, \\"For every five statues made, there is enough to make one more statue. Suppose a student is presented with 25 ounces of clay. What is the maximum number of statues he can sculpt?\\" According to the way it's written, most people, if not all, will answer 30. The book says 31. Incorrect! The puzzle says \\"for every five statues made, there is enough to make one more statue.\\" It does NOT say for every five statues made, there is one ounce left over. If it were written this way, 31 would be the correct answer.That is just one example. Trust me on this. The book is full of them. Save your money and buy another book.

Either that or some folks have been on a calorie poor diet of prose of recent. Like a few others, I found this a let-down, thinly written and not terribly convincing either in characterization or in point. It's almost as if she were in a hurry to tell about something, not quite having the time to decide what. Throwing together a number of high profile dramatic elements along with a collection of overwrought characters does not a story make. To each their own, I suppose. I vote for passing on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I figured out what happened between Geordie and his brother but kept reading to see how it would come to light.

Joby may be a good dancer but this video is not for beginners at all. Could be a combination of video editing and teaching that needs improvement, but it's definitely not one of the best out there. Joby does a variety of steps during the workout and instead of showing a closeup of her feet doing the steps, her upper body is in view.

There are also pieces of music art at the piano and touching/sensible stuff too (\\"Opening out\\" is a typical example) ...this work stands in the same place and it's almost equal to \\"Turn of the cards\\", \\"Scheherazade\\" ,\\"Ashes are burning\\" (the same consideration I have to do for almost the whole stuff by \\"Novella\\")Highly recommended to all the people with good taste !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent showcase of Haslam's vocal range; Great '70s takes","review":"An enjoyable introduction to Annie Haslam's vocal range, particularly on \\"Northern Lights\\" (probably the group's best-known radio tune).

It sticks in your head long enough to make you curious as to where you heard it and why you liked it so much! Well, curiosity pays, I found the album I'd cherished long ago on an 8-track tape, if I recall correctly. One of the better albums of the 70's. Haunting thematic intros, playful and carefully crafted bass lines that make you want to listen over and over again. If you're getting on in age, you're going to love the 70's rock feel and if you're much younger, even a teen...you'll appreciate the music on this particular album.

First, Danny Jo Brown does not sing lead vocals, and most importantly, Duane does not play lead guitar. This CD capitalizes on true fans of Molly Hatchet who desire new music from this once, stalwart, innovative Southern rock band. The record label should not insult our dignity with this contrived attempt at duplicating an original sound. The songs are forced, the guitar work weak, the hooks absent in just about every song except the original work of Molly Hatchet, \\"Edge of Sundown\\" from Danny Jo Brown's first solo album. Bring back the original or leave the legend of Molly Hatchet to the original body of work.

It sucks dust and hair out of my carpet, crumbs too. It's small & convenient, I will probably use this more often than use a bulky vacuum.Keep in mind that this vacuum is design for vacuuming a small area not the whole house because the sucking hole is small and it's handheld. This little machine can not last vacuuming the whole house without overheating.I give it 4 stars because emptying the dirt cup is hell. It's bagless so you have to open it to empty. When you open it, dirt splashes everywhere. I find that all handheld vacuums are bagless. They got to think of a better way to empty it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brush is not motorized, relies on suction to spin...forget it","review":"If you want something that has a spinning brush, take this off your list, poor design.

The filter cleaning/emptying/replacements are a joke and the capacity is non-existent. The \\"power\\" scrubber lose power after a minute because the vacuum is almost full....bottom line, I regret making this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing really sucks!","review":"Very powerful when the filter/catcher is clean, and the brush lets you use it on carpet, where it works almost as well as an upright. However, it is a PITA to empty, and to get full suction you really need to rinse and dry the filter/catcher once in a while - or replace it I suppose (I'm waaaay too cheap to be doing that, though!). Thus, vacuuming a large area is really out of the question unless you want to stop every 2-3 minutes.Overall, if you have a small, carpeted area to vacuum (boat, RV, detached office, whatever) this thing really sucks (in a good way), and if I lost it, I'd probably get another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirt Devil 08225","review":"I am happy with this product.

Also, the carpet & upholstery attachment that came with the vacuum rotated nicely as it should when I attached it to the vacuum --- until the moment I tried to actually use it to clean the seat of my van.

The band's unwillingness (or inability) to show a little spontaneity in their note for note reworking of some of their songs suggested that the band was either beginning to run out of ideas, a notion that was sadly confirmed by its follow-up studio effort \\"Novella.\\" The fatal flaw here is that the band seemed to be putting more effort on expanding the orchestral sound that worked so well on their two best albums, \\"Turn of the Cards, and \\"Scheherazade\\" at the expense of writing actual songs. Sadly, \\"Novella\\" seems almost devoid of melodies that one remembers 20 seconds after the song is over (\\"The Captive Heart\\" comes close).

After I had read 1/3 of it, I still felt no connection to Alice, the main character. The writing was very disjointed, and it was very hard to tell who was talking or being talked about a lot of the time. I loved the character of Alice as the grandmother in \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\", and I was really looking forward to reading about her younger life.

Nor did he \\"destroy a number of vessels in test runs,\\" anywhere. My source is the \\"Navy Times book of Submarines,\\" written by retired Navy Captain Brayton Harris.

If, like me you are a boring old fart who likes to hear grown men waffle on about submarine tactics, training methods and the highly technical load of letters and numbers that makes up the bulk of military jargon, then books like this one is a must.Another very pleasing thing about this book is that Clancy does the rare thing of praising somebody else's military. It was nice, from a British point of view, to hear about our own submarines for a change, instead of the continual American/Soviet propaganda.When Clancy says that the British Trafalgar class sub is \\"nearly just as good as a 688 class\\", then you know it's ten times better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference","review":"This is a good reference score, but for more demanding tasks use Eulenburgs critical score."},{"rating":"2","title":"curves","review":"\\"Curves\\" are a brilliant product, very comfortable to wear, far more comfortable and more natural looking than similar cheaper products I have tried.

I had to send them off once because one of the ears on the lenses broke because of the hard handling when I was changing them. You see I work as an EMT and I am constantly changing the lenses for CPR and other various other things. So needless to say they get abused every day for over 5 years now. I was really impressed with their service. I got my glasses back within a week. And they upgraded my case and even sent me an all mew lenses and frames. I'm getting ready to send them off again. Simply because I have rubbed off the rubber nose pieces and the ear pieces.All in all I would say to anyone looking for the best pair of sunglasses you'll ever own. I'm about to buy next pair of smiths simple because I want to have a pair in my other truck. But just keep in mind that smith has a life time warranty.

They may have gotten the better deal at the time.The booked is filled with fascinating pieces of history and you will soon learn that the Hudson River is linked to the very foundations of our country. You will also learn that all those street names and highway names in New York stem from the state's very rich history with the Dutch and the English.Some parts of the story are a bit dry, no doubt, but the book is worth reading for the highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crucify Me Again","review":"Mark Manning, aka the legendary Zodiac Mindwarp, rock god and idol to millions (well, at least a few hundred) shares with us his skewed memoires in this fine tome.

The ever-present battle between \\"progress and development\\" and preservation of some of the green, wild spaces for our sanity, resounds to this day. This is an epic story and probably could easily have been twice as long in length and kept my interest. It is enjoyable to read about strong-willed, determined women, especially back in those days, when women were supposed to marry well, have children, keep house and keep their noses out of \\"men's business\\". Not a comment to male-bash, simply nice to read about women who influenced the development of the Emerald City of today, i.e. think Thea Foss and the dynasty she started.

Boy was I disappointed! This was a terrible book. Not only was it very very boring. But Anne was very self centered, pestering and depending on her very very elderly and dying father until he died. She really needed help- running around at night screaming for her dead husband, while here young and terrified kids looked on. It also seemed like everyone in the book died, or almost died. Anne's husband, sister, mother, father, brother and father-in-law, daughter, only son, and best friend, are all killed off. There's barely anyone left but Anne, and her daughter Pete, who almost marries a drunk, but at the pre-wedding reception dumps him, and Anne's bossy maid eve are left. They all buy a white house and live in it. that's about all to this book. If you haven't read it yet, don't waste your time.

The main character, Anne Couper Fraser,is about 18 when the first book begins, and is emotionally 18 when the third book ends in her late 60's. She is one of the most selfish characters I've ever encountered and I certainly hope this woman was not that way in real life. No matter what happens to anyone in these books, her first reaction is what effect it will have on her. This is my first exposure to Eugenia Price and I believe her writing style is sophomoric. Could people have really talked that way to each other? (Sugar-y sweet). In addition the author is VERY repetitive. Each book could have easily been 100+ pages less. What could have been a very interesting account of real people in one of my favorite historical eras was a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring!!!!","review":"I love books about the old south but I couldn't even finish this book.

Glide Deep Clean is wonderfully smooth and comfortable, making flossing downright pleasant on both your gums and your fingers. The width of the floss prevents the tourniquet effect of thinner flosses. And there is a pleasant cool, minty feeling left behind wherever you've cleaned.But... It's the single most expensive floss I can find in any of my local stores, and even on Amazon. And Crest's claims of being \\"shred resistant\\" fall short. My Glide Deep Clean was shredded right out of the package, and shreds further every time you tear off a new piece. To be fair, I haven't yet had it shred in the course of flossing, but the fact you can't even cleanly cut a strip off without shredding doesn't inspire confidence. At the price premium Crest is demanding, I'd expect Glide Deep Clean to cut well and in one piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game","review":"Got this for hubby and he has raked up many hours and just loves playing. thank you thak you thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool sensation","review":"I'm using this lotion for 2 weeks now and can tell my skin is much smoothier.

Excess visual noise is a major cause of Information Anxiety. Its a trait so endemic in websites, tax forms, technical manuals and... now this book from Wurman. Its such an anti-thesis to good information design.And then there's the material itself. A convoluted, pastiche of personal anecdotes, home remedies for organizational management, random musings and dazed observations on the subject.If you are genuinely interested in addressing the problem of Information Anxiety, this book will NOT provide with you with meaningful insights and solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have followed his own advice","review":"I admit it, I like the idea of Information Architecture.

The album following Painkiller may have ended up sounding a lot like this is. In other words, this stuff rocks! Sure \\"Angel in Black\\" sounds a whole lot like \\"Painkiller\\", especially in the opening drums. And \\"Kiss of Death\\" is reminiscent of \\"Hell Patrol\\", but is a much better song. There is no filler here, all winners. Vocalist Ralf Scheepers has insane range, much like the aforementioned Mr. Halford. The guitars are just fantastic, as each song has a memorable riff. This is hands down the best metal album to come out in 2001. Just check out songs like \\"Eye of an Eagle\\", \\"Nuclear Fire\\" or the shifting \\"Iron Fist in a Velvet Glove.\\" If you like old school power metal at all, you need this album!

Then she bacame a hero fighting, early on, with Johnny Thunder (Who should get his own volume to. Email DC and say you want one!) Canary then went on to do a solo gig in her own feature in Flash comics. This volume even shows her team up with Starman - which now in DC history is when Canary had an afrair with Starman.So if you want to find out about the early adventures of Diana Drake, the first Black Canary (Diana lance, now appearing in Bird of Prey, is her daughter) then buy this volume!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the DC Archive Series","review":"This here's my surprising winner for the best of the DC Archive editions.

I need a list for a head count, to make sure we didn't miss anyone and to keep track of all of the correspondence (read: invitations, thank you's, etc.).

He tries to make a new life for himself with the nurse who is taking care of him and eventually falls in love with him. But there are problems, like her former boyfriend, a cop who is not happy with their break up, and a detective who is trying to solve a murder from several years ago. Keith Carradine is great as the man who starts a \\"new\\" life from scratch, not sure where to go from his hospital bed. Richard Widmark is wonderful as the haunted detective with a thirst for revenge, Michael Beck is functional as the jilted cop, and Kathleen Quinlan is perfect as the nervous wife who doesn't know who her husband really is prior to his accident.

At first his voice seemed off-putting: upper-crust snob. But when, on page 4 he admits to once being an arrant snob, his admission won me over,and I fell hopelessly under his spell, madly in love with his otter, his puppy, and his passion for the environment including all the creatures within it, from eels to gulls. Too, I expanded my vocabulary with words like littoral, cygnet, meniscus, spate, and beyond. Finally, he had me laughing out loud when he described his Air France flight with a live otter in his carry-on. I thoroughly lapped up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Otters Don't Make Good Pets","review":"The reason I don't recommend this book, despite the nice writing and decriptions of the Western Highlands, is for one dark fact: a number of wild otters died for Maxwell's selfish pursuit of having a wild animal as a pet. This is not the story of a man who raises abandoned wild otters cubs in the Western Highlands and releases them but the story of a man who takes otters from the wild in Iraq and Africa and tries to raise them in Scotland. What this story also tells us is that, if you are of a privillaged class, you can have any wild animal you want as your pet. Today this is illegal \\"pet\\" trading and it is responsible for pushing certain species to the edge of extinction. I know that at the time this practice was not looked down upon as it is today and certain other nature writers (Durrell, Heinrich) engage in the same practice but with a more educated populus it should be clear: wild animals are not pets and they should stay wild!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Convicts","review":"Story went nowhere for the amount of acting talent involved .

This has to be Duvall's worst movie ever. The story line was about an old man who, it seemed, had lost his mind. I kept waiting for a plot or something to happen, but there was nothing. The only part that included \\"convicts\\" was in the first scene and then just an old man's rambling imagination. Nearly every sentence contains \\"G** damn\\" in it. The coffin scene was hideous.Ok, I sat bolt upright, took my ginseng, B-12 and Acai berry and I still feel like falling asleep it is so dull. This movie was a terrible.

As the saying goes, \\"What were they thinking?!\\" The CONTINUAL cursing was such a turnoff as well as the constant gibberish from Duvall's character.

These pretzels are not nearly as good as the ones by Ener-G Foods (small size bags) or by Glutano (larger, family size bags). These Wylde pretzels are, as one reviewer already commented, not salty enough - that is, not salty enough for me to feel they qualify as satisfying a pretzel yearning. These pretzels are also much harder than the others, which I don't find appealing. That being said, I would highly recommend the Glutano or the Ener-G Foods pretzels over these.

Mr. Marshall did not dissapoint. Face it, we glad men and women in the army of the unpublished are amateurs--but we don't have to present ourselves as such. He doesn't cotton to our \\"foster your creativity\\" sort of needs; he takes us to boot camp, shows us what it's going to take to become writers. I loved it.

It's not very thorough, and many of its recommendations are against the prevailing views. Annual MLA meetings are often the bane of serious writers and academia, and is frequently the material for murmors and shouts. The book seems attractive, because it's short. If a briefer version of the \\"Chicago Manual of Style,\\" *the* authority on style, is desired, then Kate Durabian's book based on \\"Chicago\\" is the reccommended version.

Damn Spot!","review":"Would that the bard himself had directed. Ian contorts and convolutes. Judi despises and denies. The whole stage to television adaptation loses the gripping starkness of the theatrical intent. Brits being Brits bringing the bard to the modern masses. How more cliche can it get? In 1976 this may have seemed the definitive version, and lord knows it made McKellen and Dench, but I still hold out hope against hope that an actor and actress will come forth and give this play the truly powerful pitch it deserves for the pallette of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO DARK AND MOODY FOR ME!","review":"I think that Ian McKellen and Judy Dench are two of the greatest people working in the film today. McKellen turned in a rather Shakespeare-esque performance as Magneto in X-MEN, and Dench has proved herself as a good M in thel last three JAMES BOND epics. So I was surprised that this film turned out to be a waste of time. Trying to capture the Bard's stage vision, Trevor Nunn screws up everything with this lumbering two-hour-and-sixteen-minute film. There are no sets, just blackness, making the dark tragedy TOO dark. The costumes are no good whatsoever. The acting is just plain terrible! The only saving grace in this film is Roger Rees.

I realize this movie was a stripped down version of the play, but this is one play that should never have been stripped down.

There are virtually no sets, few props, and only one fancy costume--Macbeth's royal robe when he is crowned king. But don't let any of that put you off. The emphasis here is on the acting, which is as good as you're ever likely to see. Most of the camera work is in close-ups or near close-ups, so that the viewer feels intimately involved with each character. What came across especially strongly to me was the suffering and guilt that the Macbeths went through as a result of their crimes. It's a riveting experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure the casting is good, but...","review":"The casting for this production could scarcely be better (of particular note is the harrowing performance of Judi Dench) and it's one of Shakespeare's best plays. That said, this film of a production on stage doesn't quite carry the viewer's interest for the entire play. There are times when the actors seem downright pretentious; you feel as if they're tellings us, \\"We know how deep this is so appreciate it, please.\\" That's too bad since \\"Macbeth\\" is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film. Sadly, this relatively slow-moving production isn't it. There are, of course, wonderful moments with Mackellan and particularly Dench (no one plays the scene where Lady Macbeth goes crazy better than Dame Judi). I just don't know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase. For my money, Kurosawa's \\"Throne of Blood\\" is a far better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"I mean it; this is not only the best filmed Shakespeare adaptation I have ever seen (and I've seen a LOT of them) but a wonderful film.

No stage sets. No real lighting effects to speak of. No good costume work. This movie reading of Macbeth takes place in a dark room, where the actors say their lines to each other, and sometimes, just by themselves.That's all fine and good if you already intimately know this play. But even though I have read it countless times, I couldn't even sit through this entire production. I was very disappointed in it, especially after seeing who the actors were. Part of the magick in performing a play onstage is the use of props, lighting, interaction, costuming, etc., to engage the audiences imagination.This seemed to be to be a read aloud, book-on-tape style production. Yes, the recitation of the lines was well-done. But there was nothing else to compel me to finish it. I can read it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not High School friendly","review":"Not exaclty what I had wanted for my high school class.

The title track and reprise especially convey a sense of homecoming and comfort therein. The quirky \\"Mrs. Toad's Cookies\\" hints at entire realms left unexplored by the closure of this band's efforts, and leaves us to ponder what might have been, given a more nurturing music environment. Meanwhile, the forgivably sentimental \\"Maybe I'll Move to Mars\\" hearkens back to the band's earliest days, when they made their mark blending early space-art rock with neogothic and sometimes quirky themes that one can almost envision, like master paintings on black velvet. A whimsical and affectionate closing statement from a band who deserved better than they got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I\`ll Move to Mars","review":"Being a big fan of Klaatu\`s superb first two albums Magenta Lane came as a big dissapointment. There are too many pointless, mediocre ballads, well played, sung and produced yes, but this is not the klaatu I\`d come to love. Mercifully the album is not much above 30 minutes. Only the album closer \\"Maybe I\`ll Move To Mars\\"- an epic space opera - is worthy of the name Klaatu.

If you were a fan of Klaatu in the late 70s, you probably expected much from this band, in the same way you expected much of The Moody Blues or Electric Light Orchestra; and, indeed, Klaatu's first two albums---while not exactly epic---were certainly cinematic in their scope (I always envisioned \\"Klaatu\\" and \\"Hope\\" as the soundtracks to esoteric independent films). On the other hand, \\"Magentalane\\" delivers only a shallow assortment of sing-song, B-side pop. In fact, I seriously thought that \\"Magentalane\\" was but a compilation of otherwise forgettable out-takes thrown together for one more commercial stab. Alas, sometimes a legend SHOULD simply vanish without trace or explanation---I could have gotten along very well wondering \\"Whatever happened to Klaatu?\\" for the rest of my days. Unfortunately, \\"Magentalane\\" provides the unwelcome answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half star better than Endangered Species.","review":"\\"Mrs Toad Bake some cookies\\" and the \\"Magentalane\\" title track are the only songs of any redeeming value here. Again, one was hoping for something to replace the bad taste that one had in their mouth after the Endangered Species fiasco, but only a burp was mustered up by Klaatu."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great biography of a great man","review":"This is one of the best biographies I've read in recent years (and I read a lot of biographies). Leigh Montville makes his subject come alive, and after reading this book, I feel like I know \\"The Kid\\" personally. This is not to say that the story is sugar-coated: Williams flaws and foibles are presented, along with the things that made him great. Ted Williams is shown as a man who was very self-centered, often immature, impulsive, bad-tempered and difficult to get along with (some of the detail around his 3 failed marriages is painful), but also a hero marine pilot who saw combat in 2 wars, a good friend to many, a generous person with both time and money (especially when it came to kids), and probably the greatest hitter in the history of major league baseball. I heartily recommend this book. Thanks Leigh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Williams fans...","review":"This book is a must read for Williams fans, Red Sox fans and baseball fans in general. I felt this book was one of the most balanced books I have read aboout Williams. Not only does it pay tribute to his success on the field and in the air during WW II and Korea, but also decribes his many faults. I have always been a fan of Montville and this book, simply put, is a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated man - now he'd be medicated!","review":"I enjoyed this biography (except for a glaring typo in an early chapter that gives TW's birthday as April, 1918 instead of August....where was the editor??!). I have to wonder, however, if the personality \\"quirks\\" that TW displayed would be accepted in today's world. His on-the-field persona was one thing, but the verbal abuse of his family was often over the top. But, a true America original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Written Biography","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Montville's book. It's a flawlessly written biography of a flawed but uniquely talented baseball icon. If The Splendid Splinter wanted the title of \\"the greatest hitter who ever lived\\" he certainly accomplished that mission. A great read and highly recommended regardless of your team affiliation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as a Plumb-It","review":"I generally love Stabilia levels, and I own 5 of them, but for a plate level, this one cannot compete with my Plumb-It PIX 5.0. Conceptually they're similar, with the exception that the Plumb-It reduces to about a third of its length which means that my PIX 5.0 can go from 5 feet to almost 14 feet. If you're going to spend the money on a plate level, why not get one that can extend 6 feet longer? The extra length allows the Plumb-It to be used on taller walls, skylight shafts, locating lighting fixtures (though I'd use a laser for this as it's easier), as well as to horizontally level long stretches of cabinets, floors, decks, etc. Plus the Plumb-It is super durable (it's survived a ton of jobsite abuse), super accurate, and that Plumb-It sells replacement parts for affordable prices in the event of a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning - it's not a clean romance","review":"This is not a clean romance - the profanity and premartial sex really detracted from what could be a great book.

As the language began to get rougher, I realized it must not be Christian fiction. If it is Christian fiction shame on the author. When I tell my testimony of who I was before Christ, I don't go making it seem romantic, fun, and desireable. Thought love scenes were out of place if it is Christian fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Written","review":"From the third page this book had such a hold on me that I couldn't put it down. I found myself staying up later than normal to finish reading it. The flow, the emotions, as well as a very well rounded story are what I look for in a book and this story has them all. I look forward to reading more of the Grayson Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shades of Honor (Grayson Brothers)","review":"From the very first sentence to the last you will be captivated. This book draws on every many human emotion: love, anger, confusion, frustration and finally satisfaction. The writer clearly sets the stage and gives you time to form you own opinion and possible conclusion, yet hides away secrets that will cause you to change your first impression and even your second impression.I loved this book and the characters. I can hardly wait to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Book, Can't wait to read the other ones","review":"First off, I am not one to read romance novels. This book grabbed my attention and I could not read it fast enough!I am ready to read the rest of the books about the Grayson Brothers. Warning, if you read this one you may be hooked! Also, this is one of the books in the 4 book set so you may want to read one of the other novels by this author or jump right into the 4 book set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Christian Fiction","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing the book. While I don't necessarily desire to read books about God, I usually shop in the Christian fiction category in order to avoid curse words and sexual content. Amazon sure missed the boat when they labeled this book as Christian fiction. The writer appeared to have some writing talent, but unfortunately she felt the need to throw in unnecessary curse words and sexual content. And by unnecessary, I mean that the curse words and sexual content lent nothing to the plot or character development. As you get deeper into the story the curse words and sexual content become more frequent so I finally quit reading the book--it wasn't that spelling binding of a plot anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shades of Honor","review":"Once I started reading this amazing I couldn't stop.

It overflowed with the type of love that most people would give anything to have this day and age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shades of Honor","review":"The story line of the book keeps ones interest and glued to the book. The story keeps the reader wanting the brothers to wake up especially Kyle to realize he is not the one suited for his fiance but Radford. However I have to agree even though it is considered a christian novel. The vivid details of passion makes it not one in the true sense. My suggestion to you is for you to be the judge of the contents yourself. However the author is truly a gifted writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"What a great read! I was a little apprehensive when I first purchased the book. Once I began reading the book I couldn't put it down. I would defiantly purchase another book by the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shades of Honor","review":"This is not your typical romance book. It's a family saga, and not only will you fall in love with the two main characters, but with a frail man and a scared little girl as well. I cried in three different areas of the book, and when it ended I felt a deep loss, wanting it to go on forever. Great writing. Great research. Great love story. And a great writer. If you're looking for a story with several plotlines, a hint of civil war memorabilia, and a desire to root for the heroes, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Graphic","review":"I ordered this book because it was free; however, once I got into the story, the main focus is on Radford's passion, written in very graphic detail. The book uses a lot of expletives and has crude remarks which are unnecessary. The story line could have been more productive by letting the reader fill in the details rather than spelling out the passions felt toward Evelyn. Although the book shows the human emotions of bitterness and envy, as well as compassion, between brothers, it is hard to get past the daily passions of Radford which are always in the forefront. I could not finish the book and deleted it from my Kindle. I love to read, but will choose books that are more uplifting without the language and intimate details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grayson Brothers are fascinating","review":"I loved Shades of Honor and look forward to reading about the rest of the brothers. Lindstrom's strong storytelling pulls you into the book in short order. The problems the characters seem authentic. Learning about the entire family gives you a taste for the next book in the series. I simply need time to read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I am always wary of free books (which this one was for Kindle), but I loved this book. It was very well written. I loved that the authur was able to go into details about the time period without making you feel bored. I read alot of historical novels, and feel that most authurs try to hard to give an authentic feel to their books and lose the readers interest. Not once did this book lose my interest. I laughed, I cried, and I felt joy right along with the characters. I can not wait to read the stories of the remaing Grayson Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!!!","review":"This was a refreshingly different story amongst the hundreds of period romances which seem to come from the same cookie cutter mould.

The lever to adjust the seat is completely hidden and the seat must be uninstalled in order to adjust it. It is not at all intuitive. Other car seats such as Britax, Eddie Bauer, etc. are easy and very simple to adjust. I was disappointed with the quality of this car seat. I would not recommend purchasing it to anyone. I bought it as second seat for grandma's car but it wasn't worth the savings."},{"rating":"1","title":"returning this carseat ASAP","review":"This car seat took my husband over on hour to install and once it was in, we couldn't reach the latch to loosen the shoulder straps. Once the baby was in the seat, it was very difficult to pull the strap-it did not pull easily, it was more of a ratcheting motion where I had to pull and release, pull and release over and over. If that wasn't enough, only one side of the shoulder strap would tighten and the other side was totally loose! I took the seat completely out to try and figure out this problem, but to no avail. I will be returning it as soon as I can and splurge for the more expensive but easier to use car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love this Seat Front Facing","review":"We bought this seat for my parent's truck when my daughter was just older than a year and could sit forward facing. We were so impressed that now that our son is moving out of his infant seat, we purchased two more. We are moving my daughter (now 3) out of her Britax Roundabout and into this seat because she seems more comfortable in it. I was surprised to read the other reviews because we like it so much and have had no problems with it. We have not used it rear facing, but we love it forward facing. My daughter loves the cup holder and snack/toy tray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best carseat","review":"I bought this carseat shortly after my daughter turned two. It has always been a battle with her to sit in her seat, but once we bought this seat she seemed to like it a lot. I was very impressed. Easy to install, even my mom could secure it properly. Most of all we were invovled in a 10mph front end collision the doctors were impressed at childrens hospital because no one was hurt and they told me you must have a good car seat for my daughter not to sustain any injuries. Top it off my minivan was concidered totaled. Since we were in an accident our insurance gave us money to replace the carseat, which I chose to buy the same seat. To me it is the best carseat on the market, I know it works my daughter is proof of that. Very pleased mother of two."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD FOR REAR FACING","review":"We had purchased the Graco Comfort Sport car seat for our daughter who is 8 1/2 months. It to is supposed to be a convertible car seat, but when we placed it rear facing it didn't seem very secure. I have a 2000 Hyundai Elantra, and my car does not have the latch system, so we had to use just a seat belt to secure the car seat. It would move a lot no matter how much we tried to tighten the seat belt. After much thought we decided that it was just not safe enough in our opinion and we decided to try another seat. I did some research and decided to give the Evenflo Triumph 5 a try. All I can say is \\"WOW\\"! What a difference. We put the seat in my car with just the seat belt, and it doesn't move hardly at all. I am so glad we tried the Evenflo seat, it truly is a convertible car seat and worth the extra money. The Graco might be okay when forward facing, but I wasn't about to keep it that long to find out. Besides, the Evenflo rates higher in safety from Consumer Reports."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT seat!!!!","review":"I dont know why everyone is saying this seat is hard to install?!? IF you adjust the straps for your child while they are NOT in the car (like the instructions tell you to!) then there is NO problem.

I spent hours trying to get it properly installed in a Trailblazer and a Van without sucess. The car seat kept moving because of the angles in the base and I never could get it to recline enough for my large 4 month old. Also it was hard to tighten and release the straps. The car seats went back and were exchanged for the Evenflow Triumph. The $20 you save is not worth the trouble!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good car seat, great price","review":"I can't say that this is the best car seat, but it's good for the price you pay for it.

It has great safety reviews and it does it's job."},{"rating":"2","title":"My small toddler grew out of it, but overall liked it","review":"I bought two of these when my son grew out of the infant seat. Overall, I liked the seat fine, though it was a little tricky to do the adjustment rear facing at first. As far as the straps being uneven, all I ever had to do was pull on whichever side was uneven to even them out, then tighten. That was never a problem for us.I had one of the 79$ model, and one of the 99$ model. The pad on the $99 model was MUCH better, and does not slip off like the cheaper one does.One problem that came up was when my son grew out of the shoulder straps (heightwise) long before he got the the weight and height they suggested.I called Graco, and they gave me $40.00 toward each new carseat I bought (I chose the Ultra CarGo, which I also like, only forward facing though).Now that I am expecting #2, I will be able to keep my older child in his Ultra CarGo, and use the Comfortsport for the new baby.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rear facing is impossible to adjust shoulder strap - returning...","review":"The seat seemed to be a good value - solidly built, good price. However, our immediate need (since it is 'convertible') is for rear facing. With the seat in rear facing, I found it impossible (well, more difficult than I'm willing to put up with) to adjust the shoulder strap by pulling the strap that is situated in the front center of the seat. In the rear facing position, the strap and it's release lever are jammed into the seat back of the seat holding the car seat. One other review suggested wedging noodle foam pieces, but I'm not sure that is safe - yes, it will hold the seat out so you can get your hand down there, but what happens in a wreck with that addtl. space that the manufacturer didn't plan on?Seems like a great seat for forward facing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good car seat, but cover comes off too easy","review":"When we first bought this car seat for our daughter I absolutely loved it. However as she became more active she started ripping it apart. I big piece of styrofoam broke off and it's very easy for her to get the cover off. One of is is constantly having to reach back to fix it. It's starting to become a real pain and I'm seriously considering tossing this one and buying one that doesn't have a cover that comes off or one that is better secured.

When the seat is in rear-facing mode, there is absolutely, without a doubt, no way you can adjust the straps. Some moron decided to put the adjuster in a position that butts up against the seat when it is installed and tightened. DO me a favor, if you plan on buying this seat, just put your $80 in a pile on the floor and set it on fire instead of sending it to the idiot that designed/manufactured this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this seat!","review":"My 5 month old has reached the height limit on her SnugRide and I wanted to stick with a Graco product so I purchased two of these seats last week. The seats are being returned this week. We could not get the LATCH to tighten and installing it rear facing makes it impossible to adjust the straps. I called Graco to complain about the LATCH system not tightening and they said I should take it somewhere and have it installed for me. Forget it, my daughters safety is more important to me than the Graco name. I wish I had done my research sooner, I'm buying an Evenflo Triumph!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am taking this seat back to Toys R Us!","review":"I bought this seat for our 8 month old daughter. It does not fit in my Bravada rear-facing. It fits great forward facing, but she is not a year old, and just 20 pounds. I don't want to take the chance. Unfortunately I read these reviews AFTER I bought the seat. I looked at all the seats at our local Babies R Us and the salesperson really recommended this seat over the expensive seats. I don't think I should have to buy pool noddles to rig this seat into my truck to make it fit. That doesn't seem safe. The sad part is that my son's 7 year old car seat fits great but \\"you're not suppose to use the old ones\\".I'm going to take this back and start all over again and spend a couple more dollars for a good seat! A good buy for forward facing, not multi-functional though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!","review":"Do you need anymore stress in your life? If so, buy this seat!

I can't wait to get rid of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After 24 hours and the car seat broke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This car seat was made so cheap. The styrofoam is so cheap and not secured to the frame. There is really nothing that holds the cover to the seat. In the instructions it says that it is, but it is not. We had this seat less than 24 hours and my 7 month old grandaughter in it once. Noticed when taking her out of the seat that the styrofoam was all broke. What a joke and for $80.00.

This is your child or grandchild not your groceries."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS SEAT!!!","review":"I had so much trouble getting the straps secure and it took forever to get it installed. Also, I've only had the seat 3 months and the styrofoam broke in 2 pieces. I called Graco and was told they would send me a replacement piece. When that arrived, I had to completly take the seat appart to get to the styrofoam and then put it back together. Please don't waste your time and money. I am very disappointed with this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this one!","review":"I bought this for my 4 month old boy that is almost 20 lbs. I was advised that this was really good for the money and would provide all the protection he needed in a car seat.After 2 days of use, it went right back to the store. I had to take the car seat out several times to readjust the straps for his shoulders, as they kept shifting and getting one side longer than the other. Everytime I would put him in the seat and start to buckle him in, he would start screaming and crying. I finally realized that since the straps kept moving and shifting around, one strap would dig into his neck.He still faces the rear of the car and the seat sits too upright for a rear facing baby. His head would fall into his chest when he would start to doze off to sleep. Poor baby!I took the seat back and exchanged it for the Evenflo Triumph 5 and WOW! That $50 difference was well worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return this item!!","review":"I loved this car seat at the store and when I got it home. I thought it was so comfy and nice looking for the money. Plus, it was really easy to install. Unfortunately when I installed it rear facing the strap adjuster is located so low on the seat that it is nearly impossible to squeeze your hand down there to adjust the straps. So after about 15 minutes of trying to put my 6 month old in the seat we ended up having to take it out and put her in her old infant one. Needless to say, it did go back to the store. I think this seat would be great forward facing but if you install it properly you just can't adjust the straps when it is rear facing. What the point of buying the car seat if you can't use it. You get what you pay for I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE, HATE, HATE this car seat","review":"I HATE this car seat. If I could exchange it, I would. It is hard to buckle. The straps pinch my daughter's legs. If you need to adjust the position of the straps, you need to take it out of the car. It is hard to get into the car, and once you have it in, it seems like it is sitting up too high. I HATE this car seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR DESIGN","review":"AFTER LOOKING AT WHAT SEEMED LIKE HUNDREDS OF CAR SEATS, WE WENT WITH THIS SEAT DUE TO THE PADDING,LOOKS AND OVERALL QUALITY.

AFTER AN HOUR OF TRYING TO GET THE STRAPS ADJUSTED FOR THE RIGHT HEIGHT OF OUR SON, WE FINALLY GOT IT IN THE BACK SEAT (REAR FACING). THE BUTTON TO PUSH TO TIGHTEN/LOSEN THE BELTS IS SO LOW THAT YOU CAN BARELY EVEN REACH IT AND I HAVE SMALL HANDS. THIS THING IS BOXED UP AND GOING BACK. WE ENDED UP PURCHASING A COSCO TOURIVA AND IT IS WONDERFUL.

While out on a family vacation, my husband leaned on the top of the carseat while trying to get our 15 month old daughter out and the styrofoam insert broke! I could not believe it. We just bought this seat 3 days prior. We both thought if the styrofoam breaks that easily, how is it going to protect our child in the event of a crash. We have since returned that seat to Toys R Us and are currently researching all carseats to make sure we buy a safe seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget It!!","review":"My whole issue with this car seat are it's straps. I am constantly having a problem with tightening the straps. If i can't get both to tighten - only one does and the other is extremely loose. Just when I think that I have fixed the problem, I'm at day care picking up my son - and his car seat straps are loose as can be. I sit there for 15 minutes trying to fix it and still drive away thinking that my child would not be safely secured if I had an accident. It's not worth the worry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"We live in Eastern Europe and drive a typical Eastern European car. We were concerned about finding a carseat to fit our car with it's strange seat belts, but this one (which we bought in America and had shipped to us) fit fine. Even though our car is tiny, the seat fit with plenty of leg room for our daughter (she is tall) plus two other passengers in the back seat with her. Installation was easy, and would have been easier, I believe, if we had the convenience of the LATCH system on our car. The only problem, of course, was that it was stolen from our car one night, so now we are going to replace it. Our daughter was so comfortable in it and the safety ratings it received from Consumer Reports and the price all make it worth the cost of shipping overseas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat.","review":"I purchased this chair for my 6 month old, she had grown out of the infant seat.

We bought two seats one for each car, I had both seats installed (rear-facing) withen about 15 minutes. I had more problems finding the Latch hooks on my car then anything. The strap to tighten the straps is hard to get to in rear facing, but if you adjust the seat before you install it there should be know problems. You should only have to adjust the straps again once your child out grows it.I look at the Evenflo Triumph 5 and I really wanted that one but at $120 that was a bit much when buying two so we went with the Comfort Sport and love it.The only con is I do wish it would recline a bit more in the rear facing position but I just added another rolled up towel under it and it worked great!I would recommed this seat if you are on a budget and want a great seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T DO IT","review":"My husband and I purchased this car seat for his truck. I have a Britax in my car. Like most Graco car seat products it's really awful to install. I usually get my cardio workout from it which is often since the straps tend to develop a slack on one side because of a horrible design flaw! The only way to 'fix' the slack is to re-attach the strap to the holder on the back of the seat! I usually have to uninstall the car seat completely to fix the problem for it only to reoccur within a few uses. It really bothers me that Graco seems to think that this design flaw is ok and shouldn't affect your child in a car wreck. Yea RIGHT!!Save yourself the trouble and tears and spend the money on a Britax. I promise you, it's WORTH the money! Don't skimp. I wish we hadn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a lousy rear facing carseat","review":"This carseat is a horrible rear facing seat. We had this seat professionally installed so I cant comment on installation. Getting your hand between your the carseat and the backseat is next to impossible to loosen the shoulder straps.When you do get the lever up to loosen the straps, they both dont loosen evenly and when you try to pull the strap to tighten the harness both sides never pull tight evenly. You spend 10 minutes fumbling with the straps before you get out of the parking lotWe owned the Graco infant seat and loved it. The operation of the seats are the same so we anticipated loving the seat but now hate it.This seat might be appropriate in a grandparent's car or for a child facing forward but certainly not for everyday use in a rear facing position.Save your money...buy a better seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"My daughter was 6mths when we purchased this car seat. At first I thought this was a nice car seat considering the price. Yet, everytime I put my daughter in the seat she would begin crying and fuss the entire time. She never did this in her other car seat that she had outgrown. I notice the straps would pull her from one side to the other. I tried to fix it, yet it never worked. It also did not support her head. She would wobble from side to side. It was not even a month and I notice a piece was hanging from the side. It had already BROKEN. So, please take my advice, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible seat!","review":"We bought this seat for the grandparent's car. The straps do not come out far enough to go around our baby when he is wearing a fleece. Yes, he's a big guy-but the straps need to be at or below the an infant's shoulders. The only way the straps would come out far enough is if we moved the straps up which would not be safe. We returned it and got another Evenflo Triumph 5 (which we have in our car) and it is SO much better! A breath of fresh air knowing he is secure! The Graco is very cheaply made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for both rear and front facing and budget","review":"We just bought this seat for our 6-1/2 month old son because he outgrew his infant seat. I was reluctant at first to buy this product based on some of the negative reviews, but there were more positive than negative and it fit into our budget. We've only had this seat for one week, and our son loves it! It only took my husband a total of 15 minutes to install it and that included one removal to readjust where the straps were coming out and to put a towel underneath the seat (which is clearly explained in the manual)! My son now has room to kick around and put his head to either side. I have no complaints, Graco makes a great product. Bottom line - if you read the manual you should not have any problems installing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very practical for winter","review":"I bought a Graco ComfortSport Convertible care seat for my daughter when she grew out of her infant seat and it worked great- I never had any problems. So when my son, 5 months and 17 lbs, outgrew his infant seat, I bought another ComfortSport. My son is bigger than my daughter was and we found it extremely difficult to strap him in. According to Graco, you must use the shorter harness slots when using the seat in the rear-facing position. I called the customer service line to ask if it would be okay to use the longer slots since my son wouldn't fit in the seat. They told me it would compromise his safety. They asked what my son was wearing when I strapped him in. They informed me that it is NOT DESIGNED FOR USE WITH SNOWSUITS! In Northeast Ohio, we have at least 5 months of winter and a snowsuit is a must. Obviously Graco didn't take this into consideration and now I have to return it and find a more practical car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"We purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born.

Sometimes these movies don't have enough in them, this one does not have that problem. It is Las Vegas and the beautiful Cherry (redhead) starts out the movie very sexuallly, garter type hose, etc. Then there is the wonderful brunette, Asia, who actually gets a good line. They call her Asia because in about a half hour you will be hungry for more.

I was able to adjust the height of the straps fairly easily (just press the metal plate straight down, and slide up to reinstall). Installed the seat, no problem. Then we tried to put my 19 month old daughter in the seat. The problem is that the adjuster buckle is so close to the chest clip on the right. The straps are adjustable for the left shoulder, left hip, and right hip.

Because they will not stay on, they pose a safety hazard. If we were to ever get in to an accident, they could become projectile, and injure a child. This car set has been a huge disappointment. Save your money, and don't buy this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with adjustable straps in the back!","review":"I have always liked Evenflo carseats from infant to infant/toddler and even a booster until this one. I purchased 3 of these that seemed to have had the same flaw. The adjustable straps in the back were very difficult to move upward and when moved the metal lock would not snap back into place on the left side. The lip that holds the piece in was not entirely there and kept popping out. I had checked the manufactured date on all three of them and they all were made in Nov 04. So with that said hopefully the next batch of seats will be better until then I off to search for another brand and see what they have to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light weight seat","review":"We bought this booster carseat for our 2 year old last July she was 1.5 we were traveling and didn't want to lug around our 25 lb carseat. This seat is great, it's comfortable and will grow with her for many years. The buckle on the front is easy for adults to use but would be very hard for a little kid to undo. Yes the straps on the back were a pain to adjust but in the 9 months we have had this seat we had to do it once. The straps are supposed to be above the child's shoulder so once they are moved to the top you won't have to do it again. We hadn't even installed the seat into the car so it wasn't that hard to do at home. This seat was great to take on our vacation it was so easy to carry around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy!!!","review":"We purchased this booster seat 2 months ago for our 22 month old son. I love everything about it except all the accessories. The cup holder doesn't stay put, the arm rests can get sticky and I washed the pad once and it is falling apart! There is blue fuzz all over it and I washed it alone! The stitching is coming loose and it looks pilled and it's brand new! It looks like it's 2 years old after washing it. I am calling Evenflo b/c I cannot imagine that Babies R Us will take it back looking like that, even with a receipt! I wouldn't but this seat for the fact that that nice looking seat will not stand up to washing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating to use","review":"This car seat looks great BUT1) Was difficult for my husband to install (LATCH)2) The straps are VERY DIFFICULT to adjust. There is no handy button at the base of the seat, but the adjuster is right by the chest buckle which is awkward. This was the most frustrating feature as I would have to adjust them nearly every time I put my son in the car. (based on changing weather). The only way I could get the straps adjusted was to not have my son in the seat, and that isn't very helpful to know how tight to make the straps!! I am used to my Britax (which I loved loved loved).3) My son was always complaining that his 'neck hurt'. My guess is the straps were rubbing up against his skin.4) I found myself always digging to find the buckles. Again, I am used to having the Britax Roundabout where the straps Velcro to the side of the seat and are always ready to go.I am getting ready to return my seat tomorrow! It has been nothing but a frustration to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but HARD to use","review":"We bought this carseat, took it home, had a heck of a time getting our child to fit in it (he is only 28 pounds) had a really hard time with the harness, and adjusting them in the back, I had to get a butter knife to adjust it and then on the left side it still doesnt fit right, I came on here to try to get information on helping me and found this site. I am sooo glad. I read the reviews and for the most part, it seems like everyone has the same problems, so I will be taking it back, I am so thankful I found this in time and very thankful for all the reviews from people who actually used this carseat. If it is this hard to deal with, down the road I would have only wished I hadn't bought it. So thanks to all the reviews!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disatisfied","review":"Arm rests are flimsy and do not stay secure very well. When placing our 35lb 4 yr old in seat sometimes her legs will brush over the arm rests. They fall off and it is very annoying. Cup holder cheaply made and doesn't stay secure either; it also slants back a little. I am sick and tired of always pushing these pieces back into their slots. Straps don't seem to even out no matter how much I try to adjust. Buckle receiver way too short and close to her bottom. However it is hard to unclick so I know she can't do it and is safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"belt clip loosens over time...unsafe?","review":"After owning this booster for only 1o months the clip which tightesn the belt to the car has lost its grip. We have moved the seat from our car to grandmas two times and its now too loose.If you plan to move this seat from car to car do not buy this seat. The seat jiggles from side to side and is very wobbly in the car..it is obviously unsafe. There is no way to tighten it now.We have to go out today to replace this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAFETY ISSUE","review":"I found this seat to be well padded, fashionable, easy to adjust, etc. Thought it was perfect. However, my 2 year old son likes to climb into his car seat himself, when doing so, he holdsthe armrest for support. This armrest is NOT attached to the seat, it pops into a plastic hole. He leaned on it, the arm let go and he went flying backward. If I had not been standing behind him, he would have fallen on his back and hit his head heavily on the pavement. The armrest is now broken and cannot be used. A 30 pound child broke this and almost got injured. The attachments are cheaply made of pliable plastic and are easily broken. I have 2 other car seats in my husbands car and my mother inlaws, both have attached, built-in arm rests (both are Eddie Bauer) and have never had this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the late model","review":"I purchase the same brand/style seat back in Jan. 2004. I am replacing it due to an accident. I bought the upgraded model because the model involved in the accident is discontinued. I was very happy with the previous model especially because it held up well in an accident, however the new version is a bit more difficult. Like another reviewer said, the straps are not easy to adjust. Installation of this seat was a bear. The other model (and my other car seats) have a split seat cover so you can help guide the seat belt or LATCH when installing it. This seat does not have that split, so I found myself with my hand stuck in the back of the plastic hole (not very comfortable!) Also, the belt guides for when your child grows out of the harness unit are covered by the seat cover. I am returning this seat today and trying another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjustable Straps a Nightmare!","review":"I just bought this for our 2 year old son -- hadn't even installed it and had a big headache adjusting the straps in the back.

I'm returning this seat - adjusting straps should NOT be this difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do *NOT* buy this or any EvenFlo product","review":"I have bought several EvenFlo products over the last 3 years, and there is a common theme, they are all unusable. The problems stated by others regarding adjusting the straps is true. It defies physics and cannot be done without possibly damaging the seat. Not something I am willing to do with a product \\"designed\\" to keep my child safe.I am returning this product today, and will never make the mistake of buying an EvenFlo product again. Hopefully this review will help some other folks avoid the same problem.One last lesson, always buy Gracco...they know what they're doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untitled","review":"Third in the trilogy of \\"She\\".

It has ripples and lines throughout the finish making it look cheap and damaged. I exchanged the first mirror for another one hoping it would arrive without these issues. However, the second one has the same issues. It is a defect with the way they are made. It is not something that happened during shipping because you can tell that they tried to smooth it out cover it up. I just contacted Amazon and had to request a refund so I can get a quality mirror. I loved the design of this mirror and wanted it for the powder bathroom at our new house, but unfortunately I'm going to have to keep searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to hang","review":"A lazer level is required to hang this mirror.

It adds light and life to the tale; thoughtful, moving, fun and funny.

This book is now part of my every-year Christmas must-read list."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the play script, not the story","review":"The play script is useful in its own right, but it is NOT the hardcover story I was expecting. If a picture had been posted here on Amazon, the confusion would never have arisen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol","review":"A Christmas Carol is a good book told in third person point of view. It is mostly about Scrooge and how he starts out all mean, lonely, and hates christmas, and how he becomes nice, kindhearted, and starts to like christmas, as he is visited by ghost of christmas. During the time he was being visited by the ghost he became nicer. He fered the ghost of christmas yet to come more than any other ghost he is visited by because he fears of what to come or what could happen in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful New Holiday Classic","review":"This is a an absolutely delightful read. It pays respectful homage to Mr. Dickens while taking us on a journey that is heartfelt, funny and poignant. Mr. Mula's creative portrayal of the real story behind the Marley visit to Scrooge on Christmas Eve will stay with readers long after finishing the book. I will be giving the book to many friends and family this holiday in the hopes of creating a new tradition - the annual reading of Jacob Marley's Christmas Carol. Leave it to a child - Mr. Mula's muse - to get indignant that Marley got a bum deal in the original story by Charles Dickens. Mr. Mula takes the reader on a stunning journey, creating a visual panorama through his words that enables the reader to see, to feel, to experience all that Marley does in his efforts to save Scrooge, and himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Alternative Carol With a Nice Moral","review":"This is a very witty and imaginative alternative version of Dickens's A CHRISTMAS CAROL. And it also has a very affecting moral of its own about self-sacrifice--Marley thinks that Scrooge is unredeemable, but then comes to pity his former partner and sacrifices himself for Scrooge, which has unexpected (and beneficent) results. It is also full of witty dialogue and pithy poetic descriptions.Also highly recommended is Tom Mula's reading of this work--he does an OUTSTANDING job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas story since \\"A Christmas Carol\\"","review":"We have made it a tradition to read this story every Christmas. It is EXCELLENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilberto Gil's first album - lovely bossa nova!","review":"From 1967, this is perhaps Gil's most conventional, most bossa nova flavored, album, and also one of his dreamiest and best. Although many of these early songs were also recorded by reigning pop stars of the time (such as Elis Regina), Gil's versions are superior, and many of the songs on this album wind up on his various best-ofs. Gil's gentle voice and deft acoustic guitar work mesh well with the studio back-up -- strings, flute and percussion -- and his presence is so strongly felt that it's clear this is an artist who will rise above the musical conventions of his time. Although the liner notes aren't clear, I suspect that the accordeon on \\"Viramundo\\" is by the forro great, Dominguinhos... this one's a real winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I returned this product for a refund.

The back of the neck bunches up and the collar should be tighter. Otherwise it's not a bad value for the low price though the stitching should be better too.

It's a little quirky, but I like quirky.I'm a big fan of Zach Braff's show Scrubs. He constantly shows on there what a good actor he is. With his movie Garden State he shows us what a great director and writer he is. I especially liked the writing in this. There's a lot of very clever stuff in this movie.I found it hard to not like Garden State - especially once Natalie Portman showed up in it. She's VERY likeable in her role. (And I'm not just saying that because she's hot.) Her and Braff have great chemistry together.It's a really good movie with a nice mix of drama and comedy. Best of all, it left me feeling good at the end of it. I'll definitely watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, But Not Great, Romantic Comedy","review":"Star-director-writer Zach Baff's \\"Garden State\\" is a consistently engaging film although not a perfect one. I thought when the film started off it was a little too quirky for it's own good. It had kind of a sitcom feel to it which I found a little inappropriate for a film about a young man returning home for his mother's funeral. The film got it's legs when Natalie Portman's character enters the fray as the epileptic love interest to Braff's psychologically damaged actor. The chemistry between these two is palpable and unforced. The film's main strength is when it focuses on their relationship. Peter Sarsgaard gives an excellent performance as Braff's gravedigger buddy. In smaller roles some older actors shine: Ian Holm as Braff's father, Ron Liebman as a doctor, and Jean Smart as Sarsgaard's mother. By no means a classic but I can envision this film developing a devoted cult following."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful movie...","review":"I can hardly believe that this was Zach Braff's first major film- he imbues the movie with such beauty, class and meaning. I don't usually buy movies, but I'm going to make a special exception for Garden State- the best movie that I've seen this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone can.....","review":"Write an overly expository movie that takes a long while to say not so much.Braff is funny and he does have some good scenes in this movie but it's like he had a stand up act and decided to build a movie around it.Characters WAY TO CONVENIENTLY COME IN/OUT OF HIS LIFE. He also has the characters go on side trips and endure plot events that are not a basic part of the story.Some people won't mind but I bet there are screenwiters out there who are not stars of sitcoms that WOULD LOVE to get their screenplays into movies that simply won't take the lazy way out of explaining plot and setting up easily comical situations like Braff does."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe I'm missing something...","review":"I don't understand this movie! I know that the main charecer's mom dies and that he inevitably falls in love...but I just feel like I'm missing something about this movie. I've heard so many great reviews and I wanted to likee this movie....but I just didn't understand it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Call me crazy....","review":"Call me crazy, but I did not like this movie one bit. I don't know if it was simply that I didn't understand it, or didn't connect with the movie, but I found it just plain boring. If it's the kind of movie you can connect with, then definitely give it a shot, but I guess I wasn't even close, because I wasn't even slightly entertained by the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Had this been an art house film, I might have given it a two-star rating. The plot lacks realism and depth. Romance with Natalie Portman is added to give the movie more elements but not much else. And why is that dysfunctional guys always get the good-looking gals? Though I like Natalie as an actress, her underage looks make her a miscast in the role. If you are looking for a good drama, leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Scrubs, Hate This","review":"I got this thinking that Zach's style and humor from Scrubs might be fun to see in a film. I only got 20 minutes into it when it started seeming like the whole script was written as an experiment to see how many times the writers could cram the word \\"f*ck\\" into each page.I pulled the DVD out of the machine without finishing it and I can't decide whether to keep it against the day I feel far too happy and need a tug back towards 'neurotic' or tie it to a brick and toss it in the sea.If you love Scrubs (good family humor) and you are looking to find that here, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooriiiiiing","review":"I thought this movie was really boring and I almost turned it off, but I thought the person I was watching it with liked it. Turned out I was wrong. I mean, I love Scrubs and I like the actors, but the story was just boring to me. I hear it's a great coming of age story; um, no. I hear it's a great story about someone moving forward with their life; no. I don't know, I just felt that there was two hours of my life I'd never get back.

It reminded me how beautiful imperfection is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as they say","review":"Garden State was a huge disappointment to me. Many of the reviews give it a thumbs up. I have to disagree.This movie is not funny, not exciting, has no plot to speak of, and the characters are one dimensional cliches.Quirky for the sake of quirky, and pointless because the writer couldn't think of a story to tell or how to create any drama for his characters.Like Napolean Dynamite it is a very sad rip-off of Wes Anderson's style, but contains no wit or humor.If returning a set of knives to a store, or riding a motorcycle with a sidecar, or having a person from Africa appear in the film for no reason whatsoever is your idea of comedy, then this movie is for you. However, if you are over the age of 22, and have ever seen \\"The Graduate\\", \\"Bottle Rocket\\", \\"Rushmore\\" or \\"Say Anything\\" then you will recognize that Garden State is just a very poor imitation which steals from other movies but falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it.","review":"this movie was terrible!there was no real plot, no real climax--no real story.it was one of those hipster movies that people \\"like\\" because its trendy to watch something abstract like this that makes no sense. it makes people feel more philophical or something.as for natalie portman--she was as annoying as all get out. i am not a HUGE natalie portman fan to begin with--but this was one of her worst performances.i DO NOT recommend Garden State."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good.","review":"This movie was horrible.

The only remarkable thing about this movie is, how boring it really is. It is supposed to be a comedy. Well, I didn't laugh a single time. I didn't even smile once!

I give one star for the motorcycle with the sidecar, which was really cool.Don't watch this movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable.","review":"I recieved a lot of personal hype about this movie by many of my friends and finally broke down to watch it. The movie was melodramatic, inane, and muddled. This may sound harsh, but there was very little about this movie I actually enjoyed. It becomes obvious more effort was put into the movie's soundtrack then the actual elements of the movie, in particular it's painfully lacking narrative. In the end, mediocre acting (Which I can only assume is the work of director Zach Braff as his movie had talented actors but it didn't show), unimpressive cinematography, excessive teenage angst, and nauseating self-indulgence make this in my mind one of the worst movies of 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong exit","review":"\\"Garden State\\" is an awkward hybrid of a Gen-Y coming-of-age tale and middle-period Barbra Streisand--think \\"Prince of Tides\\" or \\"Nuts.\\" That said, it's a pretty pleasant viewing experience until about 15 minutes from the end, when a son-dad confrontation lets loose the tear-jerking and psychobabble to the point that the film's fragile charm is lost. Spell broken, you have a few more scenes to savor Natalie Portman's thespian stylings as \\"wacky Queen Amidala in the burbs,\\" Zac Braff's bizarrely puffy lips and a soundtrack that keeps things moving but never adds up to much. The DVD extras are painful: Everyone talks like they're making \\"Citizen Kane\\" or something. I guess they didn't read the script.Is this all you have to say, Gen Y? Gee, this makes \\"Reality Bites\\" look like freaking Proust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I think Firedancer's review hit it right on the nail. I read many reviews on this movie and saw the trailer prior to renting. I thought this was going to be great with everything positive that I heard. I was wrong. Natalie Portman's character annoyed me. All the characters lack depth, I was completely uninspired by the film's end. I couldn't feel anything for any of them. I am very disappointed in this picture. I fell asleep during the movie and had to go back and watch the part I missed, so that speaks for itself. I'm sorry, but I just can't recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful","review":"This movie is, hands down, the best director-debut film I've seen in the past 5 years, and one of the best movies I've seen in my life (reguardless of how experienced the director is).The visuals are beautiful without being overbearing. The dialogue is funny and realistic without being stylized. The characters feel like the people you grew up with. Or wish you grew up with. The girl is what every guy wants: cute beyond words, funny, friendly, and amazing in an indescribable way. The music is...well, the music quite possibly makes up the best soundtrack of preexisting songs that has ever been assembled for a motion picture. The Shins alone make this movie something that's just as increidble an experience with your eyes closed.There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. It gets everything right. I would reccomend this film to anyone that has ever felt lost in the unrelenting tide of existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Natalie Portman","review":"My choice in \\"romantic comedy weekend\\" (vs. wife's \\"Spanglish\\") was \\"Garden State\\", directed, written by and starring Zach Braff, has a promising future in the business. My wife only hung in thru about 10 minutes, though I encouraged her to give the rest of the movie a chance as it really picked up once Natalie Portman got involved as Braff's new girlfriend. It's nice to know that she got such a fun role after (before?) suffering through her time as queen in Star Wars the last. The whole film has a grittier feel than \\"Spanglish\\", which helped make it more to my taste. It's R-rated, but aside from a few \\"MF's\\" and some fairly substantial drug and alcohol use in the first 10 minutes, the story's probably OK for kids down to 11 or 12 (at least by my standards). The movie also has an interesting mental health aspect at its core and should appeal to those who've lived with someone who's under a psychiatrist's care."},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite movie of all time","review":"I just came here to give it 5 stars.

I don't want to be mean, but the guy who gave this movie 1 star is a complete moron.

Was I supposed to care?Sorry, I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh please","review":"If you think that mindless teens-early 20 year olds taking charge of their life is moving than by all means watch this. But if you some how think deciding to lay off the prosaic and find a steady girl friend are somewhat less than monumental life decisions and certainly not worthy of a movie plot then avoid this as though it were the plague. I am a college student and independent movie afficionada, but I just couldn't stomach this one. Aside from a few comic moments, this movie lacks substance and direction. The only thing worse than sitting through all 2 hours of it, was having to listen to ignorant people whose lives are inherinetly meaningless gush over how it's the greatest, most meaningful movie of our age. Ackhhh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This movie consisted of overdone themes and dialogue so corny and overwrought that it made me cringe. Cliched metaphors are shoved in the viewers face throughout the film. Main characters are simply irritating and elicit little sympathy from the viewer. Compare to eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, except with worse acting, lamer dialogue, and a mind-numbing plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone else's therapy sesion","review":"I bought this movie taking a chance, which I rarely do, to find I've made a horrible mistake! Zack Braff should not act. Natalie Portman was the only bit of sunshine in this film. My brother is taking a film class in college and they review movies in class all the time. His teacher said,\\"This movie is like being invited to someone else's therapy sesion\\". Get your pillow, this movie will bore you to sleep! The only thing this movie is good for is insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"Ok, so this movie is alright. I'm sure it would have been good if it wasn't the same thing that any other love movie has. There is no new, good humor and at the end it's just a sappy love story. Now, maybe the movie would be better if people hadn't told me it was \\"amazing\\" \\"the best movie ever\\" before i had seen it, because it definetly IS NOT. If you like corny love movies, or want to cuddle with your honey then i suppose this is a good movie, other than that do not expect too much depth out of this movie. The climatic emotional part isn't even exciting...it's just corny and lame...i say make your girlfriend pay for the movie when you rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"4.5 stars? You must be joking.","review":"All I can figure is that the people who are giving this movie 4 and 5 stars saw a different movie than the one I saw.I gave it two stars simply because I found Zach Braff's character Andrew very realisitic. Then again, Zach Braff is a 20-something actor living in L.A. figuring out his life. His character, Andrew Largeman, is a 20-something actor, living in L.A., trying to figure out his life. Not much of a stretch there. But I'll give him a little credit for being a cute dorky guy who actually wrote and directed a film.But 4.5 stars???? No way.Natalie Portman giggles and nauseates her way through this movie, while Andrew walks around in a slightly befuddled state while all around him get high on whatever illicit drugs happen to be available. Yes, I know, he's kicking his own over-medicated state. I get it. It's not that funny.If you are over the age of 18, this movie is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Great","review":"I like the simplicity of this movie, no special effects, no crazy robots, and no big explosions. Garden State is a simple movie depicting this somethings strange journey called life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garden State DVD","review":"Quirky, teenage angst/self-actualization in progress, neo-modern classic with an intriguing \\"below-the-radar\\" approach to touching your brain that has become the calling card of Zach Braff. It's a good movie...almost like a slightly deeper/darker \\"Juno\\" but from a male central character point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Puppy Love Film","review":"Hmmm...just saw this film and was left unimpressed. Watching a 20 something who is lost, finding his way (and it's questionable if he ever does) is less than captivating, unless maybe you are in the same state the viewer is in. His old friends are immature and irresponsible partying 24/7 with no care in the world. One of the film's leads has the most despicable of habits to pay for his drug use. Is it supposed to be funny? The characters are two dimensional and poorly scripted. The whole premise just seems unrealistic, unresolved and unintelligent. If the critics say this is a great movie, maybe it's because they do that for a living. Not a waste of time but close to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, Enchanting","review":"Immediately I was taken with the visual and cinematographic choices made for this movie - basically I like to see different portrayals of life other than blockbuster bs. I loved the dark and almost mysterious environment. I found that at first it is hard to connect with the characters, they are kind of strangers, but toward the end they become your friends, they become people you know. I just found reality and truth and honesty that are often pushed aside for a pretty story in most movies. If you like movies that make you think, that make you feel raw emotions, this is for you. If you like a mind-numb picture with raunchy jokes and idiocy, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it 0 stars, I would.","review":"Garden State was the most pretentious sack of crap I've ever seen. It is second only to Broken Flowers. I couldn't even finish watching it, it was so bad. I couldn't figure out if it was trying too hard or just not trying. It was thrown together by a group of people who just wanted to look clever. It didn't work. It's an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikable characters who all sound alike","review":"I don't want to say anything insulting about this film, because I don't consider it to be a bad film -- I just didn't like it. And there are basically two reasons why:1. I didn't find any of the characters likable. I didn't care what happened to them. When Zach Braff's character is hanging out with his friends, I was thinking \\"If those were my friends...I'd have to get new friends.\\" Even Braff's character came across as unlikable -- it seemed like he thought he was too good to be there.2. With a few rare exceptions, every character in the film sounds like every other character. You could take any line spoken by a character, and give it to almost any of the other characters and it wouldn't sound out of place.There are a couple of funny moments in the film, but it's not a comedy, and I wouldn't consider the film as a whole to be funny. To me, it was a film about a bunch of characters I didn't like, who all spoke exactly the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea poorly done","review":"I wanted to enjoy this film but found the characters a little too obvious. Relying on music to further the story became a little trite.It could have been better. Also, shouting into the abyss was a little too obvious.Send Zach good thoughts but save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scrub it","review":"The script was good (no Charlie Kaufman, but then again, what is?), nice dialogue and quirky characters. Too bad the performances could not sustain it. Zach Braff mopes around like Ray Romano's younger brother. Natalie Portman gives a poor mans Kate Winslet but falls way short. Supporting cast could have phoned their roles in. Under abler hands, the film could have been okay but when you're director, writer and star, the whole is weaker than the parts (as opposed to a collaborative team like Kaufman, Carrey, and Gondry) unless you are a genius like Woody, which Braff is certainly not. The one stroke of genuis was including the muse himself, Nick Drake, in the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"I spent a lot of time fast forwarding through most of it","review":"The basis of the movie revolves around a succession of bizarre events when Andrew returns to his hometown in New Jersey for his mother's funeral after being gone for 10 years.Other than that, I guess I must have missed the main message. - or I must have been heavily medicated like the main character.Overall I would say the story (one of self-discovery) was OK, the acting was good and Natalie Portman played a believable character. The chemistry between the two main characters is what holds the whole thing together.I spent a lot of time fast forwarding through most of it thou,There are a few funny parts mixed in - like the scene with the hamster cemetery. but that's about it.Maybe rent it or borrow it from a friend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish","review":"I could not finish watching this movie after the scene where Natalie Portman meets Zach Braff in the dr's waiting room with her big hipster headphones on. Wow, is she unusual. I saw about 15 chicks like her on the way into work today.

I hadn't read up on the film, really went into it blind, not expecting too much, needless to say I was impressed.The plot concisely evolves around Andrew Largeman (Braff), who is effectively \`sleep walking' through life, only awoken by the death of his mother. He finds himself at home for the first time in years meeting old friends and making new ones, in particular Sam (Portman). The real key to the film is the characters and their relationships, such as the contrast between the \`numb' Braff and quirky-happy-go-lucky Portman. The relationship between father and son is also enjoyable to watch, raising questions on just how much control a father should have. There's no cars exploding, no gun shootouts, nothing even side-splittingly funny, just an enjoyable look into one mans world."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" Decay of language is the decay of man \\"","review":"This is a perfectly good student film.It's besotted with vocabulary indifference.The only people I know of who man-dude-like andf-word this much are actors in films, although I willassume it does go on elsewhere.I'm tired.

Very deep, yes?). Of course, it must be good because it's an Indie movie, so eventually I'll have to revise my opinion to fit in with the Indie crowd (and by doing so become a nonconformist)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!!","review":"Being the hopeless romantic that I am, I was so excited to see this movie only to be highly disappointed. The performances by Zach Braff and Natalie Portman were outstanding (minus all of the foul and completely unnecessary language) however, the movie itself left a lot to be desired. The plot was substantially weak and the longer the movie went on the longer my husband and I suffered. By the time it ended we were both glad, though I was personally sad as I had really hoped it would stand up to all of the rave reviews I'd read and seen on television."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"Whenever I watch a movie, I ask myself this question--\\"Why should I care about the characters and what they are going through?\\" The answer to that question is absolute nothing as far as Garden State goes. The characterization is so paper thin that I half wished that Sam and Andrew will never see each other again. There is nothing sympathetic about story's hero Andrew. He is just another loser who can't get his act together. His story is not worth telling. Natalie Portman did what she could with her role, Sam. Her presence is the only saving grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"YUCK! I could not make it through the entire 1 hour 45 minutes. After the first hour, I had to stop watching.

This movie really did put me asleep. Twice. I didn't even know such a boring movie existed.It was stupid, and had no story line. The best part of the movie was the end credits because the movie was finally over. No action or humor whatsoever. 1 star is way too many stars. This movie should be outlawed or burned Indians with torches. If you want to see a movie that will have you laughing, on the edge of your seat in anticipation and suspense, or even remotely entertaining, I suggest you walk right past this movie, and never look back.

Garden State was fun to watch, with its unique characters and interesting camera shots, but all in all i feel there was to much hype over something that was just alright.

The post and backing have come apart often. I do not wear them to bed (although I have many earrings where that isn't a problem) and I do not pull on them or put them under any stress. They just aren't made very well.

It is way too short! I managed to catch it the first time they fell apart but that didn't happen the second time-- i spent [...] bucks to have them for 3 days before one of them went completely missing because the post wouldn't stay in because the earring itself is way too short.

All three movies are amazing, and the experience I had watching them in Blu-Ray was astounding. I have seen a few movies in Blu-Ray, but many of them have one common issue: the volume of the voice track is rather low. These movies, however, have excellent sound for the voice track, music, explosions, and much more. I highly recommend this product to any Pirates of the Caribbean fan. You will feel like you are really there in the scene with the ultimate picture and sound quality.The movies are absolutely amazing. Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow is, in my opinion, the best in his career. All of the characters are so realistic and the stories for each film are astounding.

The product came yesterday and I wanted to try all three of them for making sure that they are working. First two movies works fine but when I inserted the third one \\"Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End\\" I received the error message about regional code. I live in Turkey (Europe) and that's why my PS3 was manufactured for region B. Before I purchased this productPirates of the Caribbean Trilogy [Blu-ray] I reviewed the technical details but could not find out any word explaining regional restrictions. On the contrary, the product information says the disks are available for ALL REGION.I am a loyal customer of Amazon.com but very disappointed about this fatal mistake.

My copy of Dark Knight blue ray is on it's way (this too doesnt mention any Regional Restriction) and now I wonder whether that will play on my system !Great disappintment after spending money to get it shipped etc. I guess it is a packaging mistake.

The blend of action and humor is outstanding and it is a pleasure to take it all in over and over again.My minor complaint is that the second and third disc seem to not have the same high quality as the first and it always takes some adjustment on the HDTV to keep the quality consistent. The Samsung reports 1080i on disc two and three while one is registered as the 1080p; don't know why. This should not hold you back, because the quality of the trilogy is among the best we've seen.If you have to own just one Blu-Ray it should be from this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use with multiple staff","review":"Purchased this for use at a Nurse's Station.

Communication and techniques are the solution. The good news is that this short book focuses on exact techniques (you can move your tongue up-down, sideways, in circles, figure 8s, etc.) which can be the basis of communication and sharing with your partner. No really new ground here.Everyone sees this book differently, just as they see sex differently. Everyone wants to be a good lover, but some have difficulties. Men and women need to work together, to talk, to discover.

The anatomically correct pictures are a big help and everything is diagramed for easy understanding.

I picked it up on a whim, but I was totally unprepared for what it had to teach me as a woman. I've been sexually active since 1971 and thought I knew everything about my own body's sensations. When my husband tried out some of the ideas in this book..... I was totally amazed, not to mention thrilled. I really appreciate the point the authors make about how a woman should be getting as much satisfaction from a sexual encounter as a man. It has revitalized my marriage.

This book is a tasteful and educational book about how women can achieve orgasms with their lovers... but above all it emphasizes the importance of both partners having the desire and know-how to please each other. And desire does not always equal know-how! I can't say enough about the value of this book. Buy it and read it. Or buy it for your man and ask that he read it. Or buy it and read it with him... only good things can come from it!

The best book on sex to be published since the 60's. Bravo to everyone involved. A real stunner. Great sex is like great cuisine.

Called it a Beatles/Byrds hubrid. Well, right he was and is. Heyman's tunes are graced with sparkling jangly guitars, heartbreaking harmonies, strong drums and bass and more hooks than a fly fisherman. A 60s feel with modern recording and production values. Reminds me of McGuinn and his son Tom Petty, the late 70s Searchers, with strings a la 60s Baroque-meisters the Left Banke. My only complaint - it's extremely difficult to play all the guitars and drums, sing all the parts, and produce a record without running out of new ideas from time to time. I'd like to hear Heyman with a band and a producer, capitalizing on all their experience and ideas to add to his wonderful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good for the cutout bins","review":"I wrote one of those lists for 90's pop and this guy is one I forgot. That seems to have been his fate with most of his releases--the terrific \\"Hey Man!\\" album is in most used stores for a dollar. But he's pretty much a one-man band who writes songs that stay with you. His singing may be a bit nasal, but his overdubbed harmonies work for me. He does take too long between albums though."},{"rating":"1","title":"this stuff makes me laugh","review":"ok so theres people out there that listen to this stuff? although under the far too giddy music i believe is some hooks, but the production sounds like it was recorded under water, and thatd even be cool if this was a good album by anyone other than this guy. this is truly annoying music by all means. the lryics are about god knows and the music is just really unorginal. reminds me of 60s folk recorded by some dude that was tripping on shrooms. this is not a good thing by the way. i dont like this album and i will try my best to stay away from music like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book - \\" Lucado 3 in 1\\"","review":"This book was delivered in record time and in good condition.

For those of you haven't seen it in a while, it practically takes place not long after Henry ends. Several actors from Henry reprise their roles in this series (I'll leave it you to spot them all, quiz later). I beleive the BBC used the same sets as well. The extra features sound extremely worth while as well. Now, let's see I, Claudius, Henry and Elizabeth are now on DVD to live forever. What should they release next? YOU make the call :-)."},{"rating":"2","title":"all time favorite","review":"I love this series. I saw it many many years ago when I was about 12 and it inspired me into a lifelong obsession with Elizabeth I. I have read every book about her and seen every movie, this is my favorite. I did see Elizabeth with Cate Blanchett and while the movie was not accurate, Cate was great. I could see the Glenda Jackson mannerisms that I believe Elizabeth herself would have had. THis is a very entertaining and historically accurate film series. See The Six Wives of Henry VIII and then see this. You will adore Tudor history like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely excellent!","review":"Fans of the current Oscar-nominee \\"Elizabeth\\" need to check out this BBC television classic. As sumptuously directed as the 1998 movie is, it doesn't hold a candle to \\"Elizabeth R\\", which covers the entire reign of Elizabeth I, as opposed to stopping just when things get really good. Glenda Jackson's performance is luminous, and the supporting cast, although some older than I would have liked, is uniformly excellent! Although Cate Blanchette's performance in 1998's film is wonderful, Glenda Jackson's terrific portrayal from sumptuous virginal girl to withered, fantastical (& virginal) old monarch is far superior, and is easily one of the two best perfomances by an actress in a television movie EVER(the other being Sian Phillips for \\"I, Claudius\\"). \\"Elizabeth R\\" is an historical film at its best---and television film as it is, sadly, no longer. Absolutely riveting & wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece Theater masterpiece","review":"Glenda Jackson was fantastic in the role of Elizabeth I from a young girl to her death after a 44 or so year reign.

Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Elizabeth","review":"I have always been pleased with everything I ever purchased from Amazon. Elizabeth R in DVD format is no different.

Glenda Jackson plays the part as a strong willed queen just as you would picture the daughter of Henry VIII to be. She is strong, has moments of passion and tenderness, and can swear like any of the men around her. She is her father's daughter.What I liked most about this dvd was that there was little pomp and circumstance with only a few actors which allowed the scenes to be more initmate and focused. It may seem dry at first without the pagentry, but it leant much more time for charachter development. Isn't that what it is supposed to be about? I highly recommend this for anyone who is interested in the life of this \\"First Woman of England\\"(my nomenclature). It adds such a large piece of the puzzle to \\"Gloriana\\". A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"History lesson","review":"I think this is the most historically accurate account of the reign of Elizabeth I. Having read many accounts of this time period, I was impressed with how much detail went into recreating the actual events. I found the commentary wonderful, but distracting. There are no subtitles, so the commentary is spoken over the dialog. There were also some occasions where the commentary repeated itself (same comments given for different events). I think you will end up watching the DVD thru first - then watching again with the commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackson is the definitive Elizabeth","review":"The costumes, cast and set are fabulous - this is the best of the bunch, even stacked up against the newest entries.

This is very annoying when she makes her speech in the Spanish Armada. This movie makes the actors talk on and on, and it BORES me to death.

I liked the way that Guest tells his own personal story while at the same time narrates what was going on with the rest of the cult, making it both a personal and chronological account of the cult.

Ms. Badami (like many of her countrymen and women) have that ability to present a wonderful and engrossing story of a family dealing with the vagaries of maintaining dignity and a semblance of pride in the highly corrupt culture and society that is Modern India. Well paced and reminds me of many of Rohinton Mistry's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring characters and plot","review":"Off all the many novels I have read about modern India this is the most disappointing. Paragraph after paragraph of numbing detail about daily routines, petty arguments and family disapproval wear away at the otherwise sensitive depictions of the familial roles and expectations that this family burdens under. The characters somehow never really emerge as real people, although the multi-generational theme is tied neatly together. This book was slightly reminiscent of the book Palace Walk set in old Cairo, but which was vastly superior in cultural depictions and well-drawn characters you could either care about or despise. The characters in this novel seemed two-dimensional and passive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun story about an middle class Indian family","review":"This book is a light read. I would probably have not read it if it were written about an equivalent western family. The insights into Indian family dynamics make the story more interesting from the point of view of a person unfamiliar with the culture. Badami gets us to understand life of a middle class Indian family. The story is colorful and fun. Badami does a nice job of character development. At some point the father ends up going to Vancouver, Canada and bringing back his grandaughter back to India to live with the family. The contrast of life in India versus Vancouver is certainly interesting from the grandaughter's point of view.This is not particularly fine literature, but a worthwhile read if you are interested in Indian culture especially."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, wonderful!","review":"This is a wonderful book. I read it in one sitting and enjoyed it very much. Some parts of it were rushed and felt contrived but that's nothing compared to the entertaining read this is.

The build up of characters, (particularly Sripathi Rao) is amazing, and so is the story development.. very touching and emotional at times. If there were a moral to the story, it would definitely be: Live In the Moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-done contrast between the Western and Indian cultures","review":"This book is touching, heart-breaking and most of all, realistic. I could not help but thinking how would I feel if, as a little girl, I would have been torn away from my culture and my recently-deceased parents' world to live with relatives in an unknown, mysterious place on the other side of the planet. That is how much impact the book has-- you feel the pain, love and feelings constrained by cultural norms that every character is burdened by. What is wrong and what is right takes many different meanings. The book makes you reconsider values that are culturally accepted but that go against the human spirit. How hearbreaking it must be for a parent to cut all ties with a beloved child because of a marriage against his/her wishes? As a reader, you can't stop thinking about that either."},{"rating":"1","title":"told not shown","review":"While I really enjoyed Badami's first book, The Hero's Walk proved cumbersome and tedious. The plot lacks any creativity. It plods along at a labourious and predictable pace. The reader is \\"told\\" rather than \\"shown\\" everything feeling, thought, emotion. Pales in comparison to Such a Long Journey by Rohinton Mistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a silly gothic","review":"This book is very sensitive and sad--- a jewel.

Chock full of examples and side bars, beginning to advanced users will find something worthwhile in its pages. Coverage of popular reporting tools such as Crystal Reports and Active Reports prove informative, but more informative, interesting and cost effective yet was the discussion on using the ubiquitous Microsoft Office as a reporting tool from VB6 and VB.NET.

But having expressed the link, it bathes in it and rolls around in it, and expects the reader to sympathize, without substantiation. It is its own indictment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Have It !!!","review":"Wow !!! As in Bow Wow!!! I thought their recordings were gone and forgotten forever until I decided to take another look at Amazon today. You may have stumbled across this by mistake while looking for a godawful 80's new wave band or silly rap kid, and if so you are in for a musical education Tokyo style. Bow Wow was the first Japanese hard rock/metal export,re-locating for a time in England and gaining some notoriety for playing the Reading Festival in the early 80's. These were the guys that opened for Kiss when they first visited Japan in the mid-seventies. They had a sensational guitarist in Kioji Yamamoto. Musically they bring to mind early Rush,Van Halen and Deep Purple with an oriental twist.The vocals could be a little bit of a turn off,occasionally sung in Japanese mixed with English;it can get very weird. Still recomended for fans of 70's hard rock. \\"Touch Me I'm On Fire\\" is a powerful rocker with a riff that sticks in your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Family's Sacrifice for Freedom","review":"PASSING THE BATTON is a warm, rich family story that takes place during a most patriotic moment in America's history, WWII.I laughed with the children who mixed with buddies on the street, played hard, made bonds and showed themselves to be ordinary kids who found the means to become men who knew no bounds when it came to fighting for their country.PASSING THE BATON is one family's tale of trying to come to terms with the ultimate sacrifice many suffered: the giving of their sons and brothers to preserve the freedom they, themselves, had known for hardly a generation.I found this sad, tragic, heartwarming and worthwhile.

For one, it feels that some of the code was written by one person and explained by another. Also, the lack of continuity in code style decreases after each chapter (obviously from all the different people that wrote this thing). Some of the introduction chapters were well written, only because they didn't talk about code so much. This book's major failure was the lack of case studies. So Wrox.. with no case studies or quality examples, why should we buy your cheap book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential, but very poor implementation","review":"I have been programming with PHP for 5+ years and loved it.

You wonder if the publisher themselves had anything to do with it.While some of the chapters in the book are quite well written, the book as a whole is somewhat useless. I wish some of these chapters were put into a 'generic Web Services' book, since they are pretty good when PHP isn't concerned, but as for everything else - it pretty much stinks.I'm tired of the Wrox books. What do they do? - slave drive would-be computer scientist from pakistan to pump out the book that they do? There isn't quality or quantity here. It just's a poorly thought out book. For one, it doesn't even have any case studios. Two, php and web services suck anyway.Just don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why so many bad reviews?","review":"Why so many bad reviews? Many of the authors are mad because the company had went out of business and many of them did not get paid royalty fees. In response, it is no doubt that they would wish the publisher to not profit from their own work - there is no justice in that. The truth is that this book is quite good, but due to the circumstances surrounding the entire thing, there is a lot of negativity in the air. I would suggest that you buy the book on its merits rather than the reviews, which I can only honestly suspect are all written by constituents in one form or another with different agendas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh record with a special guest","review":"Even if it's not an electronic record, it's a good tropical pop one.I write this review only to alert fans of LOWELL GEORGE that he's most certainly playing on the first track, even if he's not credited anywhere, just listen (A strong clue is that Little Feat was playing in Japan at the time and that he's playing on Akiko Yano's LP from 1975 (Ryuichi Sakamoto's wife by the way)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"Cheap, cheesey ........... you get what you pay for.

This player did not work correctly from the start. The speakers do not cut off when I plug in the headphones and the headphone jack has to be jockeyed around so both sides work. No satisfaction from RCA when I brought the problem to their attention. I bought this for use on planes but I can't use it for that. I use a Zenith on trips and it has worked fine for nearly a year now. The RCA stays home and entertains me on the treadmill but I really didn't need separate players for home and travel.

Great communication and shipping from seller.This is possibly one of the most important collections of post 1950's pop science-fiction.

If there is a way to find this story in another collection, I would recommend finding it there. The remainder of this book is not intended to be enjoyed. Instead it is intended as a rebellion against SF authors from the \\"Golden Age\\".My suspicion is that Harlan Ellison intended to \\"revolutionize\\" SF with this book, but all he wound up doing was showing that revolutions start with ideas, not declaring \\"Revolution!\\". The irony was that a \\"Golden Age\\" author, Leiber, wrote the only quality story in this anti-\\"Golden Age\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i like a warning about certain things, myself.","review":"Those who enjoy reading certain things should be free to do so , of course, but it would be nice if the rest of us had some idea before we spent money and wasted time. I don't know how the rest of the book turns out, but some potential readers might like to know that this 'literary' sounding book, once you get past the first few pages, has graphic refences to hermaphrodites, lesbians and things of that nature, using some truly filthy language. If that's your taste, as I said, well fine, but I won't be finishing it and I am sure that there are others out there who would like to know this BEFORE they buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mozart of Eurojazz","review":"Rainer is great.He has the technique, he has the ideas, and the creativity to beguile and easily sustain interest for a whole album. Sideman to master sax player/composer Jan Garbarek, and bass player composer Eberhard Weber, he is the perfect european jazz pianist.The opposite of funky , Bruninghaus almost never plays a blue note. But he is such a divinely rare incarnation of euorsoul, you don't even miss the african vibe. Besides, it's there subliminally: ie the man swings!He has found his own unique identity as a composer and improviser. There are cool tunes on this record, and glaringly ,almost in reaction to his longtime association with Eberhard Weber, there is no bass player on this recording. Sometimes I wish there was, but despite that sometimes pointed decision to eschew the bottom, this record stands the test of time. An interesting and emotionally poignant as well as intellectually stimulating recording to be savored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Format is not as flexible as I would like","review":"I recognize this is a live recording of a program including Ms. Fields.

I contacted the reseller who tried to contact Coverking various times, by phone and email, without success to remedy the situation. The reseller refunded my money in the end and apologized for the unfortunate experience, which was beyond their control.

They also hold the title of biggest fake scary dudes, and again, I voted this.The obviously misguided youths that follow this band have no excuse, everyone can see the false pretences on which COF boost their career on - black metal with scary occult themes.These guys are NOT scary, NOT cool, NOT black (not as in race, which they aren't either) or anything really...except fakers.The horrible image this band has goes with the horrible music. Danny \\"Filth\\" sings like a filthy animal, and the guitar onslaught is a real drag. If Brittney Spears were to write metal songs, they would come out like this. REALLY boring and predictable writing.If like me you feel this kinda horrible WANKERY needs to be shown some disrespect, hit the 'helpful' button my friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was once a black metal band?","review":"This release is rather amusing. In fact, all of Cradle of Filth's recent releases have been amusing. Was I interested in the music at all? The answer is no. It is amusing in the fact that the band has sold out. The fact that they're popular isn't why they have sold out. They sold out because they quit playing black metal to avoid negative attention from the media and parental groups. Midian, in addition to all of their recent offerings, sounds more like a gothic metal (a genre which has no appeal to me whatsoever) band such as Tristiana than any black metal band. They were mediocre as a black metal band and now just continue to become worse with time. If you actually want to hear black metal, listen to Darkthrone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dani's last name sums it up. FILTH.","review":"I wouldn't give this, or any of their previous CD's ANY stars if I had the choice. The sound quality sucks on each of them, and listening to Dani Filth is the equivalent of listening to dogs bark, baby's cry, mixed with a bunch of annoying whistling. These guys epitomize CRAP music -- there's nothing \\"beautiful\\" or even \\"hard\\" about them, it's simply noise, and the lead singer really knows how to give you a headache with his feminine squeels. \\"Ah, I can't scream, can't yell, I have no singing voice. I guess I'll just squeel like a stuck pig on every track!\\" -- I have nothing against this approach, except for the first time I can remember, I've never been bothered by a lead singer's voice as much as I have Filth's. I can see why people are so drawn on giving them a chance. I personally think Dimmu Borgir is a WAY better choice, so give some of their previous CD's a try. They completely outshine Cradle of Filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Since I liked CoF's earlier realeses, I was really hoping for their new CD to be good.

Though the lineup constantly changes, It doesnt really matter. I love Dani's voice, and the drummer is great. The two guitarist are great, rivaling Kerry King's super fast picking. Dani's screams are unrelenting, throwing you off with a whisper or two. The keyboards are so cheese, as is with all black metal bands. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT REALLY BLACK METAL, NOT REALLY GOTH","review":"Well this band is not really black metal, but it is not really goth metal either. I think the best label for this band is Goth-black metal. If you are a traditional black metal fan you definitely wont like this because this band is anything but \\"raw\\". However, if you are just getting into black metal this band is probably a good start, and Six Feet Under is a good start for death metal. These bands will lead you to bigger and better things. Best songs on this CD are \\"Chtulu Dawn\\" and \\"her ghost in the fog\\". Fairly decent stuff, if you are a Cradle of Filth fan you will probably like this so pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin's the man.","review":"For the start this is pretty good Cradle of Filth album. Complex as usual in vocal use seems a tradition for brit acts to use different sets of vocals such as Carcass use to do. The real charm of this album is the keyboardist Martin Powell anyone of My Dying Bride fandom should appreciate this album for Martin alone. Though I hate Dani for firing so many members of this band especially skins master Nick Barker. I applaud him for getting Martin. Though I wish Martin would have a chance to play his violin on this album instead he mostly sticks to his keyboard techniques. Maybe on Sucubi he will get that chance. Also if you are a fan of Clive Barker and Hellraiser deffiently get this album. Its based on the story Cabal and even the famed Pinhead gets to make an appearance on this album. Excellent choice by CoF. The only reason I give this album 4 stars is due the lose of number of musicians from this band but where there is loss there might be gain."},{"rating":"2","title":"4,5 stars Amazing album","review":"this album is only second to Cruelty and the beast.

Lost of wildly evil vocal screaming over brutal, very fast metal. This really is the stuff of nightmares. Horror fans should love this.

The songs themselfs have some of the tightest names (i.e. \\"Lord Abortion\\" and \\"Tortured Soul Asylum\\") and have some of the best riffs I have ever heard. This album is a must have for Cradle of Filth fans and fans of the genre. Thats really about it, oh yeah, the video for \\"Ghost in Her Fog\\" [is great]..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never thought I'd say it, but...","review":"\\"Dusk... and Her Embrace\\" has been surpassed as Cradle of Filth's greatest masterpiece. \\"Midian\\" is just too incredible for words. The vocals, as always, range from the most god-awful screeching to low, guttoral growling, to operatic soprano. The haunting melodies are brillianty juxstaposed with fast, abrasive drumming and masterful guitars. The lyrics are more beautifully poetic and disturbingly twisted than ever. This album gets in your head and stays there. And as a nice bonus, this album also has the coolest cover and sleeve art CoF's ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I have been a fan of Cradle of Filth since the beginning (when they still played Death Metal!) and I always liked their work. They have grown more and more mature (musicwise) and they have developped a very own and unique sound through the years. When the mini 'From the Cradle to Enslave' came out I was a little bit disappointed. Don't ask my why but I just was. So I was not realy looking forward to their new release but when I heard it for the first time from a friend I couldn't wait to get my own disc. It is a marvelous one indeed. It has their wellknown and typical 'atmospheric' sound again. I don't know how they did it again but they just keep doing what their good at: creating a beautiful and dark atmosphere which takes you to a world of graveyard romance under a bright full moon.I think that everyone that enjoyed their previous albums should by this one too beacause I can't get enough of the feeling you get when I put on their music and I'm sure you can't too.Corsuvax"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty awesome cd","review":"I am no long term CoF fan by any means (meaning I just recently got into them about 7 months ago) but I personally enjoyed this album. Granted the old stuff was incrediable but I can still see the greatness in this album also. I have seen and read that the veteran fans are somewhat put off by the new stuff and I can somewhat see why they are because of CoF's direction change, but personally I enjoy both the old and the new and am hoping that a) a new album will come out soon and b) that it will satisfy both the veterans and the new fans. And lets face it folks CoF will always at least be better the slipknot and their band of quote un-quote \\"musicians,\\" ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cradle of \\"Filth\\"","review":"The name of their band proceeds their music for sure. The lead singer sounds like he's throwing up during every song, making it very annoying to listen to. I'm a fan of slipknot, but Corey Taylor has a great voice and even his screaming sounds good.

And if you haven't noticed half of the guys that bought this album were guys who thought the name was cool. Thats probably why they didn'tlike this album, They would rather listen to a bunch of guys in suits my grandpa weres to the gym and a bunch of old halloween masks. But if yu are a true black metal fan you will love this album. It has everything from chanting and opera to high pitched screaming and symphony. So buy this album you willl not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very Funny.","review":"A Wonderfully pantomimic concept album from Britain's key death metal outfit, with tongue lodged firmly in cheek and laced with a dark humour that those in the right frame of mind will definitely appreciate. Its easy to scoff, but the gloriously over the top operatics, coming off like Wagner remixed by Twisted Sister, and sheer lunacy of the whole thing renders it not only an accomplished musical work but a poke in the eye for the eternally gloomy noodlings of bands like Type O Negative and Skinny Puppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The only reason I gave this album two stars is because it has some really good keyboard parts. Otherwise this is the most god awful Cradle of Filth release ever. There is absolutely no flow to the album at all, every songs' instrumentals sound extremely choppy. The vocals sound extremely out of place on the album and lack the emotion that was put into them on previous releases. And the drums are absolutely terrible, Nick Barker's departure was obviously a severe blow to the band. But I suppose this is what happens when Dani Filth turned into a rock star. His firing of songwriter Stuart is something this band is not going to recover from. As he put it, the band is becoming \\"Dani and the Filths.\\" And if your one of those people who thinks this is a good album, listen to Vempire, then Midian, and think twice about this being a good album. If you don't have it already, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midian Is Good","review":"Midian is my favourite COF album thus far. The music and lyrics are both amazing. In earlier productions, the sound quality ruins the music, the vocals sound bad, not because dani can't sing (he most definitely can!) but i beleive it's just due to lack of funds on previous albums. Damnation and A Day comes close, the atmosphere and quality are better, but nothing can match the amzaing melodies and lyrics of Midian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm...","review":"I had heard many good things about Cradle of Filth and this album in particular prior to purchasing it, and I just happened to find a copy in my local music store, not knowing anything about what to expect. Now that I've expanded my Filth collection, it's the worst of their albums, as the synth is way overdone, but it's still pretty good. The first two full-length songs are the best. Most of the other stuff is good, but suffers from the omnipresent vocal downfall and the overdone keyboards/synth, which overpowers the guitars at times and doesn't sound much like metal. Anyway, pretty good album, and not a bad place to start a Cradle collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"tears of inconceptual beauty","review":"who doesn't like Cradle of Filth? Danni Filth is not only one of the best metal singers, he is the best! His voice rips through each song on this album, like a razor through the hearts of millions of listeners! The videos that the band makes are symphonically gothic and satanic! A blister that won't go away! Danni Filth and the band of COF have done it yet again! Through artistic stylletics, morphogenic voicing on each track, making each track his own personal hell; Danni gives Cradle of Filth fans something to bang their heads to, something to become dark to, and something to sing to! If you can't sing to this album, then you're deafer than my 80-year-old grandpa! With this album and many others that have followed; it's no wonder why critics love to hate them, and fans hate to love them! If you don't give this album a try, along with Damnation and A Day, their newest one, then you are missing out on the best black satanic metal band out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two bloody thumbs up","review":"They never bend drastically from the brilliant black metal staples: movie monster-type vocals, lots of high-pitched screams, exceptional lyrics, and relentless, punishing riffs. Midian begins with a chorus of what sounds like some [] monks chanting. The album is at its very best when the ominous, classical-style keyboards kick in. But most of the record is intense screaming and rock'n guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so low rating and what I love about Raggedy Ann !","review":"I started to watch Cartoon Craze today for the first time since 2 year that I get the dvd but never watched til today !

This survey of his work helps me think my way through many theological briar patches - whether I agree with Hauerwas or not.Readers who like the way Hauerwas combines breadth, depth, and compassion with a stringent ethical vision will also want to read Heroism & the Christian Life by Brian Hook and Russ Reno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its about Christianity ...","review":"If you think you know what it means to be Christian, read Hauerwas.

This album is worth steeringh clear of. The Beatles only appear properly on two songs, the first two songs. On the other twelve songs Tony Sheridan is the lead vocalist and only half fo those song feature the Beatles on backing. The 'Beat Brothers' are not the Beatles. Oh, by the way, Birth of a legend is an early 1962 LP that they cut for Decca, who didn't sign them, and the BBC didn't sign them on the strength of 'Yellow Matter Custard', which it wasn't originally called. Third time lucky, I suppose. But even if they aren't as good as Please Please Me or Sergeant Pepper, they are two LP's made up entirely of Beatles songs, and the public and the fans deserve to have these two albums released!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best bebop guitarists","review":"Although Louis Stewart's name won't be familiar to many, I consider him one of the major bebop guitar players. This live set was recorded in Scotland before a small but enthusiastic audience. The set list doesn't hold a lot of promise with 9 overplayed standards, but the playing is unbeliavably fresh and modern.

Crippled by disease, the child ponders the small beauties of life that offset her plight.

I adore NR & all of her books - trilogies, magic, mysteries, etc. and was excited to read \\"Birthright\\", however, less than halfway through I was totally annoyed with the book. The main characters were so unlikeable, particulary the woman (why is rude & nasty loveable in some of NR's books?) & the storyline just bounced around too much. I found myself, for the first time w/a NR book, skimming through some of the pages.Now that being said, I am enjoying NR's newest trilogy (I've just started the 2nd book) and never find these magical storylines boring - different strokes for different folks I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult read","review":"Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Best","review":"This is probably one of Nora Robert's best books! This book was also the first of the Nora Robert series I've read and this is the book that got me totally hook to Nora Robert's series.Callie Dunbrook is an argeologist and one that is stubborn. But when a man that's trying to build a building discovers a thousands of years old site. So, with some difficulities, Callie was forced to work with he ex, Jake, again. First it was bumpy but as time goes on, Callie discovers something that shakes that hot head of hers. It seem to be that she was adopted in an illegal adoption. Through hard times, Callie along with her Jake finds the answer to the questions. And meanwhile doing so...falls back into the one person's arm so never knew she would.

Though quite long for a NR book...it was well worth the time spent to get to the finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double romance with the suspence","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The sparks between calli Dunebrook and Jacob Graystone are great!! Alsot he secondary romance between Lynn and Doug. The end was at a great pace. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the consatnt use of G**D***. I don't think I a being a prude but it was not necessary there are other words that would suffice. Otherwise it was a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great...of course...","review":"It was great...of course. Roberts never lets you down. Everytime you pick up one of her books you already know the outcome; you're going to get romance, mystery, comedy and a well researched plot, of course there are never really any surprises, but that's ok by me...I know I'll always get my money's worth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STILL TRYING TO GET THRU IT","review":"Nora Robert's is my favorite author and her books are the best...but I am having a tough time getting thru this one.

I am still reading it..and have been putting down for a month now on and off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Reading","review":"I've been a huge fan of Nora Robberts for years and this book was (as always) a pleasure to read. The characters were so realistic, people you might already know. It made me laugh, it made me think, it is really a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, repetitive, tedious","review":"This is the first book I've read by Nora Roberts and probably the last. I picked up the book because the topics of archeology, Maryland and Robert's popularity were intriguing. After 50 pages, I just speed-read the book to get the plot (mostly about an adoption/kidnapping, which was not what I expected). I found I could skip page upon page and still get the story (which maybe could be witten in 10 or 15 pages). I know Roberts is popular, but this book was like a worn-out, unnecessary, mediocre, lukewarm \\"romance\\" with potenitally semi-serious plot (archeology, land disputes, legal-medical issues around adoption) which drown amidst the \\"need\\" for romance. Also Roberts tries to sound too \\"hip\\" citing rock groups, etc. I felt like this book was really pandering to the readers. So, guess what, I don't recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right On!","review":"As the previous reviewers have already stated, this story encompasses many plots; all of which are interesting and somehow tie to one another. Callie Dunbrook, archeologist, out on a dig of a lifetime with a surprise addition to her team - her ex-husband/anthropologist, Jake Graystone. Not only do Callie and Jake discover each other and the remnants of a lost settlement in the town of Woodsboro, MD, Callie has a bigger surprise in store for her - the discovery of a birth mother, father and brother that could possibly be more fact than fiction. This story plays many different angles, but Nora ties them all together with some really lovable characters - Doug, Lana, little Ty, Suzanne, Jay, Vivian and Elliott as the parents and siblings as well as the team, and I especially like Digger! Definitely a Nora book you won't want to miss - Birthright is a great find."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of her best","review":"Roberts has certainly come a long way as a writer.

You can almost guess the ending before it begins."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Nora Roberts I've ever read","review":"I love Nora Roberts. This book just didn't make it for me. I didn't care one iota about any of the characters. I felt like the dialogue was coming out of nowhere.I really liked the plot. It was the best part. The romance was boring and unnecessary.I usually love anything that Nora puts out. I'm just glad I got this from the library instead of shelling out $25.95."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good thrill","review":"Well, quite opposite of the other reviews of this book, I liked it. I was excited to see that archaeology was the medium used to anchor the story. As someone who's been on archaeological digs before, the portrayal of the site, events, and all characters was quite realistic (if a little fantastic at times). Callie fit the bill perfectly. Women who get involved in and make it in the world of archaeology are tough and sometimes they're mean. I liked that she never stood still, stood up for herself, and really did care for the other characters around her. Jake was also great, even though he could have been a little more developed. I thought the story was good. Was it realistic? I don't know that for sure but why read a romance novel if what you're after is realism? Taken at face value for what it is, Birthright was an entertaining story and a great escape from reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's dragging on and on and on","review":"I am struggling to get to the end of the book. Too much going on and it drags. Three relationships, baby kidnapping, archaeological digs, murders and more. Too many threads and the pacing is thrown off by it. I find the lawyer/brother relationship completely superfluous and detracted from the pacing. It's plodding to the point where I am wondering why I am still trying to get through the book and no longer care about any of the tangle of threads going on in this book.I am listening to the audiobook version and I also have to add the narrator is awful. The hero (after you figure out who the actual hero is because of all the threads in the story) sounds AWFUL. All the male voices are terrible. Gravelly and I want a throat lozenge after listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was absorbed","review":"I must say I did enjoy this book, contrary to some of the reviewers. I didn't find it boring or stupid! There was a baby snatching ring in the USA some years back, so the plot was feasible. The main characters were - for me - likeable, though I preferred the lawyer to the archeologist, who was a pretty mean woman. I particularly liked the men in this novel, particularly the brother of the main character :)Over all, yep, it was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would definitely recommend","review":"lovable characters especially the main man! talk about steamy! great character depth with an adorable side love story. you really feel for the characters. great plot with some amazing twists. another incredible book from nora roberts. this title is definitely going on my top 10 list"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora does it again","review":"Awesome book.

Hence I was on the waiting list for her latest. The editors writeup did not sound like something I'd enjoy but we often have different tastes.This time we were years apart. This was the dullest book I have ever read; and yes, I plowed all the way to the end because often times Ms Roberts saves the last part of the book for a smashing finish.Believe me, I could have lost this book at any point and never wondered again who did what.

While there are a couple catchy songs (Face Down, Damn Regret) I just couldn't find a single thing that The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus offers, at least on their first disc, that's different than the dozens other bands with an emo/faux metal sound with the occasional misplaced grunting/screaming. The definitely have potential but I bought this at the same time as Coheed and Cambria's new disc and Don't Fake It is now collecting dust while No World For Tomorrow is stuck in my head.And to top it off, they had a guest appearance on The Hills. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I reserve 5 stars for my favorite bands of all time","review":"But I have to admit, this CD is pretty kickass. it's got a lot of catchy songs, great vocals, great guitar... of course, it's nothing that will blow your socks off, but it's a solid CD that I will listen to over and over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This album is amazing. From start to finish, every song is absolutely amazing. I've definately been playing the songs over and over again. I recommend you buy it, it's what all the cool kids are doing! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"super cool stuff from some super cool kids","review":"Don't you Fake it, the debut from Jacksonville's own The Red Jumpsuit apparatus is absolutely amazing! It is a easy to relate to with catchy phrases and hooks. There is something for everyone on this album. If you think this album isn't full of ficticious lines and ideas- you are saddly mistaken! Each and every song is about an actual event, person or situation that the band knows. For more info on this check out the at&t blue room for exclusive performances and interviews. The moral of the story, the method to my madness- This is real stuff written for real people by real people and each song carries more meaning than what is on the surface. Sit back and let this introspective work of art consume you. I've had it on constant rotation since i bought it! if shallow, meaningless music is what you've been listening to pick up RJA's album and allow it to expand you musical horizons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RJA Review","review":"This album is great.

It would be, if half the songs didn't have this low, gutteral screaming in them. I just couldn't listen. I don't think I've listened to the entire album all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blehhk.","review":"Okay, so, this CD was on my listen to list for maybe a couple months but I just never got around to it. Then earlier today, I was disappointed. Possibly the only good songs on this CD are Face Down, and Your Gaurdian Angel. That's all I'm gonna say. So yeah. If you like this kind of \\"Ooh, look at me, I'm trying to be so hardcore\\" stuff. Then this CD's for you. If you don't, then don't even bother. All i have to say is...Blehhk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a full star","review":"RJA sounds like every other top 40 boy band trying desperately to have some kind of punk edge.

Every single song is outstanding. I can honestly say that I can listen to the album over and over again without even skipping a song. Every song has such a great sound. If you dont have this album yet, get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RJA DYFI = Awesome","review":"I first heard of The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus on Fuse television. I saw the video for their single \\"Face Down\\" and i was completely blown away. They tackled a serious subject matter as spousal abuse and made it into a catchy song. That in itself is amazing.So then i went and checked them out online and was impressed by what i heard. I bought their album the day it came out and i was excited to hear their unique style of music. The cd did not disappoint. In fact it phenomenal and i have been letting my friends listen to it. They like it as much as i do. Their songs range in subject but each song has a uniqueness that demonstrates the bands style and artistry. Overall i think that anyone who has heard a song by RJA will enjoy this album. I still haven't heen able to stop listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Much Amazing.","review":"This album is really, very good. My boyfriend told me the band was really good, But he thinks every band is good. Well anyways i checked them out, and im stuck. Im definitly in love with The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. I can actually listen to it when im sad, or in a good mood. It's really amazing music. GOOD JOB BOYS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"how much worse can it get","review":"i'm tired of all these bands that come out and they think they sound good. this is another example of how dumb music is sometimes. RJA has copied every other band i've heard of and i'm sick of that. \\"Face Down\\" is there first single and it sounds like a rip of MXPX. so yeah not even that song. \\"Guardian Angel\\" or whatever sounds like Copeland, or Lifehouse or something like that. i mean every song on the cd is a copy of other bands. no originality what so ever. i wish bands that are trying to make it big use their own skills in writing instead of others. one star is the least i could do, and that's sad cause i enjoy music, don't waste your time on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously. ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS I OWN!!!","review":"When I saw these guys on some 'Ones to Watch' sort of thing on mtv, i was immediately entranced. They had a catchy song and I immediately found my way to Limewire and downloaded face down.When the album came out...i bought it have been listening to it ever sense. Part of me just blends with the music and falls into this trance (I ran into a 2 x 4 listening to their cd.) where it's just me and the music. It's rare i do that with music. my thing is movies.RJA isn't like any other band. They don't have just ordinary catchy tunes that you can bounce around to when you're alone in your room. It's real music, with well thought up lyrics. The band is talented, and on their mark.Don't You Fake It is seriously one of the greatest albums I've ever honed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"red jumpsuit apparatus is ready to make it big and this album is just the start. great album with songs that sound different and not all the same like some other screamo/emo bands. best song easily is cat and mouse with how mellow it is. the album is so easy to listen to and is so well put together. awesome album and worth paying any money for."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"Well all I can say is I bought this cd hoping to be something great and all I got was a washed out sound of mess. There are only like 2 great songs that caught my attention, other than that, I think that I would have rather cleaned my bathroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio air time is deceiving.","review":"After hearing Face Down and Your Guardian Angel, which is an absolutely beautiful song, I decided that I wouldn't mind having this CD. BIG MISTAKE. There is a huge difference between the songs you hear on the radio and the ones on this CD. The only genre I could put them in is screamo. The majority of songs on this album are not sung, they are simply screamed out in what sounds like some type of hellish gag. Do not buy this album if you like what's on the radio, you won't hear it, except for 2 songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is much better than you'd expect","review":"This isn't great art, but let's face it, hardly any music, much less rock music is.But this album is eminently listenable all the way through.

Let's not over-analyze a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing album","review":"The Red Jumsuit Apparatus did an amzing job with their debut album.

The best songs on the album are the hit(s) face down and Your Guardian Angel, Damn Regret, 17 aint so sweet, & Cat and Mouse. This album is for fans of The All-American Rejects, Plain White t's, Cartel and several other Punk Rock bands.

I have a friend who lived in the boonies but LOVES 80s music. He did not receive MTV until many of these songs were long gone from the air and tv waves. He was extremely happy and excited to see this collection. There were a few videos that I really have no clue as to why they were on there, but for the most part, this is a really good collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it would work.","review":"When I first turned it on it would power up, but wouldn't do anything.

However, about 90 days after purchasing the recorder, which comes with a 90 day warranty, the DVD drive completely died. The rest of the machine still works, but what am it's not worth much any more. I guess I should have bought a better brand name with a longer warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This DVD recorder is awesome.

For confirmation of my opinion, please see Gloria Steinem and Joyce Johnson duking it out on \\"Larry King Live\\" shortly after the book was publishede.

This album has me trying to get every one to listen to it. Just like my other favorite artist Prince he is simply moving with technology by adding rappers. I praise him for changing his style once or twice. Whether or not he uses rappers or hard rock artists he has already established himself as a beggar. So go with the flow I never got into rap until now because music is music and he realizes that. Go Kieth you are blessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! WARNING! DO NOT BUY THIS CD!","review":"After listening to this CD a couple of times, I was extremely disappointed. I almost threw it in the trash! I expected slow sensuous R&B songs that Keith is so well known for. This CD consists mostly of Hip-Hop and rap songs. If you want a good Keith Sweat CD, get the self-entitled \\"Keith Sweat\\" album. You've been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not meant for my dog.","review":"Your better off with some Penn tennis balls. These smell like mint but I haven't noticed any minty smell on my pup. That may be because I'm not smelling my dogs breath on a regular basis.They aren't chew toys, and they are not marketed as them. I tried playing fetch with him and he refused to give it back, I ran all over the place and crawled under the table trying to get it back. Eventually he lost it somehow and my mom found it in her closet.The problem with these is that my pup enjoyed eating the fuzz off of them and peeling the fuzz off the ball (which came off with a layer of the ball) I woke up one morning to a half tennis ball, half lacrosse ball.If your dog is well behaved and not a heavy chewer go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have heard a lot of CDs, and this is the best yet","review":"This CD was the best I'v ever heard, you never seem to get bored of the songs. I myself really liked \\"Then the morning comes\\", \\"Satellite\\", \\"Who's there\\", and \\"Defeat you\\". Well, I like them all a lot. The sound affects and lyrics are outstanding. I definitely recommend that everyone buy this CD. I guarentee that it's worth 15 or so dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY GREAT CD!","review":"I first bought this cd because I loved \\"All Star\\". When I first listened to it, I liked every song except for a few. Now that I have listened to it a million times, those songs have really grown on me and now I love all of them!

Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SmashMouth Fan","review":"I love this CD. \\"All Star\\" is simply the best song ever! They never play it enough on KIIS-FM, which is why I have so gotta buy the CD.

Even my 5-year-old likes it--especially All Star, which he affectionately calls \\"Shreck.\\" It never gets boring because of Smashmouth's amazing ability to carry off a breadth of styles convincingly. It's upbeat, and makes you feel good. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes pop, alternative, or ska."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Smashin'","review":"I bought the CD for my son but after listening to it a couple of times, I am tempted to keep it for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big :^(","review":"I recieved this CD for my birthday a week or two ago and was thrilled.

I mean this album is good, but Fush Yu Mang, their first album, was way better than this. They sound the same but their music just lacks the energy they use to have. It was a real dissapointment to me because i was expecting an album with more humor and action than the first one had. If you enjoyed this album, but never heard Fush Yu Mang, trust me they were better, and if you have Fush Yu Mang and are thinking about getting this album, trust me, it really is a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashamed","review":"I would be ashamed to own this record (luckily, I borrowed it from a friend and was able to promptly give it back). I felt like tossing this CD in the garbage. I eagerly anticipated smashmouth's follow up to their brilliant debut, a punk infested album that remains one of my favorite. And instead I hear a travesty of an album, each song provoking ponderous expressions (such as \\"why would they...what were they...?). At best this album would present a laugh, if not for the inexplicable demise and sell-out of a once promising, passionate band."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it NO stars if i could","review":"It would really take more than 1000 words to describe how bad this cd is. THe lyrics are very shallow and empty, there is a real lack of meaning. The sound is not original at all. It is pop music with a lot of repition, the songs all sound similar. Most cds i buy, i listen to a lot, this one gets boring so quickly. The songs sound like the band is trying so hard to make it sound kool, but unfortuatly it didn't work. I was very surprised, i had expected a lot more from smashmouth. But i soon learned that i shouldn't have expected much. THe lead singer, acts immaturely towards other talented musicians in the industry. ANd this attitude is only magnified in the music. I wouldn't reccomend buying this cd, but if you really want it, i'll pay you to take mine. -person who wasted good money on a bad cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell happened to this band?","review":"smash mouth went from having funny lyrics and awesome music style to mindless crap for lyrics and gay space music. if thats all smash mouth could come up with, they should have quit while they were ahead! they must have been STONED when they wrote the lyrics and astro lounge is a WASTE. we should give it the old HEAVE HO."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst albums I have ever heard","review":"Astrolounge, the album by Smashmouth, has to be one of the worst albums I have ever heard! When the band first came out I loved the song \\"Walking On The Sun\\". Then I heard this album. I liked the song \\"All Star\\" when it first came out but then it was just overplayed. The songs on this album are sooo boring and the only ones I kind of liked were \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" and \\"Can't Get Enough Of You Baby\\". Other than that the cd is a total waste of money and I don't recomend this album to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch","review":"smash mouth USED to be a good band...i dont know why they ever came out with this garbage...a friend at a radio station let me hear it, and i was gravely dissapointed...buy their first CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smash Mouth rocks as it is, but this, ohhhhh boy!","review":"Smash Mouth comes back finally with a great CD, Astro Lounge.

This is cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell-outs!","review":"Well, Smash Mouth has sold out. They had it going with Fush Yu Mang, but Astro Lounge just can't compare. There was only one song I didn't like on Fush Yu Mang, while Allstar and Then The Morning Comes are the only ones I liked on Astro Lounge. Smash Mouth looked at the success of Walkin' On The Sun, and then tryed to do a whole CD in that genre. They only succeeded with Allstar and Then the Morning Comes. So, if you're expecting and want a CD like Fush Yu Mang, don't buy this. Likewise, if you just have to have Allstar or Then the Morning Comes, buy the single. Soft rock just doesn't work these people. Go back to hard rock, Smash Mouth. It's what you do best."},{"rating":"1","title":"good at first","review":"I have had this cd for a while now and realized it got old pretty fast. All-star got old too. If you like all star just record it off the radio (its on all the time) or buy the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn inducing pop music","review":"Been there, done that. That's the first thing I said to myself upon listening to Smash Mouth's latest album \\"Astro Lounge\\". Many of the songs on this album sound like rehashes of the last album's hit single \\"Walking On The Sun\\", so you might like this album if you enjoy hearing the same song over and over again. The songs are punctuated by dumb lyrics (\\"Hey now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play\\"), watered-down ska-pop riffs and something of a spy-music fixation, which goes nowhere fast. The worst of the lot is \\"Waste\\", a ballad so insipid and dull you would swear it was the latest 'N Sync hit. \\"Come On, Come On\\" is a decent track, despite being written for a commercial - heck, you can even hear \\"All Star\\" and \\"Then The Morning Comes\\" in commercials as well, so you will probably be sick of them once you buy the album. This band definitely doesn't warrant the overexposure they have received upon the release of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it","review":"Fush Yu Mang rocked, every song on it was great so naturally I figured this would be the same. I was wrong. This is horrible its nothing but played out radio songs and boring mindless junk.

I bought it, then took it on vacation the next day. I couldn't stop listening to it all the way there! I like just about every song, except for just a couple. If you like 'All Star,' 'Then the Morning Comes,' and 'Walkin on the Sun,' then I strongly suggest this album.FYI: Lyrics are included."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album","review":"I should be giving this album 4 stars but I love the music. There is one INCREDIBLE flaw. Even though All Star helped these guys' careers a lot, it gets EXTREMELY old. Everything else in the album is priceless. This album is worth the purchase, so if you hate Smash Mouth's music, I pity you. You are missing out on some great beats, in a sort of unestablished genre. This will fit under Pop/Ska/Hip Hop/Rock/Lounge, you tell ME what you think it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new sound. Cool changes. Good phrasing. Thought out !","review":"Heavy freakin sigh. Somebody ( SMASHMOUTH ) is finally doing something original. I am sooo tired of the \\" GARAGE BAND \\" ( They know who they are ) music on the FM dial.

Good Album Guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, quirky and fun","review":"I wasn't sure what to make of these guys from the radio singles at first: standard pop with a slight quirkiness, or talent with real originality? Since they're popular with the mainstream I was expecting the worst, but I've been pleasantly surprised. Reggae, punk, alternative, ska, pop, techno, new wave.. they roll it all together into one big entertaining mish mosh, and they have the creativity to pull it off and make it all fun to listen to. As others have said, however: this isn't another Fush Yu Mang. It's more mainstream, for lack of a better word. But they've become more mainstream without sacrificing the quality of the songs themselves. I'm impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"You cannot go wrong","review":"This is a \\"must have\\" addition to anyone's collection. You would have to go out of your way ...not to like this CD.

Well, Juicy Fruit commercials also get stuck in my head and I don't consider them musical brilliance. This album isn't horrific, but it's simply boring, repetitive, derivative, and fluffy. Sure it makes an OK soundtrack to a party, but there's nothing earth-shattering here. Typical here-today-gone-tomorrow pop fare. In a decade no one will remember who these guys are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to listen to","review":"If you buy this CD for \\"All Star\\" then you're the kind of person who will love a lot of the songs on the album. \\"Radio\\", \\"Who's There\\", \\"Come On, Come On\\", \\"Stoned\\", and \\"Then the Morning Comes\\" all are good sounding songs and are easy to listen to.

Things here are much less ska-pop, and more surf-rock. Somewhere between the \\"Beach Boys\\" on speed, and lounge music (hence the title). Of course the big hits are here, \\"All Star\\", \\"When The Morning Comes\\", and \\"Can't Get Enough Of You Baby\\". But alot of the other songs like \\"Fallen Horses\\", are just as catchy and fun. They also slow it down some on \\"Waste\\", which is a really kind of pretty song. Even though \\"Smash Mouth\\" has recently gone soundtrack crazy, they're a good band, and of all their albums, even \\"Fush Yu Mang\\", I think this one is the \\"All Star\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun!","review":"I bought this album because I enjoyed listening to All Star. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the entire album was fun and easy to listen to.

This is an album that won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD that just keeps you going","review":"Some people simply don't like Smash Mouth. Well, that's tough luck 'cause most people do.

I bought this CD the day it came out, and I admit, I was a little disappointed there was nothing like \\"flo\\" on it,but I still loved it. I know of at least 14 people who did not buy the last CD because of lyrics so this CD did not have that conflict. I like every song but \\"Can't Get Enough of you Baby\\", which I actually like, I just have heard it way too much. I love alternative music, so this is kind of a change, but overall, the CD is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys are awful","review":"What drugs are being sniffed by fans of this group?

The rest are go-into-the-corner -and-curse-yourself -for-spending-$$-on-it material. You can't even understand half the words, and all the songs sound the same. I'm so happy that Amazon and Best Buy let you listen to C.D.s before you buy them; otherwise, I would've gotten this album and would've been really unhappy.

The best c.d. ever made!!","review":"I've been a big Smash Mouth fan since I heard \\"Fush Yu Mang\\" in the summer of '98. I bought this c.d. the first day it came out and I love it! This c.d. is for people who like a variety of music styles, such as alterna-rock, pop-rock, reggae, new wave, and modern-day swing. If you buy this c.d. for \\"All Star\\", you'll be in for alot of other great songs as well. If you are expecting \\"Fush Yu Mang\\" all over again, you'll be disappointed.

And I am so glad I have it... I listened to it numerous times during that summer and came to associate different feelings with different songs. These usually made me happy or sad, depending on the specific sound of the song. Here, almost two years later, I pulled out this CD which I knew I had been looking for, and played it again. Somehow, these songs captured emotions of the good times back then, and let me relive them - especially when I needed them. It's only now that I understand some of the lyrics in are what now my favorite songs on this CD, such as \\"Fallen Horses\\" and \\"Waste\\". This will always remain a favorite CD of mine, and is worth getting if you don't have it yet - years from now, you'll find it one you love too, if you're anything like me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smash Mouth's Best Yet!","review":"This is unquestionably Smash Mouth's Best album. If only The East Bay Sessions was as good as this. I looked at some of the other reviews and noticed that a lot of reviewers were about 7-11 years old. Why curse for all your worth if your albums are aimed towards that age level. I've heard plenty of eleven curse in my life, but all the same, what parents going to buy there little 7-11 year old kid an album that has the \\"Parental Advisory\\" Sticker in the corner? This album has no explicit content whatsoever, and this is probably the album that earned Smash Mouth so many younger fans. Fu Shu Mang and The East Bay Sessions are fine, but with the age level of fans, I think they'd sell more CDs if the left out the explicit stuff. Its a great album, the best track is probably Who's There. This easily comes to my mind as Smash Mouths best. I just wish all the other Smash Mouth Albums were like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Wow! This is and will always be my favorite CD!

Despite what some critics say, this cd is enjoyable to listen to. The cd contains different styles of music, such as punk, alternative, and electronica. songs like \\"who's there\\" and \\"radio\\" sound like punk music, while other tracks sound like upbeat alternative music. My favorite songs on the cd are \\"who's there\\", \\"all star\\" and \\"can't get enough of you baby\\".

OK, so \\"Walking on the Sun\\" was a great song, and it would have been tough to come up with another that good, but nothing here is even remotely in that league. Instead, everything here sounds drearily the same. And I know that sounds like something your parents say, but read the first line again. Even the now obligatory cover doesn't sound as fresh as the one on the earlier CD. So go buy that one if you don't already have it, but stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"good and bad","review":"This CD has its share of infectious tunes such as All Star, Then the Morning Comes, Diggin Your Scene, etc. But it seems to me like the ultimate sell-out album for SmashMouth, which can no longer be considered a punk-ska band.

About the only throw away, in my opinion, is Fallen Horses. The diversity of styles and the great pop hooks have kept this CD spinning for me since day 1.

It's great to put on a CD that almost all ages can enjoy, plus I don't have to cringe because the music is dumbed down to the lowest common denominator (two steppin', trad retread rock, line dancing and so on).

Astro Lounge was a total turnaround from the grunge rock of FYM. The light pop to even the darkest tracks (Home, Fallen Horses) had a very upbeat fun sound. This is one of the few CD's I own that I can listen to completley and not want to skip a track. Every song has its own little groove and each of them will stick in your head for months. The song \\"all star\\" which was the first single was a bit overplayed on radio and TV but it doesnt hurt this alblum at all. It actually makes it better. 15 tracks, great vibes, and an overall fun sound make this a definite addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb edition--new standard ed. for Chaucer's dream visions","review":"Besides the excellent, scrupulously edited texts and Lynch's thorough notes and rich-though-brief introductions, this new edition contains a concise and incredibly useful guide to Chaucer's pronunciation that is alone worth the price of the book.

(See Wolf, Muddy, Hooker, etc.)This album proves the general rule, which has virtually no exceptions: White guys can't sing the blues. (See Eric Clapton, Paul Butterfield, Mike Bloomfield, Johnny Winter, etc., etc.) Peter Green is just an awful blues vocalist. He's got knowledge, but he ain't got the soul. There's one thing to live the life and sing the blues; there's another to study the records and sing the blues. And boy, does it show here. So, given the fact that he's the lead vocalist on almost all of the tracks, this make the album torturous. As proof, I offer the two tracks sung by Otis Spann and J.T. Brown. That's the blues.It's also clear, as another reviewer pointed out, that the Chess artists are none to happy to \\"collaborate\\" on this album. The uneasy feeling between Mac and the Chess artists is palpable. This is not always the case. (See the Wolf London Seessions.)Do yourself a favor.

Eliot depicts a village caught in a battle between tradition and progressivism. The characters who make up this struggle are brilliantly portrayed. There is even a sweet romantic twist to the story that renders it even more enjoyable. Eliot gives one the impression that in order for society to make advances for the good of all, some people must willingly give up the prosperity and status that accompanies a largely capitalistic state. It is through such noble acts that those less fortunate can gain a voice in a system that constantly represses them. This is the major theme of this incredible novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A background-propelled novel.","review":"If you're looking for a novel propelled by its plot, then perhaps you should look elsewhere. Felix Holt, as well as the other characters of this novel, are more stock-types set in concrete than actual individuals, and the (far-too-complicated) legal issue that pushes the novel foward is never much convincing and quickly set aside in the end for the sake of moralizing. But then, the background - the socio-political changes in the Early 19th.

The light will only attract flies at night and never during the eay unless you live in a cave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very suitable indoor trap","review":"This is an excellent product that I bought from Costco; I have two; one is in constant operation. The bulb died very quickly, 3 months, a major downside. But the flexibility of the device allowed me to rig-up a portable uv light inside the trap. The device still works as the day I got it. I use two of these in my apartment b/c I live close to water and have lots of mosquitoes, flies and, incredibility, spiders. It is as loud as a small box-fan, noticeable, but necessary to avoid the bites. If you rig-up a party-uv bulb instead of the included bulb, it will work like a charm. The included bulb offers no advantage, its the design of the device and any uv-bulb. Cleanup, both a good and bad thing, sometimes requires a can-of-air from the dust and tweezers for those not-so-easy remains. All-in-all, the best \\"residential,\\" in-home solution for fighting flying pests."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG What a piece of crap!!!!","review":"Thge fan will wake the dead, I live in Port Aransas and the bugs are real bad.

Somehow we have misplaced it in the house and wanted to find get another one. Looked high and low in the stores and couldnt find it. Came here to Amazon and found it should have known. I love this thing. In the summer and fall we put this close to the front door to get all the little nats and mosquitos that fly in.

When most people see the unit, they want to hear it make zapping, crackly sounds. They are a little disappointed that it is fairly silent.

Well, I am sorry for my poor decision, because I am now convinced that this is a pure waste of my money. It catches nothing. I wonder if some bugs do ever get trapped, perhaps the house is so badly infested, and they simply got trapped by chances. I was tring to give it a rating with no star at all, but I was forced to make at least one star. Really, it does not even deserve one single star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very effective","review":"I bought this last year. I use it indoors to catch mosquitos that have gotten in the house. Over the last two years, it has caught about 3 mosquitos. This year, it hasn't caught anything.

The mosquito population where I live is unbelivable.We started using one after one (maybe two) mosquitos were in my infant son's room one night and bit his legs and feet 10-15 times - not an exageration! By morning his feet and ankles were a mass of welts and blisters. Never again with this mosquito trap!We have trapped mosquitos, flies, gnats, and other annoying flying things most everytime we run it overnight.You will not regret purchasing this mosquito trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"Unfortunately, this product did not alleviate our mosquito problem. We have had it turned on for days and have only caught one mosquito. Many more are flying around mocking us with glee. Also, the problem with this machine is that it is very loud and exceptionally bright. You can't have it in your room at night because it's like having a huge fluorescent light on. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must read this before you consider purchase!!","review":"I'm wondering how this product ever got on the market? It is junk. From the moment you take it out of the box and feel it's quality, to when you plug it in and hear the cheap fan motor and see the UV bulb... you sit for a moment and wonder if this contraption will indeed work. I sat in an inviornment favorable to the mosquito and the flew AWAY from it. NOT INTO IT like it is suppose to be desiged to do. It does not work at all. Ever! I had it going for hours, just to give it the benefit of the doubt as a consumer. I really thought and hoped it would work, so I threw out the packaging.

I have purchased repacement lightbulbs, thinking that was the problem at first. These units work fine for the first two or three months...or if you are lucky, maybe 6 to 8 months. Then the lightbulb goes out. The fan works, but the lightbulb fails. I purchased new lightbulbs. (Not an easy to replace bulb, either, and pricey I might add!) But that's not it. Open the unit up, and there is way more complexity than should be required to fix a lightbulb! The failure is apparently in a circuit board (a circuit board? in a mosquito trap that is basically a lightbulb and a fan?!!!) that is integral to the unit. This is planned obsolesence at its finest. Don't aggravate yourself. Let this one go without purchasing it. You will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do the mosquito knot this is a trap?","review":"Living by a creek...lots of mosquitos. Purchased 3 units. Within 1.5 months I counted 1 musquito traped within the 3 units! I have dumped all 3 units to the garbage. I was expecting from Honeywell not to put such a garbage on the market. May be I am wrong in case the machine indeed trapsthe mosquitos and immediatelly makes them invisible...or may be the mosquitos in Florida are really clever and the machine is made for Alabama mosquitos only.P.S beside the infernal machine makes an anoying noise during the night.

Yes, we have good screens and windows, and no, we do not leave the door open, but mosquitoes find their way in when anyone enters. Outside deterrents helped, but if even one comes in, there is a problem!This is not a cure-all, but it does help.

After going through all the reviews carefully, I have to concur with other reviewers about the fact that this is not meant for mosquitoes- the title and description is misleading- and in addition I have to note that the fan IS incredibly weak.

In theory, the Stinger should work well, but in practice, it's complete rubbish! However, I CAN OFFER YOU A SOLUTION - If you can't sleep at night because of mosquito attacks, I highly recommend buying a $20 bed net from IKEA. They're easy to hang up at night and to take down during the day, and they will end your suffering.

This opening is closed mechanically when the switch is turned into the off position, and the trap can be removed from the unit. Most house flys and gnats in my house were only slightly interested in the glow emitted by the unit, gnats would land on the outside of the unit, or the wall next to it, but almost none would actually go inside of it. My vacuum cleaner was 1000 times more effective at taking care of a gnat infestation on my window screens. Solitary mosquitoes and house flys were not interested in the light, and were never trapped.

I have had it continuously running for about six weeks (in Florida, we have year-round mosquito problems), and the few mosquitoes its trapped is negligible. It has attracted a few other bugs, but those aren't the ones I'm interested in killing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly, it works!","review":"I purchased this for my boyfriend because his apartment has a weird infestation of mosquitoes, causing him to get bit numerous times in the middle of the night. He and I were both skeptical at first, but after using it for about 2+ months, it's caught quite a few insects and prevented a bunch of irritating bites! It's even caught moths, gnats, and regular flies, so it's doing more than hoped. The only thing I'd have to say is a negative, is that the light is extremely bright. If you can get yourself used to a bright blue light glowing over the soft hum of the fan while you sleep, then this product could work wonders. However, if you're a light sleeper or have trouble sleeping with a light in the room, this may not help so much. All in all, though, this product is pretty amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Effective","review":"Save your money. It may work for other flying insects but it does not attract or trap gnats.

Some notes from other reviewers that I agree with - if the mosquito is in the room when you are in the room, this product may not work. However, when it is dark and there isn't anything else to attract the mosquito's, it did work. I would usually run it for a few hrs in the evening in my room before going to bed, or in another room all night after going to bed and keeping my door closed. Over all, it worked surprisingly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No clue how these continue to sell","review":"We have had a bad mosquito season this year. I have purchased a couple units to try to combat this and this is the latest and certainly greatest engineering blunder. I gave it a month's use. It failed to catch one mosquito. It did manage, however, to attract more mosquitoes indoors with the extremely bright light - they just came to feast and not to rest in the little trap. The problem got so bad that I ended up getting bitten to the point I contracted W. Niles. I squarely blame this unit for 5 weeks of hell.If you buy this, you are making a mistake much greater than the wasted cost of the unit. I am aghast at the danger this mosquito attraction device subjected me and my family to.

If we have one in the house it will drive me nuts trying to sleep. When we let our dog out into her yard in the evening she invariably brings some back in with her. So I bought two of these. One on the screened in pool deck and one in the house where she comes in from the pool deck. After using them for a week we've caught many mosquitoes. One night there were 10 in the one on the pool deck! This is awesome, the one in the house has caught 4-5. So we've had very good luck with this trap. I really don't understand why some people have had such poor luck with them. It's a very simple design and either it works or it doesn't... hard to imagine why it wouldn't work for someone. The fan is a little loud, but being a constant noise in an adjacent room it's not a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead","review":"The Stinger does work but it is advertised as quiet, I agree it is not eccessively noisy but it is not what I consider quiet.

I think every dish or craft project mentioned by China and Ruby are included. I highly recommend the book for repeat visitors or anyone new to Pecan Springs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a collection of short stories with herbalist China Bayles andcrew as protagonists. While the China Bayles series of mysteries is oneof my favorites, I didn't care for this book at all. The stories weretoo short, there was no time to develop a mystery at all, the solutionswere abrupt, and the entire volume was chopped up with sidebars onnearly every page with little known facts and folklore about whateverherbs were mentioned on that page, and recipes for each and every fooddish mentioned in the stories. Many of these took up an entire page andall of them, without fail, served to distract me from the story at hand.Horrible format, IMO. What a waste of time! I finished it, so I'llgive it a 1, but Ms. Albert is capable of so much better than this, I'membarrassed for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unthymely Death and other Garden Mysteries","review":"The book was in very poor condition.

I think those opinons couldn't be farther from the truth. The video is so extremely over-edited that I find it impossible to watch. The sound quality and performance (i think) are good, but overall this does not capture the essence of a show simply because of it's dizzying camera work and quick edits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, video quality","review":"They've done a good job of capturing the spirit of this last concert.

I think the slight trade-off of flavor for nutrition is well worth it. My 4 kids love them and each wanted to buy his or her own bag so they wouldn't have to share!

This seat looked great with the features, extra holders for \\"stuff\\" and the one we purchased had \\"memory foam\\". We purchased two of these following a car accident as one for the fixed car and one for my car (her primary car) since my son is old enough to need her Cosco Alpha Omega. I had great hopes of this being a fairly inexpensive car seat (compared to the Britax that my ex-EMT neighbor begged me to get). This seat is SO NARROW!!!!!! My daughter's shoulders look squeezed in. She loves it because of the extra head rest/pillow, and of all things the neck roll for when she falls asleep, but I hate it. I returned one of the two, and am getting something different for her primary car seat. This is ok for a spare in my husband's car, but I can't think of how uncomfortable she must be every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but it creates too much frustration for us","review":"We bought this seat for our second vehicle, so we didn't have to swap the original car seat back and forth. We had this seat for several weeks and have now returned it. It became too frustrating and I never felt that my daughter was truly safe in it.The belts were next to impossible to really tighten - the seat was always sliding a little. Also, the straps were always getting twisted.We have several Graco products and I love them all. I think that Graco products are very well made, durable, and safe. However, I think that this particular model of car/booster seat needs to go back to the designers and engineers for serious improvments.I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this \\"nice\\" seat!","review":"We bought this car seat for our 20 month old. He was outgrowing his other seat in height and almost in weight, so we needed to find something that would work from now on, and we are really pleased. He calls it his \\"nice\\" seat! He is so proud to have a new seat that he feels like a big boy in. I love the way the straps loosen and tighten. The push of a button and you can do either very easily. Our last car seat was a pain to loosen or tighten, so this is a nice change. With winter time coming I know this will be helpful when he has on a jacket, or thicker sweater. I also like the large openings for the seat belt to go through. We don't have LATCH in our van, so we have to use the seatbelt to secure the seat in place. Ii can actually fit my hand in the opening without scrapping my knuckles! :) I would recommend this seat to anyone looking for something reasonably priced, and easy and safe to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"holds up in an accident","review":"This seat was bought for my daughter about a year and a half ago, I have always loved it. My daughter is tall for her age, and she still has room in this seat. But most importantly why I love this seat, is because we were in a car accident, rear ended at about 40mph, the CAR SEAT DID NOT MOVE!! My daughter was not hurt in the accident, she was the only one. I would buy this same car seat for my next child and every other child that I know. A GREAT SEAT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy","review":"This is a very good Booster seat for growing kids.

I would definitly recommend this seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Car Seat, but very hard to tighten!!","review":"I am really happy with this car seat and my 2 year old loves it as well!! I bought this car seat in store. I went in with another car seat in mind, but after talking to the sales man, who is a car seat inspector, he recommended this car seat to me. He said that this car seat is the only car seat that he recommends buying (at least the ones in store) that were a car seat/booster combo. This one was the only one that had the EPS (the stuff found in bike helmets). He said that it could be life saving in a side inpact accident.The only problem that I have with this car seat is that it is very hard to tighten. I pull the strap with all of my might and it feels like it is not going anywhere. It takes a while for me to tighten the straps everytime he gets in the car seat.If the straps were easier to tighten, then I would give it 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult","review":"Positives1. Well padded2. Fit well in my car with the seatbelt. (2000 intrepid RT)Negatives1. my 33 pound 38 inch tall child looks smushed when i put him in the car seat. Add a winter jacket, he could barely sit back.2. When child sits in seat it is IMPOSSIBLE to tighten straps. This is due to the fact that there is no backing on the carseat and the weight of the child pushes the straps into the back og the seat creating too much friction.3. Very difficult latch installation.4. Cup holders are lousy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I have always been pleased with Graco products, but this car seat is terrible!

It slips forward and side to side. My husband is a highway patrol officer and has been trained on how to install car seats and he can't get it completley secure in either vehicle. We own 3 Britax car seats and this was our first purchase outside of Britax and I regret it. The seat belt on this vehicle also is one piece, which means that it gets lopsided and you have to pull on one side to try to get the top even. I will spend the money on Britax from now on. When you try to move a Britax after it's installed your vehicle will shake rather than the car seat. Nothing compares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you have a Ford Explorer!!!","review":"I purchased this booster seat a few months ago and have been very displeased. First, it is all but imposible to secure the booster seat in the rear of my husbands Explorer. The seat will tilt to one side even if the seat has been kneeled in by my 270 pound husband. We also noticed that our daughter was constantly putting her blankie or dollie to the side of the seat. After investigating we found that the side pleather pannels were hot as fire. This was the straw that broke the camels back for us. Not only was it unsafe to install but now the fabric was unsafe. We imediatly took it back to the store we purchased it from and have since bought a Brittax Parkway (100 times better and worth every extra penny we paid.). the Parkway offers better support. If you own this booster seat PLEASE be careful and check the pleather sides when its hot outside to avoid injury to your little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Narrow, Skimpy Shoulder Straps that Twist","review":"I tried this car seat a few times and found the straps very thin and narrow (of the 5-point Harness System, weak and flimsy. It tended to twist and get caught. I also did not think the seat was wide enough.My wife got frustrated and made me take it back. I tought the Britax Marathon and Britax Roundabout that we puchased had more padding and a better operating harness. The Graco was thin and is about what you would expect for the difference in price.Although the Britax products are much larger, there is no comparison product that works as smoothly on the Market. We have now gone through 5 car seats and the Britax Products are the best. My advice- spend the extra money for the Britax.Rob"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfy carseat!!","review":"I had been researching carseats for about a month, when this one came out. There weren't any reviews on it, but I decided to take a chance. Boy am I glad that I did. This is by far the most cushioned car seat that I have come across. I had no problems installing it in my car, or adjusing the straps. My son is 12mo., 31 in. tall and weighs only 21 lbs. The straps fit very snuggly against him , I don't understand why the other reviewer said they couldn't get the straps snug. The only complaint I could see, would be the wings. It has these two plastic tabs that slide into the slot where the straps come thru from. Does not stay in place very well, but this car seat fits so snug, that it really is not needed. Most excellent car seat especially for the price! I originally wanted a car seat that had the handle adjustments for the straps, but they cost about $80 more. Then I thought, how often do you need to adjust the straps? Not very often, so it wasn't a big deal to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once you have a Britax, nothing else will do","review":"We needed to moved our 3 year old from his Britax Roundabout to a convertible/booster. I liked the cushy padding and, of course, my son loved the cup holder. It seemed like a nice seat. I, like others, had issues with being able to tighten the straps properly. My car doesn't have LATCH, and I also found it difficult to get the seat secure enough. (Why doesn't this seat have a tether?) Even the moment I took it out of the box, I didn't feel it was as solid as the Britax. After having the seat in my car for a couple of months - and standing out in the cold Chicago weather for ten minutes each outing trying to get the straps tightened - I ordered the Britax Husky. Love it. We'll keep the CarGo for an extra."},{"rating":"1","title":"my child ate memory foam","review":"I loved the carseat for about a month. That is when my 2 year old daughter found that she could pick at the memory foam and eat it. Around the area where the lap belt would go through, if using seatbelt, the pad does not cover the memory foam. When a child sits in the seat the foam sticks out even more thus allowing the child to tear it to pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great car seat, I hate it as a booster","review":"I LOVED this one as a car seat, very secure. I have it about a year now and she has been using it without the harness and as a booster and I hate it. The belt straps arn't attached to the seat but the fabric which is only held to the seat with a few bands, I have NEVER, EVER, gotten more then a few blocks away before the belt comes out of the attachements because it's so flimsy that when she wiggles around or even just leans forward to look at something out the come. I thought it was just my child was to wiggle but after my friends child sat in my other one (I was stupid enough to buy 2 of these) the same thing happened to her son. I don't feel safe taking it on short trips, never mind the long ones. I wouldnt recommend it as a booster at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Compact","review":"This seat was bought to replace a Graco Comfort Sport. It was quickly returned once we sat our child in it. It was so narrow. She was scrunched in it. The buckle between the childs legs does not have a slot to move it out far enough, so basically she was sitting on the buckle piece. And when she sat in it you sit deep in the seat but the seat is elevated where the knees are. That had to somewhat be cutting off circulation. I couldn't imagine keeping her in that position for a two hour car ride. Cosco's line of booster seats are much more roomy. Everything other item of baby gear I own has been Graco (which I love) but this seat is just plain horrible. However, since it is so narrow it would be perfect for someone who has to put seats right next to each other..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat","review":"I love our new seat. My child sits in this for hours as we go on long road trips. The buckle that is between her legs is great because it is located further out and it doesn't rest underneath her. It is simple enought that she, at 3, can get in and buckle herself in, which is a big plus for anyone with more than one child. I also really like the fact that it has the harness and then it can be removed as she gets even older, so this will be our last car seat. The cup holder and \\"junk\\" caddy that are on either side is great too for her because she is able to have a drink but not spill it when she can no longer keep her eyes open. The only complaint I have is boosters in general are not as cushy as a regular car seat; however, this is true with most booster seats. This one does have the memory foam which is another reason we chose this seat over others. Overall, this is a good seat and I would recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of 4","review":"We have had this car seat for about 2 weeks and love it, I bought it for my 2 year old daughter. She had to move up from A britax, which we love, because my 6 month old had out grown his seat. She loves sitting in my older boys' booster seats but she is to small yet for them to fit her right. I have purchased many cars seats in the past, and have tried many booster seats and this one by far is the best I have found for a younger child. We dont have to worry about her head falling foward as with other seats.I do think they need to redo the cup holder idea, they fall of way to easy, but other than that we as parents love it and most important my 2 year old loves it. I would highly recomend this seat. For comfort and for price."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars with the harness, NO star with the seatbelt!","review":"This seat worked great when we used it with the harness. Very comfy, fabric held up great and my daughter liked the little pillow it came with...sometimes...When I began using, or should I say when I used it for the first time with the seatbelt, I went right into the house and began researching other booster seats. The belt positioner is a joke. It was impossible sometimes to even get it in, (the 3 times I used it) and forget about trying to exlain to other people who are not familiar with car seats how to even get the belt in the positioner. It is all together a bad idea. I do love graco and I am surprised at the way this car seat worked out. Maybe manufacturer's should just stick to a seat having one age and function, b/c it seems to me that every type of convertible car seat ends up being bad in one of the areas. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I find his book very interesting and informative in many ways. Most of it is very difficult to read because 1. John Cage is extremely intellectual, and 2. He is very avan garde, so some of the formats in which he writes in can be very complicated. I enjoy it being complicated though because there is something you can always figure out about it or just look into very closely. My favorite subject of this book are his journal/diary entries. They include entries of him away at master classes and the things that he talks about are humorous, great to know, and interesting to think about.

This video unfolds tantalizing bits and pieces of this master's career. It spans history from the days when he taught guitar lessons for $5.00 each (Steve Vai, another master guitarist was one of his students) through the early 90's.The movie is made up of interviews with Satriani, his peers, and his producers, interspersed with concert footage and music videos. Comic relief is provided by \\"interview\\" footage with Spinal Tap's guitarist.If you like excellent guitar work, if you worship creativity and excellence, if you simply want to get some clue as to how Joe works his magic with his axe, you need to own this movie. If, on the other hand, your taste in guitar is more firmly grounded in Juaquin Rodriguez or the Romeros, you'll be rather disappointed with this incredible Blues/Rockfest."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lot of fun to read aloud","review":"I heard this book being read on NPR and being a dog lover, I knew I would own it for myself.

The action was good and the discriptions of events were good, but beyond that there was nothing. It seems like he's trying to just write another book like another essay for a high schooler, not putting any thought into it and just focusing on the basics.

I know Jack Higgins is a great and successful author, but I am going to say I did not enjoy this book. It wasn't written poorly, but due to its paper-thin storyline, I wasn't impressed. The story is just a giant flashback. It begins with a group of Italians reviewing Paul Chavasse's file, and they are impressed by one of his missions. Higgins' then stretches this thin plot through 250 pages. Personally, I would've rather read the summary in Chavasse's file than have read \\"The Keys of Hell.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Good But Not Worth the Price","review":"The book starts off just like another book written by the author - only different names are used. The scenario, however is very much the same as one of Sean's novels. I like Higgins' books and have gone back and purchased every one in the Sean Dillon series. I felt cheated with this book when I noticed the Locations (pages?) only went to 2168 instead of >5000. It's more like the short stories that I pay 0.99 for.

There are a few times where she wants people to whip their head around, which hurt my neck, too. In my opinion, this might be a good DVD for people who have had dance experience, or have used other dance type DVDs, but this is not a good one for \\"beginners\\" as it states in the title.

I was sadly mistaken because evidently you need to know how to do the Salsa, Samba & Mambo before participating in this workout.

I've watched her on Fit TV, along with other instructors, but this workout wasn't for me as a newbie.Auntiec in Wisconsin"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT for beginners","review":"I bought this dvd because it says \\"for beginners.\\" I was disappointed and angry that I wasted my money and can't return an opened package. Ms. Grimes just starts dancing, with her team, but gives no specific instruction..., uses names that a beginner won't understand and goes into high speed aerobic exercise moves. Only someone with experience doing this type of exercise could call this a beginners routine. I expect instruction on a beginners tape and not an exhibit of what the instructor can do. It really does seem to be all about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"High energy fun... super fast pace","review":"Just did this workout for the first time today... Was I sweating? Yes. Moving? Yes. Heart pumping? Yes. Having fun? YES! It begins with a warm up that already has your heart going and introduces some of the moves you'll use later. During the dance section be ready because she goes fast. There are no slow-downs, or break-downs. It's a full dive in and dance from the very beginning. Would this be the best first dance DVD? Probably not. But if you're used to some of these moves, follow easily, or are willing to do it over and over until you get it, the this quick under 30 minute work out packs a real punch. There is a short cool down that wasn't quite long enough for me (hence the 4 stars) so I did some extra strechting after it was over. But MaDonna's energy is high and was very appealing to me, and despite some huffing and puffing I had fun making it to the end. I expect this DVD to become a favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Usually in \\"beginner\\" workout or dance CDs you are shown the basic steps first.

And the instructor doesn't really give much detail on how to do the steps...she just starts doing them. There's a warm up segment, a \\"workout\\", and then a cool down (three separate segments on the disc, with pauses). In the \\"workout\\", there are a lot of stops and starts...much like learning a dance in a dance class. It doesn't flow at all for a workout. And there are times when the cast messes up and they all sit there and laugh. I thought that was interuptive and very unprofessional. This might be an okay choice if you want to learn a few little mamba and salsa moves (they are all mixed together, so it's not good for learning a particular style of dance), but don't buy it if you're looking for a workout video."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for beginners","review":"the tape stated that it was for beginners so that's why i purchased it. i thought it would show ho to do the moves, thought it would be slower to catch on but it was full out fast paced dancing. i wouldn't recommend it for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good clean fun!","review":"This is a fun, easy to learn workout that will get your blood flowing. MaDonna has good energy and the other dancers add a nice variety. My only complaint: after doing the workout twice I was ready for some more variety.

I find that after doing a workout DVD for a few months, I get very bored with it and store it away for a long time. Not with this one! This DVD is not like working out at all. It's like being at a high-energy party with the most fun group of friends you can assemble. The music is good and the moves are easy, which motivates you to put more emphasis on your dance moves (and thus burn more calories). MaDonna is fun, friendly and motivating and the backup dancers have a great rapport with each other. Although the workout is shorter than most, I always work up a sweat and get my heart pumping. This DVD is a must for any workout collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"I've already given this away. It is described as \\"beginners\\" yet the instructor does not give any directions at all in regard to how to do the steps or what is coming next.

If you know all the steps in advance then this will work for you but that is hardly what one would expect from a beginners product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Moly! This is for beginners?","review":"I am a TRUE beginner. I've never done dance exercise - heck, never done dance anything. On this DVD, there is no breakdown on the moves.

More often than not, she's asking her dancers how they're doing. It would be much more helpful if she were queing rather than talking to the other dancers. The camera style doesn't help either, changing angles right when the instructor changes the routine and shooting from the hips up so, we can't follow what their feet are doing. Five minutes into this DVD I got so frustrated, I took it out of the DVD player and it is now destined to be a donation to my local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"I feel this video is not for beginners. They all looked like professional dancers. I kind of gave up after a while out OF frustration. I think I will stick with Denise Austin DVD's, they seem to be easier to follow, but kind of boring.

I have always been a good dancer and have always been told that. I know one or two simple Latin steps, but when I watched this video I was totally off key and pretty much got frustrated and turned it off after 15 minutes. #1, they go way too fast and don't review the steps well enough, for enough time. and #2 the camera person cuts off the dancers from the knees down in a lot of the scenes and therefore if you can not remember exactly where your feet are supposed to be going yet you can't watch the screen to get a clue. I suggest a few begging scenes in the DVD on each step so that during the video everyone may follow along easier AND the camera person should show Madonna's entire body throughout the DVD so everyone can follow along. I thought I would have no problem with this video, but feel like I just put $10 in the garbage disposal."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Fast","review":"I was excited to get this dvd, however; after trying to use it the first time though it was too fast for a beginner status.

This one fell short for the following reasons:* There is a lot of African influence and I was looking for more classical ballroom feel and style* It was too fast and intense for a beginner and there was no step guide for learning gradually* She criticizes her backup dancers during the routine and even stops moving at one point (while the backup dancers continue) due to some issue that I couldn't understand.

Why are these people giving free advertising to Apple products?I subscribe to it because it's the only PS3-centric magazine on the market, and it does contain quite a bit of info on the PS3 and, to a lesser extent, PSP. There's also more PSN coverage which is a good thing.Still, I keep getting frustrated reading in every issue how everyone and their grandma should get an iPhone. Man, Steve Jobs should have been our president."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I like these mags because I like to be current with the newest games coming out.

While the 360 has more people, the PS3 has more devoted fans. So, it goes without saying that their official magazine will share the same type of close knit community. The magazine itself is a monthly publication that has what you would expect, reviews, previews, blu-ray movie reviews, etc. The presentation though is where the magazine really shines. High glossy pictures, big pages, it looks nice. Compared to the 360's official magazine (which is also pretty good), it's miles ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mag you can trust","review":"PSM is the only mag i know to ever admit they underrated ICO.

As far as this magazine goes i give it 2 out of 5 stars. The do tend to give there own pennon and less facts more times then not. There are some good articles somtimes but hard to find.

The writing in PSM is concise and full of information, but it maintains a good sense of humour thoughout.PSM gets me excited about the mindblowing PS3 titles to come: Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy XIII, Grand Theft Auto 4 and more.

You can read for yourself the other negative reviews on here.To be honest, this was my first magazine subscription that I've ever bought through Amazon, and it's definitely going to be the last.

I was mistaken and I would not have done it had I known what I listed above.

The music is a series of musical portraits of various parts of the film. The film itself was an effort to bring to the United States the story of how Canada was helping the British war effort. The hope was that the United States would soon become an ally of Great Britain in its war against the Nazi's.

The PSD-210 would have fit my shower correctly, but I couldn't tell that, because the dimensions given for each part were useless.

(The two parts have the same inner diameter, but the PSD-210 has a larger outer diameter.)I wound up taking the old connector (or what remained of it) to a local plumbing supply house and they matched it with a PSD 210 from their stock.I like being able to order parts like this online, but the descriptions need to be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCarthy Is Correct","review":"This small tome, expanding upon his speech in the Senate, provides a wealth of documented information regarding General Marshall and the deleterious effects his mistaken eforts have wrought on the US and the enslaved citizens of China.A modern history of this subject with all the released information from the Venona files and the Soviet Union folded in would only enhance McCarthy's prescience in writing this book.This book does not charge Marshall with being a spy, nor a Soviet agent, nor a communist, nor a fellow traveler, but whatever leanings Marshall had and how he was influenced by the Communists and American Traitors that were in charge of formulating and influencing the US's foreign policies, especially in the far east, are strongly inferred in this book.This is a well written, well argued, and well documented book, that almost turns into a page turner and a one night read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Mystery Movie !","review":"Even though I own most of the \\"Poirot Offerings\\" starring David Suchet owing to my affinity for Agatha Christie's work,I still maintain that \\"Peter Ustinov\\" is by far more at home in \\"Poirot's\\" shoes as evident by his inimitable performences as the belgian eccentric/sleuth over the years.particularly in the \\"Death on the Nile\\"(1978).And having said that, the latest addition to A&E's Poirot caper of the same name featuring Suchet is unfortunately \\"Toothles and Meandering\\" at best.In short,If you already own the Original ( Ustinov )version,then don't even bother spending your hard-earned on this trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poirot should have detected this remake really Sucked.","review":"Really rushed and other than Suchet ... the acting was terrible by most of the cast.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noxious","review":"I certainly don't believe the Ustinov version is perfect (it's not), but the newer Suchet version is a disaster. How people think this is loyal to the book is beyond me. Maybe in form but not in substance. Characters who are well-developed in the book, like the Allertons, are made into completely repellent caricatures in the film. Much of the acting has a campy, brittle quality, like Noel Coward on a very off day. It's a shame, because this is one of Christie's best novels, both in terms of plot and character. Unfortunately, the director and screenwriters had little respect for Christie's novel. A total misfire, like the dreadful versions of Blue Train and Cards on the Table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death on the Nile","review":"This is a nice version of \\"Death on the Nile\\", although not as accurate as I would like.

I had a hard enough time with the 'time travelers', (I'd prefer it to be accurate and not fanciful), but when David hit Goliath in the head and blood spurted, it was a little unnerving and a little too gory.

They have been builders. They have been creators.\\" ~ Robert Fritz from \\"The Path of Least Resistance\\"The theme of Robert Fritz' brilliant book, \\"The Path of Least Resistance\\" can be summed up in three words: \\"Structure determines behavior.\\"Like you, before reading the book I had no idea what the heck that meant. Nor did I have any idea what \\"structural conflict\\" vs. \\"structural tension\\" was all about--let alone why creating structural tension is the core attribute of creative genius.As you gain an understanding of how structure determines behavior, you'll also gain a sense for why Fritz believes affirmations and willpower and all that other \\"positive thinking\\" stuff will never give you sustainable creative powers.For that? We need a whole new structure. And that's what Fritz great book helps us create."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Tools for Creating Your Life","review":"It's practical. It's basic. It works.This book showed up in the mid eighties... wish I had read it back then. Fritz presents user friendly techniques for creating your life, rather than solving your problems. He starts by referencing artists and I find that an excellent context because I associate art with creativity and imagination. Many self help books use a manager frame, which feels like a duty.Fritz doesn't offer much help around what to do when you get stuck in your creating process but there are other books for that. What does stand out, and gloriously so, are his simple tools for creating, particularly the whole idea of managing the structural tension between your vision and your current reality.I recommend the book to anyone who is tired of new age fluff and wants some practical help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convincing argument for open adoption","review":"This book is by adoptive parents who treat their new family in a humane way--without the secrets and lies of closed adoption.

This book changed my life after I read it. Like Nancy, I became pregnant in high school with the only reasonable alternative to be adoption. After speaking with a number of agencies, I decided that I wouldn't be able to place my child in the traditional, closed adoption. I loved the idea of open adoption because I could continue to see my son and keep in contact with him while continuing on with my own life. When he comes of age and understands what the situation is, I will be able to tell him why I made my decision and why I placed him. He won't question my love for him since I have played such an active role in his life. I understand that some people, birth parents as well as adoptive parents, may not agree or feel they could be a part of this type of relationship, but we think it works just fine for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an astonishing CD with something for everyone!!","review":"This CD is absolutely astonishing!!

The idea of an isolated Japan is a nice modernization of history, and has the level of political complexity that I usually appreciate in a movie. Unfortunately, that was about as far as it went for me with this film. All of the other details were trite and cliche, and too often the characters and the Type-A, military dialog are ripped right out of the typical action movie playbook. The umpteenth attempt at hardened, take-charge personalities that offer a glimmer of sensitivity is, at this point, dull characterization.

Not sure why reviewers even draw a similarity with Appleseed. The story is a little weak and ultimately forgettable, and it seems like a lot less time was spent designing the CGI when compared to Ex Machina.In all I wasn't too thrilled about the storyline and the CGI and animation were just \\"ok\\".

Not only will it be unhelpful as a tool to mastering the topics in the MCAT, it will be a hindrance because the topics are so poorly taught. The only good it does is that it provides an accurate outline of the scope of physics topics covered on the MCAT (and that information is free on the offical MCAT homepage). The explanations are very short, often incomplete, and sometimes outright incomprehensible. This is a book clearly not written by a person who understands the physics in a meaningful enough manner to teach it effectively.Because the MCAT is knowledge based, a person is better off simply knowing the material through and through. The outline of the topics within the scope of the MCAT and a good introductory physics textbook--written by people who have devoted their lives to the study and teaching of physics, will serve you much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Study with this book.","review":"I do not recommend this book. Not only it is poorly written, it will not give you the understanding you will need to do well on MCAT physics. This book is clearly not written by someone who REALLY understands physics.

As soon as I felt I was connecting with something said the plug for Eharmony was right there to distract me. The website pulls enough revenue, can't you just write a book and not mention the website?

The section on \\"keeping Your Cat Happy\\" shows ways to improve your scope's operation without spending a lot. This is stuff that works from dew shields to warning lights.

As the story unfolds and each character shines through, one is struck by the depth of this fantasy novel. Although the plot is developed around that which is constrained to the rein of fantasy, the characters are haunted by the very real concerns which plague teens. This book transports you to another time and place, governed by the laws of the mystical.

Married to an academic, and dissatisfied with being a housewife she attempts to fill her time by reading to residents at a retirement home. Her husband becomes very interested in the individual that Caroline is reading to, and steals a manuscript to further his research.The cynical disrespect and disregard that Caroline, her husband, and all the characters exhibit for ethics or pretense of social feeling is no doubt intended to amuse. Since her best friend is a hedgehog-fancier one cannot help but imagine that this is supposed to be a comedic story. Perhaps it is the distance in time (the book was published posthumously in 1986), but rather than humorous the characters are repellent, the plot depressing, the racism irritating. This is the type of book that might be interesting when published, but is quickly outmoded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly entertaining posthumous work","review":"Knowing that this book was cobbled together from drafts after Barbara Pym's death, I was not expecting An Academic Question to be anything special; I was consequently surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The book is set in the early 1970s in a provincial university town, not exactly classic Pym territory; however I was utterly enchanted to find myself unexpectedly in the landscape of my own childhood. Barbara Pym was an extraordinarily careful observer of human behaviour, and so much of this book rang true I nearly laughed out loud at several points. Yes, it is occasionally a little thin, but for an unfinished work it is still a great read, and the editorial work done after her death was obviously lovingly and skilfully done. It's a not the novel with which to to start exploring Barbara Pym's writing, but if you like her other books, you will definitely want to try this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Night Maman","review":"A small girl named Karin and her brother Marc get stuck in the German War.

WIZARD'S BANE is a delightful read, just the sort of book that got me interested in reading science fiction and fantasy in the first place.

Even if you're nothing like the main character, Wiz, I guarantee you've known someone like him. Just read the first few pages, and you won't be able to stop until you reach the end.

The Blu-ray Ultimate Edition is the one to own. The movie, created right around the time of the \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", creates a great atmosphere of terror... with enough graphic violence to satisfy the perverse desire for queasy feelings.

I thought it was pretty good, except on pages 94 and 95 she says we can make wraps out of smoked turkey breast or smoked salmon. Also liquid smoke. Since this is a healthy cookbook, I was surprised. Smoked foods are not good for you. She should have said sliced turkey breast or small slices of salmon, and not mentioned liquid smoke at all. So that is why I am giving it only 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"When I was eleven, I first got my hands on Terry Goodkind books from my brother. The first one being Wizard's First Rule was awesome! I loved it! Within months I started collecting the collections. I was reading the books pretty fast, but then I decided to take a break. While I was taking a break I couldn't help from reading the book, it is so addictive! Having read the whole collection of the Sword of truth(except the 6th one have to borrow that from my brother!)I believe this one is the best! It is very suspensful and fun to read! I am now in eighth grade and still love reading the Stone of Tears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth Shattering with a twist of Volcano!!","review":"I love how the book starts out right where it begins unlike other series. Terry gives excellent personal background where it is soo good you almost despise the Sisters! There is nothing like this book and all the others by Terry it seems that no matter what Kahlan and Richard just can't be at peace. It seems that excellent wording is the key and terry is in another plane of exsitance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Goodkind Does it again","review":"This is an AWESOME follow up to \\"Wizards First Rule\\". There is no doubt that Terry has set the bar a little higher for those that follow. This is a definate page turner. Again, the bad news: the book ends, the good news: he has a sequel to this one too. If you haven't already started reading Terry's books, start NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - loved it","review":"Wow ... I read the whole book (900+ pages) in about two weeks. It was so addicting, I just could not put the book down. Richard Cypher (Rahl) is one awesome dude! I really like how he thinks outside the box, and doesn't just follow the rules blindly. Awesome read."},{"rating":"1","title":"URRGHHHH!!!!","review":"I have read book number one in the series and I was very annoyed by all the perverted sex stuff in it (I have reviewed it too). I decided not to continue reading book number two, but I opened the book somewhere in the middle just to get an impression of how the book was. [...] He writes good and his books are exiting when they are meant to be, but I couldn't make myself read this book. It was almost a whole chapter just containing a woman (can't remember her name) torturing Richard (and it isn't just lashes of a whip!!!) at the same time as she loves him. That's just so [...] typical isn't it??People might say that i judge the book too early since I've just read five pages, but I don't think that Goodkind has changed his sex-and-young-boys fixed thinking. I think it's VERY strange that people have almost not reacted on this before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than the first one","review":"My oh my. This book is a complete waste of time and money. Even writing this review feels like that. WFR was not good, but SOT is really bad. I expected Goodkind to become better after his first novel, but was disappointed. I'm so sorry that I purchased all 4 Volumes of the series at once. Those of you who think that Jordan's Wheel of Time is a masterpiece will like it though. But let me tell you: Wheel of Time is not a masterpiece - not even a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Who is writing these reviews? Have they read any OTHER fantasy? Have they read Jordan, Martin, Tolkien? Have they read King's Dark Tower series?This book \\"borrows\\" so much material from Jordan it's almost ridiculous. This, in itself, is inexcusable, but even worse the story is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version Review","review":"Do not misunderstand my review of this novel. I love the book. The kindle version is another story. The conversion to ebook is filled with very distracting spelling errors and word conversions. The most noticeable being \\"than\\" is almost always translated as \\"that\\", \\"of\\" and \\"if\\", and many others. It may sound trivial, but it is very distracting as a reader to have to reread sentences and paragraphs to decipher the true meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"Best book i have read in a long time ,Terry goodkind is my favorite author,I cant wait to start the new book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible continuation of a great beginning!","review":"After attempting to read this book for the second time (7 years apart) I made it about 4 chapters further and just could not take one more word. Im truly not an uptight person, I enjoy a hot love-scene as much as the next person, but this, this is something else...The amount of rape and would be rape scene's in these books are just redicoulous, .....I guess that is all that men-who-are-not-Richard-or-Zed do in Goodkinds world. Seriously, when trying to add an element of horror to your story there is perhaps nothing wrong with using this theme, but when you rely on it for an entire book it just seems contrived after the 7th or 30th time. Sheeeshhh ....get creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY GRADE: C minus to C.","review":"A huge disappointment after the first novel. I got through about half of this novel (hundreds of pages) before I felt all the meandering of the main tale and the love story were making the tale bland. After my glowing review of his first book I reluctantly gave up on this one and the rest of the series. OVERALL GRADE: C minus to C; WHEN READ: 2001 (reviewed early April 2012)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle version is TERRIBLE!!","review":"I really love the book. It's just as good as the first one. It would be well written if it weren't riddled with spelling errors and missing words. Each Kindle \\"page\\" has at least 2 errors on it. Unbelievable! If anyone knows how to email the Kindle publisher I would be grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a sequel!!!!!","review":"Well i finished the wizards first rule and i didnt think the series could get any better. I soon found out i was wrong. This book is loaded with creative imagining. I was really impressed by this beautiful story. It caught me with the first page and wouldnt let go. This book deserves six stars. Absolutly wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sequel from Terry","review":"After reading Wizard's first rule, the expectations were very high. Stone of tears, almost stood up to those expectations, by creating a stronger bond between the reader and the characters. I felt as beeing in the story when I read it, and felt what the characters felt . Terry Goodkind manages to do the whole text into exciting reading, you fly through the text and the pages faster than you want to, not wanting the novel to end, you take your time at the end, and read the end ten times before you take another breath. Conclusion is that this was a sequel beyond my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good, bit still great.","review":"I thought the book was okay, just not as good as the first and fourth in the series. I have read it three times and, I admit, I did find a few plot holes. There even were parts that were a bore to read, but overall, I think the book was excellent. I don't think it will be one of the great literary classics of all time(of course TG probably didn't write them for that reason!). Also, there are those who constantly compare his work to that of Robert Jordan, Tolkien, and a few others....I have one thing to say; I may not have read any of the authors mentioned, but enough allready! And I also saw someone compare TG to Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis, of the Dragonlance Series. How can you?! They are by far, the best examples of authors of poor writing. I mean, their books were enjoyable, but had very juvenile concepts, and emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone of tears.. Soooo awesome!","review":"Great book! So much going on keeps the suspense from page one somehow. even better than the first book wizards first rule. Totally recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first, but still fine readin","review":"The saga continues in book 2. Not, perhaps, as gripping as the first book, but very well worth the read. Again, Goodkind combines some solid life lessons with a great fantasy story set in a world of his own creation.This entire series is not something you should miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone of Tears by Terry Goodkind","review":"I love the eBook. If you have seen the TV series \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" you will recognize the characters. The books are richer in detail and explains more about Khalin, Richard and Zed. Be prepared for a different storyline with the books than the TV show. Regardless, I still enjoyed reading book #2. Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great book inthe sword of truth series","review":"Have you ever read a series where you can just tell that the author is making it up as he goes along? This is NOT one of those. The detail of the storyline is fantastic. The characters are full and the storyline is impeccably thought out. I love the nuances and the small curves in the storyline that oftentime become huge plot twists! These are weighty tomes at almost 1000 pages in paperback form, and I looked forward to every word. Thanks to Mr. Goodkind for fulfilling this reader's want for a full-bodied detail rich, but never tedious book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sequel","review":"I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked 'Wizards First Rule' and this one didnt dissapoint either. The characters are very likeable and the story moves along at a good pace. With plenty of action and dialouge, this book lives up to the first of the series. The reason this was not a five star book, is the ending seemed rushed a little, wich doesnt matter that much because the journey is much more intriguing than the outcome. Also, I have heard alot of complaints about Goodkinds tendency to reflect on events already taken place in the previous books, and it starts in this book. I am almost done with the third book 'Blood of the Fold' and its continually becoming more frequent. This however is not a good enough reason to miss this series. If you love fantasy, than you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone of Tears","review":"If you liked Wizard's First Rule, you'll enjoy Stone of Tears as well. There is less action in this story than its predecessor, but Goodkind begins to fill in the gaps with more social commentary. Stone of Tears introduces loads of new characters as do the rest of the books in the Sword of Truth series. Much more thought provoking than First Rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Good bad good' or 'Good necessary plot stuff very good'","review":"The first book in the series is one of my top 21 books. (21? I've never felt a need to cap the number of books I have really enjoyed.) Even so, I never jumped to read the sequel. How would the followup followup? Would more to the story just be more to the story? Would it pull down my experience of the first book?Well I finally picked up the second and started to read. My exact rating would be 3.75. A 'good' opening got me interested.Then 200 pages into the book I was straining to be drawn into the story. I kept being left with the feeling of 'get on with it'. And suddenly it did! The last 700+ pages were (are) worth reading.Overall, not as good as the first book, but a good maybe very good followup; but unlike the first book that was good enough to stand on its own, I feel this book needs the next book to be good enough to lift this volume up. Which I now have to go buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first","review":"I disagree with the previous review in respect to it not being as good as the first. After reading the first I thought it was pretty good, but it felt to me like too much of a direct ripoff of the Wheel of Time. I wasn't sure I wanted to go on to the next book, but did. After the second, no doubt I'll keep reading, it was much better than the first. Felt more original, and more of the world was explained. In the first book new random stuff kept popping up and I just thought it was lazy writing, but in the second he's done better with the world building and the world and the characters are more interesting. Not to mention a more page turning story, at least for me. I am glad the next books look to be a little shorter, these huge bricks, also known as paperbacks, hurt my hands when trying to read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan without character or plot development","review":"Robert Jordan must be furious if he's read any of the Book of Truth series. It is astonishing how many similarities there are between Stone of Tears and Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Between the Aes Sedai and the Sisters of the Light. Between the Black Sedai and the Sisters of the Dark. Oh, I could go on, but why bother? Terry Goodkind's series just isn't worth the effort. Why? Because unlike Jordan, Goodkind has not told a real story. Instead of developing the plot, so that events that occur throughout the novel lead, inextricably, to the conclusion, Goodkind simply lays out events which finally and inexplicably run to the conclusion. Nor are the characters developed in the way that Jordan develops his, so that by the end of the second volume in the Wheel series, we understand who Rand, Mat, and the other characters are. Ultimately, Stone of Tears seemed amateurish and childish -- a not uncompelling story poorly told."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best book i have ever read","review":"When i began in this book i was hooked from page one. everything of the story is great, the characters the Bad guy its all very creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sword of truth series","review":"This series is really great! I'm on the fourth book at this point and look forward avidly to the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sequel","review":"An easier to read and darker alternative from the wheel of time for someone looking for an epic fantasy series to bite into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy novels","review":"I thought that I was the type of person who would never start reading fantasy novels, but after finishing Wizard's First Rule, I became hooked. Stone of Tears was simply a breathtaking continuation in the series. I highly recommend that you buy this book and hope that you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged book labeled \\"new\\"","review":"Without question the worst seller I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I purchased three books each from a different seller. The first was an older book but was obviously never read or opened. The second was a very new print. This one however was printed the same time as the first but there was a book mark in it, the spine was worn, the back of the book was bent and some of the page corners where folded or dented. Did I mention the moisture damage? So I asked for an actual new one. Turns it was the only book she had. I was told to send the book back in the packages that she sent the book in. Unfortunately the package she sent it in was a plastic bag from Fedex and no other packaging. It could not be resealed and I did not want her to blame me for any of the damage so I had to ship it back myself. I was only refunded my original purchase and was not refunded the return shipping nor has she responded to my last email."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal Series","review":"Really Enjoyed this book. Highly recommended. Usually get books from the library but am seriously considering buying this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what you would expect from Mr. Goodkind","review":"A lot longer book than I expected, but that makes it even better; even just a few chapters in, you find quality conflicts that you would expect to find closer to the end of the book. Goodkind shows you all of his best, and you aren't going to be let down by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little slow","review":"This book is long and slow reading compared to the 1st. Mostly because of the amount of new character developement done in this book. However it is definatly worth the read, and gets better near the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Kindle version experience","review":"I read a review that the e-version had been corrected and purchased this book yesterday, April 11, 2012. The title page just repeated ad nauseum. I deleted and downloaded several times without any improvement. Finally, returned the book for refund. I like the author and enjoyed Wizard's First Rule. Quality is becoming a major issue for me with downloads. Received my Kindle Fire for Christmas and did not anticipate the number of book problems I have experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I first read Wizard's First Rule in '96. I read the whole book in one sitting & immediately read The Stone of Tears. I'm an avid reader & sci-fi fantasy are my favorites. These two books have taken first place ever since & I've bought full size hardcovers of the entire series. Terry Goodkind has a wonderful way with the characters (Richard & Khalan) I can actually visualize each one & there entire journey. This is the battle of total good against total evil. Some parts even gave me chills. The love of each of there lives that nothing can destroy, but yet action adventure & tactics better than any movie.Oh yeah, I just fell in love with Gratch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt like a roller-coaster ride","review":"The longest part of a roller-coaster ride is the climb to the top. The majority of this book was the climb to the top. There was some good points. The part with Richard shooting with the mud people was interesting. The thng I didnt like about this book was when richard solved all of this problems in about 5 pages (not actually, that's the way it felt). But it was a pretty good sequel. I will still read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is a great read while waiting for Jordan's next offer. Like Jordon, it moved very quickly, the characters were intersting and well developed. The sequel is on my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Goodkind needs an editor","review":"Everyone knows the Wizards First Rule. This is MY first rule: Mr. Goodkind couldn't write a graceful, believable line of dialogue to save his soul from Darken Rahl. This is my second rule: Mr. Goodkind's editor is either so incompetent that he/she should be hung from the highest rafter of the Palace of the Prophet OR he/she has been collared and tortured to the extent he/she can no longer performed his/her duties. (Hasn't Mr. Goodkind ever learned to HINT?) Finally, my third rule: every character in this book is too stupid to escape the Keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest mistake of my reading life","review":"I hated the first book. However, I was promised the second book was much better. I was lied to. The subpoena's are currently being served.All bad jokes aside, The story was a bit better. There were moments of the book I really enjoyed. Yet there were also points in the story that made me feel like putting my head in an oven. The main character's slow transformation into a giant baby kicks into high gear in this book. His feigned respect for other people's feelings and beliefs that he had in the first book is thrown right out the window in the sequel. Richard spends most of the book threatening to kill innocent people while claiming he was in the right. The ending of the book seemed improvised and rushed to say the least. There were several segments of the plot that weren't expanded on nor explained. Terry Goodkind seemed set on keeping the book under the 1000 page mark.Please. Don't read this book without having first put a dunce cap over your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best stories I've ever read...","review":"To me, this story/series is second only to \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" it's a powerful story masterfully told, with vivid descriptions that make Richard's world come to life. An excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The further I got into the book, the harder it was to put down. The ending was great in that it gave you a sense of completion even though we know there are books to follow. I'm listening to TEMPLE OF THE WINDS on audio and I'm anxious for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Non Other - Better then the First!!!","review":"This Book is very enjoyable. It starts off from where it left off (after 2weeks) and the love of Richand and Kahlan is more intimate. The book is well paced. The dialoge is far better and you feel each charecter as if you know them all your life, I almost cried at the end of the book. Lke the last book it is realistic,if you want a good book to read then I suggest you get this book. But in order to really enjoy it I suggest you get Wizards First Rule andread that first. Now if you will excuse me. I am going to start reading the Blood Of the Fold. Hope it will be good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited ebook","review":"This review is about the digital, Kindle version of this book. It is so filled with errors it looks to have been edited by one who learned English as a second language. I describe the editing thus not to try to be funny but because of all the wrong verb tenses and a instances of singular nouns that should be plural or vice versa. Those are exactly the kind of errors you hear from non-native speakers of English. The print version that I read before was much cleaner. There is truly no excuse for this. To skimp on the quality of this ebook is particularly insulting when you consider that the Kindle version cost more than the paperback I purchased a few years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Kindle Edition","review":"The story is good. Just don't buy a Kindle version. The second and third books in the series, I have not read beyond that, are difficult to read because of simple, gross editing mistakes. Grammatical, spelling, punctuation and pagination errors throughout the book make it difficult to read and considerably less enjoyable despite a wonderful story. I love to read using a Kindle; I am just shocked at such a lack of quality control. I hope it is not a trend. So buy or borrow the books and enjoy a good story. Just don't get them on the Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously I want a refund","review":"I got Wizard's First Rule on Kindle and it was great.

What a pity,when the first book was quite good this book is just pure unfilteredcrude &@*!$. Terry plunders every cliche known to man and doesnt seem to have his own writing style. The way Kahlen and Richard kept apologising to each other at every available opportunity smacked to me of an author who can't write a decent line of dialog or of line wasting. Terry is deeply preoccupied with physical violence and uses it at every opportunity to shock the reader. The ending was the most contrived i've read in years! Terry conspires to forget about the plot for the whole book until the last 10 pages where he tries to squeeze it all in! It just doesn't work! Poor show Terry.

When I read this sequel, I felt like my everyday life was plain boring and the life of Richard Rahl and Kahlan Amnell is LIFE!!!

I own it in paperback already, but I have a tendency to re-read books several times, so I picked it up. BECAUSE FREE. Why wouldn't I?These books are decent. They start out pretty excellent and sort of decline from there.. but by the time you realize they're becoming less and less entertaining, you're already too invested to stop. At least, I was. So I finished them. All of them all the way up through Phantom and Confessor. (I can't remember which order those two were written in. It's been a year or two since I read any of them.)If you ask me, Goodkind gets a little preachy around the fourth or fifth book and the series sort of becomes a platform for the advocacy of communism, rather than an entertaining fantasy series. I was able to read through it, for the sake of his lesser-liked characters, and finish the series. I felt like I owed them that, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have read WOT, you already know the story.","review":"Let me start off by saying this book is pretty decent in it's own right. However, I have to agree with Jim's list of similarities. There are just way too many parallels for me to reccommend this book. It wouldn't surprise me if Goodkind wrote this book using Robert Jordan's notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't put it down","review":"In reading some of the other reviews, I noticed many comparisons with other authors and complaints of \\"borrowing\\" ideas. Balderdash, I say!!! Whoever had an original thought, anyway. The whole point of reading a fantasy book is to be entertained, not to look for flaws. Goodkind keeps me reading, something I cannot say for Jordan. I loved the Wheel of Time series until book six when it just flat bogged down. I haven't finished it yet. Goodkind keeps dragging me along with him through all the different adventures. I really enjoy his writing, the way he uses words. I haven't been disappointed by the characters at all. They don't do idiotic things just to keep the plot moving; the women are as strong as the men. It is a fantasy...lighten up...enjoy it for what it is, not what you would make it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved writing and a strong story.","review":"There was an improvement in the writing skill for this book, as I'd hoped he's seemed to have gotten a few of his writing kinks out and it was more enjoyable and less aggravating than the first book. I enjoyed the plot and characters, and thankfully after about the 12th time he finally stopped referring to Richard as a 'Rare person' every three pages.A few quirks still bother me, namely that he can't really get away from describing things certain ways. Kahlan's use of her powers are always described as 'thunder with no sound'. After the umpteenth time of reading that, alright already, I get what her power is like, you can shake it up a bit. Goodkind does this in other areas as well, but the strength and pace of his story makes up for it, and it was an enjoyable read all around. A solid 3 1/2 stars, I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"This was a better book than the 1st book. He uses extreme detail and allowed me to visualy see the story inside my head. Not many books can do that for me. Great job Terry!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks detail, not worth the money","review":"I bought this book hoping that it would be as wonderful as the Jordan series from which this author borrows heavily. What is so disappointing is that this book is merely a detailed outline that the author has failed to embellish. What I got from Jordan's books, Kathryn Rusch's Fey series and George R. R. Martin's books were fully developed characters and plots. I was able to fully immerse myself in a new world and believe that world existed. Goodkind, while writing a good yarn, has failed to make the characters interesting, has failed to describe the countryside. I have no idea what sort of trees grow there, what the mountains look like, what clothing the people wear, what the native food tastes like. I am left with a one-dimensional story that while promising, should never have been released without the detail to make it come alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grow up!","review":"Terry Goodkind is a morbid sadist who can write extremly well. This kind of book is great for some poeple, but I can totally see others making little mews of distaste. I thought it was a good book, and loved Gratch, but some of it really is overdone. You are all acting like not loving this book is sacriligous, or that everyone who did like this book is some kind of heathen. Grow up!

'Stone of Tears' is more engaging than 'First Rule.'This is a fantasy series that I have wholeheartedly embraced. So far, each of the two books are self-contained. Mr. Goodkind \\"finishes\\" each story without the cliffhanger ending, so you can enjoy each book on it's own merit. I eagerly anticipate the third book, \\"Blood of the Fold\\" and each book thereafter. If they are like the first two, and I believe they are even better, then this is a series I won't stop reading until I've read all the books back-to-back.Excellent. Outstanding read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Goodkind is a fraud!!!! I read the first book and hated the first three quarters, then the last quarter caught my interest. I then decided to buy the next book, and was thoroughly dissapointed. The main character Richard is a Jesus like character that can do no wrong. He is the god of every tribe he comes into contact with, he is the main focus of every prophesy ever written, he can do just about everything better than everyone else in the book. The dialogue is also very childish. I really would like the time I spent reading this garbage BACK!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"A friend loaned me this book because I loved Eragon, Elder and Brisinger. This is the worst book of the genre I have ever read in my life. I'm glad I didn't pay money for any of this series. I don't know what my friend was thinking! There is no comparing Paolini and Goodkind. Goodkind reeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sword of Truth","review":"The entire series is the best I have ever read. Mr. Goodkind's stories just seemed to draw me in. All the hardships and joys they went through made me fell as though I was actually in the story watching everything happen. I mean it was so good I thought I actually had all the sensory functions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Place to End the Series","review":"If you are looking for a way to kill a few days reading an below par book then this is the one to get. This author does his best to drag out a book that should be no long than 400-500 pages into one almost 1000. He does so by repeating lines of characters over and over, adding in openings for future books, and constantly describing Richard and Kahlan's feelings for each other.These books have the weakest plot line I have ever seen and left me with a bad taste in my mouth for wasting the 12hrs it took to read. The author seemed to focus more on side plots in order for him to write even more crappy books than on actually getting to the point and finishing this one.Dont read these books. Instead look into George R.R. Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"They publish books that are this bad?","review":"This book was horrible. I'd say it's even worse than the first book, but that's pointless. Goodkind doesn't have a single original thing in this book-- characters, plot twists, bad guys. The violence is just too much to be believed, the writing is the worst I've ever read, and the plot... well, that is even worse than his previous novel. I'm still hitting myself over the head for making myself READ this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, you're right...","review":"Goodkind is balderdash. Aside from not having anyideas of his own, he can't write fit for s**t.Nor can he plot, nor can be build characters. Some day, all these teenagers who love him will (hopefully) grow up and see how utterly stupid Goodkind's books are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abundant Typos","review":"This is an excellent book. It is very well written and the story pulls you in. The only trouble with this book is that there are an overwhelming number of typos. Every single instance of 'than' is replaced with 'that'. Incorrect usage of a/an is common and extra or missing words are on almost every single page. It is incredibly jarring to be reading and encounter a few (1-5) typos per book. This is unacceptable. The only reason I gave two stars was because it is otherwise very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stole ideas from Robert Jordan","review":"TG blatantly stole from WOT. The example are legion. To begin with, there is the striking similarity between female wielders of power, the Aes Sedai and the Sisters of the Light. Plus, each has a dark, secret sect amongst them: Black Ajah vs. Sisters of the Dark. There is also the fact that male users of the power suffer and eventually die if they don't find ways to get their power under control. Add to this, Stone of Tear vs. Stone of Tears, the use of collars to subdue magic use, Caracarn vs. Caharan, sword forms used by blade wielders, ageless female users of the Power, etc. Oh, and don't forget Children of the Light vs. Blood of the Fold.It is actually patent and obvious when you look at publication dates that Goodkind ripped off many concepts and terms from Jordan, nearly whole cloth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first","review":"The story is not as well weaved and reads somewhat like a romance novel...where the last story left off with the hero more confident he is plunged for most of the book into tired whining about relationship issues. Instead of wasting time with the author should have connected all the sub-story lines together. I am undecided if I will read more in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much different than the first one","review":"4.5 stars. This book was much different than the first for me. In the first book, I was struggling to feel Richard's inner struggle with his new role as Seeker and hero. However in this book, I felt his conflict much more intensely which I liked. In the first book, Richard was a little to nieve for me but in this book I felt he was more mature and had grown as a character.When I picked this book up, I didn't expect it to be as long as it was (900+). The first book was roughly 500 pages so this was a huge jump in length but I thought it was appropriate because a lot happens in this book. The length didn't bother me but it did take me a while to get through.Overall this book had a decidedly darker feel to it. It was more about self acceptance and then of course the character conflicts and their inner struggles were interesting and complex. A enjoyable read for sure!See my full review here: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This novel is utter and complete garbage. After 600 pages of wading through waist-high piles of raped corpses, I wanted the Keeper of the Underworld to destroy everything just to make it stop. The story drags through the death and destruction until the very end where everything is suddenly resolved in slam-bang fiesta of Spielburgian special effects and the book is over before you figure out what happened. The subplot with the conflict between the Ai'Sedai... I mean Sisters of the Light and Dark was briefly interesting, but the rampaging stupidity of the Sisters of the Light had me rooting for the Dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version Stinks","review":"The rating for this book is for the Kindle version only. Do NOT get the Kindle version of this book. The formatting problems make this version worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stolen ideas still can't make the grade","review":"I have been a long time fan of the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan and also of Goodkind's 1st book in this series, Wizard's First Rule. Imagine my suprise when I picked up this novel expecting another smash hit and instead got Jordan re-runs! Every detail matches Jordan's books but with different names, especially the final sequence with the dark sisters-almost word for word with a specific part in the Wheel of Time books. I can't believe that there isn't a lawsuit in progress over this. I have never been so disappointed in my life. This series started out very strong and then this. What a waste of good talent. People...read Robert Jordan-at least his characters are powerful, beautifully written and ORIGINAL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage and 1/2","review":"Guess old Terry didn't learn his lessonwith the first book: he can't write as wellas a monkey could in his position. He really needs some grammar and style courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series, Kindle Versions Need Proofreading!","review":"I own these books in paperback, and have read them several times. Now that I have my Kindle, I'm purchasing them and re-reading them again.... But whooo-eeeee, does the Kindle version need to be edited! I can't believe the number of mistakes! The first book wasn't too bad, the second book was horrendous, and just starting the third book, it looks about the same. Seriously, if someone wants to hire me, I'd be happy to fix these! This series is too good to let these bad editions be out in Kindle edition.....shame, shame! Love the series, but the mistakes in the Kindle version really take away from the enjoyment when reading it.I honestly have no idea what rating to give this! Giving it a one because of bad editing (would give it a zero because of that if I could), but the books themselves are all four or five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did not disappoint!","review":"This book can be at times verbose. It will not disappoint you though if you stick with it. I look forward to book three. After a long day at work this book gave me back my sanity. I love the characters in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"non stop badassery","review":"my FAVORITE of the series.nonstop orgies of epic and violence.and always a hint of romance and perseverance...all the books seem to have a positive message."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to proof reading?","review":"The story was fantastic I liked the first book of the series, but it is a very hard read when the, they, them, or a, am, an are mixed up in the writing of the story. At times I would have to read a sentence 2 or 3 times to get the point. I do hope there is a rewrite of this book in the future it has a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"E X C E L L E N T !","review":"I am a fan of Terry Goodkind and all his wonderful books, I was eager to review his work, hoping to encourage future would be readers to get themselves a copy. However I was most dismayed when I found other reviews were not so glowing.Reviewers who have offered their own opinions about the Sword of Truth series, have been cut to pieces personally, targets because another person did not agree with what another has written. Whether for or against the series, I feel that reviews should be limited to the book concerned and not with the person writing the review, we are all intitled to our own opinion.So to end on a positive note I Loved Stone of Tears, sharing the experience of following Richard and Kahlan through their many adventures, triumphs and tragedies, my favourite character would have to be Gratch, wish I had a Gar. Get a copy whether you buy or borrow it, READ STONE OF TEARS and make up your own mind! ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT NEW! IT'S DAMAGED!","review":"I ordered a book that was labeled new. I paid full price for this book plus shipping and handling. When I received the book I noticed a black ink blemish stamped on the outside of the pages at the top of the book. However, the book is otherwise in good condition. I'm very disappointed I paid full price for a book with an ink blemish on the outside pages at the top of my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"If I could have got by with giving this book a rating below one star, I would have. The book isn't worth the time of day. It is drivel...and actually, if I could have got by with a one word review, I would have written \\"drivel\\" and nothing more. I'd really like my $8+ back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was awful!","review":"I'm sorry but this book left little to be read. There was no suspense in the book at all because they kept talking about the \\"prophecies\\" and you knew exactly what was going to happen. There are a few scenerios that are extremely sick in theme and should have been left out. also, Richard and Kalan should have starred in a Harlequin Romance after this was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!!!","review":"Disgusting. This is a total-ripoff of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, which wasn't that great in the first place. Sisters of the Light? Try Aes Sedai, or Children of the Light? What about Sisters of the Dark? Black Aes Sedai, as another reviewer pointed out. Chase is pretty much the warder Lan, and Moraine Sedai is none other than our very own Kahlan Amnell! Sure, I liked Richard in this book, but I thought he was just as good when he was Rand's \\"father\\", Tam. Not worth the time or money. Don't read unless you're borrowing it from a friend and you plan on burning it. Even Ba'alzamon was a better force of evil than the Keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid is as stupid writes","review":"Don't waste time on Goodkind--read everything else hecopies from: Jordan, Eddings, Lucas, Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher errors in Kindle Format destroys a great series of books.","review":"I own the paper back books of the entire Sword of Truth series and beyond. The books are absolutely some of my favorites. That is the BOOKS and not the kindle issue. Error after Error after Error. Spelling mistakes and mistakes in wrong words used greatly annoys me, seeing that these errors happen several times per page. It disrupts the flow of reading. These errors were not made in the paper back books, they were made during the conversion to Kindle. Whomever proof read before publishing obviously was not interested in there job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put this book down","review":"I just finished WFR, and had to start reading this immediately. Since I had been introduced to the series from watching Legend of the Seeker, I knew that the TV series grabbed from all over the books, and was eager to see how things played out in the novel. To my surprise, almost all of this was different than the second season of the TV show, and that was a pleasant surprise. It's a shame that the fans of the books didn't support the TV show - because for anyone who started with the TV show and then read the books afterwards, it's like having Goodkind's world expanded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birds of a Feather...","review":"The only thing more saddening than Goodkind's abysmal writing style, unrealistic and childish world and stereotypical characters seems to be the apparent legions of fans who proclaim him as the best thing since sliced bread (which, I suppose, would be correct if that is your perspective. Sigh. I just hope no other publishers will put forth similar drivel to cash in on the indiscriminate market of escapist pulp fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you guys kidding?","review":"Only by sheer force of will (OK, and skipping pages here and there) did I manage to slog my way though this 100 page novelette. 100 pages -- what is he talking about? Well if a real editor got hold of this and did his job, that's all that would be left. Ok Terry is creative, he thought of all that filler between that start and end of the book, but did any of it really make sense? Was there any flow? Was it really believable? Did all the whining give anyone else a headache?This would be a great kids book, except he forgot to take the dirty parts out. Happy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is NO God!","review":"There is NO God, and this book prooves it! If there was then he would fling Mr. Goodkind and his publishers into the fiery hell they so richly deserve! This book is the most atrocious use of the English language that has ever been. I feel the need to switch to a different tongue simply because Mr. Goodkind speaks this one. The writing is infantile, the plots absurd, and the eloqution terrible. Mr. Goodkind, go check your report cards, I'm pretty sure you'll find a failing grade from your 2nd grad english teacher. Read this if you want to feel horribly ill."},{"rating":"1","title":"cliche, boring, stiff etc","review":"Well, I read the first in this series years ago, and tried reading this one right afterwards. I started and was disgusted with it. I for one do not like the neverending list of baddies that suddenly crop up in the beginning of each new book. The characters seem fairly stupid to me, and even though they have all these powers and gifts, they cant seem to ever use them to advantage. Also there are so many things ripped from other recent fantasy, very blatantly I might add(a silver collar that controls magic with no visible clasp... um is it just me or is that a direct rip off of the collar thing in Wheel of Time?) I just put it down in disgust after a few hundred pages, but thats just me. I know fantasy 'borrows' often one from another, but this is just copying. etc etc, I dont really see how so many people rate it so well, Proceed with Caution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, ponderous and pointless","review":"Is this only the second book in the series? Feels like it was written 1000 times before, only better, and by better writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah","review":"Great book FROM A GREAT AUTHOR!! Gotta write more words just to be able to read it though. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone of Tears","review":"I love this author. He has the best of imaginations, the writing is clear, crisp and positive. I am now on book five of the series, and can't put them down. I got my mother hooked on the books too. I found her at two am still reading. ENJOY ENJOY. You will not regret reading a Terry Goodkind book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I'm hooked. The story is great, if drawn out in some spots. You feel you really know the characters after the first book! My biggest problem with book two, on my Kindle, is the number of publishing errors per page! Wish Amazon had worked to resolve those errors, made the reading just a little aggravating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little Heavy on the Torture Descriptions","review":"While the story remains intriguing, the lengthy detail of torture was a little much for me - and I'm not usually one to shy away from violence. Ended up skimming and then skipping a couple of torture scenes because I had the picture 20 pages before the description stopped."},{"rating":"2","title":"not g-rated","review":"I started reading the \\"Sword of Truth\\" series after watching \\"The Legend of the Seeker\\" on TV. The series was PG, maybe PG13 for some episodes. The books are R. Great story, great characters, easy to pick up and not put down, but very graphic brutality, gore, and rape. A few cursewords also. I just wanted to make this clear for any parents ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragons, sorceresses, immense battles!!!","review":"This novel contains some of the best aspects of epic fantasy. Both Kahlan & Richard (the main characters) are even better in this novel. They face many challenges but prove themselves as worthy to them. This is a great book! And it is one of Goodkind's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first, but still great","review":"Yes, Goodkind could indeed spare us some of the graphic details, but at least he isn't as bad as Steven King. But this book still scores high points on plot, setting and characterization. The reader has no trouble caring about Richard, Kahlan or their friends and is quickly drawn into what they are involved in. Goodkind has great skill with his characterizations! The little girl's point of view is wonderfully done! Don't stop reading this series yet! It is good and the plots are very very good! Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fast paced and enthralling","review":"I love this series.Although this is not my favorite book of the series because there was alot of focus on the one city; Goodkind manages to keep the reader enthralled. I can never put these books down."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the Same","review":"Book 2 of The Sword of Truth follows squarely in the footsteps of the first. If you loved the first book, you'll probably love this one. If, like me, you thought that the first one was a generic heroic fantasy pastiche with lots of pointless cruelty thrown in, you'll despise this one too.The sad thing is that Goodkind has a fair amount of talent at jerking reactions out of people. I kept reading because I *did* become involved with the characters, and I kept hoping the overall narrative structure would go someplace interesting.Word to the wise: It doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better then Wizards First Rule","review":"Stone of Tears is a great sequel. I read the first book and wasn't impressed with Goodkind's writing; however, I loved the characters and the idea behind the series so I decided to keep reading them.This book exceded my expectations. It seemed like Goodkind's writing improved alot, maybe it was just good editing. Anyway, the character devlopement was throughly enjoyable and storyline progress seems to go at a perfect pace.One thing I didn't like was in the beginning of the book everyone seems to cry, about everything, all the time. Fortunately that pattern didn't continue after the first 100 pages so I was happy.If you liked the first book or just thought it was OK then I still recommend giving the second book a chance. I thought it was much better then the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Energizer...","review":"After a great book like Wizard's First Rule, Terry Goodkind disappoints with this 1000 page flop. It seems that Goodkind stretched the novel to it's limits with about 700 pages. He beat around the bush with lots of bull with them going here and there, and not actually doing what was important. Kahlan was especially disappointing. When in need of figuring how to fix the viel, saving 5000 men means nothing when the world is at stake. I was sorrily upset with this 980 page book. I expected something more than maybe 250 pages of useful writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reading","review":"I enjoyed 'Wizard's First Rule' but not this subsequent attempt at writing. The author's style bears remarkable similarity to that of Robert Jordan. Also, the author seems to revel in the idea that genocide and rape offer good plot intrigue. Indeed, most of the suspense in this work can be traced to whether the lead character is to be imminently defiled. This book has left me perturbed as to the author's intentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this one.","review":"The first book of this series wasn't too bad. That's why I read the second one. I was extremely disappointed with this book. This series is turning out to be a very poor and polluted copy of The Wheel of Time. The non-stop violent and perverted sex is enough to make you vomit. Needless to say, I won't be wasting any more of my time or money on this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars + Tolkien + Eddings + Jordan = Goodkind","review":"I can forgive him for copying Tolkien cause every fantasyauthor does it. But Star Wars, Eddings AND Jordan!!?? Thisguy should be sued. Bad guy is good guys father...Sisters of Light and Dark = Aes Sedai...collars to control powers... good guy is a powerful wizard but doesn't want to be...ad nauseum. Can't Goodkind come up with ANYTHING original?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better.","review":"This book was boring. The first few chapters kept my attention but soon I was getting tired of reading Richard and Khalan cry again and again. in fact it was rather annoying. All they seemed to do was whine which made me wonder what they were. Powerful heroes of this story plot or helpless children who feel the need to moan about everything from spilled water to death. I expected MUCH more from this book but it just turned out to be a very big dissappointment. I don't even bother to read any of Goodkind's novels anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not bear to finish this one....","review":"I really enjoyed the first volume in this series. There were one or two places where I winced at the obvious \\"borrowing\\" of characters and concepts from other fantasy series, but there was a lot of creativity there to counterbalance those minor lapses.I cannot say the same about this second volume. I was shocked at concept after concept that appeared to have been lifted directly from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, shifted slightly in context, then placed into Goodkind's storyline.Eventually I became too distracted by the large amounts of \\"borrowed\\" material to be able to enjoy the creative and original aspects of the story (which were less in evidence here than in the first volume), so I am sending this one off to the used book store -- unfinished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second in Series - written well","review":"Terry Goodkind continued his Sword of Truth series and the book is good. Be aware that the Kindle version of this book has a flaw - does not display in the color mode white letters-on black background. For some reason - it works correctly on the Kindle applications on the computer, iPad, or iPhone - but not on the Kindle Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Brilliant effort By GoodKind","review":"I noticed somebody giving a review on this after reading 1/3 the book. Such a review should be given only 1/3rd its weight in value in my opinion. First of, the so called \\"sexual situations\\" are directed at adults. Goodkind say's he writes these books with adults in mind. If there is so much evil in these fantasy type stories, its only common place that such gory sex acts might exist too. I don't have a problem with that. If the reviewer continued reading, he'd know the Sisters of Light are nothing like the Aes Sedai of Jordans world. In conclusion, this is a fabulous tale, and I give it 5 stars. I have read all the books in this series and their wonderful. Each book is nicely concluded and we're not kept hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Errors to Make an Enjoyable Read","review":"I have read the previous hard and soft copy reprinting(s) but have never been so embarassed for a publisher as during my time reading the kindle version of this novel. Nearly every page contains errors such as duplicate words (as as, to to, etc.) as well as errors such as I instead of it, or you instead of your. The proof reader should be shot (or at least look for a different line of work)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read fanfiction with less errors...","review":"I would give the novel itself four stars. Not as good as Wizard's First Rule, but still quite decent.The kindle version, however, should get zero stars. The amount of errors in the book is just... laughable. I counted roughly FIFTY grammatical and spelling mistakes scattered around, along with an entire section completely out of place. Obviously, there was no proofreading done whatsoever. The frequency of such errors became distracting after a while, and I spent more time marking the mistakes than I did concentrating on the actual plot.Honestly, I have seen better care taken with fanfiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrowing from myth and legend","review":"But Goodkind didn't borrow from any of thosemythologies: he borrowed from someone whoborrowed from someone who borrowed from the actual legends. You can tell just by his stuff that Goodkind has never actually read the old myths and is simply coasting through the territory of others. There's a word for writers like that: hack."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pain Continues in Book 2","review":"Stone of Tears continues where the first book left off. The style is pretty much the same, only (even) slower. I was hoping this would be better than the first, but it was even worse. If you liked the first book, then you will probably like this one too. Its just as amateurish as The Wizard's First Rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind = Nausea","review":"\\"Oh, I love you, Kahlan,\\" - \\"Oh, I love you, Richard!\\"Jeesh. Make me puke while you're at it, Terry. Thisbook was written mostly for horny teenagers and has little for the mature pallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"...And I thought he might improve!","review":"I thought Goodkind might improve on his second book--but, ifanything, he's gotten worse: the storyline is even morepredictable than in the first, the characters have become the Lords of Cliche (as if they could have gotten any thinner), and the style is even more bloated and irrelevent. It's as if he sat down and TRIED to write a book with every contrived device any fantasy author has ever put down on the page--as is, without making them his own in any way. A real master of low-grade hackmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth anything","review":"I've purchased informative, worthwhile digital downloads from Amazone before, but this isn't one of them.This is totally worthless. I expected a review of Microsoft's CRM product. Instead, the \\"article\\" barely filled one browser screen, and was little more than a typical press release of new products in the pipeline.Don't bother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for the Serious Buddhist","review":"This book provides a very readable English translation of some of the ancient discourses. In my opinion, these discourses are not the most accessible things to read for the \\"dabblers\\" in Buddhism, partly because of the repetitive nature of some of the discourses and partly because of the focus on enlightenment as the ultimate goal. The translators have done what is possible to reduce the repetitiveness by eliminating some of the word for word duplication in the text.I purchased the hardback version (not the on-line one) and the quality of the book itself, the paper, etc., is very good.I would definitely recommend the book for anyone serious enough to want to know the teachings of the historical Buddha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the Kindle version!","review":"I was so excited to get this book on my Kindle until I discovered that the page numbers are not available. When you are in a class and everybody is instructed to turn to a certain page - you will be out of luck. What's worse? No page numbers for the index?!?! How awful! Over 1400 pages and you cannot find your way around easily.This wonderful book needs to be fully enjoyed in the hard-cover edition..."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE INVESTMENT FOR BUDDHISTS","review":"This is part of a greater series, but it is an essential book for Buddhists to have. It is all the middle discourses as aggregated by the monks. While we talk about the suttas and stories that frame the Buddhist mindset, usually they are third party analogs or commentary. This is the direct teachings of the Buddha and written in a very enjoyable prose. I read a chapter every night and go to sleep with inspiration for the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition - no index, no page numbers","review":"While the paper hard-copy of this book deserves 5 stars, the kindle edition is a one star job.The index lacks page numbers or links to the relevant suttas. So basically the four extensive indexes are now mere lists of words, pointing nowhere. This is not Amazon's fault, it is Wisdom Publications just slapping their book into a cheap ebook creator and hitting \\"convert\\".But in a book more than 1400 pages long an index is pretty important, and at this price kindle users should expect more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, inspiring -- an amazaing book!","review":"David Bornstein captures the spirit, determination and passion of social entrepreneurs from all around the globe.I was especially delighted to read about my friend and mentor Bill Drayton, of the Ashoka Foundation.

The book is really not so much about changing the world, and more about one organization in particular. In addition to focusing on an organization, I find that the stories of the people *in* the organization take up as much of the book as actual stories about people they've found who have made or are making a difference in the world. It's not necessarily bad-there are plenty of inspiring people and stories to motivate you. It just takes the book a long time to get to them and seems to deviate often."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring book, worthy of the title.","review":"Mr. Bornstein's book brought dreams out of me that were just ready to be born. \\"How to Change the World\\" is a collection of powerful stories of people who had the initiative to stand up with their ideas and make effective, dramatic changes to their communities. And by doing so, they helped others in other communities find ways to do the same.It is this entrepreneurial spirit that *will* change the world, for we all can change the world if we find new ways to look at recurring problems. It is possible, and it's not just optimism I'm speaking of. True desire and will to change will bring change.Thank you, Mr. Bornstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual Grisham","review":"I loved The Painted House and A Time To Kill but those were fiction.

I was disappointed that Grishman let readers know the fate of Fritz and Williamson near the beginning so the story was a bit anticlimactic. However it is still a fascinating well written story. I have not been able to develop a definitive opinion on the death penalty until now. It opened my eyes to some of the injustices of the legal system. Like everyone else I knew it was flawed but The Innocent Man made those flaws really sink in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 5-legged dog!","review":"It's amazing how many people still today can be duped and will believe Grisham because he's Grisham, a novelist, not an investigative reporter. If you call a 'dog's tail a leg, it doesn't make it a 5-legged dog; and, if you call it non-fiction, it doesn't make it non-fiction'. It may be non-fiction couched in many lies to help support a certain agenda, eg., anti-death penalty or to sell books...or an historical novel. One thing is certain: this is a one-sided novel. Do yourself a favor and take a look at the DA, Bill Peterson's, website for another, more credible view!"},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst book by far","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books, and am a big fan. This by far is his worst book. Although you could tell he spent a lot of time researching for this book, it is SO BORING. The detail he goes into is excruciating. You can easily read 10 pages and 1) feel like you read 50 and 2) realized you could have easily just skipped those pages.

The author simply repeats the same information over and over again in slightly different ways.

I've convinced I missed nothing important. I can find no fault with Mr. Grisham's handling of the subject matter, although it does seem a bit long-winded, and as always, his writing is impeccable (which is why I gave the book 2 stars).

This one was a huge dissapointment. It almost appears that Grisham first started to research this character in order to write a similar type fiction novel he is so famous for, then changed his mind and submitted his notes for publication. It was a \\"60 Minutes\\" type report that certainly didn't help to advance his writing career. It's been a long time since his last novel, his fans were anticipating another fine fictional thriller, and Grisham failed to deliver. Why does success lead people to think they can forget \\"who brought them to the dance?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a legitimate non-fiction book","review":"While the topic of this book is worthy of being exposed to the public, Grisham's writing is clearly biased to put the investigation and prosecution of the Innocent Man in the worst possible light. His writing is full of his, or other's opinions, and he does not just stick to the facts. It is obvious that he has attempted to sensationalize the event, rather than just honestly report the events and the facts of the case. There is no bibliography to record his sources and the reader has to just take his word for it regarding where he got his information. This is not how this subject should have been reported, nor is it the approach that should be taken when writing non-fiction. My impression of the book is that Grisham is trying harder to make a political statement regarding law enforcement than trying to write an actual, legitmate, non-fiction book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNORE!!!","review":"This book was so unbelievably boring that I had to struggle to get through it. It just went on and on, blah, blah, blah! The main character in the book was so unlikeable that I didn't even really care whether or not he was wrongfully accused. The only one I felt sorry for was his sister who seemed to suffer the most. Don't buy this book. It's really lousy. If you want a good true crime book try \\"Small Sacrifices\\" by Ann Rule, which is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Grisham is definitely not Truman Capote, Capote even made us feel sorry for the killers.

Although the story could have been thought provoking, I found the writing to be bland and unexciting. It was just one fact after another.Even though Ron Williamson had a mental illness and a tough life, Mr. Grisham failed to make me feel sorry for him or, for that matter, feel anything for him. I've read all his fiction books and they are always a page turner. Grisham needs to stick to what he knows!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary","review":"This is Grisham's first non-fiction book. If I hadn't seen that on the cover, I wouldn't have believed it. This is story of a man, Ron Williamson, and his alleged accomplice, Dennis Fritz, both wrongly accused of rape and murder in a small Oklahoma town. The local police and judges, as well as the state and federal systems, all rushed to justice to convict someone and failed to look past their noses to find the real killer. The ineptness of everyone at every level is disgusting and unbelievable...the stuff of fiction. After years on death row, Williamson was a physical and mental mess, but he finally got help from the Indigent Defense System, a group of legal eagles who help indigent, wrongly accused inmates.It's any eye-opening story; you aren't necessarily innocent until proven guilty in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Read!","review":"Usually, I prefer to read fiction, but I found myself hooked on this book from the opening pages. It concerns the wrongful conviction of Ron Williamson, a former baseball player, fallen on hard times, for the murder of waitress Debbie Carter.The book gives a great insight into the small Oklahoma town of Ada, where the crime took place, and how the local police, and District Attorney, were hell bent on getting a conviction for the murder.There is also, great detail given to the trial, and Ron's life on Death Row, but it always stays interesting, throughout. If this book was fiction, I would have found it a great read, but as it is factual, it makes even more compelling reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"I have long been a fan of John Grisham's books, but this one really kept me riveted -- I felt so emotionally involved.

I knew it would be different, since it is non-fiction. I can hardly put it down. It arouses in me such a myriad of emotions - shock, pity, anger, disbelief, hopelessness - toward the \\"innocent man,\\" his family, the victim, her family, prosecutors, judges, law enforcement officers, inmates.

In my opinion Mr. Grisham should be applauded for educating the public on how our legal system can go terribly hay-wired. The dominance of this book takes the reader on a journey into how ordinary people can have their lives ruined by a miscarriage of justice.

It is a Pandora's Box, because justice has been steadily eroded and it seems there are way too many innocent people in prison either by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or because prosecutors and police seek successful prosecutions or plea bargains to the detriment of truth. Another book to look at is The Tyranny of Good Intentions: How Prosecutors and Law Enforcement Are Trampling the Constitution in the Name of Justice, by Paul Craig Roberts and Lawrence M. Stratton.

It was only out of my enjoying previous books by Grisham that I even read as far as I did. About 175 pages into it, reading every word as I do, I could not do it any longer; it was just too boring. I just read a few paragraphs through the last half and looked at the pictures, which was the best part of the book. Yes this story is very sad, but you could have put it in a magazine article. There was too much writing on Ron Williamson's depression, caused by him not making the \\"Big Leagues\\" and his use of drugs and alcohol to fight that depression.I was really mislead by the reviews and hype on this one.

This book on the other hand has been difficult to slog through; I've been attempting to finish it for a couple of weeks.As I read the book, I was struck by the seeming incompetence of the law enforcement officials, and their zeal to get convictions in spite of what appeared to be inadequate evidence.

When it arrived, I felt like a kid at Christmas, but was soon disappointed. I actually got halfway through the book before calling it quits and going right to the end. Although the story was well written, it dragged on and on, eventually losing my interest altogether. Boring would be a good word to use at this point.

In all of his earlier work (The Partner, The Pelican Brief, even non-legal works such as The Bleachers, and A Painted House) there have been strong enough background details to keep me amused and in suspense to the point where I couldn't put the book down. However his recent work has been disappointing and has discouraged me from reading his books. Grisham's forte is in his legal thrillers. Leave the biographies to other writers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Grisham should stick to fiction. He seems to have well vetted his recitation of the facts in the case, and it brings attention to innocent people which are no doubt behind prison bars. However, many writers could have recited the facts of the cases with some background thrown in the mix, but duties or causes such as these could be done just as well by any number of writers. Grisham's talents are best used in the area of fiction, spinning fascinating yarns on real issues facing the law and lawyers with the latitude given him in the fiction arena.I pre-purchased \\"The Appeal\\" , and chose to include \\"The Innocent Man\\" in the same transaction. I am only on the second CD of his new novel and he has already reminded me why he is among the most entertaining writers today.(Both of these audio books were listened to in the unabridged version, the only audio version that deserves consideration. Listening to an abridged book is not fair to you or the author.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"True mystery....","review":"I didn't realize it was a true story and at first was disappointed.

John, 306 were 250 too much.I enjoy Grisham's novels, but \\"The Innocent Man\\" was a laborious read. The repetition was amazing. Yes, we get it. The \\"protagonist,\\" Ron Williamson was an alcoholic, and drug addict, mentally unstable, etc. If Grisham wrote this once, he wrote it 50 times. The book would have had much greater impact had the story been told succinctly.This is the second \\"true crime\\" non-fiction book I read in 12 months (Douglas Preston's \\"The Monster of Florence\\" the other) and both centered on bumbling investigations into several murders. Both weren't so good.What happened to Williamson and Dennis Fritz, the other \\"innocent man,\\" was appalling no doubt. The hell they went through to prove their innocence was excrutiating. But as Grisham repeated the fact over and over, I just got to the point where I didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Innocent Man","review":"I am quite disappointed by this book. To be honest i find it boring and did not finish the book. I read about 2/3 and moved to the conclusion. This is not a novel, more like a court document written in a more animated style.

I find it incredibly heart-wrenching to read about the hardship innocent men were facing when wrongly convicted of horrendous crimes. I also find it absolutely appalling the extent of judicial injustice that prevailed in the county and the deplorable conditions experienced on death row. To see pictures of these men in real life and to read about what their lives were like before they were harrassed by the police and arrested, makes it that much more salient. I have not yet finished the book, but I eagerly read as much as I can every day. John Grisham did a stellar job in his first venture into the world of nonfiction.

I also knew going into it that this was a work of non-fiction, not of fiction, so I expected a very different book than I normally get from John Grisham.However, this book was a huge disappointment. This book read more like a textbook, or a series of random notes and observations, than a story. Even a true story, it could have been written as a story. Instead, Mr. Grisham takes the approach of just presenting \\"facts\\" and not performing character or story development at all.In addition, while the injustice described in the book is a *real* injustice, this book is highly biased in this direction. If Mr. Grisham would have presented a more balanced view of the story, his credibility would have been much higher and the injustice still would have been clear. Instead, Mr. Grisham takes a very one sided view, and does not spend any time exploring the issues around why this injustice happened.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham should stick with fiction.","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books. Some better than others, but all were enjoyable. The Innocent Man is one of the very few books that I could not finish.

Grisham did not do a good job of connecting the reader with the characters of in the story. I personally will not jump to purchase the next novel.I'm hoping Grisham will use his imagination next.

I did not have any sympathy for the main character considering his alcohol and drug abuse, arrogance, inability to deal with rejection from the Major Leagues, rape charges, and other police activity connected to this awful human being. Unfortunately, John Grisham has let his love of baseball, and those connected to it, block his view of how much this man does not need to be remembered. There must me hundreds of other \\"innocent men\\" who deserve 368 pages written about them. Simply being the highest baseball draft pick from Oklahoma is not a reason to write about someone. This guy and this book were not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, slow, and disappointing for Grisham work.","review":"Most of Grisham's novels create strong protagonists and feature rich dialogue. This recent installment, however, does neither. Dialogue is practically nonexistent. The main character is a substance-abusing minor league dropout, whose long mental deterioration while imprisoned (for a murder he didn't commit) is the central story.I wonder if Grisham based this on a true story, which might explain why most of the book is a timeline of events with an overpopulated cast of largely unadmirable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"This book reads like a police report. Grisham must be rolling over in his grave. It would be very interesting to see who is making money from this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really pissed me off","review":"I just finished reading The Innocent Man and my overall feeling throughout the book was anger. I hated the fact that this was based on a true story. I was so caught up in the way the DA and the court worked that I had to keep putting it down to cool off for a bit. I don't usually get emotionally involved in books, but this one caught me off guard. It was a bit dry, but the fact that it was a true story made up for it. Every American who believes the judicial system is working just fine should be required to read this book. It should be required reading for anyone who is going on jury duty as well. Just because the testimony is coming from an officer of the law does not necessarily mean it is the truth. Our society thinks that if a defendant has made it all the way to a court room, then he is guilty. We need to all read this book and learn to have an open mind when entering a court room. It might just save some lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Innocent Man","review":"No matter what style John Grisham chooses for his books, they are all great.This has all the things you want in a story. There is love, betrayal, mystery and legal wheelings and dealings.I read this book in 2 days. It just keeps flowing one page to the next and you realized you are lost in the story and are reluctant to wait til the next day to see 'what happened next'I have passed this book along to two others to read and they also loved it. Some 'true crime' type books are the most enthralling.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a story of a true crime, injustice and the good guys v the bad guys. As participants and onlookers we should all pay attention to the criminal justice system.Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Innocent Man","review":"Seems like Grisham has either lost his 'touch' or is using a ghost writer. Book was filled with repetition. way too long and boring. Definitely not up to his former standards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Innocent Man - Great Reading","review":"I picked up this book at the library not realizing it was non-fiction. I enjoy Grisham's fiction, so I checked out the book. I couldn't put it down. My husband, who seldom reads non-fiction, couldn't put it down. I had Amazon send a copy to my mother, who is from that area of the south and who reads totally different books than I do and she couldn't put it down.This is a story that needed to be told and I think Grisham did an excellent job in telling it. I highly recommend the book to fiction and non-fiction readers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the Grisham trail - but GREAT!","review":"Having read all of Grisham's books I ordered \\"The Innocent Man\\" blindly. At first I was a little disappointed, but not for long! What a compelling story, really, I couldn't put this down. Now, because it is a true story my opinions about \\"criminals\\" has changed forever. Thank you John Grisham for being the conscience America needs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Reading","review":"It was tedious to read with the author going over the same ground from endless viewpoints. Grisham seemed to be just filling up pages with repetitions instead of having a great plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough action for me.","review":"I like some of John Grisham's books and I guess I expect each book to be as good as the one I just read. The Innocent Man moved much too slowly for my likes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long","review":"It seemed to have a lot of \\"filler\\" and I was glad to finish it. Where is the good old Grisham gone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read","review":"John Grisham is one of my favorite authors. I have not read this book (The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Ton) yet, but I am confident that I will enjoy it as I do every one I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town","review":"A real move away from what I have come to expect from Grisham, but artfully done. Draws one into the maze of bad police work and prosecution. Very scary as to what happens when prosecutors are misguided and shows what can happen, if you don't have the money to find the right attorney and even if you do, how costly it is when the government decides to \\"make it happen\\" dispite the facts or lack of evidence. Wish that he had had more pages to develop more of what he found out and alluded to.Well worth the reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Grisham for taking this injustice","review":"John Grisham chose a compelling story to feature in his true crime book about Ron Williamson's scandalous treatment at the hands of Ada, Oklahoma police and prosecutors. It's too bad the book is not quite as great a read as it is an important and empathetic discussion of justice gone awry. Now I understand he's signed onto a movie deal for the book, a film that I'll no doubt rush out to see. Grisham may write better when he relies on his imagination rather than the record, but I'm truly thankful that he made the effort to write this book and I'm pleased he's apparently gone on to help the unfortunate soul who was convicted with Williamson, Dennis Fritz, sell his own book about the experience. Don't give up on the true crime genre John. You'll get even better at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different for John Grisham.","review":"This book was not what I expected as a huge John Gisham fan. But once I got into it ,I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Innocent Man","review":"Great story but was expecting something different from John Grisham so a disapointment in that sense. Sounded like an Ann Rule book. I know authors like to stretch themselves and try different things, but when I pick up a book from an author, I go for the known style. I have many Grisham books but I won't be keeping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had not bought it","review":"I was very disappointed in this story, about 100 pages too long, the details were repetitive and I had to struggle to keep reading. Had it not been a John Grisham, I would have given up about a third of the way through it but I kept thinking it must get better.Next time I will check his book out at the library first. I gave this one away a few minutes after completing it. Big sigh of relief that I was done with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no \\"Helter Skelter\\"","review":"The story Grisham chooses to tell is certainly one tale which needs to be told, but it ain't no Helter Skelter! A Vince Bugliosi could make so much more of it than our legal thriller writer, who should stick to popular fiction for the masses.The writing style is simplistic, choppy and sometimes grammatically incorrect. Although fast-paced and cohesive, the bias evident by Grisham destroys the pathos of the Innocent Man and stirs a yearning in the reader to hear the \\"other side\\" of the story, from the cops' perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Having read all (or at least most) of Mr. Grishams previous books I was anticipating a good read. Instead I was treated to a confusing mix of characters and locations thrown at me in a more or less random fashion. You, the reader, must work hard to keep track of who is who and how they relate to which murder at which time or place. Too much work! I stopped at the halfway mark because it was giving me headache.Of course the publisher fails to mention it's non-fiction anywhere on the cover and even though it does say it inside the sleeve (at the top) most readers, like me, just read the description which of course fails to mention this fact. They are, of course, banking on previous novels to sell this one and don't mind a little trickery to do it. The bookstore put it in the fiction section, natch.Save your money and buy something else, anything else actually because this book is the pits in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy!","review":"I've enjoyed reading almost all of John Grisham's books. However, the switch to non-fiction was not a good one. The book was very dry and I had little desire to continue reading, other than my hope that it would get better. The story itself was very serious and deserves to be told. But if you're looking for a good John Grisham story, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book so much I could not finish reading it.","review":"I hated, hated it. It is the first book in years I did not finish reading. I can't remember the last time I gave up on a book but this one was horrible. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I am so disappointed in John Grisham's most recent books that I don't think I will read another book by Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Innocent Man","review":"Did not like this Grisham book. He rambles on and on about each character without developing much of a story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best of Grisham","review":"Typically when I read a Grisham novel, it is tough to put the book down--unfortunately this is not the case with The Innocent Man. It is like reading a history textbook for me, and I had a real tough time finishing this work. It was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to fiction","review":"I'm a big fan of John Grisham, but this book is a dud! The story is fascinating and needs to be told, but by someone else. While Grisham seems to get the facts and the chronology of events across, the read is about as interesting as watching grass grow. Stick to fiction John."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"This book reads like a 300 page newspaper article. It is a real - very tragic story about a wrong accusation which ruins a life but this book drags on forever and I actually had to flip over ca. 40 pages because I couldnt take more dry facts anymore that only lead to something that you already know because : there are photos in there which tell you the whole thing before you even start reading. It is shocking how in such recent past or even still the justice system here lacks of professionality and things like this happen - but this book is too dry to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed Grisham fan","review":"I hope that this is the last non-fiction book that John Grisham writes. I have not read a book of his that I didn't like until this one.It reads like a bad episode of Dateline NBC. It's hard to keep up with all of the people involved. AND I don't know if I can emphasize this point enough, IT IS EXTREMELY DEPRESSING. Stories like this about fictional characters can be enjoyable at times b/c they are seperated from reality, but when it happens to real people it just makes you sick.Brief synopsis:A woman is murdered.A man's life begins to fall apart.A man's life continues to fall apart.Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it does.There's no nice neat bow on the end of this one. There are no answers. There is no final resolution.Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as engaging as the fictional work","review":"I have read many other pieces by Grisham and enjoyed all. Admittedly, the prior works were fiction. The works were spell binding, informative,enlightening. This particular work did not measure up to what I have come to see and welcome from Grisham. It conveyed important history and succeeded in having troubling history and messages about our judicial system and the travesty for these innocent men resonate loudly.However, this book was lengthy, plodding and predictable. It might very well have been a more compelling and impactful piece (and message) if it had been half the length."},{"rating":"2","title":"tbax","review":"great. Kept me reading until all hours. Being raised in the a small town in the south, it really was a true repersentation of what goes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The innocent Man","review":"I have read most of his novels, enjoyed all. The InnocentMan,was a tough read due to the recapping throughout.No author can please everyone. I hav ordered his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Innocent Man","review":"This is a true story about my home town. I knew the victims and the accused. John Grisham did an excellent job of telling the stories surrounding these crimes and corruption concerning small town politics. This is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long but good storyline","review":"The summary of the book and the author drove me to purchase this book. I got through half the book and stopped, even though I felt guilty for not finished a book, because I have other books on my shelf that I want to read. The storyline is good but it is way too long and very repetitive. The book could have been shortened by at least 1/2 and still have a powerful story. Good storyline but it drags on and on that it gets lost to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even read past the first few chapters - ugh!","review":"I bought Ann Rule's new book and this one by Grisham, thinking that I'd be set for holiday reading. I was terribly disappointed with this book and could barely make it past a few chapters before throwing it in the garbage. What a waste of money!I believe that true crime stories can only be written by a select few - and one of those authors is Ann Rule. Any book by her is worth reading.Janet in Florida"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham should stick to fiction","review":"Terribly boring. all you had to do is read the jacket of the the book. The book just dragged on and on. I had to stop reading it 3/4 the way through. I have read all of his other books and really enjoyed them. This one was a bomb"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst....","review":"This has got to be one of the worst non-fiction books I've ever read. I haven't read Grisham's fiction books, but I think he should stick to what he knows how to do best.This book was really confusing...jumping from character to character. It read like a fact sheet, and didn't really present anything new as far as the accused being innocent but being found guilty anyway. The Freedom Project shows that, which ultimately freed this man.Sorry, Grisham..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"John should stick to what he knows. I have enjoyed his fiction and eagerly awaited his next. But this work was not his usual best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another example of how junk science corrupts","review":"From his fictional work, \\"The Street Lawyer,\\" I had discovered that Grisham's opinion of Republicans is almost as low as mine is, and this work of non-fiction that takes place in the heart of redneck red-state Okie ignorance says it all without even alluding to political leanings at all! Granted, his notes at the end assure us that this is not unique to Oklahoma or any other state. On the other hand, those states like Bush's Texas that are backward enough to retain the death penalty and in a hurry to carry their legal lynchings to conclusion are also the source of most of what is wrong with our entire country these days, including additional examples of the junk science used to rationalize these wrongful convictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good . . .","review":"At best this is a very poorly organized documentary. Early into the book I wondered if this was truly a work of John Grisham or merely a collection of facts, loosely thrown together in afterthought-like chronological order, baring his endorsement."},{"rating":"1","title":"the end","review":"Another anti death penalty book by Grisham.How many is that now? Either Grisham starts writing those great books he wrote years ago,or he goes into politics. I am fed up W/Grisham throwing his OBVIOUS left leaning politics in his books.After reading ALL his books I now consider this one to be THE END. Grisham I can get my political news from TV, or newspapers I dont want them in bestsellers.THE END."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to fiction","review":"Boring. You know who did the crime in the first few pages. While I initially was interested in the massive coverup and found the characters compelling, after a while I started not caring. The level of incompetence was distressing; but Grisham's writing was not as good as in fiction. I usually cannot put Grisham down, his writing flows so well. I was easily able to put this one away. Scimmed through to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book!","review":"Do not buy this book. It reads like someone other than Grisham wrote it and than they just put Grisham's name on it. What a waste of time and my money. Shame on you Grisham to put out crap like this just to make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I keep on reading this?","review":"Is what I wonder each time I pick this book up. I consider myself a very caring person but I haven't conjured up anything but pure disgust at this Williamson. Mental illness is very scary and disturbing to me and I think it can't really be helped all that much and it ticks me off that they quit taking their meds and go off the deep end. What purpose did he serve here? I looked at the pics and saw he was wasted away to nearly nothing so went searching to see what finally put him out of his and everyone else's misery. That was the high point of the book and I may not have to finish it now. Yes, it sucks that he was not guilty but he was crazier than an outhouse rat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY","review":"I firmly believe that Mr. Grisham should stick to fictional writing. His attempt at Real Crime leaves so much to be desired. Carlton Smith, Carlton Stowers, Diane Fanning and Keith Ablow do a much better job of Real Crime writing and in a lot less words and for a lot less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Read","review":"What a WASTE of my money!!!! I won't ever read his non-fiction again. Very boring endless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very good book ruined","review":"I was reading this book and enjoying it. In the middle of the book, there are a few pages of photographs of different stages of the suspect/defendant's life. The captions next to the photos give away the story. How stupid was that. The captions ruined this book for me. Why finish it, I already know the outcome. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham delivers with nonfiction","review":"As you probably know, The Innocent Man tells the story of Ron Williamson, and how he was arrested and charged with a murder he did not commit. He was later sent to death row for the murder, due to a failed system. The story is truly tragic and unfair, but it is this unfairness that draws the reader in. Amazingly, Williamson is not the only person charged in the rural Oklahoma county with a crime that he didn't commit, and Grisham's book brings to light how several bad players including police and appointed defense attourneys can fail people, especially the poor. Unfair trials do exist, and people are wrongly convicted, although I have to say Grisham's book opened my eyes to just how this can occur. I found this book tragic, yet extremely interesting. He does an excellent job of writing nonfiction and letting the reader get to know the background and personalities of those involved with Williamson's case. I could not put the book down and read it in just two days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and drawn out","review":"I really like John Grisham's other books, and I expected ths nonfiction book to be different but was disappointed. It appears that Grisham is trying to do a book similar to In Cold Blood, but the topic here is just not as interesting. It is quite long and actually boring until the last fifth or so of the book, but it takes perseverence to get to that point. I think a shorter format would have helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, but I still stand behind the death penalty","review":"This another great book by John Grisham. A work of non fiction.This tale tells us how things can go awfully wrong within the judicial system.In the end however, I still think the death penalty is a good tool for dispensing justice. The only thing we need to do is revise the way we do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very compelling and shocking story!","review":"Grisham could do more non-fiction! As this story unfolds, you'll be horrified and amazed at how this small town's legal system operates. I have a legal background and know first hand how things get botched, but these were mind-boggeling screw-ups. Grisham can definitely tell a tale, and you will be totally absorbed by the characters. I do give this 4 stars instead of 5 as the story got a bit draggy and slow in parts. A few parts were repeated a bit too much. Didn't matter though. Still a great read by Grisham and will leave you wanting him to do more of the same type work. If he tries another non-fiction, I'll definitely give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite","review":"I am a big fan of John Grisham books and I have purchased and read them all. This was not my favorite by far.I found the story to drone on and on and take forever to make its point. The main character is not a very interesting man and I found that I didn't really care about him (which is quite sad since this is a true story). Grisham did not make me feel sorry for this \\"innocent man\\". I hope the author's next book is fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much information","review":"I enjoyed the first half of the book. I found it interesting that it was a true story unlike the rest of his books. I also used to be a counselor so I thought the mental illness aspect was interesting. His writing style (similar to a reporter) was also different but I enjoyed the change. What I didn't like was there was way too many details and information. I ended up skimming through the last half of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Story","review":"This book is writen in a narrative style with lots of facts, events and characters. Some readers, looking for more of an action type story, may be disappointed. I had a hard time putting the book down and finished it in record time. It is an inspiring story about the unjustly convicted and their families, how they survived the ordeal and the dedication of a legal defense team that ultimately comes to their aid. The sister of the main character, who does so much to care for him his whole life, should be made a saint. The reader can't help but wonder how many others Ron Williamsons are out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps u reading","review":"This book brings to attention the injustice in our systems. John Grisham is an excellent person to bring this fact across. There has to be a better way to police the police, for it seems they just want to find a way to get the crime off of there books. Its really a shame that people loose there freedom for so long a time, and there are plenty that never get there freedom back. the death penalty should not even be allowed. This is an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"Good read as are all Grisham's works. Disturbing story makes you think about all the injustices that occur in this country due to imcompetance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and an eye opener","review":"I feel that Mr. Grisham did an excellent job telling this story of Ron Williamson, and others in sad, but similar situations. Ron's sisters are saints and I felt for them just as much as him. They also went through a great ordeal. The reason for the 4 stars is there were times I wanted to hurriedly get past some of the repeated legal details, but I can see where it tied the whole story together nicely and I found myself unable to put it down. Great job for John Grisham's first non-fiction and may we all hope and pray that this story will serve to make those in the justice system remember how important it is to do their jobs with the utmost care and thoroughness - for both parties involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham's best book","review":"This true life story outdoes any fiction for drama. Every person in the country should read this story of how the criminal justice system is easily manipulated by corrupt or inept officials. As a practicing lawyer, I think every one should see how subtle and nuanced the process is, such that minor errors can compound into the death penalty for an innocent man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed!!!","review":"I love John and I constantly rave about how interesting his books are. Not this one. I have to say, this is his first book that I thought was just flat out boring. I read half of the book but just couldn't take it anymore and had to move on. I love baseball and the story still didn't grab me. I hope this was just a bump in the road for John. I am going to try his new book \\"The Appeal\\" and see if he got his swager back. I think he was trying something a little different writing about a true story. I think he should stick to fiction, that is where his skillz are. I can't recommend anyone buying this book. Borrow it from a friend if you just have to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Innocent Man","review":"If you like John Grisham, you have to get this book.

What was done to these men was such an injustice. I've read all of Grisham's book and I think this is one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"dry and tedious","review":"Please don't assume you are getting the regular John Grisham novel. If you like true crime, it MIGHT be ok, but still it rambles on and on and repeats things until you just can't stand it. I read ALOT and this is the first book in a LOOOONG time that I didn't bother to finish. I wadded through almost half and realized it just wasn't getting any better. Choose something else !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Thought Provoking","review":"I had a couple of long plane rides, so I went with the unabridged audio version. I had a very different impression than some of the other reviews. I couldn't quit listening.Ron Williamson was definitely a troubled individual. However, I was actually able to empathize with him and cheer for his release from death row, while at the same time cheering against the Ada police.I am from Oklahoma, and although I was not familiar with this story, I was familiar with a lot of the places mentioned, and I actually know (friend of a friend) one of the reporters mentioned in the book a few times, and also have another friend that was going to school in Ada at the time of the murders. He said Ron Williamson was definitely the talk of the town.I will definitely buy this book and see if the impression is different than reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It starts well and keep me awake, but Mr Grisham is too much of story teller for my taste.

Why the author is so surprised to uncover injustice when stories about prisoner releases because of new DNA evidence abound. Overall the repetition of the hearings etc. were tedious and boring.

I read Grisham to escape. I want a fun conspiracy type story to read about; not a real story (the current world situation is depressing enough) - this I found b-o-r-i-n-g. It goes on and on as this poor slob can't get a decent shake of the dice from anyone. Grisham also tried something different a few years ago, called Stealing Christmas (or something like that). I might have finished reading that book, however. But it wasn't as good as his regular style mystery, etc.You can't blame authors for trying something different, I guess, but when one switches genre, reader beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"As a rule, I rush to purchase and read John Grisham's latest book.

Very hard to just get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of talent...a waste of my money","review":"I could not wait to pick up the new Grisham book and bought it the day it came out. Unfortunately, this one time, I was completely let down. While I enjoy non-fiction and thought Grisham would do a killer job, I was bored. For once, it took me a week to finish a book, instead of a day when I do nothing but read his new book. If you are looking for a good read, this is not the book. If you are looking for something to put you to sleep, by all means, buy the book.I'm looking forward to the next book and am hoping its back to non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling, but not a Grisham best effort.","review":"This documentary is not one of John Grisham's best works.

STICK TO FICTION, GRISHAM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!! How can I possibly listen to any more","review":"I am at the end of the 2nd CD, and this book gets more boring by the minute...please someone tell me it gets better!!!The litnay of dates and names is endless, in 1978 this...in 1981 this...in 1988... and on and on....the lack of dialog and colorful descriptions is so disappointing.Mr Grisham, what happened?

Grisham's licence should be revoked for a while!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Rule Revisted","review":"I am definitely not a Grisham fan. I think his fiction is written in formula form due to his publishing so many books so quickly (much like - shudder - Danielle Steele). I decided to read this book, however, because I found the premise to be interesting and a sad reflection on what can happen in the criminal justice system. I couldn't make my way through the morass of details without becoming frustrated/bored, so I mostly skimmed it. I had no high expectations of Grisham, and he didn't surprise me. Ann Rule writes about true crime in a much more engaging way. I don't understand quite how this book made it to any best seller lists. It is not worth the time I spent reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that sucks with a capital S","review":"I started out hoping for something intriguing. The back blurb led me to believe I was in for a treat and what started out great soon descended into one long boring drone. At times I had to force myself to pick it up again. Can't put my finger on what it was. Perhaps it was Grisham's need to constantly hammer home what a great guy Ron was (he should have trusted the readers to come to their own conclusions). Or perhaps it was all the erroneous boring day to day activities that Grisham constantly subjected me to. A lot of it felt like filler and I began to wonder if this story really fit the novel word count. Somewhere here is an interesting story but the author's style is too heavy handed to pull it off successfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"JOHN GRISHAMS BEST BOOK YET TO DATE","review":"A very compelling book written by a excellent author. The story is amazing and you would think it was ficition if it was not a true story. Once you pick up the book you will not put it down until you have finished reading it. A great amount of research into the book by the author and will make you think of the criminal justice system in this country. Worth the price of the book to read about the injustice done to four innocent people in OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a JG fan, but.....","review":"I am a big John Grisham fan. When I heard he had a new book out I went to my local library to secure a copy. I am glad I did not invest $30.00+ to buy this book. Although it is thought-provoking, it is not what I want from JG. If I want to read about \\"true crime\\", I generally turn to the writings of Ann Rule. I will continue to read Grisham's books, but I trust he will get back to the fictional fast-paced style I have come to know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham should stick to fiction","review":"My title sums it up. I just couldn't get into this book. The innocent man is such a reprehensible character that I have not been able to sympathize with his plight. He may be innocent of the murder, but this is one guy who didn't need a book written about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham with a twist","review":"I used to love Grisham, and his older books are classics in my view. The more recent ones, though, are less interesting. They give the impression of being written for the sake of the paycheck rather than because of a real passion in storytelling. This book is the exception. Grisham really got into this sordid story of crime and punishment with two twists-the people who committ the crimes are NOT the ones being punished, and the story is real. This book is not quite as good as \\"Tulia\\": the characters are not as detailed, the writing is not as interesting. However, it is well worth reading if you want to get a picture of how the American justice system works if you happen to be poor. This is not an isolated case: the recent articles about exoneration should give pause to anyone who trusts this system. Yes, Grisham has his political opinions. Given that they are based on reality, I cannot see anything wrong with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling. Concise.","review":"I could not put this book down. Its concise, clear and compelling because it reminds you not to put too much faith in those in power. The criminal justice system in our country is the best the world has to offer, but thanks to Mr. Grisham for reminding us that it can go awry, and usually to those who need it the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Although I am a Grisham fan, I was really disappointed in this novel. It moved incredibly slowly, and read more like a case note than a novel. I didn't care about the characters, and just couldn't get into the book. Sorry, John, this just wasn't one of your best efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"the truth is hard","review":"Well, I'd rather not read about tsunamis, but if one is coming, I want a warning.This is not a pleasant book, but it tells several \\"moral\\" stories...stories that urgently need to be told. Warnings. This book is not fiction and it's not fun, but it's brilliantly written. Grisham always leaves the reader thinking about truth, consequences, and the inevitability of judgment...now or later.Unfortunately, Grisham IS writing about what he knows. Boring? This is history...and you know what they say about those who forget the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Innocent Man","review":"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read. I tried to get through this book but it was very difficult. I finally skipped about 100 pages so I could get to the end.

The price was right, and service was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Change...","review":"To be honest, I had grown tired of John Grishom's books. They seemed to all have the same plot after a while. But this book...WOW. I was very impressed. What a scary thing to think that this goes on in our judicial systems, however, I have seen first hand that it does happen, everyday in our court systems. While some may feel that they were weighed down in too many facts, most true crime stories do this, but I didn't find it to be boring in the least. It was a great book, one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading of an important subject","review":"I almost passed over this book because of the reviews I read here. This is not a typical John G book, in that it is a true crime story in the same class as Vincent Bugliosi's books (Helter Skelter and \\"And the Sea Will Tell\\"). His in-depth research and explanation of the finer points this gross injustice using his legal backround and ability to explain in layman's terms, make this a very informative book. The story reads more like an investigative piece than a dramatic story, which I prefer.I liked this book better than John G's other books in that I am a fan of true crime stories. His reiterating of the main Character's mental problems is necessary to drive the point of this incredible miscarriage of justice.If your looking for a typical John G novel, wait for his next book.But if your a fan of true crime, get this book, it's his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked, Disturbed and infuriated","review":"I was shocked, disturbed and infuriated just like the last paragraph of the dust jacket said i would be.I thank John Grisham for writing this novel, i've been a fan of his since high school (the firm) and the well researched, worded and informative book baffled me. When i think of innocent people being murdered by the government i think of the 1800's and even up to the 1950's. This book is a MUST READ especially for my generation (Gen x).To put this into prospective the story started when i was in kindergarten and by the time these men got out of prison i had been married for 3 years. Thats almost incomprehensable for me, i'm suggesting everyone i know read it, especially my pro-death penalty parents.I also intend on purchasing Dennis Fritz's novel Journey to Justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow at first, but gains momentum","review":"I had a hard time making it through the first 100 pages of this book. I actually didn't know it was nonfiction (received as a gift and just starting reading -- I didn't read the blurbs). I really didn't like John Grisham's writing style -- it came across as a list of facts.But once I started feeling for the main character, Ron, I had a hard time putting the book down. I began fighting for him inside, and got pretty wrapped up in the story.*Spoiler*In the end, it was a pretty sad story. Even though he was free, the damage had been done. He finished his life as best he could. And of course, he never received true justice (even though he got $$$)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Innocent Man","review":"It was the saddest book I ever read and the scariest. I feel it was one of John Grisham's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book shows that Mr. Grishman can not only spell bound us with his fiction story telling but that he also has the diligence to research and assemble an excellent non-fiction book. The beauty of this book is that people will be helped and the bad guys will be exposed. Justice will be served and we should all thank Mr. Grishman for having the integrity to tell this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"'One' of the most \`known' incompetence and dishonesty prosecution in history.","review":"Making insignificant bad choices during young age can sometimes lead to extreme hardship in the future. I have friends who are behind bars for crimes they never committed, or simply because they were at the wrong place in the wrong time. After all, the sloppiness of the justice system makes it even harder for such mistakes to be avoided.John Grisham's book \`The Innocent Man; Murder and Injustice in a Small Town' talks about a true story murder and rape of Debra Sue Carter in Ada, Oklahoma, which lead to one of the wrongful convictions throughout the United States, the conviction of Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz; creating \`one' of the most \`known' incompetence and dishonesty prosecution in history.If you haven't yet read this book, then take this chance because the movie-making process is in the oven, ticking for some-weekend in 2009."},{"rating":"2","title":"At first, I thought this was a great book...","review":"At first, I thought this was a great book...and like anyone else who read it without prior knowledge of the case thought the small town police department was inept and looking to hang someone. But I did a little research on the web and found the other side of the story and think there may be more than Grisham lets on, even though he took longer than necessary to tell the story (some stories seemed repeated). Still, a fascinating story and the first true crime type of bok I have read, unless you count In Cold Blood. Read the book but also look at http://www.billpetersondistrictattorney.com/ for the Ada, OK DA's side of things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-inspiring","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books and was looking forward to this one, however, unlike his past works, I have a hard time wanting to pick this book up and finish it. I've had it months now and just have no interest in how it ends. His past works have been \\"keep you on the edge of your seat\\" readings, this may be a true story, but it does not keep you spell bound nor interested enough to \\"not put it down\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT one of his best books...","review":"Long, Drawn Out, Repetitive, Irritating & BORING...more about statistics of the real crime than his writing...NOT one of his best books...in fact, in my personal opinion, it was a FLOP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Stars?","review":"So disappointing. I expected a book, not a collection of facts written in some random stream of consciousness attempt. This is the worst book I have read ever. I kept thinking it would get better but it never did. Talked to folks on planes reading it and they had the same reaction. Not worth it even if someone gives it to you. Don't waste your time. I hear Playing for Pizza is almost as bad.

I gave this one away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick With Fiction","review":"Having read each of Grishams novels, and been happy with most of them.....even pleasently surprised by those not set in a courtroom...it was with some trepidation that I picked up his first forray into non-fiction, The Innocent Man. Overall, I was not impressed, and found myself quite dissapointed.Grisham is a wonderful story teller. Perhaps not the most poetic, but his characters and storylines have always entertained me. All of which is absent in this book.I found it to be little more than a regurgitation of the facts, with a rather thick bias. Gone is any hint of wit, or even the slightest sense of his humor.Anyone on the fence regarding the death penalty might benefit from its pages, but aside from that, I'd recomend you wait out his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Innocent Man","review":"John Grisham should stick to fiction!

I especially like that it has 2 rods for hanging clothes. It works for most shirts, blouses, skirts, and pants (if folded over a hanger). I only wish the manufacturer had made it 2 or 3 inches taller, because the longer jackets are just a tad too long to hang totally free. But that is a minor flaw. I've considered taking the shelves out and putting another rod in the shelving side to hold longer things; but the shelves are so handy.

The shelves can be customized to your liking but I followed the picture. The wheels have locks and the cart actually rolls while full of clothes. No sagging or bending of parts.

You can never reach higher than this masterpiece. Comparable to this gem maybe Survivor's When Seconds Count, Trillion's debut and second and recent Mecca debut album. It represents the art of production and essential role of Jeff Pocaro drums and Steve Lukather's magic touch of guitar. This best wraps up the first half of glorious TOTO career.

The text-to-speech engine is generally good but will sometimes hilariously mangle street names. Not just long complicated ones like you'd expect, but relatively mundane names as well. The list of Points of Interest is incomplete - some major chains of restaurants simply don't exist to it, yet tiny hole-in-the-wall establishments are constantly found. The British voice sounds much nicer to my ears than the default American one, but for some reason will not read street names at all. And so on - nothing deal breaking, just odd and mystifying.Yet for all that its pathfinding seems excellent, it's very accurate and I have no major complaints. It's good at the essentials, but once you get past that the extras are almost bafflingly quirky. I would only recommend this unit to those who find an unbeatable deal and are fully aware of its oddities."},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works properly it's great, but...","review":"I purchased this product last August (8/6/07) and it has not operated properly since.

A bit like DANCING WITH WOLVES which was first released at 3 hours then 4 but 3 and a half would have been easier watching and still cover the full story.How people could sit through 193 min back then beats me.

You know this is the same world where people consider human excrement to be art so I am cautious in actually taking their opinions. I sincerely believe that these people are in fact trying to sugarcoat the fact that they feel that the film was accurate, especially in its portrayal of blacks. Its also sad that the beginning of cinema in this country is marked by something so negative. Yet that is the USA in a nuthsell. The film was boring for the most part, but the second half raised my blood to the boiling point. It is highly incendiary and I warn anyone that watches it that your hackles will be raised (if not then perhaps you should take a good long look at yourself)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist trash!","review":"This is not a cinematic masterpiece. This is racist trash. The fact that this got rave reviews when it came out in 1915 showed the sick psyche prevailing during those times.

It makes you sick as a human being watching this perversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero stars I would have.","review":"This is easily the worst film I have ever seen. I had to see this film for my US History Course, and I was absolutely stunned by its racial stereotypes and historical inaccuracies.

BOAN was the most popular, profitable, and influential film of its time. As such, it deserves to be seen. But the movie itself is racist propaganda that celebrates the Ku Klux Klan as noble and heroic, castigates blacks as bloodthirsty rapists out to ravage white women, and pleads for white supremacy. The story is over-the-top cornball melodrama, the acting is ludicrously hammy. Suitable for film buffs and cultural historians. Others will find it alternately ridiculous and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DVD doesn't work","review":"I played this DVD when I got it and there was about 20-30 minutes of it that wouldn't play.

It was more expensive but that one worked fine.I am very satisfied with the return policy of Amazon. They make it very to return things (they give you a shipping label to print) and they will exchange or refund returns very promptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent early film","review":"This film was very well done. You must consider the standards of the day, however. For a silent picture, the plot was pretty easy to follow and it was filmed using as much creativity that was available technically at the time.

This film is racist, racist, racist! Hearing it was a classic, I watched it, and, no lie, I really tried to like it. But the Klan glorfication on this film is something I cannot overlook. The fact that the majority of the black people is this film are actually white, and dyed, doesn't at all help this. No wonder this film is still used as a recruitment piece for the KKK! But another thing in this film that cannot be overlooked, is the vast majority of technical achievements. I think it is the only thing that keeps this film from my utter reviewing wrath. Buy it for the technical contributions, but, hopefully, for nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"For study, not entertainment.","review":"It is true that this film was a great leap foward in the technical development of motion pictures. However, D. W. Griffith was too smart a man to NOT know what the story was about (based on \\"The Clansman\\", hello). Critics who like the film either already decided that it was a cinema classic before they saw it or are in some way racist themselves. The film is not subtle in how it poorly portrays blacks, and the birth of the Ku Klux Klan is not an unfortunate footnote to the story, it's the Finale! It can't even be said to be a reflection of the time in which it was made because it met with protests when it was released (this at a time when blacks were still second class citizens!). Griffith was a wizard with a camera and the film may be looked at for that, but only that."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as great as i was expecting","review":"I've heard a lot about Griffith's movie as being an important one in film history. So I watched it. First of all, this movie is extremely racist. Even taking in the time that Griffith lived and the setting of the Civil War, the racism still was over the top. And the movie was dull, though it did get slightly better as it went on. So what you have here is three hours of a boring movie that is extremely racist. I'm just not sure what to make of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Perspective","review":"What can one say about this perplexing film? Technically significant and even a landmark achievement on one hand; hopelessly biased and unredeeming on the other. After weighing the pros and cons, I settled on the cons. The film will and can never change its unconstructive perspective, which to my mind cancels out its technical achievements. One of the most unfortunate films to be placed on any best-films list."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of its time...","review":"I absolutely hate people who purely judge this movie by the amount of racism it conveys. This movie was indeed very innovative and redefined the way filmmakers tell their stories. Racism and hate aside this is without a doubt one of the most influential movies of the century. D.W. Griffith is a genius and masterful storyteller. Check out Intolerance also that movie will blow you away with how complex it was for the time it was made in. But yeah sure if you grade this movie on morality and hate then it gets a 1 star out of 5. Thanks a lot to all those who do not have open minds...P.S. The Lifetime Achievement Award for a Director in the Oscars used to be named after D.W. Griffith. However, they took his name out just for material his movies were on...for shame"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the SHORT version","review":"This film was one of the assigned viewings for a History of Film class. The professor specified the 180 minute version and specifically described the ending as being important to a complete analysis of the work. My bad for not checking the specifics for this edition, but be forewarned: if you want the full version, this is NOT it. This version ends with Liberation. Several other key scenes appear to have been edited out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birth of a Nation (1915)","review":"This film truly demonstrates Griffith's genius as a director, producer and editor. He manages to tell an epic of a story with bold camera work, clever cuts and balanced pacing. He includes historical interpretation, adventure and romance. It's unfortunate that he possessed such a twisted morality. The first half, which concerns the civil war, is very watchable, but second part portrays blacks as either ignorant or evil (mostly played by whites in blackface) and features the Klu Klux Klan as righteous heroes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Version","review":"This version (A2ZDCS) is not 190 mins as advertised, It is 181 minutes.

If one looks as it, however, as art, then perhaps it can be slightly less shocking: that's how critics view it without vomiting.

Kevin Brownlow in his definitive book on the silent cinema wrote, \\"The silent film was never silent\\"...pity that Allied Artists didn't realize this when releasing this tape.

By the standards of today, though, it is the most horrid thing ever to come out of Hollywood, racist to the core. It did not even have black actors portraying the black characters, such was the racism of the early 1900s.If you look at it through the eyes of a moviegoer who lived in the early 1900s, you would rate it ***** and then some.If you apply today's standards to it, though, it must be given the lowest rating possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist Crap","review":"The only value this nonsense serves is to show just how sick and evil this country once was."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad thats its now almost comic","review":"This film is so bad and so racist that it boggles the mind.

Naively assuming that remastering would enhance the image definition, I purchased this DVD for my film studies class to replace the Image Entertainment/Blackhawk Films 1998 edition. The two discs don't compare on a big screen; the older edition is far superior. You can barely read Griffith's title cards in this version, and the pixilation makes for a numbing, unpleasant viewing experience.

The film was supposed to have been titled \\"The Clansman,\\" after the ludicrous book that inspired Griffith to make The Birth of a Nation.

Based almost entirely on actual letters written by members of the family, Salone Italiano reads with the fluidity of a fine masterpiece as it chronicles Angelina Sartore's struggle to keep the family together, Katie Sartore's forbidden romance with a member of a rival immigrant colony, to Phil Sartore's love affair with a well-known local prostitute, the threat of danger and gunfire, and more. A fascinating glimpse into daily life, triumphs, and travails of the distant past."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Fashioned Look at a Contemporary Issue","review":"In the midst of the steaming immigration issues moving across our nation, I was happy to receive Salone Italiano by Kay Niemann, a timely read with old fashioned ideas about what it is to become an American.The book chronicles an Italian immigrant family during the late 1800's, as they settle in the area of Silverton, Colorado. Back then, immigrants came to the USA to become Americans. This group worked hard (without the support of social programs) to learn English and move their label from Italian-Americans to American citizens.The whole concept of assimilation may be out of date and considered anti-diversity, but even Martha Stweart could probably find social blending to be \\"a good thing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"CD","review":"It was not what I thought.

I could see why fans of twothirtyeight were reluctant to open up to it, because it is different. Still, these songs are great. Chris is a master songwriter that I (and I'm sure many others who know of him) think is severely under rated. I think this is demonstrating his realization of his solo song writing skills where you can see that they are really going to blossom very soon. He seems to write in minimalist kind of way, with a less is more style compared to his other bands. He also has a new album ooming out that I am personally pumped for, based on his kickstarter samples. I would say this album is a must for any Chris Staples fan and any Discover America/twothrityeight should give it a try as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Staples has done it again!","review":"Although this lacks the same passion and pop found in the last two albums by Chris Staples' now-defunct twothirtyeight, Blackest Hair, Bluest Eyes has all that I loved about his old band. From the interesting lyrics to the dark undertones to the nice guitar, it nearly lives up to his past endeavors. My only complaint would be that it feels like he intended this to be the next twothirtyeight album, and resorted to doing everything himself instead of performing it with the rest of the band. While not bad, I'd have liked to see how this would have turned out with the rest of the group performing to round it out. All in all though, any fan of twothirtyeight that hasn't obtained any of Chris Staples' work owes it to themselves to pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not all that it seems","review":"The style of writing is not committed, it doesn't sound factual, one way or the other.

What Rogers \\"writes down\\" about the men in this book, isn't with clarity, there isn't definitive supporting documentation that's \\"clean\\"; some of the information can be traced, some cannot be validated.

The others have failed where the ballast fails and even a new bulb (at $20) obviously won't work. Of course you don't know it's the ballast until you fork out the $20 for a new bulb and find out the zapper is shot. Save yourself the grief and stay away from the Stinger brand all together.

After about 6 days, the plastic around the bottom of the grid was so charred that it because almost impossible to prevent it from arcing constantly. No amount of cleaning did any good. At that point the chintzy transformer in the unit burnt-out. It's now total garbage. Score - Yellowjackets: 1 - Mexican-made Stinger: 0.Round two is coming.

However if you liked his last album \\"Almost Honest\\" you will love his new one as well because the mood it tells is even happier. It's a great new album and I just have to say the word: amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd Time's the Charm!","review":"You can really see the growth in Josh's music on this, his third album. His first showed the excitement and promise of his talent, the second expanded on his lyricism, and this album, 'Just Say The Word', brings it all together in a very intriguing and entertaining way. There are a lot of singer-songwriters out there, and many are very good. Josh is in a class almost by himself, as his composition, his lyrics and his musicality are all excellent, and are presented with a beautiful voice, capable of conveying every emotion. Any CD that will take you places where you smile AND places where you feel like crying is an excellent CD to own. Had there been a couple more cuts on the CD, I would have given 5 Stars, as I kept wanting MORE!! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I found this at the library, was skeptical, had no notion of what might be lurking between the covers. This is a treasure. Rampuri is not only a unique being with a star-blessed journey that most of us who are interested in such things can only dream about - he also writes beautifully. This unfolds like good novel, and even if only a fraction of it is true (I suspect all of it is), the story is amazing on a host of levels. I have been to India several times, lived in ashrams, studied Yoga there, been with great masters, but this - my God, what an adventure, it makes my pilgrimages seem like they were taken in an armchair. The ending reminds me of one of my favorite books \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" - an unexpected, shocking and enlightening BOOM! Great job, Ram Puri-ji, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...","review":"Rampuri succeeds here in doing what so many spiritual teachers have not been able to accomplish finding the words and images to convey that we all cannot escape the play of the universe in an unfolding story orchestrated by the gods above. As characters in the divine drama, we make mistakes but keep persevering as we try to do good and open our hearts to others.This is a very inspiring work on a subject that deserves more exploration. Rampuri has given us much to think about with his rich reservoir of fresh images. His advice is simple and sound: \\"God is living His secret life through you. Take a moment to contemplate, feel, and taste this delicious truth. Take a lifetime to live it and celebrate it.\\" I saw him speak inBend and was amazed to see a Caucasian man sitting among ash covered sadhus, who revered him with as much respect as each other. The video of initiations gives us a rare peek into their lives that should be shown on PBS, not at a yoga center."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jai Jai","review":"If you have been to India you can relive the smells and sights of that phantasmagoria in Baba.

We easily could have understood his anger without the profanity. Some creative liberties were taken as well, but they didn't harm the Biblical account too harshly. A few scenes weren't how the Bible depicted it but no doctine was damaged by the changes presented. It was basically the language. The wrestling scene was poorly done and Esau's reaction to Jacob's return wasn't presented 100% Biblical but no harm there. The best feature was the representation of the family dinamics between the sons and their parents... especially Jacob's actions at the coersion of his mother, but the language prevents me from sharing it freely with my children or other church members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up!","review":"One of my favorites out of the Bible Collection. It sticks the closest to bible, though it is not word for word and it does take some creative liberties. It picks up with depicting a confused Jacob, not really understanding his call in life or hearing from God. If gives a small back drop for Jacob's and Esau's character. In the movie you will see Isaac bless Jacob, Jacob's dream at Bethel, Jacob's, Leah's, and Rachel's relationship, Laban's deceitfulness...Also the part I loved the best is the way they depicted Jacob and God wrestling. I really love this movie. I do want to add, you enjoy it better if you read the bible first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A faithful and education retelling of the narrative","review":"The film is a faithful retelling of the story of Jacob (played by Matthew Modine) the Patriarch of Israel, and begins with Jacob's wayward brother Esau (Sean Bean), selling his birthright for a bowl of pottage. And Jacob's trickery of Esau out of his blessing by their father Isaac (Joss Ackland) at the urgings of his wise mother Rebecca (played with panache by Irene Papas)The film really picks up after Jacob has fled to Haran and the tender story of his love for Rachel (heer beauty and intelligence shown magnificently by the pretty Lara Flynn Boyle) and his relationship with his other wife Leah (Juliet Aubrey) who he learns to love too, not blaming her for the deceit of their father Laban (Giancarlo Giannini) the deceiver.Ends with Jacob's apparent reconciliation with ESau,and the crossing of him and his wives and ten children back into the Promised Land.Fairly engaging but not gripping-a faithful and education retelling of the narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"X rated Bible story ???","review":"I agree with the other reviewers regarding Esau using profanity time and time again.

We are taking it back to go with our initial pick of the Triuph DXL it is just like it just doesnt' go to 100lbs but it is alot smaller base wise to fit it in any car. Yes we will need another car seat after she reaches 40lbs but my 3 yr old still isn't 40lbs so I am not too worried about moving her that soon since she is only 7 months old.

The author has always done a good job in these large overview books and he has maintained that level here.He has been working with contacts from this agency for years so there is some interesting inside info that will be new to the reader, but a lot of the really interesting stuff has been spelled out in an number of other books or TV programs.

I love that her books all sort of tie together somehow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossibly boring","review":"This book starts out in an interesting fashion. Unfortunately, it quickly becomes a mire of dysfunctional people caught up in unbelievable situations. While the story line could have some potential, and the historical line should be interesting and exciting, it does not come together to be a good evening read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice book ... but not Jude's best","review":"I am a big fan of Jude Deveraux, but unfortunately this book did not live up to my expectations, it started off wonderful and I really felt captivated by the refugee Noblewoman Nicole and had been reduce to working for a snobby english woman, but frankly after having that man threat her so horrible all those times I just wanted to reach in the book and slap her silly! I was routing for Wes to get her in the end! Now that would of been a twist!Not Jude's best work but its still worth reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah","review":"I genreally like Ms. Deveraux's work and picked up Counterfeit Lady expecteing another sucess. The book started off pretty good and I began to like Nicole, however it droned on and on, never really picking up, Clay treated Nicole horriably and she still loves him etc. It was painful to read because I just wanted Nicole to see the light and get over the egocentric Clay. And then there was Bianca who seemed to be trying to be a minor charcter but failed because she took up too much of the plot. The love between the two main charcters was so phony, and I kept reading it because I had hope it would pick up, however I was let down with the incrediably random and easy way out ending. I came to like Clay's friend Wes more than Clay himself. The book had good parts where Nicole shows her strength as a proud woman, but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the wasted space."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so disappointed with this book","review":"I haven't finished this book yet, but I find it so annoying that I want to warn other readers to avoid it. The characters are not believable; they are all too often clumsily portrayed in broad strokes of black and white. The depiction of Bianca is an insult to all overweight women. Apparently her weight is indicative of her villainy. (...) Nicole is too sweet and virtuous to be true, not to mention being something of a doormat. And if she is part of the former French aristocracy, how is it that she knows the recipes for so many complex dishes? Aristocrats didn't cook for themselves; they had servants. There are so many other holes in the plot that they distract from the storyline. If you're considering purchasing this book, please don't waste your money. If you want to read a really entertaining romance, try \\"The Thin Woman\\" by Dorothy Cannell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it but...","review":"The premise for this book is what caught my attention but the story itself disappointed, especially as a huge J. Deveraux fan. I liked Nicole's character and the contrasting view of the very bloody French revolution with 18th century revolutionary America and, because of it, I think this story could have been something so much more... but the character development and the relationship development was uneven AND voluminous... sometimes less is more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work.....","review":"I love Jude Deveraux, however this one is missing the usual Deveraux flair. The main characters were weak and confusing, the heros' friend was stronger and much more likable than the weak-willed, wimpy, main character- and the plot almost predicitable, this is the first book of Jude Deveraux's that I WAS able to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell in love with Clayton!","review":"I read this book years ago and recently re-read it.

I was drawn to the heroine but not so much to the hero. While I was reading, I kept wondering at Clay's stupidity where he had this incredible once in a life opportunity to be with a woman who loved him at the depth that Nicole did. It was obvious that Nicole loved him from the beginning but Clay in response did not appreciate her as say his best friend and everyone else. And his dog in the manger attitude annoyed me to no end. But thankfully, he came back to his senses at the end although he almost lost Nicole."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON BIANCA'S WEIGHT","review":"I thought this book was a DISSAPOINTMENT.NEVERMIND the predictable and at times boring plot, Ms. Deveraux doesn't seem to know any other way to describe Bianca other than \\"fat\\", \\"plump\\", \\"swollen\\", \\"so fat when she sits, she can't get up\\", \\"her eyes were lost in her fat swollen face\\"...etc. I don't know how many different ways Jude Deveraux feels the need to describe Bianca as overweight or how many different characters needed to tell her so. Wherever the name Bianca was, there was an insult to her weight and she eventually took on name \\"The Fat Woman\\". It was unneccessary and took over the whole story. Instead of spending so much time on describing how repulsive Bianca was because of her weight, Ms. Deveraux should have been developing a stronger, more meaningful plot with likable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendously bad","review":"Waste of paper and ink. I ended up using it to line my bird cage and feed a cozy fire in my fireplace.I felt the characters had no depth and the writing had no richness at all to it. It read like \\"Jane ran to catch the ball. Run Jane Run!\\" Also there were long episodes filled with nothing of any importance. The love scenes were entirely uninspired.I was also insulted by her portrayal of Bianca, the constant references to her weight as if it was of any pertinence to how evil and childish the character is. Very stereotypical: Bianca is fat, lazy and bad, Nicole is thin, hard working and good. Jude also seemed to waste what little sense of humor she has on describing how fat Bianca is and begins to sound like a kindergartener teasing a classmate. That alone would make me hate the book, but there's also the [disappointing] writing and meandering, predictable, boring plotline.I'd only use this book to prop up a broken table leg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin is good, fat is evil?","review":"I found myself speed reading most of the time. It started off quite well and I thought that I would enjoy it. But there was no sparkle between the 2 main characters. There is no depth to the characters. There isn't the essence of either humour or a heart wrenching love story. I found it annoying that so much emphasis was put on Bianca's weight, as though it made her a more evil character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Unbelieveable and not Jude Devereaux's Best","review":"Many other readers have written reviews so this will be short. I found Clayton to be just plain stupid, weak, and an all around jerk. Although I know this is just a story it's totally unbelieveable. I just could not believe that a rich supposedly smart man could fall to Bianca's blackmail, especially at this particular time period. Bianca is hateful and mean. Nicole is too good to be true. I love Jude Devereaux's books, but I hated this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had a real hard time with this one...","review":"Maybe it's just me but doesn't the main character lack any heroic qualities whatsoever. I never fell for this guy. He was weak and kinda sick in the head. This weird fixation (Bianca) on the image of his past weird fixation (brother's wife) really seemed on the verge of insanity. The only one who I was endeared to was Nicole. She stayed strong and in most cases wore the pants in this book.I truly felt sorry for the spoiled, Bianca. Nobody deserves to be treated so nasty but most especially it should not be made out to be a good thing to call people some pretty aweful names. In the beginning of the book she was just a spoiled, pampered brat but after being ridiculed and verbally abused. Even the children were allowed to treat her badly.I just didn't care much for this book. I can honestly say it was not a bad read but I felt I was disagreeing with the author the entire time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This Brush!","review":"Don't know what product the first reviewer was rating but it could not have been this particular nail brush.

At track 3, Steinman's exaggerated lyric and music kick in and for a minute you'll remember what is fun about the Bat Out of Hell series. Meatloaf sings well throughout, but only on the Steinman cuts do you find that ridiculous mix of faux operatic vocals and outrageous orchestration that made both he and Meatloaf famous. The rest is just a pastiche of the work that came before (but I do think the Dianae Warren contribution \\"Cry Over Me\\" works well for Meat) and pales in comparison. If you want to hear some more Steinman/Meatloaf this might be your last opportunity so take the good with the bad and skip over the other cuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego kills!","review":"So after all the crap Loaf went through to get this made, the lawsuits etc, it ends up being a big flop (very very low sales and off the charts in a few weeks)! He decides to make the CD without Steinman, who is the songwriter, producer, and genius behind Meat Loafs entire career (The first two Bat albums). With all it's slick production, and even using the Steinman written songs, this CD is a pale imitation of the first two. It doesnt sound the same at all. None of the Steinman songs sung by Meat Loaf on his own have ever sounded the same. The CD sounds over dramatic, like a rock opera but it isnt appealing. I heard it 3-4 times and was through. I cant play it anymore, it's boring! I still play the original Bat CD and Part II for many years now without getting tired of them. Now that Loaf has blown it, there will never be another Bat Out Of Hell CD, and his career will be forever glorified on the success of the first two Steinman productions which remain masterpieces!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"Meat Loaf is back!

If you want to buy cds that only have the chart hits on it, buy the singles... And comparing it to Bat out of Hell I and II, each album is meant to be different, and each album was recorded at different stages in Meatloaf career.... If you want Bat out of Hell I, buy Bat out of Hell I. Anyway approach this album for a new sonic experiance and you will be pleasantly suprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Definitely NOT the Meatloaf I have come to expect.

I tried so desperately to like this album. I listened to it again and again, but it just didn't click. Bat One is, in my opinion, one of the great albums of all time; I have listened to it since it came out in the 70s and have never grown tired of it. Bat Two was a bit weaker, yet still quite good. I looked very forward to this third installment, and my initial disappointment has not abated. After several months of attempting to like this album, I am sure it will likely never again be heard on my stereo. But, that being said, I will happily pull out Bat Two, and especially Bat One."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a classic but it grows on you","review":"Meat Loaf's voice has never been better but the quality of songs on Bat I and II was vastly superior. \\"The Monster Is Loose,\\" \\"In the Land of the King...\\" and \\"If It Ain't Broke...\\" are excuses for shouting. On the other hand, the duets are all terrific, and \\"Alive\\" and \\"Blind As A Bat\\" are exceptional. Onbe other complaint: the album could have been five minutes shorter and not lost a thing. \\"Seize The Night\\" seems to drag on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Bat!","review":"Here it is, the long-awaited finale to the \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" series. And this one is *dark*. It's depressing. It's melancholy. It's angry. Meat Loaf has crafted a real downer here. Don't get me wrong, this is a great album. Meat's voice has never sounded better, and the songwriting by Steinman and others is top-notch. But BOY, I didn't expect this. The songs practically drip with loss and regret. The future is seen as bleak, the past as a tormenting enemy. This is how the saga ends...in despair and blackness.But wait! Counterbalancing the hopelessness of tracks like \\"The Future Ain't What It Used To Be\\" is the angry defiance of \\"Alive\\" and \\"Seize the Night\\". Meat's not going down easy.Yet the disc ends with the barren but beautiful \\"Cry to Heaven\\". It's all over, the monster is not only loose but victorious. The guy on the bike on the album cover loses, the angel is doomed, turn out the lights, so long.But what a listen! Five stars and a classic in the making."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I cant say enough about how good this album really is to listen to...not for the faint of heart...this album is meant to be played loud!

It has some Steinman cuts....but if you want to hear them done right, check out Pandora's Box 'Original Sin'.

This album sucks. The original BOOH is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest albums of all times. Also, I am a big Queen fan and think Brian May is perhaps the best guitarist of all times. I also like Steve Vai. As a teenager, I was a fan of Motley Crue (at least their first 3 albums) and was intrigued that Nikki Sixx co-wrote a song.But it's all smoke and mirrors. The only high point on this disappointing CD is Marion Raven's voice. SHE can sing! Everything else is over-prodouced, over-dramatic and under-performing.Borrow a friend's copy of this CD before spending $14 for your own copy.

Let me just say that Jim Steinman's participation was sorely missed when they made this album. For one thing, I have the distinct sense that this was somehow meant to be a country album. (Just listen to the duets he does...told ya.) It's always been difficult for Meat Loaf to get into the groove when recording in the studio and this album is no exception. There's just very little pizzaz. If you want to hear many of the songs on this album done the RIGHT way, grab a copy of Steinman's/Pandora's Box's \\"Original Sin\\" and kick back. What a difference! BOH III is, in my opinion, more for completists and devoted fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"BAT OUT OF HELL 3","review":"My first reaction was that I was disappointed. And this disappointment sort of justified me, being in the dark about the existence of this current CD. I just recently learned about it on Biography channel, when they featured Meatloaf. I own all of Meatloaf CDs, most are rated from okay to great. H-o-w-e-v-e-r, after listening to this CD several times, it finally draws out or stirs up the emotions of the previous 2 Bat of hell cd's. Of the 3 Bat out of hell cd's, this one is third best; and better then Meatloaf's other titled cd's. If you were to own only one of Meatloaf's cds this would not to be the number 1. But if you had a budget for 3 cd's, buying Bat out of hell 1, 2 and 3 would certainly be worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is a lemon and I want my money back","review":"I can't figure out why anyone gave this a good review. Bat out of Hell I and II have been on my top ten list for years. Listening to emotion, lyrics, and compositions in awe. The compositions in Bat of out Hell III are forced and contrived.

As stated this album is a lemon and I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"the meatloaf spoiled!","review":"first let me say I have all of Meatloafs CDs, most replaced the records I have.

I found that only tracks 4, 8, and possibly 11 really deliver. Track 2 is supposed to be of some acclaim, but it just didnt' do it for me, and don't even get me started about track 12 which starts off magnificently and then just goes horribly wrong. This can't be a trilogy because a Bat Out Of Hell IV is now needed for Steinman and Meat to redeem themselves. Save your money on the album and just buy selected tracks from iTunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this!","review":"I've been a fan of Meatloaf since the beginning and always thought he was before his time. Bat Out of Hell 1 was a masterpiece. Part 2, while not up to it's predecessor, had some acceptable tracks.

The first two albums at least had the theme of a Motorcycle given the albums an impression that it was like a soundtrack for a road movie. The motorcycle road movie theme seems missing on this particular album, apart from the album cover artwork. There also seemed to be an emotional content missing somewhere and the album itself wasn't telling me a story like I was on some mystical journey.The songs I do like on this album are \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" by Jim Steinman, \\"Cry Over Me\\" by Dianne Warren, \\"If God Could Talk\\" by Desmond Child. However \\"Cry Over Me\\" sounds a bit weird because it is written from a female perspective. The other songs on the album didn't do more for me, even the Steinman penned songs.This album isn't my cup of tea and I would advise anyone contemplating getting it to at least listen to it first to make up their own minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bat is Burned Out","review":"By Bat Out of Hell 3, Meat Loaf's creative spark and energy is spent. Again recycling some Steinman songs as he did on Bat 2, Meat's versions pale in comparison to the originals. I do like this version of It's All Coming Back To Me Now but that's one of few highlights, and really that song was never great to begin with. If you like the original Bat Out Of Hell album, do not get more Meat Loaf albums get Jim Steinman's Bad For Good and Ellen Foley's Night Out, both which are masterpieces. Bat 3 just doesn't cut it, and hearing him butcher Jim's old songs can be painful. The lead off track is pretty good and has an obvious Nikki Sixx influence. It's really the only good track on this CD.Standout track: The Monster's Loose"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steinman Did Not Dissapoint","review":"I am a Meat Loaf fan, more importantly a Jim Steinman fan, and a Brian May fan. This CD did not dissapoint! Although many of the tracks follow a Steinman formula, it is that formula that has made his previous work--\\"work.\\" Some of the short tracks are forgettable, but \\"Seize the Night\\" makes it all forvigable. Steinman is in true form and the orchestration is powerful and moving. Needless to say, Meat Loaf's hard-rock vocals are solid, as usual.

Luckily, she saved them to share with her little girl (me)twenty four year later. Judy, as others have said, is so much better than Nancy Drew. She's a realistic heroine and a great role model. She's also a great feminist who doesn't let the guys in the novels get the glory. Not only that, but she still seemed cool in the eighties. As an adult, I have been searching for more of these books to complete the collection. Thankfully, they've begun to reprint these timeless stories. I can't wait to share them with my little girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sydney Drew Review","review":"This book was absolutely great! I've read the Vanishing Shadow and this one and think the haunted attic is way more engaging. Judy try's to solve the mystery of the ghost in the attic plus she deals with the problem of picking the wealthy girls ( Lois) as friends or the poor mill girls! Plus, the mystery of the house has a connection with Peters past. My favorite characters in this story have to be Judy Bolton because she's a great role model.

This volume continues the story of her life. Crying Wind is a master story teller who uses her Native American background to bring truth and beauty to a story of laughter, pain, joy, adventure. Crying Wind's story is witness to the way God spans time and cultures with His love. Parents and children alike will enjoy this account of how Little Antilope, Lost Deer, Snow Cloud, and Spring Cloud grew up in their dual world with their parents Crying Wind and Don Stafford. Crying Wind tells her story compellingly, beautifully including how she adjusted to life afer Don's sudden death. This is a book for those who have seeking hearts, and all who enjoy beauty. The testimony to the strength of faith has never been more forcefully presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting book","review":"This book picked up on a similar experience that was experienced by America,the seizing of the American embassy. In the Icarus Agenda the embassy is seized by a bunch of rabid terrorists. A hero comes in the form of an American Congressman.He of course comes through. The interjection of the Isreali commandos makes this a further good read. Another conspiracy being hatched by the Vice- President and some of his followers adds another ring to the stort. The Congressman due to a leak of a mole is placed in immense danger. He manages to survive the attack of the terrorists and then line up for the Vice-Presidency after thr Vice- President dies. A very fast paced book with plenty of excitement. I wish that Ludlum would do a sequel. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Typical Ludlum","review":"If you enjoy Robert Ludlum you will enjoy this book. There is plenty of action. Kendrick, the protagonist, takes on the bad guys by himself against the odds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"OK, I love early Ludlum. That about says it. Icarus starts off too slow, never picks up and should not be signed by Ludlum at all. Wonder if that's when his books started to be ghost-written. Giving it 2 stars in case it was written by Ludlum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This was the first Ludlum book that I've been disappointed with. I found it to be slow and tedious. I kept waiting for it to pick up, but found that it never really got off the ground.This book is a rarity, a Ludlum novel I wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really quite awful","review":"This novel is frustrating, insubstantial and very very improbable. A caucasian US Congressman dons dark makeup to pass for an Arab, infiltrates a terrorist organization in Oman, convinces them he is a fellow terrorist, and somehow foils their plot. All this despite his obvious non-native accent which isn't even mentioned by Robert Ludlum. He then keeps the entire caper a secret until one covert agent recognizes him from a photograph.The only interesting plot involves a secret star chamber-like organization scheming to select the next US President. Once again logic holds no sway in this universe because the secret organization is apparently risking their lives and reputations for entirely altruistic reasons, with no personal benefit expected or desired from the new administration.Please stay away unless you enjoy smacking your forehead with the palm of your hand every 20 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's a rambling man...","review":"Read at your own risk of falling asleep. I have read 12 or more of Ludlum's books. They have always satisfied. This latest one however is just too rambling. The story line is stretched to the limit with an endless string superlatives and hyperbole. If I could return my Kindle ebook, I would. Sorry, it's just not up to his usual high level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best effort","review":"I've read everything Ludlum wrote, and this is the only one I couldn't finish. Sorry, but too difficult to follow. Not his best effort, by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read to date","review":"I only give this book one star since I can't rate it at no stars. I have read several Ludlums in the past and have enjoyed his writing but after reading this book I'm sure I won't read any more Ludlum. Ludlum books frequently start slow and start moving after a few pages but the writing in this book is unbelivably dull. Although there were some parts where it looked as though the story was going to pick up the pace, he managed to quickly turn the story back to absolute drivel within a page or two. Apparently this book was a platform for him to bore the reader rigid with political ramblings. I suggest any other Ludlum but this one - Apocalypse Watch was my first Ludlum and I enjoyed it, a first rate, tense thriller. Best thing to do with this book is to prop up a table leg with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter dissapointment","review":"Having loved the Bourne series I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book, but it was almost painful to read. The story was boring, the language was pretentious and constantly mentions the various wars and skirmishes which, although relevant to the story in the broader sense, left me lost in all the details as I am not a Middle East expert, neither do I want to be. I could not get into the story and imagine the scenes. I was completely aware that I was reading a book, and not a good one at all times.Ludlum is trying too hard to write a good book and it's very contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the last Ludlum you have when you are stranded on an Island..","review":"I am a fan of Ludlum and have liked a number of his books but this one is -1. too predictable not only on story line after the 1st book but also what the characters are going to say next.2. too long. Like other reviewers noted its supposed to be 3 books in one but it is really 2 books and that is 2 books too long.3. at the end I think he himself got bored of the book because the last operation is finished too easily and too quickly.4. the main characters can never die no matter how deadly is the disease or improbable the situation..This must have been the first review I wrote because I want others to avoid the mistake I made of starting this book. I finished the book only because I have never started one and left it midways but I was very close to letting go of that rule for this one..The Bourne series are definitely written at a different stage of his writing career."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I did see her!\\" Bernadette in her own words!","review":"In this fascinating book, the words and testimony of St. Bernadette herself are interspersed with photos, both old and current, of Lourdes and the pilgrims who have visited since the apparitions began.

Many people just don't think they're qualified to write their own prayers, or have the time to research what patron saints it'd be best to pray for in a given situation, so you've put it all together and offered it to anyone in an organized manner.

Many statements like \\"We do not know what this means,\\" littered the book with useless, inconclusive babble. The studies were purely linear in nature and provided no valid conclusions or insights into usability. It was almost as if the researchers were afraid to admit to drawing any conclusions from their findings. They also neglected to actually capture the content they were researching, the 1996 Olympic site for example, and could therefore not present pictures of the site when it went offline. Their painful admission of this fact only strengthened their lack of credibility. Read it if you'd like a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Methodology and Unsubstantiated Conclusions","review":"I found the idea for the book good, but the execution VERY poor. Their methodology was poor at best and they jumped to conclusions with very little to back them up.Here is an example of their questionable methodology: They ranked the web site based on three data points which they choose AFTER they gather a bunch of data and did some analysis.Here is an example of their jumping to conclusions: They concluded the user don't form mental models of web site solely based on the fact that they didn't use the Go menu to return to previously visited sites. I can think of many, many reasons why the users would not use the Go menu and it has nothing to do with the absence of mental models. Besides, you try to form a mental model on up to 9 sites within a maximum of 3 hours while doing a goal-orientated task."},{"rating":"2","title":"A milestone publication in web usability testing.","review":"This book is the first coherent documentation of the application of usability testing to the web that I have seen. Although I tend to question the validity of some of the statistical methods employed and the sample that the researchers used, this book is important because it addresses the need to develop a set of tools for making the web a usable place, not just a place to \\"surf\\"; it also makes the important point that the rules for usability are vastly different for web documents than any other medium tested so far.I would caution the readers that, rather than blindly apply the findings presented in this book, they should take the principles of usablility testing that are presented and develop their own tools for usability testing.All in all, I believe that this home-brewed book (it looks like it was produced on a Xerox Docutech or similar device) is a worthwhile addition to the web developer's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"False assumptions, questionable methodologies.

From the standpoint of communicating information, everything Jared and his team has put together has been validated over and over in my experience designing sites with very technical content. Spool (et al) takes into account all the idiosyncrasies human beings bring to their Web searches, whether for information or entertainment, and makes consistently valuable comments about users and how they behave when using the Web.

Jack DeJohnette is in rare form on this one, and if you know his playing then you know that's saying a lot. The groove he and George Mraz establish is always driving, in that loose but propulsive 70s way, whether they're playing a ballad or a quasi-bossa or a way-uptempo jam.Richie Beirach always sounded to me like a cross between Keith Jarrett and McCoy Tyner, and this album is a good example.

This is a 15 year old SF book that just got published, in which the Soviet Empire has taken over. This book will only appeal to people that can tolerate alternate universe stories. The writing is so terribly formula that you can see the writers checklist, i.e. violence for attention grab, wet dream scene backup, dull filler, etc. I've read hundreds of SF novels good and bad.

Easy to put together, fairly sturdy. I have now owned/used it for about 1 year. It began to squeak (which wd-40 helped) and the handle bars began sliding down. I put a set screw in each arm to hold the handles in place. Then the squeak became really pronounced so I tried to take it apart to regrease. One of the orginal screws has rusted so that it cannot come out (despite being in my family room) and when I openned the flywheel case a large amount of rubber fell out. The drive belt is slowly being eaten away where it rubs on some of the mechanism. I also noticed that one of the handles is cracking.It may be that I am working the machine fairly hard, resistance 6 or 7 and over 50 rpm, but it seems like the machine should be able to handle that. Looking at some of the other reviews, I wonder if just got a lemon. But I am going to have to find a better machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"I bought one of these machines, put it together, and had it for about three weeks. It squeaked almost right away and the handle bars were constantly falling down. During the third week, one of the supports cracked and could have thrown me off if I hadn't been careful. I took it back to the WalMart where I bought it and they gave me another one. This time I had a service technician come to my house and put it together. Even HE couldn't get this bucket of bolts to run like it was supposed to. Icon's customer service was terrible and it took them almost three weeks to get the technician back to fix what he should have fixed the first time. In short, don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. It's not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Until Something Breaks","review":"This machine has been used moderately for about a year and a half. Right after the warranty ran out, it started making squeaking noises inside. I took the machine apart, reduced the tension on the flyweel and the squeak went a way. However, this did change the tension settings.THEN, the rod that holds the right foot arm broke. After examining the broken part, it was obvious that it was poorly designed and/or manufactured. It broke right through the weld. I called customer service and they were very helpful in getting a new part ordered FOR SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS PLUS SHIPPING!!!!! This is a cheap piece of steel with a rod welded on one end. Give me a break.This was a very inexpensive machine - you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"frame broke","review":"welds around the frame broke after a couple months of use.

I was worried about the joints being bushings rather than bearings. It was fairly wobbly. At 2 weeks, the frame cracked at the base, and of course the machine was unusable at that point. I'm 155 pounds. I did get a 3 yr warranty. I'm taking the machine back and getting my money back from Walmart. I guess if you want something that will last, you probably have to dish out $600 or so. Keep reading the reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money. Buyer Beware!!!!","review":"I put this machine together and the thing will not record the amount of steps you take or time or run the programs it has. I called customer service which is near impossible to reach and there solution. They tell me to take apart the main component and adjust a switch. The adjustment does not fix the problem. Customer service with image is a joke.Now it is past 90 days and they will not replace or repair this piece of junk, even thought they never fixed the problem that was reported to them days after it was bought.I would not recommend this product or any product from Image to my worst enemy, since it did not work out of the box. Buy from a reputable company that is going to stand behind their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it only two flaws i have found","review":"i have had this for 3 years, use it regularly as does my spouse occasionally and its still working great. the handles do wobble side to side, washers fixed that. the heart rate monitor is off but i dont use it much.i have used all the functions and i really do love it! for the money its a good deal and a good piece of equipment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price you paid for","review":"I think this Elliptical is excellent. I have this machine for 1yr and a half and no problems. I just have a question thought. Did anyone knows on the display in distance? Is this is in miles? meters? or kilometers? It's my only concern. I never figure it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proceed with Caution","review":"This is a fine enough introduction to Monte Carlo scenarios, but only for the highly technically proficient reader.

People turn up missing who have been a guests at grandma's place, and a local rookie cop is trying to unravel the mystery. The teenage girl is dating the rookie cop's brother, and they have their own investigation going on.Nothing much happens in this movie until the end, when there are some ungraphic gore effects and a mummified corpse. The transfer of this film is abyssmal. You can barely make out any details when it is dark.Overall, boring and with a ridiculous ending.

I paid for it already so where is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing is poor","review":"Gave these a shot because of the price. Despite looking at all of the reviews for sizing information, they are HUGE. Short should fit snugly - but not be constricting. Instead, they are loose to the point of easily being a size too big. I am 5'8\\" and a consistent size 8 quality women's clothing. Other reviewers noted the loose waist - very accurate. If you are slim hipped, you'll have a fairly large 'gap' in the waist."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll keep looking...","review":"I'm not quite sure just what body-type these shorts were meant for. Girth-wise, they were enormous; I'm about 6 feet tall and wander around the 300 lb. mark, not only could I easily slide these sorts on-zipped up no less- but after about three steps they had completely fallen off. There is simply not enough, or too much depending on your view, \\"shorts\\" there to keep themselves up. And the way they're proportioned!? They would really benefit from about six to nine more inches of height. I figured they'd cover my navel, not hardly. They barely cover my barely! That's pretty much why they fall off; if smaller sizes are proportioned the same even dropping a size or two wouldn't help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to size","review":"Not a whole lot of information with regard to sizing on the Valeo Neoprene Shorts. Product sizing should be more detailed. I normally take a size medium and these were way too big. Amazon would not allow me to return them for a different size, which meant shipping costs to return the item and more shipping costs to re-purchase a smaller size. Also, there was NO OPTION on the return request to indicate that sizing was the reason for the return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Out of the box, the smell made me sick.

This product needs to come in a triple x small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"While the material and zipper seems to be just as good as any other Neoprene suit, the design of the waist line is absolutely HORRIBLE. There is no way to adjust the waist line, so these shorts simply slip off your buttocks by just walking around your room. Absolutely a waist of money. You might as well just purchase the entire body suit or simply just a neoprene shirt as these shorts are poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not fit","review":"the size is really not well adapted ! too large on the belly but ok for the leg... can not use it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Amazon","review":"I had recently ordered these and had receivec in the wrong color and was going to ship back.

I also bought the Everlast Body Slimmer for the same reason [...]. I thought I would use both, just alternate between the two, but the fit of the Valeo was really weird. They fit in the hips pretty well, although they were a little roomy, but around the waist I might as well have been standing in a barrel. There is no contour from the hip to the waistline. I realize these are meant to help people lose weight, and I often have this same issue with jeans--I might have better luck with a size small, but instead I will buy a second pair of the Everlast because they fit perfectly. I also like that they come up higher so when I wear a vest over the top, there is overlap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing chart on this is ALL OFF","review":"These pants in large are huge and since they're stretch, should have gotten medium.

As another reviewer pointed out, they are not form-cut, but I am after practicality and comfort and not fashion: again, they work for my purpose and are cheap. I hand wash them after every use to get the salt out. Afte six uses they are holding up. I find the medium size accurate and not the smaller \\"European sizings\\" you sometimes run into.

The seams themselves did not come apart, but the actual fabric itself split in two like a 'run' in panty hose. The third pair is still inthe box and I have not worn it, but I figure that the same thing will happen with it as well.Also, one of the pair had one leg about an inch longer then the other leg. The one leg also fit tighter and you could tell the cut was wrong.Like I said, very poor craftsmanship and materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied","review":"I am happy with the neoprene shorts, but want to warn people that they run very small.

This is the ONE Book in the Bible where we are WARNED Not to ADD OR DELETE, YET Most of the Book is TOTALLY REMOVED.

Combine this with outstanding artwork that truly captures the imagination of children and you have an excellent medium to help children grow in their appreciation for God's Church. It will also help Children to become accustomed to the language of great literature at an early age. The reading level is suitable for ages 7 or 8+, but younger children will certainly enjoy having these stories read to them, although the themes in some of these stories are clearly oriented to children of greater maturity.

For example, Jesus, a Jew, is characterized by blond hair and blue eyes; the Queen of Sheba, a white woman, only to name a few. NOT SO!If a writer is going to tell history, the words as well as the pictures should depict the truth!I give this book a rating of 1 star based on the pictures, not the contents. I returned the book for that reason!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive, racist, inaccurate","review":"I bought this because it was recommended in a Catholic homeschooling book. I was initially impressed by the beautiful art in the Old Testament section. Imagine my shock when I discovered Jesus, a middle Eastern man, depicted with blond hair and blue eyes! Of course, no one of us has actually seen Jesus, but since he was born a Jew, it is highly unlikely that he had this coloring. The text is nothing remarkable. It is not particularly friendly to very young children.

Aaron hires Kate and the story starts to progress in predictable ways. A subplot deals with Kate's real mother who is looking for her three children who were taken away from her years ago.This book doesn't offer anything new to the good old romance formula. Characters and conflicts between them are rather realistic - there are no tropical islands and mysterious millionaires here. However, this also makes plot twists somewhat unimaginative and one-dimensional. I also felt that the subplot about the reunion of Kate's family was mostly an unnecessary appendage. There are neither rewarding challenges nor anything dangerous here. I would only recommend this to someone who is willing to waste a couple of hours reading insignificant, mildly pleasing and harmless entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great color photos","review":"Like most books from Motorsport International this one has an abundance of professionally executed color photos that are reproduced well.

It scares me to think that there are actually people out in this world, reproducing, who need to read this book.Dr. Elkind expressed some valid points on the general \\"rush of society\\" - our tendency to saddle our children with competition in the adult world, but nothing that needed 221 pages of interpretation. Dr. Elkind takes an extremist position on his point of view throughout the book. Despite the books' attempts at valuable lessons, they are dissected into such meaningless pieces that any cohesive lesson is lost. The reality is we are living in a rapidly changing society, and individuals need to do their best to strive at an individual pace to attain what they perceive as success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but ENOUGH WITH THE GREATEST HITS","review":"I am a huge Selena fan and we all know she can't make any new material but the Quintanilla family is going way over board....They released All My Hits Part 1 and 2,Ones,The Ultimate Collection,and now this....The only thing thats worth buying this cd for is that all the songs are remastered...but thats it....The only thing that should be released is unreleased material or some new mixes...Let Selena rip"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent harmonica","review":"This is an absolutely excellent harmonica.

Robinson was a consensus builder who sought to grow American Express by acquisition. However his poor strategy brought him to get out of cable too early, and the brokerage age when it was too late.His rule weakened American Express. What is prevalent throughout this book is the shark like atmosphere in American business, where one person is seeking to displace another. Some heavy hitters are in this book such as Sandy Weill, Lou Gerstner, and Cohen.This is a nice book about how an American icon company is badly run. It shows how and why American companies have not fared well in the international market. The caption on the cover of the book equates it with Barbarians at the Gates, and I think this book is as good as that. A nice thorough review of what went wrong at American Express."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAPPY ENDING?","review":"Rocketship X-M is for it's time a good sci-fi effort,it was shot on a very low budget but it doesn't look like it.

In todays tech age, well it seems to simple and male oriented. However, if you put all that aside then its a good movie. If you watch the movie you will see someone in charge, like Vernen Von Braun. If you watch closly it is a two stage rocket, orbits the earth, leaves Earth with escape volocity, reverse landing, etc. It sounds very nodern. My wife and I watched it the first time and thought it was ok. I watched it a 2nd,3rd and 4th time and it got better. If you want to see a movie of the 1950s then this is the movie to watch.

Mechanical Wonder sounds quite effortless when compared to their last two albums, and has great sunny vibe to it. Simon Fowler's voice seems to have gotten better--still slightly reminiscent of George Harrison, but quite expressive in its own way. An impressive, solid album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful recording","review":"As a fan of mellow pop - for example the Cowboy Junkies, Galaxie 500, Mazzy Star, and VU's third album - I am naturally attracted to this laid-back set. The lyrics are wonderfully written and the songs sweetly crafted. If you're the type of person that needs constant action in life, gunplay and explosions in movies, and bombastic theatrics in music, then this is not the recording for you. But if you enjoy subtlety, simplicity, and contemplation, then this cd will be a wonderful addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"really boring","review":"This cd is really boring. I can't imagine that they were motivated enough to go to the trouble of making it.

It has great reviews, looks good...HOWEVER, our small daughter can pull the WHOLE thing across our hardwood floors. It is EASY to open the place where you put sand or water to weigh it down. We've already had major spills. AND she can climb the pole and tip the whole thing over.We are NOT happy. Our daughter loves the toy but I would NEVER leave her alone with this toy. EVER!!! If you have a strong and/or determined to climb toddler - do NOT get this toy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wine","review":"This book was recommended to me and I am so grateful to the person who did. I have not finished reading it yet as it is quite a hefty volume. For anyone interested in reading John's gospel from an unusual perspective, I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Stated, Read this book and its prequel.","review":"Others have commented on the story, so I will simply state that this is a great book that further develops the characters introduced in the prior Zahn Star Wars stories. I loved it. And some of the questions this leaves unanswered are addressed in Outbound Flight. Read both, but read this first as this was written first and you will appreciate Luke and Mara's mindset better in Survivor's Quest if you are also learning as they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This has to be one of the worst books ever written for the Star Wars Expanded Universe. The story doesn't seem suspenseful at all and is very slow. I gave up this one after the first 150 pages.This was a major disappointment especially coming from such a good writer as Zahn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the hand of thrawn","review":"Survivors Quest was much better than the hand of thrawn series by Zahn. Some parts were slightly predictable, but it was still a good read. Though the book doesn't quite enthrall the reader like Heir to the Force. All in all a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars The new jedi order","review":"A awesome book by Zahn. Best writer of star wars ever. Umm I made it a 5 because its with only Luke and Mare, my two favorite characters, and its a mystery too. 10th grade reading level"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best Effort","review":"This was a complete disappointment. I really looked forward to reading another Timothy Zahn Star Wars novel but this was boring, predictable, and had poor character development throughout. The relationship between Luke and Mara was barely explored except with some \\"mystical Jedi nonsense\\". Mr.Zahn's previous efforts for the series were outstanding---what a shame this did not meet his own standard of excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money for Nothing","review":"Wasn't I excited when I found out that Timothy Zahn would be writing a new Star Wars novel. Great I thought. One of my favourite authors writing for my favourite past time again. I devour Star Wars literature at an expensive rate. Also it was to be about the Outbound Flight Project. Another Great. How was my dissapointment after I read it. Not up to Zahn's usual high standards. What does this novel tell you. Nothing much except contardict a lot of established expanded universe information. The fact that nothing much is revealed is the big killer. All it is, is an excuse to forfill a contract. Living in Australia books are expensive. Paying $40 for a hardcover that wasnt any good is very frustrating. Like Planet of Twilight all over again. Zahn let himself down and he let down a lot of star wars fans. It wasn't a \\"fantastic read\\" or deserved the comment \\"zahn is back\\", no the comment that it really deserves is this. \\"Lucasbooks and Timothy Zahn suck people in again with crap\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"i love timothy zahn!","review":"i love the way he writes, and the universe he develops. this book is awesome. the only problem is, when it ends, i am left wanting more. i really hope he continues his story with luke and mara, and the rest of the star wars 'verse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable","review":"I have read almost all of the SW universe novels... this one was predictable and dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUTBOUND FLIGHT DID NOT CRASH ON NIRAUAN!","review":"This is definitely the least appealing of Zahn's full-length Star Wars books. But I said that in another review which I seem to have deleted.I'm beginning to think that certain reviewers may not be reading the books very thoroughly, to put it mildly. Why? As the title of this review states, OUTBOUND FLIGHT DID NOT CRASH ON NIRAUAN.It's just that the text material in the book jacket says that it did. No big deal... I guess some so-called \\"editor\\" has some problems with reading comprehension.From reading one review, it's like the reviewer only read the book jacket, while being compelled to put out a 5-star review. I don't see why anyone who actually read the book would think that Nirauan was the crash site. Nirauan was merely the site for the meeting between L&M; and the Chiss government.Nirauan's defining feature is a huge fortress in the shape of a hand. No crashed Outbound Flight dreadnaughts, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"good premise that never went anywhere","review":"boring and disappointing. you think hmmm luke and mara and crew going to investigate the wreckage of outbound flight, sounds interesting right? well it didn't turn out that way. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"It's a good read even though it isn't Timothy Zahn best Star Wars novel, but never the less, a great Star Wars title."},{"rating":"1","title":"I barely made it out alive","review":"I have fond memories of the Heir to the Empire 3 books and couldnt remember why I stoped reading Zahn's work. I wanted a scifi book for a long flight and I picked up Zahns Survivor's Quest. Then I remembered why I stopped reading his work, this book, like all the others I read after Heir 3, are dull trodding titles that have none of the fun of the first 3.

However, this was a substandard release that is less than happy. This music is closer to Gabber/Hardcore without the uplifting feeling of the rave scene. I was extremely saddened by its mislabeled packaging. There is no happy in this hardcore music. I would give it 3 out of five stars as a hardcore album, but it is too simplistic to keep any listener occupied.

The plot is marvellously rich, with Ken as an extremely strong main charecter. This book deserves a place on every bookshelf, no matter how old. The author obviously knows horses very well and can relate to them through her writing. I reccomend this book to anyone, but mostly for people who really love horses."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is interesting and a good reading choice.","review":"This book was different. It is about a boy named Ken and about some horses. The book switches from Ken to the horses. Its sort of like two stories that are so intertwined it is one. This review doesn't do a whole lot for the book, I am only 15 so its not like I write reviews a lot anyway, but trust me the book is good. I reccomend this book for people who like to read. Its sort of hard to follow at times, but thats okay. If you can't tell from the title, this story has a romantic twist. This book is good and thats really all I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying Ending","review":"I found this, the third novel in the Flicka series, a satisfying ending to the whole story, which started with the Goose Bar ranch in financial trouble and Ken in trouble for daydreaming, and then for choosing Flicka as his horse. In this book, Ken is a young man with a love interest. Thunderhead, son of Flicka, is causing trouble by stealing mares from other ranches. While I liked the story, I didn't find it as \\"visual\\" as the two previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book!","review":"This book is only 121 pages. Also, it is a paperback. I paid $11 +shipping from Munn books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Informative at the same time","review":"I always love reading stories set in Scotland, Ireland and England, especially historical novels and this one did not fail my expectation. Flora McDonald was depicted as a very loyal and strong character in the book. I was always intrigue of Prince Charles as I am not very familiar with Scottish history but this book moved me and I did some research to make more sense of the story. This book can make you laugh, smile, feel sad, and sympathize for those early settlers in America that are thorn between the Whigs and the Tories. Flora was one of them, she wanted peace just like her husband Allan but they were seeking it in two different ways. Fighting for the Hanoverian crown in England or joining the rebels who are tired of \\"taxation without representation.\\" Just pick up a copy of this book because it is worthy of your time.

Extremely recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a mess","review":"I started reading this book today and I've only made it through two chapters and the only reason I read two is because I thought I should give the book another chance after reading the first chapter. I'm really not sure where the author is going with this book, it just doesn't seem to make sense to me. I felt he was not writing this book to tell the story of Lucas's life but in stead writing in literary confusion. It did not grab me at all. So I came here to see what other people thought of this book and I'm glad it wasn't just me. This book is a mess. Glad I got it from the library and didn't spend the $27 for it. There are other books that tell of the creative work and business of George Lucas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slaughter of a legend","review":"Fans of George Lucas or his work should not read this book. Baxter has nothing positive to say either about Lucas the man or any of his films. While the narrative is generally factual, he seems to take every opportunity to attack the subject as a misanthrope, a poor businessman, an exploiter of others, and generally a maker of worthless films. Furthermore, there is practically nothing in this volume that can't be found in a work that doesn't tear Lucas down.I don't know why John Baxter decided to write this book. Why does a self-proclaimed world-class writer invest the years of research, then proceed to write 400 pages on a subject that clearly means nothing to him?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Collection","review":"This is a great collection...some old and some new but it gives you choices between 1 mile through 4.

I purchased them after giving birth. It was a great way to get back into shape and a great aerobic exercise for getting your energy level up after having a baby. The weighted balls segments on the 1 mile walk video made dramatic changes in my arms and shoulders. What a complement it is to have people tell you that you look as if you've never carried a baby, four months after giving birth. I started her 1 and 2 mile series 6 weeks after the birth of my child and I've been hooked on her exercise series ever since. The steps are not difficult to follow.

I am down ten pounds in three weeks, while getting a little toning. It's like being in her studio. I do the 1 and 4 mile in the morning, the 2 and 3 mile in the evening. Or whatever, depending on how much time I have. You can mix however you like. I pop in the dvd sometimes 3 in the morning. Once you start, you can't stop.

The first workout is perfect for beginners...no complicated choreography, very little space required to do the workout, but it got my heart rate up and I feel it not just in my legs but in my upper body as well. I assume that the other workouts will be just as effective, and it's nice to get so many on a single DVD so I don't have to buy anything else as I progress!NEUTRAL - This comes with a stretchy band, but you don't use it in the first workout, so I have no idea how well it works yet.CON - Not conS because so far I only found one...in the first workout they use the \\"walk away weighted balls\\" which the description of the video didn't mention that you'd need. I have looked online even on Leslie's site and they no longer offer these, and I am not sure how much they weigh to get something comparable, so I just used some light hand weights that I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Way to Start Exercising","review":"I noticed on of my girlfriends was shedding weight steadily.

I have a flatter stomache and much more energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Steps but great workout","review":"I love this workout - absolutely perfect for someone just starting out as it has 4 different programs from which to choose. Leslie also shows you how to modify the simple moves so anyone can follow along. I did the 1 mile the first time and found that too easy so the next day did the 2 mile. After doing these exercises 3 times a week for 5 weeks I am now at the point that the 4 mile workout is almost too easy and I am now looking for something a little more challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets you moving !!!!","review":"I love this DVD.

We not only heve them in our pens we also built holders to mount them on the walls in our kitchen, we even put one on the fence outside by the pool. I did have to call the breeder and ask them about the leaking issue, the trick is to create a vacum when you fill the bottle by first filling them then place your finger over the hole while you invert the bottle then let some water out over your sink by pressing the ball with your finger till the water stops fllowing, using this method non of my bottles ever drip after hung up, i agree directions could be clearer however if you want to eliminate water bowls this is the way, disregard all the people that say they drip...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for out door use!","review":"I bought this dog bottle because the package says for \\"cages\\" and I needed one for use in my dog's crate.

After writing back and forth with a company rep., she finally told me that bottles larger than 32oz are not meant for crate use.

My male great dane wasn't particularly interested in it, but at least he HAD it in case he wanted to drink.

I chose this bottle because of its size. At 1/2 gallon, it will last for about 1 1/2 to 2 days.Some other reviewers have complained about leakage. My experience has been that it will drip for a minute or two when it's just been filled, as it hasn't yet built up enough vacuum to hold the water in. You can help this along by inverting the bottle and squeezing it once or twice prior to attaching it to the crate, which will build up a vacuum. I used to do that, but I don't anymore because (1) it doesn't drip that much water anyway, and (2) my dog sees the dripping and comes right on over and drinks from the bottle and then it doesn't drip anymore.I'm very happy with the product and will buy another when this one wears out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked all the time.","review":"I was going to return this product but unfortunately I had placed it somewhere and couldn't find it again until too late.

I tried to find at least one song that I could play, ie, listen to fully through without cutting it out because it was unappealing to my ears. So far nothing.

From the offensively hysterical Undertaker Sketch to the immortal Spam, this DVD has some of the Pythons' best work. It also contains one of my all-time favorites, the faulty Hungarian-English phrasebook, with such laugh-out-loud lines as \\"Would you like to come back to my place, bouncy bouncy?\\" and \\"My nipples explode with delight!\\"This DVD catches the Pythons after their initial rougher (but still funny) beginnings and before the strife within the troupe started weakening their work.

The series began with the recenly widowed Jane as she helps to solve the murder of a local housekeeper in Grime and Punishment and has continued with other murders and personal events. Note the clever titles based on other well known book titles.For the most part I have enjoyed all of Ms. Chruchill's books and Fear of Frying is no exception.

He communicates why we need salvation, how we are saved, and who is our Savior. He explains the message of Christ in simple terms, answering typical questions one may have about Christ and salvation.If you have been a Christian for a long a time, nothing in this book will surprise you - which is good. This book is a great tool for anyone who is struggling with their faith or anyone confused about faith actually is."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Fiction\\" at its WORST.","review":"So McGinnis takes a few plane flights and is an expert on Alaska? What a joke. He also talks about a Moses Lake, Oregon! Moses Lake is in Washington, not Oregon. His poorly researched book and his foul language and racist attitude are OFFENSIVE. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty language...waste of time.","review":"Save your money on this book and buy \\"Looking for Alaska\\" by Peter Jenkins instead. \\"Going to Extremes\\" was a total waste of my time. His non-stop foul language and embelished stories seems a front to sell books and cover up for the fact that he may not have even been there at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTELLIGENT AND ADDICTING","review":"This magnificiently written \\"fly-on-the-wall\\" narrative about The Last Frontier is pretty dead-on and holds up after 20 odd years later. I have travelled many portions of the state on leisure expeditions and felt his emotions throughout each page. The most valuable asset of this book is its ability to both entertain the sourdough among us and in addition vividly depict the Alaskan aura for those who have never been. There are no slow moments: witty, poignant, and eloquent structure make this the most enjoyable book I have ever read - in actual fact, it is the Only book I have ever read whereas upon finishing the last page, I immediately began reading again! Favorite anecdote: In describing the residents of Alaska as thinking about Alaska all the time as if it was an entity onto itself in their lives, he states that this is a unique state of mind in that you would not, say, find people walking around Toledo contemplating the \\"Essence of Ohio\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characterization!","review":"I read this book in the early 90's, just before I moved to Alaska. After spending 9 years in the Last Frontier, I still loved this book. One of the things I like best about it is that McGinnis doesn't romanticize the state and its people, as so many seem wont to do. His characterization is right on, and his descriptions are accurate...a number of folks ARE quirky, eccentric, social misfits looking to escape the trappings of \\"down south\\", and not everything works the way it's supposed to. You never know what to expect in Alaska, and I think McGinniss paints a humorous and accurate story of our 49th state."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Hand Experience","review":"My wife and I happened to be included in Joe's book. I spent time with him during his Brooks Range hike. Joe was a great companion and had a unique way of making us all laugh. His version of the hike is amazingly accurate and sensitive to the character of the land. He has the unique ability to make you laugh at him and youself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Alaska","review":"This is an essential book on Alaska, both an extreme adventure book and a book that starts to tell the story of why Alaska attracts the people it does. Many great people and stories, I only wish it were much longer and even more detailed. By the way, be warned but actually I think you'll appreciate the old-fashioned politically incorrect tell-it-like-it-ism."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is How it Was!","review":"Joe McGinniss catches the heartbeat of Alaska during pipeline days. He is right on the money! (No pun intended). It would be interesting if he wrote another book about Alaska now, with oil at its high, with our Governor running for Vice President, with many of our elected representatives under indictment or already indicted for a variety of crimes. It would make a real pot-boiler & page-turner! Please think about it Mr. McGinniss.Alaska is a state that accepts differences and welcomes eccentricity. No one judges you by how you dress, what zip code you live in or your last name. It is a place of extremes in many ways. I can't say that I fact checked all of what Mr. McGinnis writes about but I can say that I have heard some of the same stories and other stories that are close enough to those he tells that I believe him. If you want to read a book that is off the beaten track about Alaska, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rada cutlery","review":"I have used rada cutlery for years.

They are the only knives I have that I know I will always have sharp because if they start to get dull I quickly and easily sharpen them with the Rada sharpener.Normally I either purchased them from our local Eagles organization or at resale stores. I had no idea that Amazon sold them until I wanted to get a set for our daughter. I was tired of trying to cut up things when visiting her, using her knives.This is a great price for these knives and a nice variety of sizes. You can't go wrong by purchasing these knives and also the sharpener to go with it. The sharpener also works on other knives. Just note that because the handles are brushed aluminum they will turn a bit dark and dull if put into the dishwasher. I find it is well worth it and always send them through the dishwasher anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ocean Blue color is PURPLE.","review":"I was making a costume for Halloween and drove far to get this stuff, as my local store was out of Rit.

I gave it one more shot because the ad for it showed a blue cap and described it differently--but what I received is the same old (new) one with the dark green cap and the unappealing scent. I'm thinking of switching to Weleda Sage--more pricey but seems to work well, and it smells better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks badly and causes skin reaction (for me)...","review":"I was looking for an alternative to toxic deodorants, and decided to try Aubrey Organics -E Plus High C Roll On, per the suggestion of a sales clerk at a local natural supplement store. Made with (potentially) great ingredients like aloe leaf juice, grapefruit extract, lavender, and calamine and rose water, it sounded safe enough. What I didn't realize was how messy this would be, that it would smell awful and completely burn my skin (after shaving). It does work against bad BO (Body Odor), but, that is about all. I really wish I could give this a higher rating. It is just challenging to to find an effective deodorant made without aluminum, triclosan or other harsh ingredients.The search continues...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aubrey Organics Deodorant","review":"I use this product, and it did wear off one day for both my husband and me.

I have never had this deodorant fail me again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work at all","review":"This did not work at all for me. I might as well have been applying water to my armpits. Actually, that might have worked better. This stuff has a decent smell which is very mild. I wish it would have worked. If you're searching for a natural deodorant, Weleda spray deodorant and Queen Helene mint julep deodorant worked better for me. Another thing that works is applying Dr Bronner's liquid soap as a deodorant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really work and has an odd odor.","review":"I thought the scent of this was earthy and kind of nice...until I read the other reviewer that said it smells like bug spray. I hate to say it but they're right. It pretty much smells exactly like bug spray, which I guess isn't a noxious odor but it's not a fragrance one tends to seek out especially when you don't want to smell. It also didn't really work so by the end of the day I smelled like b.o. and bug spray. Really gross. I'm going to have to keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for stinky woman","review":"I am a very stinky woman, having evidently two different bacterial flora in opposite pits, as odor different on both sides. So i had a hard time finding even the toxic deodorants that helped. I had been using toxic Degree for years. But had read about dusting with baking soda. How's it supposed to stay on? I had gotten all other toxins out of my life (baking soda instead of shampoo works great), but I just lived in fear of offending others on the pit department. Finally, itching pits forced me to make a decision.So I bought 4 different natural deodorants. One was the crystal, which also works great but is a pain to apply, and one was this, Aubreys. It works great for me the most stinky and dealing with more than one skin flora. Also applied to skin folds of belly and it eliminates the need to use antifungals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"The deodorant works OK against body odor, but it has a somewhat strong and not too pleasant smell itself that is unlikely to be noticeable by others in a social setting, but I find it distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aubrey Organics","review":"This is the best product that I have tried to date.

In fact, it stinks! Waste of money. Better to go without."},{"rating":"1","title":"not strong enough","review":"I bought this hoping for good things. It worked great for three days and I thought I found THE product. However, by the fourth, I smelled something funky and realized it was me. I thought maybe I didn't put enough on or didn't shake it up enough, so I tried it for another few days. However, I just don't think this product works for me. I would say I smell like body odor masked with floral perfume. I think that it worked for the first few days I used it because I still had my old non-natural deodorant lingering on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Deodorant Around","review":"The best deodorant around. I use white vinegar first to eliminate bacteria (cheap, safe and very effective). Then this product (pleasant with no overpowering perfume scent and also very safe). I order 4 at a time.

I live in Asia, and deodorant choices here are limited, so an herbal deodorant with pine scent sounded great. But it sure doesn't smell like pine to me. Even Pine-Sol bathroom cleaner has a more natural pine scent. This scent reminds me of some cheap deodorant some of the guys used to use in the locker room in high school.

Nintendo has clearly stated that the DS is their 'Third Pillar', Gamecube, DS, and Gameboy SP respectively. So, don't hesitate to get this system, as they are continuing to make Gameboy games. Personally, I prefer this over the Gameboy Micro, but that's just me. Also, Nintendo recently upgraded the SP light to a backlight, compared to a side-light. However, I believe you can only get the backlight version with the 'Graphite' and 'Pearl Blue' colors, but I'm not quite sure...

I mean, what kind of movie can Bible-basher Ted Turner produce on one of the great heroes of the Bible - Joseph? Boy was I wrong. This is one of my all-time favorite movies and the best part is it faithfully tells the story directly out of the Bible with very few Hollywood additions. The acting is great. The actors are well known and correctly cast. Even the unknown lead of Joseph (Paul Mercurio) does a wonderful job. Even the scenes and settings are wonderful. Two thumbs way up!!For fans of this movie, look for other TNT offerings in this series - Moses, Abraham, David, Jacob, and others. Most of them are equally good - with I think David being my next favorite followed by Abraham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I recommend this movie, Joseph.

A low budget testament to the power of imagination and good acting. Remarkably faithful to both to historical and scriptural sources, the script brings life to an already marvelous tale of alienation, faith and redemption. The tragic family of Isaac is beautifully portrayed with every character (including all 12 brothers) skillfully defined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Movie","review":"I liked this movie, except one scene where Potipher's wife is seducing Joseph, and he has a hard time resisting at first, whereas, Biblically, I think he was stronger than that. I REALLY like the actor playing Potipher. Because of the scene mentioned, I am hesitant to allow my younger children to view it. But, other than that, it was done excellently."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME Portrayal of Joseph","review":"As most movies, this story takes a little liberty with Bible history; the way the story is laid out, it brings reality to the likely interaction between Joseph, his family and those he met in Egypt. A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is fine.

It is nice to watch a Bible story that is not a cartoon and not an overacted, way too serious presentation. Bible heroes on film are often treated as if they walked on earth with a halo constantly hovering over them. This is a story about a man who follows God's heart through thick and thin (mostly thin), but you can relate to him because he is portrayed as an ordinary, albeit tremendously faithful, man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joseph - A great movie from Amazon!","review":"I started watching this movie on TV with my grandson and we did not get to see the last part.

But it is still a good movie. The movie covers the period before Esau sold his birthright and blessing to Jacob through his time with Laban and finally his confrontation with Laban and later Esau.The disappointment with this movie was its over-focus on him and Rachel. The lessons God was teaching him were kind of talked about, but not focused on. The non-Scriptural parts, though, were pretty consistent with early Near Eastern customs and not contrary to Scriptural understanding. In that way, it was very good.If you choose to watch this movie, you won't find yourself wishing you hadn't. It is a good movie and well produced. Just be sure you don't base much theology on it. ;-)The movie is a solid PG movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Viewing","review":"I have always enjoyed the story of Joseph and it is so good to actually see a excellent movie version that is accurate according to scriptures. The acting was excellent also and each individual played their part very well, even Potiphar's wife.As for Potiphar himself? the bible never said anything against him and the actor lived up to that.

I almost forgot that this was a made for TV film. If you're looking for someway to present this story this is a very good way.

Normally I complain about them, and they are usually done very low budget with completely unknown actors who cannot act. Joseph, however was done very well. The sets were historically accurate, and the filmmakers made sure to put detail into everything they did. They also left nothing out. Every little detail from the Joseph story is here, in their greusome details. Ben Kingsley does an excellent job as Potiphar and Potiphars wife is equally good and vile. Joseph himself is everything you would expect Joseph to be, humble, handsome, smart, and spiritual. Wonderfully Done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nakedness not necessary!","review":"The acting was good, the story was correct, but naked backsides was not necessary. Also the Potiphers wife did not need to be so very seductive of a naked Joseph. Not a Christian movie.

This should be rated PG 13 at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for a Christian family movie, this isn't","review":"I am very disapointed with how accepting we as Christians have become, after seeing nudity in a story that we should be able to trust, (in front of my wife and children as well), I turned it off. Even though I am sure this was part of the culture in this time,I know in my heart that the Lord would not want this publically viewed. The producer could have easily led the viewer to realize woman were being protrayed this way without showing anything. My family and I, were offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done depiction of the story of Joseph","review":"This telling of the story of Joseph in the TNT Bible Collection is very good. Although certain liberties were taken with the account as fleshed out in the Bible, these did not impact the overall telling of the story in keeping with what the Bible reveals. The use of Joseph telling of his early history with his brothers and how he came to be a slave in Egypt was done as a flashback, which actually enhanced the dramatic telling of the story. Very nicely done and mostly true to the Bible account."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK REMAKE OF A CLASSIC FILM","review":"This film is a cheap remake of the classic 1962 thriller.

The latest victim is the 1962 Cold War masterpiece, \\"The Manchurian Candidate.\\" Director Jonathan Demme's 2004 rehash squanders an excellent cast (Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber and Meryl Streep) while moving at a snail's pace.

This situation is getting out of control. Its arrogance in the supreme that should not be tolerated.This should have been a great movie. The original was great and they had that example to follow. The thrill and suspense are built into the script. This movie is lousy. One of the producers/directors discusses how the blurred background behind the actors was to achieve a \\"dream-like\\" perspective to the scene. He was proud of that \\"artistic license\\" but projecting the point of the movie was less important. The movie ends with the business tycoons only disappointed, not punished.

Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remake of \\"Candidate\\" undone","review":"Despite a great cast headed by Denzil Washington,Meryl Streep & Jon Voight, this remake is extremely disappointing. Washington is excellent but changing the plot and making the chief character to be a politician drains the film of whatever suspense and tension the original did have. Demme is no John Frankenheimer, his direction is competent but plodding and I found myself waiting for this film to end rather than being tied up in knots as I did with the original. Washington may be a better actor than Sinatra yet the original contains proof that Frank was a fine film actor (also check out \\"Man with the Golden Arm\\" to verify this!)and he delivers.

Raymond's hatred of his mother was watered down to nothing. Raymond's relationship with Jocelyn was mimized to the point where her demise was more of an afterthought. The current version lacked humor. Ben's patriotism was eliminated. the antagonist was sketchy and indistinct. the character of Raymond's stepfather was eliminated. The emotional core of the story is a tragedy with echoes of Hamlet from which Condon obviously lifted part of his premise. Demme seemed to end scenes 30 seconds to early, just when the characters were about to develop. None of the character's developed, particularly Raymond. Enough said. At least the new version has drawn peoiple to the old version, a true classic"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, poor untalented Hollywood","review":"If you saw the original you will understand.

I know that remakes normally are pretty crappy, but since I thought the 1962 movie was so great, I imagined that the 2004 version would at least be decent. I was wrong. The 2004 version is awful. Really bad dialogue, disjointed, less hard-hitting story, and has already aged very badly. The 2004 movie is done in a cheap \\"patriotic\\" way, lots of flags and statements telling us how great the US is. There is no subtlety in this version. It feels like a bad movie made for television. Even if you loved the 1962 version you'll gain nothing by watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Creepy and Cool Film","review":"I recently watched the Manchurian Candidate, and was blown away.

I am a big Denzel fan, so I just had to rent this movie. Well Denzel does his part, but the storyline/plot was a joke to me. It made sense but it just wasn't good enough for great actors like Denzel and Meryl Streep. Towards the middle it all starts to get long winded and boring. I know that this isn't an action movie but I thought it was supposed to be a suspense type thriller or something like that. There wasn't much suspense for me; I could see almost everything coming a mile away, especially the cheap and corny ending where I was hoping to be rewarded for sitting through all the speeches about whatever. Anyway, if you like Denzel and Meryl Streep, then you won't be dissapointed because they act very well as always. However, if you like a good plot and storyline and suspense, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest movie of all time","review":"This is a great movie and i think it\`s even better than the original Sinatra 1962 movie. It could very well be based on a true story too. Who knows if some past presidents were Sleepers. Was Bush jnr brainwashed into invading Iraq? Who knows? Was Oswald and/or Sirhan Sirhan programmed to kill the Kennedys? Maybe the writer of this movie was trying to tell us something. Was the writer trying to get a non fiction story out to its audience in the disguise of a fiction movie? The truth is that this sort of thing is not fantasy, it\`s reality. Look into a thing called \\"mk ultra\\" for more details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Potential","review":"I was disappointed. Meryl Streep was the star of this one, she really didn't need the supporting actors. They could have done a lot with this movie which had my attention in the beginning, but once I figured out what was going on (35 minutes into it) it became boring and predictable. I agree with another reviewer, Denzel did what he could with what was given to him, his pitiful character was sad to watch. They could have done more with Kimberly Elyse as well.The movie wasn't horrible, it's just one that I won't watch again or recommmend."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinker","review":"I love the Sinatra version of this movie and I also love Denzel, so I had high hopes for the remake.

I had to keep checking the display to see how much time was left in this DVD, as I couldn't believe it hadn't picked up speed.The convoluted plot was so abstract that by the time it started making sense, who cares?Overrated by a mile, I felt ripped off just renting this bomb and wasting 2 hours of precious life on it.Don't we have enough corruption in real-life politics for any of this to truly be interesting?Kind of surprising from a director like this who has created worthwhile endeavors on more than one occasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reputation as worst movie ever well-deserved","review":"One of simply the worst movies of its generation-- a total disaster from beginning to end.

I might have to re-watch this sometime to double check. Some things seem unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Visual Distortion","review":"I could not watch the \\"full screen\\" edition of this film because of the terrible distortion of the picture. Instead of cropping the wide screen original version to fit the TV screen, as it is usually done to wide screen movies, they just SQUEEZED the picture into a square format. This made the characters much narrower and taller than they actually are. Imagine a 7 foot tall Denzel who weighs 90 lbs. Thats what he looked like in this full screen version, along with every other character in the movie. This is probably a good film. Denzel is a great actor and he does not star in crap movies. Same with Meryl Streep. I just couldn't stand the distortion and couldn't believe they would release a dvd like this. Avoid this version---watch the WIDE screen version, which is not distorted."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS EDGY AS THE STORY IT TELLS","review":"It's natural to compare a remake with its original. But I may be one of the few who like the pacing, the look and feel, and the general acting of this new one better. It's just easier to watch on the DVD and the theme is easier for me to relate to. Sure, the script could have packed more punch and pastiche (certainly our present world lends very well to notions of impeding danger, both on a national and corporate scale) but as it were, taken on its own merit, this is still a very taut thriller. Certainly a decent rental, at least, as just about anything with Meryl Streep usually is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This movie is about a mega-corporation with special talents in mind control and manipulation of memories, that decides to apply those talents to gain control of the White House. Their target is the photogenic son turned war hero of a prominent US Senator who fits the role of the perfect political candidate. By implanting mechanical devices in his brain, Manchurian Global is able to take control of the young man for whatever purpose they need.The premise is intriguing, and I can see where it would be very appealing to some, especially the \\"black helicopter\\" crowd. But I think more could have been done with this. Compared to the original, it falls way short. Denzell Washington was brilliant as always, although this was not his best performance, and Meryl Streep was easy to despise in light of today's current political environment.I was interested enough to watch the entire movie, but wouldn't watch it again. And if you haven't seen either one, I would recommend the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible","review":"Couldn't believe how bad this was - disjointed, tedious, waste of time. Doesn't come near the original, which had me riveted. Meryl Streep gives a good performance, but I was disappointed in Denzel Washington. Some remakes are never meant to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the original, but ...","review":"The movie had very good acting: Washington, Schreiber and Streep were all excellent. The plot was tight and suspenseful. The original was better, but this was a pretty good thriller on its own. The remake filled in some of the pot holes that were opened in the original and created some of its own. The original was more suspenseful and I cared more about the characters. However, Denzel's character very sympathetic.I am stuck because I don't want to reveal the changes in the plot. The original Manchurian candidate has the Cold War as its milieu. The remake has a nebulus corporate entity pulling the strings. It is just not as scary as the communist scare.It is a good movie and the acting is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that interesting","review":"I never saw the original movie so I have nothing to compare this one to, but taken on its own merits, it isn't a thrill ride like the box promised when I rented it. In fact, it's rather dull and monotonous. Too many times you knew what was going to happen next thus taking away any suspense. I found the idea to be kind of a dopy one to begin with but it could have been pulled off and wasn't. To me, a good cast was wasted on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...considering the cast","review":"This movie is another classic example of what is wrong with so many Hollywood movies lately. They are all about flash and forget the substance. I picked up the Manchurian Candidate because Denzel Washington always delivers a watchable performance and because of the history of the original film.Although it was not boring, it didn't have the excitement, the edge-of-your-seat suspense that the original '62 picture had.The Manchurian Candidate is just plain dull. Never mind the original version -- this is not a remake as much as it is an adaptation so I judge it strictly on its own merits. However, it is so weak that it barely has its own merits. The story is slow and inconsistent and the directing is just plain heavy handed - focusing more on mood and music rather than story and plot. At one point about 15 minutes from the end credits all of the implications crystallize and the viewer can finally care - if they haven't given up completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY GOOD!","review":"I never saw the original, but thisremake is really good!

I was looking forward to the remake. Unfortunately, while the film holds your attention for the duration, and is a worthy effort, the movie is eminently forgettable. The chills don't last.Meryl Streep does not play evil well. The insinuation of incest between her and her grown son is just embarrassing and takes away from the story.Stick with the original for a classic yet timely political conspiracy thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"This is an excellent movie and Denzell Washington is at his best again.The story line is seat gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the original Manchurian Candidate","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this film, which was very, very loosely based on the original. This remake does not have the suspense, the surprise, the smoothness or the tense-thriller nature of the original. To me, the plot seems very convoluted; the editing is very poor--actually choppy. One mother-son \\"love scene\\" with Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber is downright comically disgusting. (Obviously mom desires her son.) The good cast is totally wasted, in my opinion. Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep should have walked away from this script. I give it no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard rehash of a much better predecessor","review":"There are no memorable characters in this version of \\"The Manchurian Candidate.\\" There is no memorable dialogue. There are no memorable visual images. The acting is mediocre at best. This piece of junk is just another Hollywood rehash of a black-and-white film with no effort at all expended to make it a *better* product -- just a flashier, louder one. The original version is still capable of generating \\"the willies\\" in the viewer decades after the Korean War ended. The only thing frightening about this version is that some people would suggest that other people spend good money to buy it. Save your dough -- it'll be on free TV sooner or later and you can spend the money you save on some first-rate popcorn, which will, I assure you, be far better than this rotten version of a great story. Even better, if your local library or video store has the original version, watch *that* while this is airing and eat some good popcorn -- you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angela Lansbury...game over","review":"I never quite understood what exactly was happening in this film. It followed the original movie's story closely, but the changes made seemed focus-group inspired. Manchurian Global wants their own man in the White House? Well Haliburton's got their own man in the White House and no one had to put a microchip in Dick Cheney's head! The premise falls short of reality. The original mixed a sence of paranoia with black humor very well. It was told in black and white in more ways than one. This remake is far to murky and vague to generate any real sence of danger or dread.And finally, Meryl Streep is a fine actress, but Angela Lansbury's performance in the original is legendary. Streep doesn't even come close in comparison. Lansbury is one of the greatest movie villains ever. Her \\"exit\\" from the film is one of the most powerful screen images ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Very twisted and strange plot, but great movie.

We already had the bike trailer, instead of buying a jogging stroller, just get the kit to convert our bike trailer. Bad idea!This thing drives me crazy because it doesn't steer, it's a rigid 3rd wheel. It works fine if all you do is run straight, but who does that? Even a seemingly straight route usually has subtle turns. There are only 2 ways to steer: drag the front wheel, or push down on the handle to lift the front wheel up and pivot on the back 2 wheels. Sorry, but I really don't like having to expel half my workout energy every few feet to lift up the stroller.They need to put a pivot hinge of some sort on this. Without it, it's pretty much worthless to a jogger. Oh, and the brake is a joke.

It was a unanimous decision that we were all sorely disappointed. The first quarter or so was very promising and held our interest, but about halfway through we began to wonder if this woman ever slept or spent time with her family. Not only were we discouraged and left feeling inadequate, but after 20-something chapters I didn't feel like I really wanted to be a Proverbs 31 woman at all. Since reading this book I've gone on to read Captivating by John and Staci Eldredge -- now that is a book that truly makes you feel beautiful in God's eyes. If that is what you are looking for, as I was when I read Elizabeth George's title, then I recommend you find a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please?!","review":"I have to agree...you can't do this and not drive your husband completely insane. I am not married, but I am in a serious relationship where we are almost never together due to where school and work is. If I called him up just to tell him random things, we'd have a phone bill the size of Texas and I'd be driving him nuts. My boyfriend is convinced that I am the Proverbs 31 woman, which is why I bought this book...I am definitely not the woman that Elizabeth George describes. I actually talked to him about it and he was definitely appalled at the whole idea of acting as she does...the two of us are both Christians and all, but we were both thinking that there has to be an element of trust in the marriage otherwise you're going to drive each other crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT JOB, ANNE MAZER!","review":"This book was good, but not the best in the series.

He is fiendishly accurate in his descriptions of Angeleno/Hollywood culture, and spares no-one including himself in his assessments.So why four stars rather than five? Because ultimately this is simply a series of essays without much besides location to tie it together. Yes, he attempts some \\"tie it all together and say what it means\\" moments at the end, but they barely escape being whiney and self-congratulatory.

In college, I wanted to write a paper supporting the Warren Commission's findings in order to spite the nut cases I had grown up around. I picked up this book expecting to tear it's arguments a part, however, Mark Lane ended up converting me. Mark Lane is one of the few people to take Ford's challenge and comb through the many volumes of \\"evidence\\" that the Warren Commission left behind. He points out many flaws and out right distortions of facts that the government made in their report. He is no \\"We did not land on the moon\\" kind of conspiracy theorist, but more a concerned citizen who was disturb by what he found and decided to write a book on it.

If so, why use Oswald at all?Where are the second shooter's bullets? Never found. So, they were hidden immediately AFTER the shooting? Where? In Jackie's purse? In the ash-tray?You see what I am saying?

Upon return to the States, my goal was to obtain a better level of knowledge so that I might eventually be able to experiment a bit. King's text does an excellent job of explaining the process, from design through to placing the tesserae and grouting the finished work. My confidence has gone up quite a bit by reading and giving some thought to the recommendations provided.I also agree with earlier reviews stating that this book and Emma Biggs' \\"Encyclopedia of Mosaic Techniques\\" make a nice combination.

It is easily fixable though by removing the tray before hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS!","review":"Not only is the tray nearly impossible to get on and off, but it's a safety issue, as well. My nine month old began to choke and I needed to get her out of the chair quickly - and couldn't. Luckily, she was okay, but I'm afraid to use the chair anymore. Also, if your child has even slightly chunky thighs or a thick waist this won't work for you.

Once you realize you're not going to break anything by just pressing really firmly, you get used to it and can easily line it up for the right setting, and you can have every confidence that it's secure. We love the portability and we take it everywhere; once my daughter outgrew her regular high chair, we also started using this as our everyday booster seat at the table at home. I'm about to buy a second one for our 6-month old! It's probably the best $20 I've spent on a kid item."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD tray design","review":"If you are just using the seat at the table, this booster is fine. However if you want to use it more as a high chair, look elsewhere. The tray is impossibly difficult to snap onto the seat and also hard to get off.

We put the light down and got away, just in case it flew apart. Using regular flashlights (with batteries) and looking through the clear case, we were able to see stripped gears and bands in places they shouldn't be - and clearly read the danger label inside the flashlight (no user serviceable parts).Well, we returned the light and got our money back. We're 0 for 1 with Freeplay products. I don't think they'll get another chance at our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the End, All the Pieces Will Fit Together!!!","review":"Monk's 8th and final is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season, Monk serves as a bodyguard for his favorite actress, investigate a UFO sighting, goes undercover as a Mafia boss, celebrates his Birthday, receives a surprising visit from Sharona Fleming, and finally solves the murder of his wife, Trudy. It all comes down to this. I highly recommend MONK: SEASON EIGHT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monk, Season Eight","review":"This was a great end to the season.

A bittersweet series, where it's both saddening to see such a marvellous show come to an end but also a delight to finally see Monk regain that true happiness that he had with his beloved Trudy.I thought the finale was well written and wrapped things up nicely. Be prepared to shed tears. It'd take a heart of granite to not break under the emotions that course through those last two episodes, particularly the moment when Monk meets Trudy's daughter.There were 2 or 3 episodes in the first half of the season which didn't really grab me and which I thought were just a little bit over the top, but apart from those isolated speed bumps this series is very enjoyable Monk entertainment. Awesome to see Sharona back for an episode.Interesting to note that Andy Breckman hasn't ruled out future Monk shows, so maybe we'll get to see more Monk in the years ahead.

The script is both fascinating in its glimpses of backstage life and its wittiness, and the supporting cast (which includes a number of celebrated burlesque stars) is superb.

With most of the action played backstage in a 1940s \\"grindhouse,\\" the film offers a fascinating glimpse into the now largely-lost world of burlesque itself. It should lay ya in the aisles.

Yes, folks, this slight film is based on the one, the only, Gypsy Rose Lee's story, entitled, \\"G-String Murders.\\" It's campy fun now, but when it was penned, about 50 years ago, this was major no-no territory. My, how things have changed. Demi Moore should have watched the real pros when actors had faces, and real acting required more than forming tears at will. Stanwyck always knew she could act, and that formidable presence makes anything she stars in palatable.

It was written at a time when Viv was seriously ill and seriously intoxicated, not a combination which makes for inspired comedy. Vivian said in his own words that he would never have released the album. Unbelievably, a representative of Viv's record company broke into his home and stole the tapes while he was in hospital; they were then edited and released without his consent. At the time of his death he was working on a new Rawlinson End album which was provisionally entitled 'Sir Henry II' ('Sir Henry I' being 'Sir Henry At Rawlinson End'), a clear sign that Vivian Stanshall had disowned 'Ndidi's Kraal'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn Back Sir Henry!","review":"<SIGH>....I hate to say it....this album/cd stinks.

Largely a narrative album,with some bits of song,Viv takes us on safari with Sir Henry Rawlinson and all his Rawlinson thoughts. Unfortunately....it all sounds like a rough draft,for a much more grandiose project. His voice sounds rough,making it hard to listen to for long lengths.....not to mention he just sounds flat out bored with it all. A sad example for a final Vivian release. My advice....if you want a good Rawlinson story...get \\"Sir Henry At Rawlinson End\\".....and if you want to hear Vivian knock your gartered socks off with songs,get \\"Teddy Boys Don't Knit\\".

For those of you who have not read the book this page has a penguin with it's back turned and a clear view of its butt and poop shooting out of it. I found it a little discusting personally. Of course we all poop and so do animals but we should keep that a little more of a private affair and I certainly do not want to read about it and look at it in a picture book with my kids.

Monday morning at 11:00am I received a call from Fuji.After I explained the problem, they shipped me a new hose and told me to keep the old one as a spare. The customer service rep was very friendly and helpful. I was amazed at how responsive they were and willing to make things right.

The anthology is quite a varied gathering of gay Latino writers at many stages of their careers, so it was interesting to note how this collection balanced the range of literary talents. I was impressed by most of the pieces, disappointed in others. If you read this collection you will recognize the weak writing rather quickly. (Find out for yourself!) I was, however, a bit dismayed that so many of these stories dealt with sex. There were few exceptions. So I found it difficult to see how this collection offered anything different from the mediocre \\"white gay\\" collections that have flooded the market recently, other than that these are gay Latinos.

Emanuel Xavier paints a nice story. but his words on the page are flat, flat, flat. The strongest, most complete stories are by a group of San Francisco writers: Jaime Cortez, Joel Villalon and Al Lujan.

I thought this was a very good book. You know you just can't have the same old thing book after book. C'mon!!! There was great character development on many fronts. I was especially intrigued with the further development of Belle Morte and how she manipulated her people along with Jean Claude's. I was a little confused in the way Jean Claude elevated his status equal to Belle Morte. I'll have to re-read that part.As for Anita, I love seeing her compromise herself in regards to not letting anyone feed off her. Also I have no problem with her promiscuity and the ardeaur. Its handled rather properly. Not smutty or distastefully. I liked how Hamilton further explained the relationship between Asher & Jean Claude and how she brought Ma Petite into the fold.

In fact I found myself putting it down after every couple of pages. And then picking it up again a few minutes later.I still do not quite understand it but I have a sense of unfulfillment. There's a just great big *something* missing. Anita does spend more time in bed - but we saw that coming in \\"Narcissus in Chains\\". She faced, and faced down, more bad guys and even had a very well written and serendipitous escape from the spooks. Ms Hamilton set the stage for future encounters with bigger and badder bad guys, which is a constant challenge for a writer.But still, I was disappointed and vaguely unsatisfied.

I am sorry I read it, it changed my opinion of the character of Anita Blake. The older books were mystery and a no nonsense kinda girl who pulled no punches. Now the whole book is about sex and, in my opinion, the downfall of Anita Blake. She is so out of character anymore, that it is no fun to read.

I am very disappointed with the book as a whole as it is definitely not my type of story. Anita has sex with and or sleeps with too many guys and all of them either lycanthropes or vampires!! She tries to show she has morals by not having actual intercourse with all of them but to me that is naive, which she is not. The sexual escapades and their descriptions are more pornographic than erotic and without any romance - a deep disappointment.However, I did enjoy the tracking down of a serial killer as that subplot was interesting although this time it was the violence and gore that were too graphic!If you like graphic violence and sex, you would enjoy this book. I do not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Anita Blake losing her thunder?","review":"I was so excited to receive my copy of Cerulean Sins.

Whatever the excuse, she is a total tramp and has finally embraced it. That is so ridiculous for a character who kept Richard and Jean-Claude waiting for months without giving in to them. Her editor must have told her that the books need more sex to be interesting because there is no good explanation otherwise.I think that the storyline is interesting if you just want to know how things will turn out in the end. Any respect that I have for most of the characters is wearing thin and the entire moral climate of the entire Preternatural community is just ridiculous. It's like any concept of the morality of humanity gets tossed aside. For that reason above all I find Richard to be appealing, he has not forsaken who he was simply because he has been infected with a virus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappionted","review":"I have enjoyed the previous books in the Anita Blake series. I couldn't read them fast enough. I was really looking forward to this book coming out and I am very disappointed with the result. Anita has spent the last couple of books getting tough and kicking some serious supernatural butt. In this book, I was frustrated with how she seemed to wimp out. I just wanted a reaction or a really good fight. I also think that Richard is starting to get really annoying and she should just take his character right out. I finished this book totally unsatisfied.

This book contains brief mentions of the furry... the upcoming new \\"big-bad\\" and then it ends with a bit of an \\"eh\\". This book could have been so much more, should have been so much more.

I loved everything about Anita, even if some of the other characters were a little stereotypical (Jean-Claude) or annoying (I find Richard's \\"poor me\\" act irritating). But it seems like Ms. Hamilton peaked with Obsidian Butterfly. Naricissus in Chains was excruciatingly long and pointless. But I'm talking about Cerulean Sins, so let me get back to that.All in all, it was much better than Naricissus, that's for sure. I even got excited, thinking things were going to get back on track. But I agree with many reviews about this book. Hamilton's losing her edge and is resorting to sex to make up for it. The serial killer plot in this book became a subplot and left a lot of things unexplained. I bought this book because half of the reviews raved about it and the other half downed it.

Sex scenes are great when thrown in as a spice. But, the sex has overtaken her new books.

So much that you begin to skip the scenes and look for the meat of the book, which you will find lacking. A fan of Anita Blake back from the first printing of Guilty Pleasures, this book was almost abhorrent to me. Literally just becoming a platform for a supernatural cocktail and the author's idealized version of herself, we lose the vibrant personality of \\"Anita\\" that we heard in the first book. There is no tension, everything works out in the end with no one for the worse and yet another bad-monkey conquered. There is no chance of death because Anita -always- wins. She doesn't suffer any true casualties. Hey, why NOT kill off Richard, or Jean-Claude, or Asher.Overdone and you can almost pick the overused lines from each of her books. This is just sex + lines from other books. Nothing new here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone take LKH's pen away from her!!","review":"I am officially done w/ Anita. I have always reread books but starting w/ Narcissus and now this abomination, I am boycotting her!Sex is fine, I'm no prude, but LKH either needs therapy or a good lay, because her frustration is ruining her writing. I wish she paid even a modicum of attention to her fans. Just about all of them hate the direction that this series has gone, the only reason the Anita makes the bestsellers list is because her fans buy the book in hopes that this time it will be different. That won't last two more Anita books.If you like LKH and want to read something that is closer to her older stuff than I recommend the Merry series.

She was smart, principled, and working hard in a hostile world. Ther first three books were marvels of the supernatural mystery sub-genre, morality tales that made me think.Now this is no longer true. I checked Obsidian Butterfly and Narcissus in Chains out from the library, and after this gift book, I shan't read any more Anita Blake. It's just too painful. A woman who had a strong and sincere moral compass in a difficult world now only has a compass for sex. A woman who made choices is now only left with the choice of whether to enjoy being driven to sex, or to whine about it.Carefully woven plots with multiple threads have now given way to a novelette's worth of plot hidden in the sex scenes. Please. Either make it a horrible dream, or put Anita out of her sad and miserable existence. She won't be in my life any more, and I mourn for the Anita Blake I once knew and loved to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Anita","review":"While the book was well written, it lacked the kick butt Anita that we all know and love.

As a fan, my wife and I couldn't wait for the new book to be released, but we are both disappointed with this story. Ms Hamilton seems to be confusing Anita with Mary from the Fairy series. Let's get Anita back on track, and be the old kick-butt, monster killer.

She also had a fun relationship with the cops where she helped solve supernatural crime. I don't know know who this person is and I can't believe I missed this much in 1 book. Boring. Sex scenes can be spicy. Sex scenes without a story is boring. Such a shame. Like the movies, no one watches porn all the way through. The same goes with books. I didn't finish this. Goodbye Ardeur.

If you are a long time fan of the series, this book will be a great disappointment.After the redeeming Narcissus in Chains, I thought the series was back on track. However, Cerulean Sins is just Hamilton's foray into the world of Harlequin Romance novels. The crime subplot, usually expertly weaved into the story, seems vague and tacked on. The \\"Sweet Mother\\" concept seemed a little far-fetched and unnecessary (as far-fetched as possible in a world populated with preternaturals). Richard's involvement seemed like simply a \\"Remember this guy? He's still a lame-wad who needs counseling.\\"This book is most assuredly one of the low points in an ordinarily fine series.

I don't mind it here and there but if that is what I wanted to read I would buy the dime a dozen grocery store variety. This book is definatly not worth being bought in hard cover.

I started reading the LKH books, I randomly checked Narcissus in Chains out of my local library and liked it so much that I went back to the beginning of the series and have read each book up until now. At this point, I feel like CS is a waste of my time. Lots and lots of meaningless sex and I am not even half way through. Were it not for the fact that I have all the other newer books in the series sitting on my bookshelf waiting to be read, I think I might skip this installment!

I continue to be amazed, each character has grown and changed so much. Each one impacting Anita's life, just like each person in my life impacts my decisions.The titilating history between Jean Claude and Asher gets kicked up a notch in this book. Giving this reader, exactly what she'd been hoping to see. Anita exquisitely rides the fence of the moral dilemma she faces. While, Ms. Hamilton knows how to keep the sexual tension at a fever pitch and uses it to it's best advantage.I for one, can't wait for the next book. The author hints that Richard and Anita are headed for something explosive, no matter which way the relationship turns. I'm sitting on the edge of my seat.Thank you Ms. Hamilton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost the plot","review":"This is a very bad sequel to the previous books. This book appears almost to be two ideas badly stapled together and never really gels into a coherent story. It opens with a client interview and a graveyard scene, which look like the lead into a nice plot based story. However, it suddenly segues into a boring and not very novel vampires and sex story arc where the characters do little beyond have sex and threaten each other. Right at the end of the book it suddenly swerves back to the original plotline and suddenly introduces a bad guy to kill for end of the book.This is a poor book and I found it a boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita Does St. Louis","review":"This book has a little more plot than most of the other later Anita Blake books, but only a little.It's about half sex. Stale, repetitive sex at that, too. I can't recommend any of the recent Anita Blake books with a good conscious.

There really isn't anything else recongnizable about her anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh so dissappointed in Anita and LKH!","review":"I couldn't finish this book only because I have no interest. I have faithfully read every LKH Anita Blake book, rated them ALL 5 stars. Every book I believed just got better than the one before it. I was glued to Narcissus in Chains, and my gears came to a grinding halt after about 1/4 of this book. Just so boring, and pathetic and way way too much useless needless dumb sex that means nothing. I am scared for the next book - \\"Incubus Dreams\\" I am hoping that the plot will come together (or that there will be a plot.

Great airplane-type stuff, although all the back history is a bit thick for someone (me) who has not read other entries in the series. And too much endless annoying talking about relationships. But the real problem for me is this book contains a truly appalling number of mistakes. It's riddled with typos, misspellings, incorrect punctuation and unintentionally incorrect grammar. I'm really very surprised it comes from a major publishing house; don't they employ people for the specific purpose of cleaning such things up? It may seem a small point, but after several chapters of this it becomes distracting, annoying, and detracts from the author's, well, authority. It makes the whole package seem juvenile and poorly produced. Shame on Berkley Books.

I just can't relate to the ridiculous developments. And if I wanted to read about wild sex, I would just buy a Cartwright bodice ripper instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The saddest thing of all...","review":"...is that it could actually have been a pretty good story had it been written differently. Theme: \\"Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\"Here we have Anita Blake, an interesting and sympathetic character. With each book she gets more power. Each villain she goes up again, she defeats. The eventual result is a complete degradation of her character. The Anita of Cerulean Sins is indistinguishable from the characters from the earlier books whom she so reviled.Had only this character assassination been intentional...but it seem as if the only thing the author is interested in writing is repetitive sex scenes...I used to love the series. However, after NC and this book, I doubt that I will read anything else by this author again.Really quite sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know what all the grousing is about....","review":"I loved this book and thought it was a perfect addition to the Anita Blake universe. It addressed plotlines that were alluded to in previous books. (I've read them all, in order, and at this point in the series, I think that helps.) There's a steady, overall story arc going on, and every character in LKH's large and complex cast was skillfully drawn down the line of their own particular development to my satisfaction. In fact, I've gone back to some of the earlier books and have been browsing them for fun, just to see how far the main characters have come -- it makes you curious about where they're going next. My fascination with this series just doesn't end. Hamilton is one writer who'll play you along like foreplay and doesn't neglect to deliver. Get it. Get them all, and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper, time, and talent","review":"I enjoyed the earlier books in the Anita Blake series - a strong female protagonist, biting sarcasm, an interesting cast of supporting characters. However, Cerulean Sins is essentially a series of mediocre porn shorts connected by a thin plot. The supporting characters have been largely reduced to one-dimensional hangers-on. There's a ridiculous overuse of certain imagery (metaphysical beasts roaring through psyches like freight trains, for example). I started to really dislike Anita in this book. That the other characters remain so enamored of her is totally unrealistic. It's time to put Anita to rest; LKH's talent would be better used inventing a new hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't know","review":"Have not been mailed the book, have writen once to sender and have heard nothing. As of now very unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"could get better","review":"I read this book, and was disappointed at the end, when I realized that all that was in less than 24 hours. It was entertaining and all, but I felt kind of cheated at the end, like the book wasn't finished, but the words stopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"most of the books in the blake vampire series have offered something new. not this one. i still plan on reading the next book(s) in the series, but very little happened. the excitement peaked in the middle, and the ending was a let down. also, the plot was not extended much at all, leaving me wondering what Ms. Hamilton was trying to accomplish. In that respect it reminds me of Robert Jordan's latest, i read it so i can read the next book, but felt like nothing happened. Wait for paperback or till you can borrow it from someone.the only reason i rated it 2 stars instead of 1 was that it still involved characters i liked, and it was easy reading, just like the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspend disbelief!","review":"OK. I have to admit: I wish Anita was still the gun-slinger from earlier books. However, as with most series, the characters grow and evolve. Is there too much sex? In a way, yes. However, as far as the storyline, it is what WOULD happen. Honestly, this is fiction and you must suspend disbelief. In doing so, this book is a great read, even if you roll your eyes a few times!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"The whole Anita Blake series is simply amazing!!! LK Hamilton's last 3 of the AB series and her most controversial are simply some of the best character development ever! NC, CS and ID have some of most amazing depth of characters revelations in them I have ever read ( did not say they were hard to read sometimes but they were essential to the characters development not just Anita's ) in a long time. The famous desk scene with Jean Claude and Anita this leads up to one of the most important revelations in the whole series ( you will have to read the book). Each character is unique and brings a depth of humanity to the series. I think sometime people do not like change in there main characters but there has to be growth or the character stagnates and LKH really knows how to shake things up !!! I don't know what everyone else read but I read three wonderful books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Anita Blake Book To Date","review":"\\"Cerulian Sins\\" in the best Anita Blake book to date. There was just enough sex in this novel to make it sexy and not enough to turn it into porn. While I enjoyed \\"Incubus Dreams\\", the barage of sex in that novel was a bit off-putting. All that being said, I would recommend the entire Anita Blake series to anyone who enjoys vampire fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cerulean Sins","review":"Perfect I love every book in this series I have read them over and over it is a very addictive series be warned. Read them all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Very disappointing","review":"I have been an avid fan of the series until Narcissus in Chains. I had hoped that Cerulean Sins would prove the last book just a fluke. Sadly, it seems someone has convinced Ms. Hamilton that she must change from writing fast paced, character driven action novels to becoming the latest Ann Rice clone.Changing Anita from a character of relatively stable morality to simply sleeping with whoever is close at hand is also a disappointment, as are the gratuitous insults of conservative Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done with this series!","review":"I've read all of the books and half of this one and got to the point where I didn't even want to pick it up and that's rare in my case because I love to read. The characters have become very irritating and after the last book being only about sex, this one didn't seem any deeper. I've stopped after only halfway through and have decided to move on to a different author and series."},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked it","review":"i liked the story, but it didn't make me go wild. i don't know what it was missing. when i figure it out, i'll edit my review. i just hope that we don't have to wait more than a year and a half for the next anita book. i want the next one already. with more jean-claude goodness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mourn the loss of what started out as a good series","review":"Enter Anita Blake - supernatural, [...]-kicking, intelligent, take no [...] woman who can handle herself. She was dynomite. Introduce her to a few more supers, and she goes off the deep end. Not only has this series taken a serious nose dive from \\"fan-freaking-tastic !\\" to \\"I don't even want to look at the rest of the series.\\" I've removed Hamilton from my author list and will probably never buy another book by her. Enough is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could she have more sex, please?","review":"Of all the Anita Blake books, I found this one to be the most disappointing. I have read the entire series, and I feel that the series started to fall apart aound the same time she slept with Richard in Blue Moon. The endings seem rushed, and there are too many sub-plots to ever really wrap the books up nicely.That said- it bothers me that now it is alright for her to just jump anything in sight. Part of what was so fun about the earlier books was it was just Anita, there wasn't a penis on hand at all times. I think the ardeur was really only an excuse to add an extraneous sex scene here and there.The book could have been good, as with the last couple books (not including obsidian butterfly- best one since bloody bones) the general idea of the plot was good, but execution was faulty.I am disappointed that I spent the money on this book that I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the plot go?","review":"I have been a great fan of Anita Blake up until Narcissus in Chains. Sex, blood and violence are great plot movers. However, since Obsidian Butterfly, that's all there is! The plot is drowning in it! I do not agree that the \\"ardeur\\" is a good thing. It's like an addiction to cigarettes or alcohol; it only weakens Anita by making her a slave to it. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please..........","review":"Give it a rest. I'm so moving on fror LKH.

It isn't all hot-sex and happily-ever-after. The main plot was incredible; the secondary plot was a little bit of a throw-away. The ending of the book felt anti-climatic after the ending fo the main plot-line. As always, the characters are incredible. This book also had one of the better villians, and I'm not talking about Musette. In Sins, as well as Narcissus, Hamilton over-shared on the sex scenes. I want more story and less ardeur. If the scenes gets much more detailed, the bookstores are going to have to file these books with paranormal romance instead of SF/F. Let's give Anita and the guys some privacy and concentrate on fighting the big bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton's Lost it...","review":"How much can you flog the same formula and get away with it. This book is the same as the last four books of the anita blake series. It starts the same way and ends the same way. It has the same soft pornographic content all through. It potray's a really wrong role model in Anita - who though a hard nut and very independent has no morality and a twisted sense of everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"The stake in the heart of a fantastic series","review":"Enough is enough. This book is not sufficiently different from porn to make a distinction. When Hamilton starts describing the mystical transcendence of having a different male in every orafice of Anita's body I just wanted to weep for the series. If you haven't yet read this book. Don't. In fact, stop at Obsidian Butterfly and then pick up \\"The Dresden Files\\" series by Jim Butcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as most people are saying...","review":"I admit that after reading Narcissus in Chains I was ready to give up on the Anita Blake series, but I thought I would give it one more try and read this book. I'm glad I did. Don't get me wrong, I still like the earlier books in the series better, but Cerulean Sins is not as bad as some make it out to be. It actually gave me hope that the series could get back on track. If you are reading this and wondering if you should give up on the series or read CS and give it one more chance, I recommend reading CS before writing off the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless","review":"I was really excited to read this book. I heard rave reviews of the Anita Blake books and Cerulean Sins sounded really intriguing. However I was sorely disappointed to find this book pornographic!! I mean I'm not prude! I read Kim H. and I've even dabbled in Highlander books but OMG it was an atrocity!Some of the plot and mystery to the book were passable, and LKH needs to continue on that route. But the sex scenes were ridiculous and tasteless. LKH made up excuses to have Anita have sex with anyone in the book! And a threesome? AND a power that heightens your sex drive 800%? Look. Anita Blake has promise, has a future. But not if you sell her out to every waiting, \\"pulsating\\" penis.I'm disappointed. I've vowed after this book to never read a LKH book again. And I warn my friends with similar interests away from the series unless they are interested in porn.:|"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bearable","review":"After the shocking change of the mood and complete destruction of the series in \\"Narcissus in Chains\\", this book was somewhat bearable. There is a story to follow (weak but better than the previous one), there is a crime scene and even though Dolph has gone completely mental, he is included in the story.Unfortunately Anita is still jumping everything that has a pulse, and each scene takes up pages and pages *yawn*. Everything seems to be only about sex, and it is really tiresome. The crimes, whatever is happening outside the bedroom walls, seem to have no importance. They are just there .... Quite sad !!!The book is not awful (very close though) and it's not good either. Just .... bearable !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Three strikes and you are out","review":"OK, this is book 11 in the series and I am sure its starts to become taxing on the author to grow the story and character.

If you like vampire romance novels this may be a good book. If you like vampire mystery, it most definitely is not.I'll not buy another book in the series unless there is some indication that Anita is going back to her roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Well, the book had all of the requisite Anita Blake plot point items. It's like she has a list - dead bodies, check. Police snarkiness, check. Vampire politics, check. Mystery, check. So she put the minimum amount necessary in for each required item, and then spent the rest of her pages on boring and pointless introspection. Nothing is better at the end of this book, and some things are much worse. The bones of a good novel are in there, but the way it's fleshed out, the character development, the action...Nothing hangs together. The times of day are all wrong. Going from one place to another takes too little time, or too much. It's like the editors just didn't care, or were too anxious to get the book on the shelves to insist on anything like a consistancy check.I know the author is capable of much better writing. I don't think I'll be buying her hardbacks until she returns to the level of quality she showed in Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was great","review":"I am having a very hard time accepting these reviews, but hey to each their own. I thought this book was great, I couldn't put it down and have read it twice. It's different but hey sometimes you need that in a series story line. Anita is herself but she is opening herself up to different avenues, compromising and accepting change while liking herself. I think that's great. Good bye Richard. (What a whinner.) Jean-Claude is his normal charming self. (Yum) I can't wait for Incubus Dreams if it is like this one I will really enjoy myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurell K.

He has said this is the worst of the seris, a snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak effort from a formerly great author.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of the Anita Blake series, but I feel like Ms Hamilton has lost the plot (and the characters) in exchange for more sex and sensationalism. In addition, there's a lot of repetition of sentences lifted directly from earlier books which is boring. Her prose seems to have gone down the tubes compared to the punch-packing flow of the earlier stories. The last great book in this series was Obsidian Butterfly, but if you must read this I'd say check it out from the library and save yourself the cash. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS","review":"I'm disappointed that I couldn't put in ZERO because this book doesn't even deserve 1 star. I am so disappointed in this series. She should really stop and I am so sick and tired of this \\"ardeur\\" in these books. It's amazing that she continues to use it as much as she has. I say enough is enough. Put Anita out of her misery. I say give Edward his own series. He is a killing machine with his own rules. Anita has become a ridiculous character and I am moving on. Poor Jean-Claude and Richard. I can't continue to support a series that continues to destroy what was once a very exciting premise. What are the problems? Several but mostly, the mystery is missing and the days of waiting for a new book are gone. Good luck to you Ms. Hamilton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please come back Anita","review":"I must agree with many of the other reviewers that this book is not worth your time. In the beginning of the series we got a good supernatural murder mystery, some great character building and interaction, great fight scenes, witty dialogue,and some good supernatural politics. Anita was much more \\"real\\" than she has become and thus this series has lost my interest. I own the first 8 books in the series, but have used the library for the last two books and I am so glad. I used to recommend this series to friends, but would no longer do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh ... another book burning please ...","review":"I thought book 10, NIC, was an anomaly ...NOPE, shear suckage. If you didn't like 10, don't bother with anything else.The author continues to trash this series, we have the Vampire Humper meets the Hardback Whore. Kinda reminds me of some concerts when the the guitarist smashes his instrument at the end of the concert ... you know that thing will never whisper, or scream, a sweet note again. Yep, that is the fate of Anita Blake, nothing worthwhile will every be produced again.What a pity.I strongly recommend you try something by any of the following authors instead: Charlaine Harris (I love her Shakespeare series), Jim Butcher, Wen Spencer, Patricia Briggs, Rebecca Bradley, Lilith Saintcrow, Rob Thurman, Tanya Huff, Lois McMasters Bujold.Life's too short to read crap.RIP Anita Blake."},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"this was bad! like crossing the streams bad! really turned me off. i don't know what the hell happened to this series but it's turned into a train wreck. i don't have the constitution to keep trudging through these books hoping they'll get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to the characters, along for the ride","review":"Laruell K. Hamilton writes the sexiest and most interesting vampires, vampire hunters, werewolves, and other preternatural characters in the business.Cerulean Sins, like the other recent additions to the Anita Blake series, focuses more on developing Anita's relationship with her men and less on solving external mysteries. Although the triumverate keeps growing stronger, there are still bigger baddies out there. The relationships between the main characters and continually growing supporting cast get even more complicated.New readers of the series will probably want to start with The Killing Dance or something published before that. Otherwise, it's harder to understand and appreciate the plot/character development that happens in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More sex does not mean a better story","review":"I hope that this is the last in the series and it seems to be. The Anita Blake series has been a wonderful ride and we believe in her world - a Laurell K. Hamilton speciality. However, as far as story arcs go - geez! Anita ends up as a succubus (she needs the sex kids or things go south), Jean Claude is losing his cool factor and poor Richard is down right suicidal.Then again, perhaps she is planning on writing another book. I just hope it's better than this one, because using explicit sex as plot points does not make for the best of stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN ANITA'S EGO GET ANY BIGGER?","review":"If this series keeps on as it is, Anita's ego is going to have to have its own book. To be so short, she spends half of her time bossing people around. Her sex drive has gotten to stupid levels, she will almost do it anywhere with anybody. I am still trying to understand why Micah (one of anita's many boyfriends) was added to the cast. He just another one of the many yes men in Anita's world. In the beginning this book was so dry that i had to force myself to read it. In the end I was angry that i had. The plot was too predicable and too packed, there was too many crisis's happening at the same time to really be able to enjoy the book. If you want a good read, read the Southern vampire series, it is delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything jessica from seattle said!","review":"Honestly!!! all i read about in the anita blake stories is sex sex sex, that and tortured, cut up bodies, not to mention really BAD french.

I'm sorry ms hamilton but you took a really good charachter and you messed her up completely.

She has come into her power at last and has a sizeable powerbase to fall back on- Vampires (Her personal servant Damien), various werecreatures: not just the pack but also pards, roderes and whatever the pack of WereHyenas are called. So buy the book to find out how the story unfolds on the standard Anita Blake storyline: Monsters, death and the supernatural."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the direction","review":"I only recently found Anita Blake and have eagerly devoured the first 10 books. I loved the character of Anita, very real and true to life...until now. With this book it seems as though Anita has transformed from a person with some type of standards and some type of line she won't cross, to one who has nothing at all to stand on. How does one go from being with one man in her lifetime to 5 or more sex partners with one session being four men at a time? I would think a transitional period would be in here somewhere. I feel as though the author went through some sexual transformation and instead of taking Anita along, just jumped to the end. So we have the good Anita and the naughty Anita. No in between.I doubt that I will finish this series now. I just don't think it will be worth my time anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a shame","review":"Like the last reviewer, I was a big fan of the orignial books. One after the other they have disintegrated into utter nonsense. The characters were cool and individual. Now they all clump into one big mass of silliness. And I no longer care about Anita. This was my last book. I thought the last one was my last, but I decided to give it one more chance. And what I've read of the next book bodes ill. So nope. They all went to goodwill and I've a whole row on my library shelf to devote to a new author. Like Susan Sizemore or Tanya Huff. Jeeesh, Christine Freehan is starting to look good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm, Rewrite Please!","review":"Ok, I love Hamilton's books. Her creativity is boundless, and her characters fly off the pages. But this book was so one-dimentional and I was really dissapointed. I gave it two stars because even though it's kind of a let-down, it still manages to nudge the story along and you should read it if you want to keep up with the series. But it's a total \\"filler\\" book. There is tooooo much pointless sex, (most of which is totally pointless to the story). Enough with the ARDEUR crap! If Hamilton wants to write porn, she should just get on with that. And don't get me wrong, I totally love good sex scenes, but in this book they took over to the detriment of a decent story line. Hamilton's signature preternatural crime hook suffered badly here, becoming almost an afterthought to the Anita's being in constant heat. I mean phleaz! Get the woman a vibrator already...."},{"rating":"1","title":"More plot, less porn","review":"I like a good sex/romance scene as much as anyone but I also like a story to go with it. The so-called plot of this book seemed thrown together around Anita's ever-widing pool of sex partners. I was very disappointed in this latest book. I hope that LKH gets her heroine and her storyline back on track soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cerulean Nightmare!!!","review":"This is the second offering by Hamilton I've read...I will admit the first offering I read was her short story included in Cravings-I was simply awful. Cerulean Sins was my attempt to give the author a second chance to come up to snuff (several people suggested I read some of Hamilton's work). Well, it took nearly 2 hours to read 82 pages...the reading was slow, silly, and boring. I thought the heroine (read whinny Anita) was just a spoiled-I-want-everything-my-way brat. How could powerful master vampires put up with that kind of stuff??I would advise the author to exercise rewriting her stories before she sends them to the publisher...200 hundred of the 500+ pages were not needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the 'downfall of the series'.","review":"This book was good. I enjoyed it throughly. I've already read past this, and this book is definitely not the 'downfall of the series'. This one is good. Incubus Dreams and thereafter are really, really disappointing.I love that Anita finally starts to see that her annoying stubbornness isn't only annoying to constantly read, but that it hurts the characters in the book. She finally swallows some of her anger, and it's really refreshing. Asher and Jean-Claude also finally show some backbone and stand up to her. I wish I could say we're finally seeing a new, stronger side to Anita - but after this book there is no plot to see character development. This could have been the first book in a great turn of the series. Instead, it's the end of a great series, and the start of an erotica series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton has gone downhill.","review":"This book has no plot. It is solely written as a device to get Anita into lots of sexual situations and be naked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"Sad, sad, disappointment for a Laurell fan.I'd suggest readers stop at Blue Moon. Subsequent books ruin the series and the characters.Too much badly written, pointless sex and sloppy plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"It hurts me to do this!","review":"I've been in love with LKH's writing for a decade now, and it grieves me to part with her, but part with her I must. What began as an awesome series staring a wonderfully tough but ethical herione infused with sarcasm has evolved into someone with about as much depth as a porno-movie plot. I've stayed with her two books longer than I should have. I'm jumping ship to Charlaine Harris, anybody want to join me in the life boat???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Grief","review":"I have read and loved all the Anita Blake novels. I have always liked Anita's moral conumdrums and the fact that there were no neat answers. I enjoyed watching her raise a graveyard of zombies. I liked her physically tough and emotionally unsure personality. She was true to her friends both human and monster. But is there a solid story line here?? I could not discern one. She seems to run from raping and using the people who depend on her to behaving like a mean spirited slut. The are no new issues in this book. Everything is recycled and tied together with so much sex I am surprised that Miss Blake can still walk. Can we PLEASE get our old heroine back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita At Her Best","review":"Before I purchased this book, I read all of the reviews on this site. After doing so I was worried that I wouldn't enjoy it. Now that I've bought and read this book, I feel like I need to comment here so that others won't be turned away from this book. This book, and Narcisuss in Chains before it, have taken Anita into a much darker and sexually charged world. And I am loving every second of it. This seems like a natural and exciting progression for her, and all of the other characters. If you're a prude, don't read the books. It's as simple as that. But if you've grown to love all of the characters and this world as much as I have, then dive in and hang on. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I can't remember what book in the series I was on when I stopped reading it, but I remember I stopped when the plot and characters went down the toilet, and it was all just sex, sex, sex, and more sex. I don't get into romance novels much because that's all they're usually about. No really good plot to keep you turning the pages in them. Unfortunatly, that's how this series ended up, a really trashy erotica novel full of sex with strange men and that's all.A previous poster said something about her \\"ardeur\\". I remember when Anita would get this, but then it turned into just an excuse for Miss Hamilton to write a few more pages about having to have sex with some other strange guy (maybe two at once) because the \\"ardeur\\" flared up again...and again....and again....and again. It's sad really, the direction this series went."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"Sex, sex, and more sex. I am so disappointed in what LKH has done with her characters and why she insists on throwningaway the very things that made me love this series. As far as I'm concerned, the last two books were not about Anita Blake and the monsters, they were about Anita Blake having sex. I used to be her biggest fan but no more. I will say she is a fantastic writer and I loved the first nine books. In fact, they are my all time favorite books. That's why I'm so upset with the last two books. I feel like I have lost a close friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's Larry and Ronnie and Animators Inc and Louie and...","review":"I am a HUGE fan of the Anita Blake series. NIC was starting to break from the usual excellence of the line, Cerulean Sins is even further off the mark. The book was still well written which is why I gave it 4 stars, but I miss the elements that made the first 7 in the series excellent. There isn't much in this book about Anita's 'work,' only a few gratuitous mentions of her side-kick Larry, and NOTHING about Ronnie. There is a lot of sex though. While some sex is fine (since ALL the main guy characters are hotties) but time after time gets old. Please, have Anita controlling the ardeur by the next book and fill the pages with a true story, not just sex. If the next book doesn't veer back on track it may be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Is Ms. Hamilton just phoning it in, now? I used to enjoy this series, but turning Anita into a nymphomaniac has made her boring. She used to be a kick-butt heroine. She's given up kicking the butts for...never mind.What ever happened to plot? To character development? I like sex as much as the next person, but page after page after page of two-somes, three-somes and more-somes gets monotonous. This isn't even hot sex, since most of the characters are one-dimensional nonentities.The only person who could enjoy this junk is a randy adolescent. It's a brief step up from the Penthouse forum."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of an Era","review":"I started out a huge fan of this series. Many fans of LKH left or became disgusted with the turn this series took after Narcissus in Chains, but this one was the straw that broke this camel's back. Where there was once a dynamic plotline rife with action, drama, diverse and interesting characters......it became an ill-conceived series of pointless sex, zero plot, and disappearing personalities. I, as of yet, have not picked up the latest book and don't plan to based on what I've heard of it. I'm personally relying on a friend of mine that has stuck with the series to let me know when it's safe to pick up another one of these books because I refuse to do so on my own. As of yet, she has told me not to bother. How anyone who claims to be a fan of this series can say that the latest 3 books are even nearly on par with the rest is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"getting worse...","review":"I started out absolutely loving and looking forward to Anita Blake...I was downloading and reading three books a week....Then I hit a brick wall with Obsidian Butterfly and it's gotten worse through and including Cerulean Sins. I think the books went from paranormal mystery, to paranormal romance and have hit on paranormal EROTICA.... taken a turn for the unbelievable...nothing is Anita - Necromancer and Vampire Executioner...it's mostly who will Anita screw and or think about killing...I mean how many more \\"most powerful\\" vampires can there be...I'm all for a good romp, but with multiple people at the same time and within hours of eachother...the series has lost my interest....not sure I will waste any more money and it saddens me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope this trend in the series doesn't continue","review":"I've been reading the Anita Blake series since the very first book and have always looked forward to the next in the series. This book, however, has really disappointed me. It was basically 500 pages of vampire politics and the main character's internal conflict of should she or should she not have sexual relations with multiple guys. The usual action-packed, crime-solving, tough heroine I always loved was no where to be found. The inner workings of her vampire world may be fascinating to the author, but 500 pages of it is way too much for me.This is NOT typical of the series and I hope Ms. Hamilton gets her character back on track, for I would hate to see the loss of an overall very good vampire series.I'll give her next book a try when it comes out on paperback. But if this new trend continues, I won't continue to buy her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best of the series, but still enjoyable","review":"Maybe the past few books weren't as enjoyable as the first ones, but I still liked \\"Cerulean Sins.\\" No, Anita isn't at all the perfect heroine. No, it's not just about good vs. evil anymore; there are shades of gray in the world one cannot ignore. That has been the lesson Anita has had to learn to live with, and also the reality that Richard has been unable to accept, both about himself and about the world he lives in. I will definitely keep reading as long as Laurell keeps writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Penthouse\\" for zombies","review":"It is very unusual for a popular series to take a free-fall like this one has (think: Charlaine Harris's \\"Sookie Stackhouse\\" series). I, like many other formerly devoted readers of \\"Anita Blake,\\" don't understand why the author would take such a sucessful franchise in such an odd (soft-porn) direction. I can only imagine that LH became bored after completing book #9 in the series, yet perhaps had a contract to \\"chug out\\" 15 books or so, and thus, decided to toss plot and characters to the winds in favor of \\"Playboy for supes\\"....very sad, as her reputation is suffering. Not worth the effort to read, nor the trees that died in order to publish this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series is going downhill fast","review":"This series started out so well. It had mystery, horror, and suspense to keep readers wanting to read more. Sadly, it has now gone downhill and in the gutter. The suspense and mystery has been replaced with soft porn and erotica. I'm really tired of reading about how long and lustrous someone's hair is or how Anita can't keep from wanting to tear someone's clothes off. I kept hoping the series would get back to its roots but each book has been worse than the one before lately. Sadly I will not be reading anymore as I've had enough. If I wanted to read erotica I would be looking for that. I however like suspense, mystery, and horror and this is none of those to me anymore"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure I like Anita Blake anymore","review":"I am not a prude by any means and I love a good book. The first books in this series were good books (although Anita Blake was not always very easy to like). The last couple of books are nothing more than a most unlikable character having sex with anything that moves, and somethings that don't move! In one day she had sex every two hours and with complete strangers. And the descriptions are so graphic, they just are not nice to read. They just go on and on and on. Enough already!I enjoy the other characters, however it is difficult to read when she is just plain mean to the people who love her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the technique using knees","review":"As massage student, I certainly learned quite some new technique from this DVD.

My personal favorites to name a few are creamy coleslaw with tangy dressing, Asparagu salad, Don's Philly Steak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Sodium recipes prevent high blood pressure","review":"I stumbled onto this item while searching the web for low sodium recipes. Having read the High Blood Pressure Solution by Richard D. Moore I was excited to see the number of recipes available to lower my sodium.I was very pleased that the recipes in this book have the sodium counts listed for each item so that if you have to alter an ingredient you can easily adjust the total count for the entire recipe with accuracy. The recipes are good. Now I will admit that it takes some time to get used to the no-salt flavor, but the author suggests alternate spices for flavoring.The author went from being on a heart transplant list to completely being off all blood pressure medications.

By opening and closing each blastgate, as needed, you will get the maximum amount of air flow at all times.For a more \\"durable\\" blastgate, there is a metal version available at a premium. But I have found the plastic gates work just fine for most operations. The only negative item for this blastgate, and even the metal blastgates, WHY are the ends tapered? All the other fittings for the DC system do not have tapered ends, only the blastgates.Overall, it is a good product that allows for maximum use of a dust collection system, with a blastgate installed at each branch to control the air flow to the machine in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Different from Traditional Chant Music","review":"Although I have not even heard the entire length of each song, just judging by the samples heard, they are modernized versions of Gregorian Chant music. And I find them straying way too much from the traditional versions of this genre. I much prefer hearing only voices in the background, without any electronic-like instruments or sounds added to it. Just as classical music should not be \\"modernized\\" by accompanying it with so many synthesizer or electronic guitar-like sounds, so should Gregorian Chant music be left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BE FOOLED!!","review":"This is not Bomb Factory, the Japanese punk rock band. This is some unknown indie-rock British band who happens to have the same name. Do not buy this album if you are expecting Exciter or Deadly Silence Beach. You will be sorely disappointed.From what I can tell, this \\"Bomb Factory\\" isn't terrible. They sound like a garage band Killers-clone, but the three songs here all sound pretty much the same. Not what I was expecting at all when I found \\"Bomb Factory\\" on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"This album hits as hard, if not harder, than any Roy Ayers put out previously.

I found it to be a really good read and was pleased to see that Tabitha Campbell-Black was one of the main characters. It was a bit different to the others, as the second half was a murder mystery. While the killer was obvious to me pretty early on, I still found it quite scary near the end. The only thing that was disappointing was that so much time was spent on the exploits of the secondary characters and not enough on the romances between the main characters, Lucy, Tristan, Tabitha etc. However, it was still a great read. I hear her next book will be set in the art world and feature Rupert's brother. I hope it won't be too long before it's finished!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I usually love Jilly Cooper, especially her book, \\"The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous\\". I also stormed through \\"Appasionata\\", which was a great read. However, this book was not up to her usually great standards. The characters were unrealistically over the top and I didn't like anyone, except for the tortured Tristan (who was a bit too tortured) and Lucy (who was too nice and weepy). Everyone hated everyone, and as I got to the end, I didn't even care who killed Rannaldini. These people consisted on a diet of hatred, venom, bad sex and so much alcohol, I'm surprised people weren't being rushed to the hospital for alcohol poisoning.I will wait for her next book, but not with the normal breathless anticipation that I relished. To get the full Jilly Cooper effect, read \\"The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous\\" first. Then work your way to \\"Appasionata\\" and skip \\"Score\\" altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"We all missed the big funeral","review":"Like the previous reviewers am I a big Jilly Cooper fan and have read all the books from riders up until this Score.I think in this one is simple a big mistake and I wonder why a good editor didn't attend Jilly Cooper at it.After Ranaldini was killed nobody thought one second about the body. It was brought to the morgue and that was that.It is very unlikely that the family ( Helen, Wolfie )were not occupied with organizing the funeral.It is very unlikely that Hermione didn't see any role for her on the funeral.It is very unlikely that the inhabitants of the book were not fighting over their places at the ceremony.It is very unlikely that a man as famous as Ranaldini did not get a big enormous funeral with at least Royal attention.It is very 'jammer' that we readers don't get anything from the funeral. It must have been really something!It made the book for me rather weak.Kind regards, Henny Jellema ( Netherlands)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooring!","review":"Too long, the murder occurs only page 354 (out of 789 pages), after whole chapters devoted to... nothing concerning the plot. Lucky there is a list of characters in the beginning, it was really difficult to remember who was who.

You'd never know that this is her first whodunit, the plot roars off at Formula 1 speed, the humour flies thick and just as fast, and the story won't let you go.

There are chapters dedicated to assisting the reader in developing a career as a makeup artist.This book is enjoyable. The freestyle section is not at all practical but demonstrates the author's free and creative spirit. If you are looking for a make-up practicum, this is definitely not it.

Moreover, most of the book is devoted to advice on how to make a career out of doing others' makeup, and to details about the author's career--which are given in an almost ridiculously egotistical way, right down to referring to herself in the third person.

The best part of the book was the photgraphs of the remains of the wall. The actual writing does not go into too much detail about the historical building of the wall; it provides a decent introduction to the various periods of building and the styles of various sections of the wall's design. Overall, this is a good introduction book to the Great Wall of China, with excellent photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Very good product slipped right onto the rifle perfectly, the only thing is sometimes it slips a bit but not enough to get in the way.

This would not cause me to not purchase the item and I am merely noting it as an observation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality","review":"I got this to fit over my Savage 111 Trophy Hunter XP from the stock end without removing my scope like other have said in their reviews.

Holds bullets snug and stays put on the stock. Only gripe is it's a little long for my gun (Ruger American) so it runs in to the swivel.

Just be mindful if you're buying this for a stock that tapers to less than 3 inches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"The holder works good. I used it on my Mosin Nagant and fits well(also looks cool). The rounds for the Mosin fit tight and are easy to retrieve. No complaints.

But this is a good book for learning the foundational stuff including how the agency is organized and its mission.The book is useful for gaining background information that can later be important for understanding events in context. I'm not dismissing the book for those looking for some entertainment value, just warning that it's not a page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, the poor, misunderstood CIA","review":"Apparently, the CIA has NEVER done anything wrong that we haven't already heard about in the popular press. At least, that's the impression to be gotten from this tedious, badly-edited work of apologist literary bureacracy. According to Kessler, the modern CIA is a thoroughly law-abiding, and highly misunderstood agency (with the possible exception of the directorate of security). And the few illegal activities the Agency has been involved in happened under past directors, particularly the much-vilified (and conveniently dead) William Casey. William Webster, in the author's eyes, is apparently ripe for canonization. Who knew the CIA was such a benevolent group of folks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are no secrets revealed. That's expected, though.","review":"The CIA is a secretive organization. So it comes as no surprise that a book that states that it reveals the top secrets of the CIA is merely a hodgepodge of technical mumbo jumbo relating to how the agency works. It is not very informative, but what can you really expect? No one is really going to get to the bottom of what the CIA knows presently and what they are telling the president. It is better that way. Policymakers are able to surprise our enemies. At the same time, because the agency is secretive, we are able to benefit from novels and movies that probably exaggerate the day to day life of a CIA spy. If you're really interested in knowing secrets, I'd suggest reading a crime novel or joining the CIA itself. But this book does not help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toilet Paper","review":"This book is the dumbest book, I ever read.

As such it is hardly an interesting read - in fact, I would venture so far to say that it is downright dull. Kessler laboriously explains the table of organization of the CIA - what the 5 directorates are and what they do (in the abstract) with very little by way of specifics. The few interviews Kessler conducted in his preparation for this book were with former Directors - very little from the \\"men in the field.\\" Most of the information Kessler presents can easily be found elsewhere, in a much abbreviated form, and at less cost than the book. If you are interested in a book about what the function of the CIA is and how it is organized to carry out its mission, this is the book for you. If you are interested in something about spycraft or are searching for stories about individual CIA operations, look elsewhere. In spite of its catchy title, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long yawn....","review":"What an atrocious book. Thoroughly disappointing after a bright start. I learnt nothing from this poorly written, poorly edited and annoyingly repetitive book. I am glad I only bought the paperback. The whole thing was extremely tiresome and it was quite obvious the author had very little actual material to work with.

Kessler is very informed about the workings of the CIA and the backgrounds of its employees and directors, but only up to when this book was published. It has a lot of interesting folklore about the beginning of the CIA and its different divisions. It's a good read if you want to get an overview of its structure and an idea of its mindset of the CIA up to and just after the fall of the Soviets. That being the post WWII era and the cold war.

In doing so, the author jumps chronologically and repeats himself. This book had very few accounts of what CIA actually does, apart from a lot of references to the Inran-Contra affair (not exactly explained in the book).

Most of the books I've seen simply go in-depth about one of the past directors or a historical incident. This book is an excellent overview of the CIA past, present, and future, with in-depth discussion on all 4 directorates (operations, intelligence, administration, science & technology).Though it is a great book that I STRONGLY RECCOMEND, my own personal suggestion to the author: include more information on the gadgets used by the CIA and the employment process.

Acting is far better here than in the version of 1930, and so are the special and sound effects. The reason is clear enough: in 1930, actors were new to the concept of sound in films. However, just looking at the DVD cover you know you will have to take this one with salt: he hasn't even got the right helmet on- that one is more WWII than WWI.

Movie is one of my favorites and book is my favorite..great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job, from 1979","review":"This movie is very well done. I understand it was shot in the then East Germany or maybe Poland (?). Uniforms are correct, and it follows the book plotline pretty well.It doesn't get the critical reviews that the 1930s film does, but I think that may be due to the wide acclaim that old classic has - and maybe due to some effects like the 1979 version being in color whilst the book never mentions colors - in fact, one can almost feel that era was all gray or black & white (and the 1939 film follows that theme, by necessity).I think this film should be better known than it is, especially with some of the re-newed interest in the Great War after so long being overshadowed by WW2 and Vietnam...but understand, the book is not a happy one - its about hopelessness. This film version 'almost/sort of' tries to sidestep that, which is really impossible given the theme of the original book.I wonder if it will ever be filmed again ??"},{"rating":"2","title":"1979 color version","review":"This version is way far better than the 1930 version. It' better because it's in color, and the acting is excellent. In the 1979 version the actors act like Germans, the 1930 version the soldiers act like they belong to an American frat club. You would think James Cagney is going to appear at any second. Richard Thomas does a fine job of acting. Buy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Quiet on the Western Front!","review":"Richard Thomas stars in this world war I movie! Ernest Borninge also stars in it.It is an all time favorite movie of mine"},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Johnboy\\" version of AQWF is truly awful","review":"This film might be okay for the general public or high school classroom, but this film brings almost nothing to the table for WWI buffs or lovers of the novel. It's hard to mention anything good about this film other than the fact that it is not as dated as the original film and is also in color.Earnest Borgnine's casting as Kat is simply laughable. The boys' mentor in the trenches, the \\"old man,\\" was \\"old\\" only in comparison to the teen-aged boys who surrounded him. The battle scenes do not inspire fear or horror. Equipment, uniforms, and sets are inaccurate and \\"made for TV quality\\" at best. The acting is wooden and hallow.This film is a waste of time and is scornfully referred to as \\"the Johnboy version\\" by WWI buffs. It is universally reviled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical movie","review":"This is a pretty good, more often than not historicaly accurate movie. It shows how soldiers in the German army lived, fought, and for many died in little ditchs they called \\"home\\".Although depictions of combat aren't brutal they give you somewhat of an idea the men had to go through during The Great War. Food, clothing, slang, music, warfare, and much more are depicted from that era. If you want an accurate, not to disheartening war movie than \\"All quiet on the western front\\" is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent retelling of an old world classic","review":"Richard Thomas at his best , with equally amazing supporting cast. Its the small daily routines and problems that the men of the trenches lived with portrayed in this film that remind you that it was originally written by a german veteran. A must for any fan of platoon/squad level life durring wars that were still fought between huge uniformed armies, intense and hard . I would put this movie on the same level as Das Boot in terms of story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good movie","review":"A very good movie adaptation of an excellent book.

I getting tired of buying what I think is going to be a complete film only to discover that for some bonehead reason it's been cut to shreds. The same thing happened to me when I bought a 4 dvd set of Shogun! Why the hell can't dvd's be labeled \\"complete\\" or \\"abridged\\"? Also, why edit in the first place? People who buy dvds buy them because they want more than what they are shown on tv or in the movie theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled","review":"I have the original from TV that I taped many, many years ago and have used in my classroom for over 20 years. When I ordered the VHS tape a few years back I was shocked by the number of scenes that were deleted in order to condense the movie to one videotape. These scenes were critical to the development of the plot and make a huge difference in following Paul's descent. I was very disappointed because I thought the original was an excellent movie for the classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting WW1 film through German eyes.","review":"Like the 1930 version of this film, All Quiet on the Western Front is about a young German boy, Paul, who eagerly signs up to fight for the \\"Fatherland\\" during WW1. During the 4 years he fights in the War, he learns that war is not as heroic as his teacher made it out to be. This movie is very well acted and it is a touching movie, even for a war film. Like the 1930 version, it is an interesting WW1 flim seen through German eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer man...","review":"...This CD is NOT what you might think: a collections of 60s oldies.

And, no offence to the studio musicians, but not very good covers!!! This whole series from k-tel (Ultimate History of R & R) must be the same, since the subtitle of THIS one ('Those Were the Days') isn't even the actual hit (and, it's AWFUL).

The first set all worked but vol. 3 of the second set did not. This seems to be consistent with the poor quality of the Black Belt dvds. There are two martial art dvd companies out there that have very poor quality goods and Black Belt is one. Since the first set I bought worked I can tell you that Johnson's concepts and instruction are great... He is five stars all the way. Unfortunately, Black Belt tends to fall short too many times letting down the buyer and the folks that present their skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Vinyasa Flow","review":"I have numerous vinyasa flow DVDs, and this one is definitely a favorite. Her cues are phenomenal and the series of poses are linked together beautifully. The longer sequence is definitely advanced; while I cannot do some of the poses yet (forearm stand, for example), I feel I will be able to if I keep practicing and listening to her cueing. The beginner sequence is great as well - again, very instructive and great to throw in every once in a while for a gentler flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Challenging Yoga","review":"This DVD offers challenging yoga for beginners and advanced yogis. The beginner's sequence is shorter and well-instructed, but it is also challenging enough for a more advanced yogi if they are in a hurry or a bit worn out. Her advanced sequence is very challenging. All four quarters can be done together or separately. Either way, someone with yoga experience will be challenged. I can rarely make a yoga class, so this is a good alternative for me to continue my practice and grow as a yogi. I am so happy that I found this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Acquisition","review":"Wonderful practice, ideal for intermediate / advanced practitioners. Good flow and challenging postures.Just a remark, draw the attention to Jenn's Mudrás, she uses them, the class does not and there is no explanation for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice transitions","review":"I have many yoga dvd's and practice daily. This is a lovely and intense workout. Like Shiva Rea in terms of the style,with well done sequences. A great addition, if you like a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Such a great dvd! Jennifer Lynn's teachings are really inspiring and motivational. She obviously draws from a wealth of knowledge garnered from numerous lineages of yoga and is able to transfer information not only with the precision of someone who thoroughly knows her science but with the fluidity and poetry of an artist. I have lots of yoga dvds from so called celebrity teachers and Jennifer Lynn's is one of the most comprehensively excellent - beautifully produced, lovely music, clear easy to understand direction, plenty of instruction: ancient teachings delivered beautifully in thoroughly modern technicolor and sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharon Rocks but LP was unplayable.","review":"Sharon Jones just rocks, that's all I can say. Great album but Dap Tone Records NEEDS to find somewhere else to get their LPs pressed. I have every Sharon Jones album on vinyl and every one has been warped, pressed off center or has some other major defect. This particular album was so warped the cartridge on my turntable was actually hitting it on playback and the album was unplayable. The seller refunded my money so no complaints there but I need to buy another copy. I can only imagine what this would sound like pressed at QRP and mastered by Analogue Productions on some nice 180/200g vinyl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re: Laugh out loud","review":"God this album was horrible. If you know what the real thing is supposed to sound like, that is the sound/vibe they are going for, you will pee yourself laughing at how bad this is. Sharon's voice is the highlight. The problem is the songwriting is terrible, too many poorly composed one note sounding melodies, lousy production with the bass drum too stark, undefined bass, and a drummer whose soul feel just isn't there. Listen deep to this Cd after having immersed yourself in classic early 70s soul and you'll be laughing too. The last tune on any album is supposed to be great. I found myself trying to stay awake while listening to it. The worst part is I was driving. Quite frankly its an ersatz version of the real thing. I never saw what the big deal with this group was and it was confirmed by this CD. Mediocrity for those that don't know their soul roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom","review":"I love these knives.

It definitely does not rust - it's very sharp - but, every time I peel potatoes with it - the skins get caught in the blade. I like to peel super fast and get on to something else, but with this thing you can't - you have to stop and pull the peels out of the blade and then begin again - which is so sad, because it's a nice peeler once it gets going again - really smooth and sharp, but it's not good when you have to keep stopping just to pick out the stuff that gets stuck in the blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST PEELER","review":"i've never had a peeler that works so easily.

Since then it has been the only peeler we've used. When I went away to college I tried to find one for myself and have been scouring flea markets for years trying to find the seller/product. I tried every other peeler from cheap grocery store ones to expensive department store specialty shops, without equal results. I'm very glad to see them available on Amazon. This peeler is just as sharp today as it was the first day we bought it. Peels were thin and smooth all around whether you cut an apple/potato/whatever. Can be used by both righty/lefties and is very lightweight and maneuverable. I love it so much I ended buying 10 more for family members. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Peeler","review":"This is a great product. I recently had a friend over who used this peeler and then proceeded to go and order their own.

The smaller handle makes it a lot easier to store with out making it difficult to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this. Now.","review":"This peeler is fantastic. I had no idea how fantastic peelers could be until I used it. The first time I set out to peel a cucumber, the peel hit the wall of my kitchen.

An exciting car chase and shoot-out. After that, I found the movie to be predictable and tired. The dialogue sounds like it was written for junior high students. There was a hideous and graphic five minute scene where a steer is first shot, and then butchered with an axe and various cleavers. This film can best be described as an amateurish hispanicsploitation film, where all Americans (except Telly Savalas) are shown as brutal racists and profiteers.

Label owner Alouysio de Riveira jumped at the oportunity and paired the gifted drummer with his star guitarist, Baden Powell for an LP release. Not content with the pair, he threw maestro Moacir Santos into the mix as saxophonist/music director and wisely chose two of his themes from the \\"Coisas\\" series for inclusion. Another happy early sketch is a \\"Theme number 1\\" which later resurrected into \\"Vou por Ai\\" in Tempo Feliz, a later release by Elenco (de Riveira's label).The opener, \\"Deve Ser Amor\\" is the definitive version of a very ornate ii-V-I groove that Baden also recorded with Vinicius de Moraes and Odette Lara, his French band and Herbie Mann.Baden loved Swing as a teenager and he clearly enjoyed himself making this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good filter, stupid price","review":"Just because this has the Jet branding on it, one is expected to pay well over twice what the same or better filter at one of the big box stores.

I know that the chamber of horrors at the \\"mental hospital\\" is not far removed from reality, but for a lot of the story, the amazing circumstances that abound in the novel are a bit too much to bear. And I can't quite parse the way Mr. Roeder attempts to ground his characters in a realistic setting, and then throws on paranormal experiences.As escapist literature, I've read worse, but for something that seems to be striving towards realism, I just don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"choppy and limited one-dimensional plot","review":"The beginning chapter read very much as \\"I like green.

The story seems choppy, mostly because of the grammatical and spelling errors. The characters are likeable, but somewhat unbelievable. Casper is on one extreme end. He is utterly and desperately poor, beaten, molested, and has only one shirt and pair of jeans? He only has moldy mayonnaise to eat? It is hard to believe that he spends all evening wondering around after school, you would think he would get a job. I know that opposites attract, and the fact the Brendan falls for Casper is believable, I just think that the author has tried too hard to make them opposite. This bothered me for the entire story.The author seems to have the need to constantly repeat himself in simple terms to prove a point.

They fail to even hint at what would be possible to attain with any degree of experience. There are better choices available for anyone who plans to continue with much painting.

Although it starts off somewhat slow, I thoroughly enjoyed the descriptions of the countryside at the beginning. However, the meat of the book isn't the descriptions, it is the wonderful, moving, life changing wisdom of a simple baker named Jacob. As Jacob strings pearl after pearl of insight, I have found the need to refer back to the book time and again to retain them all! And even though I don't tend to be much of a quoter, I've quoted Jacob to my friends several times. I actually borrowed my mother's copy of the book, and the chances of her getting it back are dismal. (I've only bought copies to give as gifts).

I recently purchased this set again and was disappointed to find these, as others have reported, pretty much dull right out of the box. I initially installed the 60-tooth in my chop saw and I found I had to push down very hard on the chop saw to drive it through KD pine and it was a splintered cut, not clean at all.

What a Value!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived dull?","review":"Perhaps mine arrived dull, but the 60 tooth split through pine 1 x 6's and left a big mess on the underside of everything I've cut with it. Very disappointed, especially given the original blade my DeWalt saw came with was so nice.I bought these to do some fine work, they are definitely not capable of doing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dewalt 10\\" blades","review":"I have been a Pro. carpenter for over 25 years, bought this combo pack because of the \\"deal\\". They are probably the crappiest blades I have ever used, not sharp and splinter the back of the cuts. Both blades were also warped and upon start up made the saw jump. Dewalt has really gone down hill, all of their products are made in China and their hand tools aren't much better than cheap box store home owner tools. Shame on you DEWALT !! Spend a bit more and get a Pro. quality product. Makita makes excellent finish blades as does Freud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy!","review":"Very good price for 2 quality blades. I paid less for this double pack of Dewalts than I would have paid locally for just one blade (except a B&D blade at W__mart which was only general purpose). The 60 tooth crosscut does a decent job on moulding with almost no splintering, and cuts true. Good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless People","review":"I have not received the item yet.

It was disappointing though went I put it on the DVD player. The video quality is poor. The sound isn't that great either. Some of the behind-the-scenes shots are interesting, seeing them driving around downtown Houston, talking on their bus. And there's footage of them hanging out and walking around either Galveston or New Orleans.The songs are not sequenced (edited) properly on the disc, so that it's hard to go directly to a particular song. You have to fast-forward. Also annoying is some of the poor videos showing over the live music. Would have been better to left the concert video footage for that.Only recommended for Nazareth freaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack","review":"Hi all,Could anybody give me the name of the song being played whilst Takashi is riding around on his bike, while having to drink a beer every lap.

After having a very inexpensive version for years, I upgraded to this model (I don't use it enough to justify $150 for the high end versions). For the money, this device is excellent. The food gripper is a little tough to use so I only use it when the remaining food item is short and I don't want my hands near the blade. The blades are very sharp and seem to be of high quality. The adjustment lever is hard to figure out at first but works fine. As with any sharp kitchen appliance, you should absolutely invest in a mesh glove to protect your hands during slicing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hindu Musical Comedy","review":"I really didn't know what to expect when I got this, but I was so pleasantly surprised.

All the idealism, great music etc. of a 1050s American musical but better because it never takes itself too seriously. The happiest film I have seen in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!!","review":"I really love everything about BOLLYWOOD films and adore the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, so I was really looking forward to watching this film. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. It has a lot of music and color, but the acting is so bad, and the abrupt interruptions of song and music so annoying, that they produce an unwelcome mess of a movie. I realize some serious messages were to be transmitted, but it perhaps tried to do too much, and failed at everything miserably. If you want an entertaining movie with a good message, try Lagaan directed by Ashutosh Gowariker or Water and Earth by Deepa Mehta. Don't waste your time with Bride and Prejudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't","review":"I soooo wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. The breaking out in song and dance was just too much. I love musicals normally, but this one was just so cheesy. And the main female character was too \\"modern woman\\". Her character was trying too hard to come across as independent, it caused me to not like her. I'm sorry I bought this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Casting and Characterization","review":"Sorry, but Elizabeth's character in Pride and Prejudice was meant to be plain and her sister was the beautiful one. That was a recurring point in the story. Then why the heck did they cast Ashwarya Rai \\"most beautiful woman in the world\\" as the plain sister. Give me a break!Wickham. Give me another break! In the original, he is a charming poor guy who sweeps vulnerable and strong women alike off their feet into doomdom. In this version, I could not see, for the life of me, why anybody would want to spend a minute alone with this fellow let alone the rest of their life. His charm, if anything, was unconvincing.The storyline was cute, but the actors did not have enough screen presence to carry this time old tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top ten movies of all time","review":"When my wife asked me to see this movie, I didn't think much about watching a movie about weddings. But what it turned out to be is this is one of the best movies I ever saw, and helped me appreciate Indian culture better. (Kinda like the main character, Darcy, of the movie.) Even though there are no suprises here, this movie made me think about the about the theme of the movie, which is class-distinction between \\"westerners\\" and \\"easterners\\". And any media or movie that helps unite people, and learn about other cultures in the process is a great movie. The Bride and Prejudice DVD brings romance, wit, and emotional force to your home. By the way, if you saw \\"The New Yorker\\" review calling this movie a travesty and ridiculous and enjoyable, just completely disregard that kind of review; it's like the weatherman telling you it is going to rain and be sunny on a particular day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"After reading mainstream reviewers, I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie. I was pleasantly surprised, this movie was funny, had a nice story and had some great actors.Most of the characters had a lot of depth and I also liked the diversity of the different types of actors. The way the director used colorful sets and outfits is really nice. There are some really funny parts - like the cobra dance. The only thing I didn't like was some of the songs. I liked two of the songs, but the other ones were annoying.Over all, this was a great, light-hearted movie, perfect to watch with the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"East Meets West!","review":"This movie was very much impressive and acutally quite surprised me. The movie stars the gorgeous Aishwarya Rai(Lalita) and the wonderful Martin Henderson (Darcy). In this typical Indian, Bollywood, East meets West movie Darcy and Lalita start off hating each other and find it hard to adapt to each others customs. But as the movie progresses..opposites attract! The movie is bittersweet and flourishes with its colour and songs. The movie also stars the highly funny mother who is desperate to marry her kids off. Bollywood movies dont get much better than this.....with corny one liners and laugh out loud jokes and ethnicity this movie shines! The songs are lovely (No Life Without Wife) and Mr.Kholi is as funny as funny can get. This is a must watch!Watch for the sisters Kobra Dance - I was in stitches!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"Having been a fan of Austen and well-made Bollywood movies too, I still could not take this one for whatever it was worth. I guess I expected more from Chaddha (Director) who has done exceptional work in making \\"Bend it like...\\". This doesn't even come close because its neither true Bollywood nor Hollywood, but simply a loose coupling of both. No attention has been given to details, especially in the sets staged in Goa and scenes of Punjab state. Acting is shallow, especially by Rai (Lead Actress). Chaddha needs to learn more from the likes of Mira Nair and Rai should give up acting complex roles now."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, cheesy...poorly written","review":"oh my...i was shocked and disappointed when i saw this film. after seeing MISTRESS OF SPICES and being a fan of bollywood and indian films, i was dismayed at how horrible this film was. had it not been for aishwarya, im sure this movie would could have a B rating.the script was poorly written and the acting was bad. the costume design and colors were pale (not really representative of bold bollywood colors), i didnt care much for the music, and it was just plain cheesy.i am surprised by all these great reviews...in fact, that is why i bought the movie...*sigh*...lesson learned.overall, this film was a disappointment. i would not recommend it, unless you like a bad script and poorly acted films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bollywood Westernized","review":"This is a wonderful rendition of Pride and Prejudice with a little asian flare.

It is good fun. It has a typical plot for this type of feel-good movie so don't get this if you are looking for something mind-expanding. This is a good rainy night popcorn movie. Warning the songs get stuck in your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie!","review":"While this movie isn't classic Jane Austen, it is a very good modern adaptation. It is really funny and definitely a must have for all Austen fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intoxicating!","review":"This movie is absolutely delightful! My daughter's and I watched it over and over again, and hated to take it back to the video store, so we bought it. Even my husband and sons enjoyed it. It's a brilliant adaptation of the original Jane Austin story. The captivating music, glorious color, magnetic characters, the grace of the dances, the stunning beauty of the locations...everthing about this movie makes it hard to take your eyes off the screen -- a total audio/visual feast. If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing a treat. And if you're like me and my daughter's, you're going to want to buy the soundtrack, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not \\"Bollywood\\" But Cute, Not Pride And Prejudice...but Close!","review":"This film is cute. This is more like a Disney Princess animated movie than a Hindi film. The singing and dancing is not \\"Bollywood\\", but it is a good movie.Several members of our family love Pride and Prejudice (and all things Jane Austen) and we all enjoy Bollywood movies, too - so this movie was a perfect family hit! Aishwarya Rai is fabulous and so is Anupam Kher. The lines are memorable, and make this an oft quoted movie in our home. It's hard to find here in the U.S, at a reasonable price, so jump on this one when the price goes down. It's one worth watching over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and enjoyable!","review":"I love this movie! If you want to sit down, be entertained, and end up with a smile on your face, then watch Bride and Prejudice. Is it the A&E version? No, but it is an excellent updated and different take of my all time favorite book. Aishwarya Rai as Lalita Bakshi (Elizabeth Bennet) and Martin Henderson as Will Darcy (Fitzwilliam Darcy) are fantastic and have great chemistry together. The supporting cast is wonderful. The songs fit and do not detract from the story. I just wish Chadha had left in the song \\"Arrogance, Pride, & Vanity.\\" It's on the British DVD, but not the US one. The colors used in the film are breathtaking (not dark like so many movies today). This is a very bright, vibrant, witty, and feel good movie. Gurinder Chadha had me walking out of the theatre with a smile on my face, then ordering the movie and soundtrack ASAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chadha's Wild Take on P&P","review":"As a fan of both Jane Austen and Gurinder Chadha, I was anxious to see this version of P&P.; Since no theater nearby offered it during its roadshow run, I was forced to wait for the DVD release. I was not disappointed.Although vastly different from Austen's original story, there is plenty of wit to go around. The outlandish plot devices are no more ridiculous than the match-making Mrs. Bennett in the novel. Without a strong lead in the Darcy role, our focus is on the young women whose mother is so intent on marrying them off.That said, Naveen Andrews really cuts a rug in the dance sequences, and the Mr. Collins character steals every scene in which he appears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great price","review":"This movie is a family favorite.

I'm not familiar with Hindi films, so I cannot compare it to others in its genre, but I was entirely won over by its blending of East and West. For that purpose the selection of theme -- a reinterpretation of the English classic novel by Jane Austen, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" -- was perfect. Every culture has its mating rituals and marriage customs. Those of early nineteenth-century Britain turn out not to be so different from twenty-first century India, especially the maternal desire to arrange for marrying off the daughters. We are all just one big human race after all.Through this film, I felt a growing admiration of and appreciation for modern Indian culture: the colors, the music, the golden light. The beautiful Indian women and their gorgeous filmy gowns. What a spectacle -- Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Bollywood!","review":"This was cute, just plain cute and very Bollywood! My daughter recommended it. I did not think I would like it but I did although a few of the numbers were a bit long. If you don't like musicals, you will not like this movie.I love Austen, which is why I was leary of watching it, but I am glad I did. It was enjoyable. Not excellent, but good.The stars were great especially Naveen Andrews and Aishwarya Rai (Ash). She is also stunning.If you are looking for a fun, relaxing watch, with a few good laughs, this is a movie to see.

It did well in trying to remain true to the basic ideas and characters of Austen's book in an fun and entertaining manner. If you like musicals or are a Jane Austen fan with an open mind you'll love this. I'm a great fan of Austen-related movies and would definitely watch this one again.

I'm a die hard fan of Aishwarya Rai (Lalita)! I've seen nearly every movie of hers! Even though she gain a bit of weight (on purpose) for the movie, that didn't affect her beauty.

I ended up loving it and watched it several more times in the following week with my kids.

The twist on Pride and Prejudice is delicious and the music and dancing India-style are charming. There is always a risk in \\"remaking\\" a classic but this interpretation set in India in modern times really works.

Hated this movie. My only expectation that was fulfilled was a modern Indian version of P&P.; Other than that, the acting was bad (especially Aishwarya Rai--all she did was grimace and roll her eyes); the musical numbers were bad. If this is Bollywood, then it's not for me.They need to decide if it's going to be a musical or not. When the characters suddenly break into song out of nowhere, it just seems ridiculous. And that's a perfect description of this movie--ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"Snoozefest, the characters are beyond cliche.... she has a chip on her shoulder and plays it worse than a silent movie actress, he's the workaholic shy guy ....... just terrible.... waste of money buying it thinking that it was in the 'vein of my Big Fat Greek Wedding'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was really anticipating this movie which made it sincerely disappointing at how very BAD it was. I loved the music, the colors, and the story was nice, but I couldn't believe at how spiteful and NASTY the character of Lalita was! Maybe it was because the character of Mr. Darcy came across as so very bland as to make it hard to imagine how he could inspire such shrewishness, but she came across as an extremely unpleasant character and I spent the whole movie feeling sorry for him. The plot devices to keep the lovers-to-be apart were totally contrived and false, and the dramatic ending in the movie theater was so ridiculous it ruined the last bit of any respect I might have had for this movie. There should have been way more focus on the other sisters as well, they came across as much more lively and entertaining than Lalita."},{"rating":"1","title":"bride and prejudice","review":"This is a pathetic adaptation of Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice.After watching Bend it like Beckham its disappointing to see Gurinder Chadha make such a bad film.Aishwarya Rai is an actress that is totally overrated and cannot act and casting her in the main role was what spoilt the film.Namrata Shirodkar was more beautiful and acted better.Ofcourse Aishwarya Rai who is supposed to be an Indian girl from Punjab was trying to talk in an American accent which made things worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Tired","review":"Why is everyone suddingly starting to make Austens book diffrent?It would be just fine if you left the story alone, like Simon Langton(Directed), Andrew Davies(Screenplay), and Sue Birtwistle (Produced)did with the 1995 virson. If you want to see a classic virson of Pride And Prejudice [The REALL title] you should watchthat one. Otherwise, if you never read the book, or not an Jane Austen fan, go ahead and watch it. You might like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"I dont think so, dont ruin a classic please keep that indian stuff out of it. If you want to make a movie please come up with your own plot. I did not like the movies and had difficulty finding any stability with the plot. Drop this and pick up Pride and Predejuice the new one. I have seen other bollywood stuff even though this was kinda hollywood and lemme say that it actuvally is hollywood in bombay. Enlgihs movies in hindi with songs and different characters. Also dont be proud after seeing this thinking you go a dose of indian culture(which I am sure most of you have not) this is nothing read a book if you must.But there are better options so cjoose wisely. But one of these guys is in Lost so I will give it 2 stars(Sayid)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't EVER mix Hollywood with Bollywood","review":"I am a person who regularly watches hindi films that are Bollywood starred. This move stars Ashwarya Rai, who is a BOLLYWOOD actress. In her movies from Bollywood, she showed incredible acting, beauty, and style. But now, she is starring in an American film. America is once again stealing a specialty from a different nation; a great actress. It's amazing how just one of the actresses from one film can change the world of movies.This is just how I feel- nations should keep their talents and instead of taking other nations'. But this movie, is about Lalita who Ashwarya plays, looks for someone she wants to marry for love and meets someone from America, Darcy played by Martin Henderson. From the beginning they don't seem to get along but as they progress, love sparks. Yes, this is based on the book by Jane Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, dispiriting","review":"I found this album -- these arrangements, selections, directing/conducting, and even singing -- to be often depressing and dispiriting, and therefore I don't listen to it. Even the occasional presence of Placido Domingo does not remedy or rescue the situation. The Vienna Choir Boys are more renowned in name than in talent or directorship; they used to be a big name in the 60s or so, but trying to capitalize on them in the 1980s or early 1990s did not prove worthwhile in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Music Collector","review":"I have a large collection of Christmas Music and many are on CDs.

All he does is make \\"teenage humor\\" remarks that are never funny and usually not relevant to the movie he is in (this is especially true of the movie \\"Gulliver\\" which may even be worst than this one).This movie is so incredibly bad, anyone who watches it must be a die-hard Jack Black fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nacho Not Funny","review":"I am a Jack Black fan but I didn't like Nacho Libre,the plot didn't make sense and the so called humor didn't make me laugh.I watched it with several other people and we all agreed it wasn't funny and we were disappointed.If you want a funny Jack Black movie get \\"Saving Silverman\\" or \\"Orange County\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"watched this film recently&didn't find anything funny at all.

Suffice it to say, this was the biggest letdown movie I've ever seen him in. The trailers looked hilarious, but as so many bad movies do, all the funny parts were in the trailer. What was left was a lot of bad filler to string the few funny parts together, with no real direction for the rest of the movie, what a mess. If you want to see Black at his best, see Shallow Hal, School of Rock, or Tropic Thunder. With the right writing, he can be this generation's Chris Farley/John Belushi type comedian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nacho Libre.","review":"I can't wait to see this movie.Rated PG for some rough action,and crude humor including dialauge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough laughs...too many yawns","review":"30 minutes into the movie, I was picking my toes and making shadow puppets; decided that was more interesting and turn movie off...nuff said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sux","review":"I usually like Jack Black, but his constant mugging and the beyond silly plot line really turned me off in thids film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it.","review":"I loved it.

We had the opportunity to become familiar with the Mexican cultural phenomena, Lucha Libre, which is the basis of this story.This movie is absolutely hilarious if you know anything about Lucha and have seen some of the actual matches.If you're not familiar with Lucha, you might not find it so funny...Jack Black is fantastic in this role."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it would be 1 star...","review":"but on a snowy afternoon in northern Maine, after snowmobiling,this gave me a couple of laughs more than I figured."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreary","review":"What can I say? I have looked through the other reviews and can hardly disagree with the consensus. Therefore I will unnecessarily write yet another review that will simply repeat everything that's already been said.Yes, what a slog. Though a fan of Jack Black, I was both shocked and saddened to see him in this tedious tripe.I suppose the script's premise must have seemed a lot more hilarious on paper than it turned out to be once they hitched Black up in those turquoise tights.There are very few laughs. I think in large part this is because Black is harnessed: forced to deliver all his lines through his clenched and rigid Mexican accent.But whatever your theory is, you gotta agree: there are very few laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Nacho Libre\\" Coming To DVD - 10/24/06","review":"The Jack Black bomb \\"Nacho Libre\\" will limp to DVD in widescreen & full-screen versions on 10/24/06.

Jared Hess is that bad.I like how the atheist character hates orphans for no reason at all and then finds God for no apparent reason at the end. Wait. No I don't. As a black man he offended me with LaFonda in ND and here with the evil atheist kid who coindicentally is also the ugliest character in the film. Just because you don't follow a religion doesn't mean your some hell spawn who wants to kill children. Way to encourage an awful stereotype that lingers in so many American minds and got that monkey in the White House re-elected.I'd give it one star except for the fact that Jack Black looks sexy in those tights. He is one fine piece of man."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless and flakey","review":"Jack Black was great in School of Rock. But he is more of a liability than an asset in his recent movies including King Kong and now Nacho Libre. I popped this into the player and sat back wondering what the hell was going on. Besides the pointless plot, the movie is just not funny. Watching Black run around shirtless, occansionally farting, and getting beat up is only funny for so long. The HD DVD picture quality was decent, but it certainly did not make this movie worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Typical Jack Black Funniness","review":"I have watched all of Jack Black's films and I have found this one to be his worst. My Wife and I couldn't keep from sleeping through it. I will admit that there were some silly parts and somewhat funny parts, but for the most part we had to force ourselves to laugh at this ridiculous movie. I'll more cautious before I rent another Jack Black movie. I hope this doesn't ruin his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny premise, annoying execution","review":"I watched the movie with an anti-Jack Black bias. Friends had told me how funny I'd find the movie, so I got it. The premise sounded great - a monk turning to lucha libre (Mexican pro wrestling) to feed orphans. First 30 minutes are hilarious. The next 30 Jack Black gets annoying. By the end you can't stand him anymore. Pretty much ruined a great concept.I'd say I should have known better, but I really did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry if you expect more","review":"First off I must say I am not a Jack Black hater. I think he has had numerous good movies to his credentials. This movie is not one. Trying to pull off the Mexican thing was a joke onto itself. When I tried to endure watching this movie I began to get a sinking feeling. The type of feeling that comes when you realize you are wasting precious time in your day. This movie more than lacks in laughs. It also lacks in storyline. Seemingly taken from a terrible Mexican soap opera and strewn out for 90 minutes this movie only has favor because of it's star. Although as we all know stars can obviously bomb from time to time. For me this movie was a major bomb. You may feel differently watching this movie but for me it feels like a waste of a video rental and hopefully not a mistake I will make again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my personal favorite, but my boys love it!","review":"This is not my favorite movie, but my boys just love it.

Jack Black is on the top of his game in this film. Everything about it is hilarious and you don't have to worry about kids watching either because its totally clean. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was hilarious!!!","review":"Most people that I've talked to that have seen it either absolutely love it, or they think it's blah. No in between. I thought I was going to hate it because it just looked like such a dumb story. I refused to rent it, but my wife really wanted to see it. I gave in and to my surprise I laughed my @$$ off. I think English speaking people of Hispanic heritage (me included) would find it hard not to like this movie. Jack's Spanish accent and facial gestures are so funny. My family has watched this movie over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Whole Family","review":"The movie is hilarious!!! Everyone in the family loves it ranging from 18 months, 4 years, 10 years to adult. Very rare to find a movie this good that the whole family can watch and feel OK about. Good clean fun! My kids quote the movie daily for laughs. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Sells It","review":"Jack Black has an uncanny ability to sell a movie. A movie that otherwise would have fallen flat. But it's Black's performance that saves \\"Nacho\\" from being just another silly underdog story, with an ending you can see coming from a mile away. Black is truly funny as the lonely cook at a small monestary, with big dreams of being a great wrestler. The movie is over the top and silly, but worth seeing simply because of Black's joyful performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messed up!","review":"Though the actual DVD's condition was fine, the case it came in was in terrible condition and I threw it out (the case not the DVD). I don't know what could have caused that kind of damage to the case but I'm going to guess it was retreived from the bottom of a muddy river. This was listed as \\"good\\" condition although being used. I would say they don't know what that word means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"Price was great. This movie is unavailable in stores and I looked everywhere. Seller worked with me to get the movie to me really fast so I could give it to my husband for Fathers Day. Excellent service. I am extremely satisfied and my husband is so happy. He loves this movie and I was so glad to be able to find it for him. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of Napoleon Dynamite But Actually Entertaining","review":"I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I like Jack Black but watching his movies are hit or miss. Sometimes they are great, sometimes they are horrible. This movie falls closer to the great side. Its not hysterically funny but it is certainly entertaining and worth a watch. The acting and dialogue is very reminiscent of Napoleon Dynamite, which could be expected since both movies are produced by the same people. The acting is bad but intentionally so and the story is original. Overall I really enjoyed this flick and do recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super nacho!","review":"I am Mexican and I appreciate the story which is really accurate.... The location is in a little town out of Oaxaca and the extras are real local people from the area. I particularly love the \\"lucha libre\\" which is really culturally imprint\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nacho Libre is a Modern Don Quixote","review":"Some may see that Jack Black is the main actor in this movie and write it off, but that would be a mistake. In Nacho Libre we are presented with an interestingly filmed and set spiritual journey that at times is too Jack-Blackey, yet at other times really comes through with the deep spiritual message of serving others versus egocentric gain. Luckily, Nacho discerns his higher calling to be a \\"luchador\\" for the lord. There are several interesting supporting characters in this film. The setting is visually and culturally enticing as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of Laughs","review":"This movie has a wonderful taste for Latin roots filled in with comedic humor. Like Napoleon Dynamite it has the same dry humor that brings in plenty of laughs. The contrasting desire of a man's job and what he wants to do cause conflict. Ignacios hopes and dreams are are wrestling, but his monk ways disapprove. Still, he finds his way to wrestling, at first failing, but still receiving money. He starts to buy real food to cook for the children.Also balancing his wrestling, he tries to win the attention of a new nun at his church. He tries to get her to like him or respond to him. So in the midst of his rebellion, this whole love fiasco thrives. Like a little kid, he gives her the best and more attention than any others.Overall, this movie is a success. The way it's put together will bring laughter and enjoyment for all the family like it has done to mine. I'm sure this will to be one to remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Jack Black","review":"One of my favorite movies of all time for its awkward humor and intensity. Jack Black epitomizes the awkward side of his humor in this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, nice, funny","review":"This movie is a nice one for all audiences that shows a tender point of view of humor, jack Black acting is versatile and let people knows his talents. Other characters as ESQUELETO enrich the movie with funny acting. The music drives you to the past decades when luchadores were real stars in Latin America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"I went to see this movie when it first was in theatres. I think what ruined it was the ad campaign. Now, I don't watch TV a lot, but I saw so many ads for this movie that by the time it came out I knew: the main story line, most of the jokes, all the main characters, what the climax scene would be (the big fight), etc. In other words, no surprises. Good comedy relies on surprise. This is why Napolean Dynamite and Little Miss Sunshine were so good; the humor was totally unexpected and fresh and you went into the theatre not knowing anything about the movies.It may be funnier if you don't know ANYTHING about it. For me, it was a loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nachooooooo!!!!!!!!!","review":"I saw this movie today and I thought it was hilarious! It was about this guy nicknamed Nacho (Jack Black) who was raised in a monastery in Mexico as a cook. He takes up wrestling (called Luchador) to raise money to buy better food for the children and to earn respect for himself. This movie is really, really funny. It also has a good storyline to it.

I believe that Jack Black owes me and anyone else who bought this movie the money we wasted on this , this,...this excuse to pay actors and crew. How the people who've given this picture more than a one star rating can do so amazes me. To each his own, but if you buy this you can't say that I didn't try to warn you. Sorry, Jack.

By opening and closing each blastgate, as needed, you will get the maximum amount of air flow at all times.For a more \\"durable\\" blastgate, there is a metal version available at a premium. But I have found the plastic gates run into problems with use. They jam with debris and cannot be taken apart to clean. The spot welds, which hold them together, will lossen with use, then the sliding gate, which is a friction function, will not operate properly. The metal gate uses a screw to kept the gate open.Overall, it is a needed product that allows for maximum use of a dust collection system, with a blastgate installed at each branch to control the air flow to the machine in use.

The Y-Connectors and Splices do not have a taper. Why do the blastgates do?The problem is that the natural springness of the hose keeps it coming off the tapered outlets just as you're trying to tighten the clamps. This is frustrating to just a wee degree since the problem shouldn't exist at all. In addition, the price is just a tad expensive for a piece of plastic.Look elsewhere if you can find a better design, or a better price.

She covers thirty years of marriage; three babies; an abortion; her relationship with not only a world-renowned terrorist, but also one of the world's most influential families; assorted tidbits about Saudi society; PLUS, an earth-shattering event in all of 200, widely spaced pages.Frankly, if she didn't share her name with Osama, the book would probably have never been published on its own merit.However, if one knows nothing about the Kingdom and its all-too-accurately told oppressive nature, it's a great place to begin research.

She not only lifts the veil and lets us see the lives of the ultra rich Saudi women she socializes with in their harem world, and how narrow, paranoid, arrogant and selfish they can become as shut-ins, deprived of intellectual stimulation and subject to the absolute power and whims of their fathers, husbands and sons, but she also lifts the veil on parts of her own heart and mind that many of us would prefer to keep private. I think she does that so that we will believe in her and what she is saying about the looming cultural crises as fundamental Wahabi Islam rapidly spreads through both the Moslem and the western world. What Carmen Bin Ladin says is not politically correct but has to be said so that western women hold on to their rare and precious freedoms and are not seduced by an extremist culture that will force them into absolute submission."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you lie down with rats, don't be surprised if you get fleas","review":"The title of my review says it all.

I think the average reader would find it interesting, but seeing the culture up close and personal makes it more relatable. She speaks with such candor about the things that she experienced and lived with and lived thru. She was always respectful of the members of the Bin Laden family when she addressed them in the book. Never trying to belittle or demean them but share a view into their life. She just hit so many nails on the head about the way women live and are treated who are a part of this culture. I feel for her and her daughters because though they are no longer tied to the Bin Laden family legally, because of the girls birth right, they will always be Bin Ladens and the world will forever associate them to their uncle Osama and his world. Good easy read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written, couldn't put it down","review":"What a fascinating inside look into the role of women in Saudi Arabia. Thank you Carmen for sharing your expereinces and opening your life to those of us who wondered what it was like for a woman in the Middle East. The honest sharing, dichotomy of lives from Western to Eastern cultures gave tremendous insite into this culture and its impact on women. This was a book I did not put down and shared with my friends. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal and inside look at the Saudis","review":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi ArabiaVery revealing view of life as a wife and mother in Saudi Arabia. Women are entirely repressed, not able to leave their homes unescorted, never being able to express their feelings or thoughts. Always under the threat of losing their children.A very informative book about a Christian girl who marries a brother of Obama bin Laudin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"A fascinating look into the ethos of the Kingdom of Saud. Very entertaining and educational. A worthwhile read for anyone interested in Saudi Geo-Politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, interesting, informative read","review":"I'm certain there are a lot of books detailing the life of women in Saudi Arabia and doubtful this one is significantly different. That said, the book was very informative for someone who has had no exposure to how these women live or how the Saudi society operates, save for the media. It is a very fast read with simple sentence structure. None the less, it held my interest, so I do recommend it. My only criticism is the author did seem to have an agenda to point to Osama Bin Ladin as a terrorist, as well as the likelihood of the Saudi involvement in general, tying the Bin Ladin family and Saudi royalty together. Given this attention was given only in the initial and ending chapters, I was OK with it, though it did come across as a marketing ploy."},{"rating":"2","title":"ending was rushed","review":"I enjoyed this book and I value her courage to speak out against such a powerful clan and kingdom. However, while the first few chapters were extremely detailed, I felt that the ending (divorce from Yeslam) was rushed and quickly summed up. Given that this event was highly built up, she could have spent more time/detail on how the marriage separation worked out. It seemed like it was and is still a huge struggle, but we were spared the details."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opener","review":"What a read. I couldn't put it down. It gives a terrific insight into life in another country. You will appreciate the freedom that we, as women, have in the United States. It makes one really understand our free agency as women in America. Carmen faced so many trial that we take for granted and yet made the decision she felt best for her family. Don't miss it. We passed the book around and every one of the five women readers raved about the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"behind the veil","review":"Wow, a real eye-opener and a page turner. Exposes a highly non-sustainable and misogynous society. Makes one feel guilty about buying oil from people that treat half of their population like sub-humans. If even half of Carmen Bin-Laden's text is true, there is serious moral repugnance in the house of Saud and the religious mafia that supports it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book although not quite sure if its all true, nevertheless its worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatty Liver Relief","review":"I have been taking this product for over two years. I first started it for a diagnosed fatty liver condition. I felt relief within a week and my liver counts were in the normal range within 6 months. The medical Doctor's recommendation for fatty liver was to eat less fat and no red meat. After seeing my counts back to normal he only said \\"keep on doing what ever you are doing\\". That is taking two of these capsules each day and eating meat, including red meat once or twice a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"I wouldn't recommend this colander... unless you just want to hang it on the wall for color or something like that. It's very pretty. With regular use, however, the enamel started to chip & the underlying metal began to rust within 4 months. We've had it for about 8 months now and it's completely unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"greg sage= The man","review":"the wipers are one of the best bands i ever heard.and this album rules.Greg sage is a guitar genius,doing things on the guitar that i barely EVER heard people do before him.hes a genius,and a VERY nice guy.go to Zenorecords.com or his official webpage.you wont be dissapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizzare,intresting","review":"Dave Kouple,is extremely underated as a bassist.If you listen to this recording you'll realize that he actually served as a rythm guitarist.Unfortunately his best work was never heard on a wipers album.Sam Henry's abillities were also underused but if you listen to track 12 (born with a curse), a portion of his skill can be heard.The wipers were definately an unusual band but somehow their music sounds almost like a very raw, stripped down orcestra.Alien boy(with the exception of a few quirky lyrics)is a good example.I would say overall that the wipers are definately an acquired taste but very interesting and fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a wonderful Zimmer collector's CD. Altough the artwork isn't very good, what's inside is really the important stuff. A CD that is worthing the listening from the first to the last second. I really recommend this to every single Zimmer fan. The fact that it contains previously unreleased material from Zimmer makes this CD one of the best on the market. This is really better than Good Morning America! A World Apart End Title is by far the best track. I really enjoy listening to it every time. And the whole CD as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this CD","review":"It has only about 5 songs. I just got it only one of the songs is a tiple Zimmer. I guess the others were from earlier years and they have a different style. I like Hans Zimmer's Gladiator, and Last Samuri. Forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slippin and a' Slidding","review":"I used both types of band clamps- steel band clamps and wire band clamps- with the ribbed hose in my dust collection system.The steel band clamps slipped more, were harder to control going on and didn't seat as well as the the wire band clamps"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"A well done documentary with the current world's religious leaders: interesting questions and honest answers- offers a rare insight into the private lives and thoughts of these important leaders of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"National Geographic is well known for its pictorial brilliance, and this film doesn't lack in that area, but I made the mistake of not considering what it cost to gain the access required to make it. A little more journalistic independence and integrity would have made for a more honest portrayal in a least some cases. I found the gratuitous anti-Americanism and hypocrisy a little hard to swallow. Nice visuals though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Energy","review":"It is rare in contemporary fiction to find a truly unique voice. There are more writers and publishers of fiction today than anyone can keep up with, and considering that much of it sounds exactly the same, why should one even try? Well, now there's a reason. Lee K. Abbott writes with a new energy, a sustained vitality, and his work carries an importance most cookie-cut contemporary work lacks. He has a filled bag of characters and situations, and he's got the raw writerly talent to make them interesting and believable. Any student of fiction or avid reader should find a copy of all of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophie Conran Salad Plate Celadon","review":"I bought these to go along with my white ones and they go so well together! I love them and went on to buy the dinner plates in this color and the bowls. They mix well with the ones I have and this blue is a soft light beach blue which is what I really hoped for when buying them. Absolutely gorgeous"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Brass","review":"Johannes Somary and the English Chamber Orchestra play this wonderful music like it needed to be played, in order to be heard outdoors. I have just compared it with the so-called authentic recording by Sir Charles MacKerras and the Orchestra of St. Luke's. As admirable as the latter is in some respects, it does seem tame and overly rapid in tempi. Somary, on the other hand, lets the brass soar in excellent ADD sound. I cannot praise the performance by Somary and the E.C.O. too highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must in any library of African Hunting literature.","review":"I found this book to be well written, informative, and entertaining. Written in the first person, the author makes no attempt to be the hero of the story-line. It is a matter of fact approach to the real life adventures of a man who truly had \\"Been there, Done that\\" in the wilds of Africa. The author relates not only the adventures of safari, but also the mundane, and sometimes dangerous aspects of it as well. His somewhat controversial recommendations of suitable calibers for elephant hunting are backed up by hundreds of real life experiences, with sound logic, as opposed to theoretical arm-chair ballistics. I didn't want to put the book down until I had finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, even for the experienced","review":"I have been a professional hunter since 1994 and having worked and lived in countries like Botswana, Tanzania, Republic of the Congo, and Mozambique and having been in Bell's environment, albeit many many years later, his stories and his accounts are absolutely marvelous and it depicts an Africa that once was. His innocent comments on the natives and the abundance of wildlife is an absolute pleasure. Even more delightful, is his casual way of describing how you should go about brain shooting five bull elephant within a matter of seconds...a must for all serious hunters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much bragging","review":"This book was purchased for a gift. Unfortunately the recipient isn't enjoying it because the author spends more time bragging up himself than he does telling a good story. I wish I had saved the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"5\\" blast gate","review":"I needed a 5\\" blast gate to connect my large drum sander to dust collection. These are hard not easy to find and the price was very good. The gate is made from plastic like most low end gates. It will not handle a lot of abuse and needs to be cleaned out regularly for it to close all the way. Still it funtions very well and I would buy again if I needed more. Great for the small size wood worker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not very good, but woks","review":"This is a decent Zimmer compilation from his early USA projects but I don't see why Milan released this CD with songs previously released tracks on various CD's. If they really wanted to release something special, they should have added to the tracklisting some previously unreleased tracks, like they did on The British Years, especially from Rain Man and The Lion King which are really wonderful soundtracks. However, this is a perfect compilation for early Zimmer fans. Overall, think twice before buying this CD. You risk to fell sorry later for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Gun For The Price","review":"This gun is good for the price first of all the mag has a nice weight.If you go inside of the mag you will find metal bars same thing with the gun.The gun feels a little bit flimsy but it looks very nice and realistic.The trigger is the same as the one on a real colt gun.I shot myself with it and with 12g bbs it makes a mrk and swells up.It isnt to bad though.The gun is fairly accurate with 20g bbs but the 12g.'s are either accurate or way off.I would definatly reccomend this gun escpeccially for the price it would make a good side arm and just so you know the whole tip is not orange wich also makes it more realistic.But the gun is a bit light.P.S. i got this gun for free here [...] you can go to the site if you want to find out more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asome","review":"This gun is the best gun ever and i got it today once i bout it i was a little upset that it would take 5 to 7 days to ship.But when i got it i was so exited so i opened it and loaded it and took it out to my backyard and i shot a bird!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"The gun is what you pay for. for 9 bucks its the best for your money, of course it is not going to last too long but heey its only 9 bucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Got It Today & It Broke Already","review":"I ordered 5 items two weeks and this was the LAST item to come today.
