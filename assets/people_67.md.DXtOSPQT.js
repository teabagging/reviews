Linda's heroes are renowned for their \\"alpha\\" male characteristics, but Niko Constantinos takes it two steps past alpha, and does Greek men a disservice at the same time. Jessica Stanton is a whiny, tearful idiot, who lacks the courage of her convictions. She's also never read the instruction manual for heroines - you don't mention marriage the first time you're in bed with the hero! Tsk tsk. It's an interesting read for Howard fans, but if you're looking to try one of her books, don't start with this one unless you're still convinced that men are dominant and should control the lives of their women. If you do feel this way, then by all means take this book back into your cave, but make sure you skin the woolly mammoth carcass before you settle down to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really Linda Howard?","review":"I fell in love with Linda Howard reading MacKenzie Mountain and Dream Man and have eagerly snatched up all her books since then. I love her style of writing and her characters, they are strong, well-adjusted, perfectly matched both in bed and out! This book was a shock, the storyline gave me the creeps and I had to struggle to finish it.The story went something like this, they met, sparks fly, Nicholas goes into a fit of jealous rage for no apparent reason, Jessica crys, they make up, Jessica crys, they go to Greece, Jessica crys, Nicholas forces Jessica (in more ways than one) to stay on the Island, Jessica crys. They live happily ever after, or at least as happily as dripping faucet can live with an extremely violent, immature man.Shame on the publishers for reprinting this -- don't buy it, get Dream Man, Son of the Morning or any of the MacKenzie books instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the printed date","review":"This book is deceiving because it is listed as being printed in 1998, however it was written in 1982 and it shows. Linda had not yet developped the writting style we know and love from her more recent works. The most emotion this book generated on my part was a desire to shake the so called heroine until she wised up and got a spine! She was just pitiful. The weird thing is that in the 80's most romance books were like this and this one must have been a success because LH is a talented author. However, times have changed, thank God, and the type of man that treats the woman he loves like he always knows what's best for her and carts her around like a piece of luggage is a thing of the past and should stay in the past!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of Linda Howard","review":"This must be the earliest book penned by Linda Howard. The characters are so immature. The heroine does not deserve to be called hero, the best she can do is crying for no apparent reason. I absolutely agree to the previous reviewer, this book is not worth buying. If you are Linda Howard's fanatic reader and do not want to miss even one of her book, just borrow this book, DO NOT BUY ! All The MacKenzie books, Heart a Fire, After the Night and Dream Man are highly recommended for all Linda Howard's first reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, seriously, it's really that awful","review":"I love Linda Howard, but oh boy! was this a stinker. The other reviewers are right - the \\"hero\\" is so irredeemably awful and the heroine is so moistly ineffectual, that I wanted to throw up. This is not some post-feminist, can't-men-be-more-like-women rant. I love strong, capable heroes, but Nick is a spousal-abuse case waiting to happen.And the heroine - what does it say that I don't even remember her *name*! She puts the \\"co\\" in co-dependent. She keeps saying she'll just turn Nick away and get him to leave her alone, but she never says \\"no\\" like she means it. Why not call the cops, refuse to answer the door, leak the story to the press, etc? It's not like this was feudal England and she had no options.If you want to read a good romance with a strong, difficult hero, I'd recommend \\"Duncan's Bride\\" (Howard) or \\"These Old Shades\\" (Georgette Heyer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I don't ususally write reviews but I just had to with this book. The first time I read All that Glitters I loved the book. The second time i read it I hated it with a passion. I guess you can account it for the time that the book was written. But the hero (Niko) was manipulative, unsensitive and not a hero in the sense that a hero should be in a romance novel. The heroine (Jessica) was just a weak cry baby that had no spine and allowed him to do anything to her. She put up with a lot of junk that any heroine in any other book would have not put up with.I agree with the reviewers that say that the publishers should be ashamed that they republished this book.If you want to read a good Linda Howard book read any of the McKenzies, Diamond Bay, White Lies, or Midnight Rainbow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit republishing Howard's early works!","review":"This book does not, in any way, reflect the talents of Ms. Howard!

That's what I've come to expect from Linda Howard, not the sniveling weak heroine and Ari Onassis wannabe \\"hero\\". Hero is definitely not a wise choice of name but the only name the FCC will allow on the Internet. Linda Howard's other books are a far, far better bet for a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a romance.","review":"I have never read a romance before where the \\"hero\\" was such a jerk, actually jerk does not really cover it, but what does isn't printable. I would recommend everyone skip this book. Okay it was written in '82, but even comparing it to books of this era it is still a dud. Heros are supposed to be just that - heros, someone to look up to. This guy would be more suitable in the role of a villian"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M SADLY DISAPPOINTED","review":"This was an okay book. I'll say that much because Linda Howard is my favorite author, and everyone is allowed mistakes.

Maybe Amazon should also start reviewing PUBLISHERS along with their books??"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't stop laughing!","review":"The only good thing about this book is the title! I've never read anything written so strangely before. The beginning is just bizarre in its whole tone, and it pretty much continues on that way during the rest of the book.

Once in a while a person comes across a book that totally captures the true meaning of love and passion. Three Moons Rising did this for me. You want action? Read it. You want romance? Read it.

This is a 5 star book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to keep attention on story","review":"I have read hundreds, perhaps thousands of romance novels. I have never had such a hard time reading a novel due to typographical errors and simply bad grammar. Where was the editorial control for this novel? The story was acceptable, but the dialogue was stilted. There was no examination of the characters' motivations or evolution towards intimacy. This novel needed a lot more editorial work before it was placed before the reading public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the drawing board --","review":"THREE MOONS RISING revolves around mysterious interlocking necklaces, blue water cats, barely believable fictional planets, and one man's determination to make \\"his\\" woman bend to his ways at any cost. If this is romance, give me a good murder mystery any day!When scenes involve both the hero and heroine together, their points of view shift back and forth so often, I felt like I was watching a tennis match. The hero also has no concept of romance, constantly trying to force himself upon the heroine, who can't understand why she has such a magnetic attraction to him. I couldn't understand it either.The book needs much more editing than it obviously was given. With more in-depth and believable, sympathetic characterization, this might have been at least a readable story. Smoother transitions between chapters and scene breaks are also needed. As it stands now, it didn't work for me on any level."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with this book??","review":"I love science fiction, fantasy, and futuristic romance books, and so decided to try this because of the rave reviews.Don't waste your money, folks. As many people have already said, it has some major editing problems -- not just in spelling, grammar, and commas, either. The characters are very poorly developed and the story just doesn't mesh together. The hero is dastardly and the heroine is...indescribably wishy-washy.I recommend the author have her next book edited by a professional and go from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy writing and non-existent transitions.","review":"Three Moons Rising has an acceptable premise, but is very poorly executed. Never mind the over-abundance of commas and lousy grammar -- concentrate on the storytelling itself -- that says it all. The author lets the reader in on every character's thought, and beyond -- what's more commonly known as head-hopping. VERY annoying. Choppy sentences and non-existent transitions continually pull the reader out of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throw out this CD case!","review":"If it wasn't for the unique spin the bottle scene on the cover or the list of songs on the back, this CD case would be useless.

Songs like \\"Share an Apple\\" and \\"Something Sour\\" blare out during shuffle mode in-between Curt Kobain's distortion and Eddie Vedder's groaning.

Then I quickly picked up As The Palaces Burn along with their first album New American Gospel, and I was hooked to it right away. The vocals were just awesome, the guitar riffs and the insane double basses are so catchy, you just get every song stuck in your head for days and never get tired of them. A true heavy metal assault, I love it. Favorite Songs: Ruin, 11th Hour, and As The Palaces Burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album shows growth.","review":"After seeing Lamb of God live and hearing their first release i have to say that i was unsure what all the praise was about. I didnt see anythin in their first album that showed such great promise. With theire second release \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" they've proven me wrong. Taking some style from the very popular Swedish sound they have grown into one of America's newest metal talents. Although many fans believe Iced Earth to be the premeire metal band from america Lamb of God Actually shows more raw talent without the theatrics. They forge a mix of swedish and east bay area metal sounds to create a new american metal sound that may become quite popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"OL' VIRGINIA BOYS","review":"Yes, yes, yes. These guys make me proud to be from Virginia, and with the title of the song \\"in defense of our good name\\" that says it all. This album is really good.

I immediately bought this album. This a cd that is a landmark for metal. This is a cd that sets an example and level for which other metal should be. I am a metal guitarist, and this cd just blows me away. These guys destroy anything Slipknot could offer. The singers roars and shreiks are among the best I've ever heard. The drummer is absolutely tight in everything he does. The bass is actually audible, which isnt very common on metal albums; especially for a band as hardcore as this one. The guitarists throw out creative, awe-inspiring, and technical riffs. These are some of the most precise riffs, and heaviest, that have ever graced my hearing. This is a beautiful album. These guys will be huge someday. These guys know how to rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"metal cd of 2003","review":"i was reading a magazine the other day and saw that lamb of god was their pick for the best cd of 2003. so i decided to pick it up and it is a very good cd every song is hard hitting and to the point just heavy as they can get. this is a cd for metal fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"This cd is just brutle.

They still have their heavy sound, which they have on every CD, but the spark of the songs and their arrangements don't have all the attention grabbing potential of other works. Don't get me wrong, I still like it very much but not every song, as I would on a number of their other CD's. There are only 2 or so tracks that I like the most and the others I could give or take. But... that in no way means I don't love \\"Lamb of God\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album for 2003!","review":"I really love this Band. They put out some supurb music.

I have listened to this cd way too many times to count and I still put it in my cd player from time to time.

Go pick this up, it is one of the best albums of 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST OF THE BEST!","review":"First off Lamb of God was a underground band for quite sometime so there other records may be unheard of. This cd though is there most popular and there best. Every song has the crazy extreme vocals to just plain out awesome drumming and guitar playing. This cd was voted cd of the year in 2003 in Revolver magazine which is a honer. I've had this cd ever since it came out and I'm still not sick of it. The cd features hit songs like 11th hour, As The Palaces Burn and some other great songs. If you liked Lamb of God before or just like plain out awesome heavy metal pick this up now. If you want more of Lamb Of God there new cd is comeing out late this year early next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most unique groups in metal today, a great album","review":"Revolver Magazine dubbed this \\"the most devastating album of the year\\". I think that pretty well sums it up. This is a masterfully crafted heavy metal album. Randy Blythe's vocals might be the most unique in metal, and they fit perfectly with the dark and fast pace of this CD. My only gripe is that since Randy's vocals are so low, they sometimes get drowned out by the rest of the band. Hopefully their next album, their major label debut on Epic Records titled \\"Ashes of the Wake\\", will fix this problem. Even with this slight problem, this is still one of the best metal albums in recent memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT ONLY GETS BETTER","review":"This album is as good as if not then better then NAG.

If you are looking for music to enable you to beat the hell out of anyone, this CD is it. Randy Blythe's vocals are absolutely his own, no one else on earth sounds like this guy.

Upon first listen it's like \\"Hey, I've heard this before!\\" For something new and imaginative try Meshuggah, Opeth or Origin. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmz.. seriously?","review":"i'm a heavy metal fan, Pantera, in flames, dimmu borgir, CoF and KSE to name a few.and once the bloke below me, said that 11th hour sounded like pantera, i had to download it, to check them out before i bought the album (well that was the original idea)pantera? u gotta be listening to a different band called pantera than i am!i love fast paced guitars, deafening riffs and screaching solos, but the few songs i listened to, had only the speed.in my opinion, if you like want to try these, i would most definately check out In Flames beforehand, they are 5x the band Lamb of god is!just my opinion tho"},{"rating":"1","title":"mainstream and pretty lame","review":"I give these guys two stars because for mainstream metal, theyre not bad compared to what we had to deal with 5-10 years ago. However, pretty much everything you will hear from them is a watered down version of other metal bands who already existed. The band sounds more like hardcore to me, especially the completely gurgled and screamed vocals. The guitar work is extremely repetitive not to mention I believe lamb of god has the worst guitar tone in the world, way to dry and abrasive. I saw them live and this didn't change, they are a slow band with a horrible tone overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's The Big Deal","review":"ok ok alot of you people are going to hate me but you what know WHO CARES!.Honestly these guys really stink and are very over talked about if u want real music listen to Vader,Strapping Young Lad,Nile etc etc.Sorry these guys are not that great The Lead Singer sounds like he trys to be Heavy when he isn't and even more bad news THEY SUCK LIVE.The Drumming is crappy Doc from Vader BLOWS this guy away to see what i mean listen to Vader.So to conclude this this cd is horrible and the band has never been good.I can't even say listen to thier underground stuff when they were called Burn The Priest cause they suck also I'm Done.ps.yo buddy dont take cheap shots at someone cause you are not at my level man especially writing the review saying that they replaced the Deftones as the loudest band ARE YOU SERIOUS MAN!The Deftones come on man dont embarass yourself dude keep ur comments to yourself LATE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamb of God's As the Palace Burns is painful","review":"This cd has absolutely no talented vocals to it what so ever. I wanted to like this cd but there is just no way I could. It is horrible. Sure the riffs and drums are thrashing but howling vocals over the top of it makes it sound awful!

These are what talented vocalists sound like!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah","review":"As The Palaces Burn would have to be one of the best compact disk out there.

These guys do it as good or better than anyone else in the metal world right now. You have great songwriting, and thats what sets them apart from most of the crowd.There is definitely a trend here. No one can deny that if you have a Killswitch album album you're likely to dig unearth. The list goes on and on, but whats wrong with that as long as there is some origninality in the song writing. As long as I don't think I'm hearing a specific metallica riff, or lyrics almost exactly like pantera I'm alright. And I coudn't pin down any particular song with these guys.So if you're not jaded on metal core hardcore whatever other label people come up with, then check this album out because its a legitimate part of good heavy metal"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aie!!!","review":"I didn't know what happened to Iommi or the others Black Sabbath member when recording such a disc!

This cd starts off like a shot. I Witness and Cross of Thorns are quite excellant. Psychophobia is a stand out. Back to Eden has a kick to it... but other than that, there isn't much here. The production is questionable with CoT fading out even as Tony is singing seems a bit odd, it doesn't seem like the song was finished. The sound however is top-notch and can be recommended on that facet and the fact that the price is right. Had more time been spent creating songs that aren't instant throw aways, this cd would be near great. Tony Martins voice is adequate, though generally one dimensional, and Iommi's guitar is a bit watered down, though the playing is quite superb.In the end, this cd represents a lot of highs and lows at a time when music, at least heavy music, was fading fast. If you have Heaven and Hell, burned out Mob Rules, Cross Purposes may be a nice distraction, just get ready to press the 'skip' button on your cd player... a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the kids in the car - especially (RAGG MOPP)","review":"This tape has a lot of songs that the children can relate to.

At first I thought itwould be good since this little girl can see images of another little boy and all that happens to him. Boy but was I wrong!

His secrets, his castle and home, his hiding places? Love blossoms between the two, but will Stephen have to return to war?Karen Ranney's sequel to My Beloved is a touching and moving story, set amist war-torn England.

They're how I obtain most of my books, are often decent quality, and are cheap. And thank god, especially if in between the good ones you manage to pull Hell on Earth. I got this at the same time as the first DOOM novel, and was startled at the differences between them. Knee-Deep In The Dead was a dump fun Aliens rip off that also stuck to the style of the game. Hell On Earth, though, is a lumbering bore, short on plot, character developement, humor and all those other things need to keep this reader awake. To call this a mess would be an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second and last one worth reading","review":"Storyline is close to Doom II however, it lacks wits, style and credibility.It is rich with action, even though it gets to be a little repetitive and sometimes even predictable. It has very little substance and I think the author would have done a better job if he didn't try so hard to basically transmute the videogame action into words.All in all, if you're a Doom fan, it's worth the read.Keep in mind this is NOT THE STORY of Doom, as thought by it's creators, iD Software. Rather, it is the author's view."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is reviting","review":"This book is pretty sweet. One may think this book is a cheap rip off from the game. But in actuality the game seems to be a cheap rip off the book. Things may be looking up for a moment but it only looks up above the pile of dead bodies and your own blood. Never will it look up to the stars above. I recently saw the movie Matrix and i think that movie was amazing. I think that Doom and Matrix have interesting parrelels. If you liked Matrix you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the second best book in the series","review":"I have read all four Doom books and I'd have to say this one is just too good. Sure, the first book was a lot better (my favorite novel ever), but this one is right behind it. My only problems with the series are the endings. They leave you hanging in a way that isn't too suspenceful, and the second book shows it. But, the two new characters (Jill and Albert) and the introductions of Revenants (called \\"bonys\\"), Mancubi (called \\"fatty\\"), and Former Commandos (called, um, Clydes) and the growing love interest between Arlene and Albert make it a worthy successor to the legendary first book. Overall a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic","review":"I have never had a hole puncher just not work, so this is a first. I have been a teacher for 9 years now. We use hole punchers often. This weak, plastic thing lasted 3 weeks. What a loss of my money.

My co-workers and I have found that genuine teamwork, especially management/employee teamwork, requires far more than just a short kid's story to be successful. Having read the hilarious and witty-sharp satire, \\"MANAGEMENT BY VICE\\", we all agreed that the naive concept of \\"High Five\\" teamwork is actually just a \\"Management Spoof\\" -- one of the many real-life eye-openers in \\"Management by Vice\\", where you'll find out for yourself what truly needs to be addressed to make teamwork a company success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little book!","review":"\\"High Five! The Magic of Working Together\\" is a good read.Instead of telling you straight off the points of how to build a good team. It tells a story about how an unemployed transforms a hockey crowd to a team. Of course, there are plenty of over-simplification. However, I think one can still benefit greatly from this book.The principles are simple, but are hard to implement in real life. How often do you see people use reward instead of fault-finding to improve a team ....The book is written in a simple language that even children can understand. This is definite a nice book to bring on the bus or train to read on your journey to the office. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless. Absolutely useless.","review":"Our company bought a copy of \\"High Five\\" for every employee. I can't imagine a bigger waste of money. This sappy and unrealistic story is written at the second-grade level. There is absolutely nothing in this book that should not be common sense knowledge to every corporate employee. The book's \\"big truth\\" is \\"None of us is as smart as all of us.\\" Anyone who isn't smart enough to know that already probably won't learn it from this over-priced little book.

This... ripoff reads like a 3rd grade think-and-do book. Blanchard makes up a little story about a star performer who loses his job, sees the light and buys into the group think of teamwork. Someone needs to tell Blanchard that in the real word, individual performance gets the bucks, not teamwork. He hides behind the innocence of a kids hockey team to drive home his simplistic solution of how team fixes all. In the real leagues, Mr. Blanchard, a hockey player's salary is not dependent on how well he plays as a team member, but on just how skilled he is at hogging the puck and making the goal.

It is a good book for mentoring a team of supervisors."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the simple minded only - and not in a good way","review":"This book is a utopian, unrealistic, poorly thought-out, infantile piece of trash. It's an insult to the intelligence of any adult who reads it. Written at a third grade level with 16-point type, this book's contents would be better suited to a coloring book. The philosophy it presents a real no-brainer, and if you need to read this to learn these principles, you have bigger problems to worry about. The \\"story\\" is just that, a \\"story\\" - there isn't an ounce of truth or realism to it, so just file this book under \\"office fairy tales\\". Believe it or not, I'm not a pessimist, I love books, and I'm totally into \\"self/professional improvement\\" topics. But do not waste your time or money on this silly book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gung Ho! for High Five","review":"A great book for not only the blue collar workers but the ivory tower group (especially) as well. Blanchard and Company again take a complicated subject such as teamwork and make it so simple by putting it in a parable format. Once the reader sees how these timeless principles apply to a 5th grade hockey team, Alan applies the same principles in his work life.This would be a great read for our kid's coaches too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing went down with the ship.","review":"Hanson has spun a very interesting, compelling and thought provoking story into a boring yarn. The book simply reads like a novel (rather than history) written by a college sophomore in a seminar class. Hanson fills the story early on with useless details that never materialize to bear any relevance on the story. He seems only to be trumpeting the depth of his research without putting it to much use. His prose is thin and uninspired. One of the two most interesting aspects, the \\"at sea\\" portion of the story, is brief and contains little of the overwhelming drama it suggests. There is little exploration of the characters. Even the chapter listing other stories of cannibalism at sea are rattled off as if taken directly from research notes with little thought given to their place or purpose in the story. Some portions, such as verbatim trial testimony and factual background of the political and legal climate were enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation including some hard-to-find tracks","review":"I originally ordered this as a gift for a friend, but after listening to her copy, bought it for myself. The 2 disc collection offers an excellent compilation, including some that are indispensible and others that are very hard to find without buying an entire album by the artist. Most of the tracks sound as good as you're likely to ever hear them, considering their age and the technological limitations of the time. As always with such compilations, one can quibble over the inclusion or exclusion of certain songs, but this collection is essential for any fan of British rock of the 60's and 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Blessings","review":"There are a lot of great ole songs on this album that give me great joy to play. I didn't give this five stars because of the song slection in total analysis. Considering the bountiful number of treasured songs that came in the British invasion, I was shocked to hear some duds on this album. They could have replaced those with some much better samples of the invasion. They could also have expanded the invasion another year or two in the timeline to say 68. The songs by Gerry & the Pacemakers alone, make this worth the purchase, and actually 80% of the songs are great.

In reply to the reader who complained that the prices don't take into account the high values being sought on Ebay and other auctions, I suggest that most of the actual sales results I've seen on American wrist watches on Ebay are in line with the Guide's prices.

Just ask anyone who has purchased a vintage watch on Ebay and returned it because the condition was not as it was described. As for new price listings, I have to take their word that there are, I believe they claim, '10,000' new prices for the 2003 edition.

Samuel H. Sprott, 40th Alabama Infantry, Army of Tennessee, wrote his memoir 34 years after the War Between The States for a now defunct southern newspaper. This memoir was recently discovered tucked away in county probate records and probably not studied by historians for details about the W.B.T.S. in the deep South.Sprott, tells the story of the 40th Alabama Infantry, Stone's Battalion and Ector's Brigade. I was especially interested in information about General Ector and his brigade as little is written about this unit especially at the battle of Chickamauga. He will educate you about the everyday life of the Confederate soldier in the Army of Tennessee. His and fellow comrade's trials and jubilations are all there.The editors do a fine job coordinating Sprott's manuscript, filling in his thoughts and corroborating historical evidence.Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and well written","review":"This book is vey special as it is very different from the hundreds of children's book I own.

Of course it sticks to it's B-Move roots of producers Golan-Globus, and aparently it is a sequel to Enter the Ninja. Although there is NO connection, other than the star Sho Kosugi. Revenge of the Ninja stands well on its own and is actually better than Enter. The fight chorography is stupendous and really made the film more enjoyable. The fights are even better than Enter; must be due to Kusugi staging the choreography himself. Kung Fu fans enjoy! For more B-Action move enjoyment, see the next entry Ninja III: The Domination. Again it has nothing to do with Enter the Ninja or Revenge of the Ninja other than Kosugi, but still is fun in its B-Movie way."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST Martial Arts Films made!","review":"Okay... Sho Kosugi (star) and Sam Firstenberg's (director) first efforts (excluding Kosugi's minor appearance in \\"Enter the Ninja\\").Though full of holes in the story, this is THE BEST ninja flick made. Full of action, excessive-gore, unneeded nudity and language, it has everything you can ask for in a \\"popcorn-movie\\". Don't forget it was made in 1983 -- AND for around $850,000 (low-budget at that time still).The only thing that puzzles me is that the theatrical version is different then the video versions. HBO showed the theatrical version (with extented scenes with blood and gore), but for some reason MGM/UA decided to cut a few gory moments from the video release. Almost 20 years later, I still don't understand why: They were both rated-R so why cut anything?But sit back and enjoy this popcorn-flick -- BUT only if you enjoy the action-films of the 80s!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best ninja movie there is","review":"This is my favorite ninja movie and I'm very excited about it coming to dvd. The fight scenes are very good and entertaining. Sho Kosugi is the real deal and obviously has studied ninjitsu. As much as I like this movie, it's not perfect. There are some scenes that defy credulity such as when the bad ninja places dummy ninjas in certain areas when he couldn't have possibly brought them with him or when he pulls out his flame thrower. If you can overlook these minor flaws, you'll really enjoy this movie if you like campy, martial arts movies. As a bonus, the supporting actress, Ashley Ferrare, is very good and fun to watch. The plot is pretty standard except for the fun twist of pitting the mob vs. ninja (guess who wins that one!). All of the acting is better than it should be and the fight scenes excellently choregraphed. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Ninja movies ever","review":"Pure 80s Japexploitation film.

Some of Ric Ocasek's Cars mates help him out on his second solo release, although Ocasek breathes a somewhat different life in a few of the songs here. Take, for instance, \\"Emotion In Motion\\", with its slowed-down rhythms and unique lyrics, which don't sound like the typical Cars record. The same can be said for the title track, along with \\"Emotion In Motion\\". which lack the new wave appeal and sound The Cars helped define. The other tracks, such as \\"Hello Darkness\\" and \\"p.f.j.\\", have that Cars sensibility written all over them. Even though the music and songs featured on this CD are very similar to that of Ocasek's group, The Cars, \\"This Side Of Paradise\\" is still an enjoyable CD to listen to.

It's nice to have this kind of stuff in one place, but what's the problem? The quality. Even the Tee Set track, which I've heard better, has tape errors throughout. A bunch of tracks are mono with different terrible, hollow re-channeling methods stucco'd onto them. There's also hiss, buzzing and plenty of other anomolies. One wonders if the original release sounded as bad. Some of these tracks are common elsewhere in better quality.

I was hoping for something like the FiloFax week on two pages layout, but this, as the previous reviewer described, is very awkward to use. The long, skinny columns, tiny type and difficult-to-find month names make this a truly annoying day planner. The removable address section is a nice touch, though.Unless you're determined to have everything Moleskine, stick to the notebooks and address book (awesome!) and give the weekly diary a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Date = auto page number (Moleskine hacking)","review":"I normally used the Moleskine graph paper edition (yellow wrapper). A week ago, I picked up the Moleskine 2007 Daily as it was dirt cheap. After using is for a couple of days, I noted that the planner solves one of the main problems I've had with my regular Moleskine--the lack of page numbers. If I am working on 20 different projects, it is fairly impossible to locate any project sketches. However, now I can just use the dates as my numbering, and then log my projects in the annual view--which I used as my TOC.I just ordered five of these, as it doesn't matter what year it is, all the date is serving is some kind of marker for me to find my notes and sketches.Highly recommended 'hacked' purchase :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible New Layout","review":"I don't know why they changed from the old layout to the new skinny vertical columns. The old planner was a lifesaver, but this new layout is unusable. They claim to be the artist's notebook, but what artist is really going to be breaking their day down hour by hour?

In these late symphonies, however, he got his act together again and we are presented with the same sonorous long-line -- almost Gregorian -- passages as in the Third, along with brilliant orchestration.The sound quality is not quite as good as usual on Naxos.

Dawkins either, must have been paid per word, or is so full of himself that he can't help but pontificate - on and on and on.....He uses 20 - 100 pages to explain what could more easily be understood and absorbed in one. It is unfortunate for science that Dawkins is one of the spokespersons for evolution, as the very people who would benefit from learning of the evidence (for evolution) that he presents, would never be able to endure the boredom this rambling book engenders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich and rewarding","review":"I was worried that as the tale continued, the story would become less and less interesting.

While it does clock in at over 600 pages, what more would you expect for such a massive task? As with his other works, Dawkins makes a sometimes complicated topic easy to digest and understand. This is a thoughtful, brilliantly written journey 4 billion years into our evolutionary past. If you are looking for something lighter to read or more condensed, try The Magic of Reality, more recently written by Dawkins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific work...","review":"Another great book by Richard Dawkins! The ancestor's Tale is engrossing from start to finish, and, as usual, Dawkins makes a captivating case for the human evolutionary journey. Though I do not always necessarily agree with Dawkin's atheistic vision, he nonetheless makes lucid and convincing arguments in each and every one of his books, and the Ancestor's Tale is no exception. This book, like all of his others, is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lengthy But Worthy Tale!","review":"This book has been written with the general audience in mind, nonetheless, the subject matter of the book can be technical and dry at times. However, should one give the 600 plus pages a pensive read, one is bound to learn more about modern Zoology/Evolutionary Biology than he/she has possibly bargained for. My last Zoology course was over 25 years ago as an undergraduate, and I am simply in awe of how much our knowledge base in this area has changed since then.I particularly enjoyed Dr. Dawkins eloquent discussions on our human tendency to dichotomize or categorize the world around us. He refers to this affinity as the \\"tyranny of the discontinuous mind,\\" and provides intriguing biological explanations for this behavior. In my humble opinion, I think any individual who wants to truly grasp a global view of human behavior, should do some readings in Evolutionary Biology, and The Ancestor's Tale is a superior choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilgrimage to Dawn of Imaginative Fictitious Speculation","review":"As a zoologist, when he sticks with observable fauna phenomena, the book is quite interesting. But when he regresses back into the misty primordial fog of unobservable prehistory, the zoologist morphs into prognosticator and origineticist and the attempt doesn't come across well. The Argument from Personal Credulity fails in an age of scientific enlightenment. This book had been better off 1/3 the size and 1/2 the price. (...) For recommended rebuttal of atheistic rationalism try Dr. J. Sarfati's 'Refuting Evolution', but only if you're open to ALL the data beyond one zoologist's take on origins events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique book","review":"Others have said plenty I need not repeat.

I have read some of his other books that are most interesting but this one just doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book but Why the Constant American Bashing?","review":"I enjoyed this book but lost all respect for the author as he bashed Americans and Republican Presidents. He is quick to bash Americans for not securing Iraqi Museums as the major priority of the Gulf War. He makes fun of President Bush's Texas accent (I have no idea how that relates to Evolution).However, the empire that committed atrocities in Tasmania, his own British Empire, is omitted.If you like Evolution and hate Americans, then this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irreducible complexity?","review":"This work may be a fine and lucid account of biological history from a evolutionary standpoint, but it fails to address many of the gaping fallacies behind modern secular theory; the principle shortcoming being irreducible complexity.Many of nature's wonders - such as the motor-driven tails of the bacterium Helicobacter - simply cannot be accounted for by the incremental genetic framework proposed by evolutionists such as Dawkins. Like a George Foreman GRP4P Next Grilleration 4-Burger Grill, if you remove the functionality of a single component (such as the grease tray) then the organism (grill) will fail to operate, and hot burger fat goes literally everywhere. Thus, how can complex organisms, whose existence relies on the functionality of many thousands of different biological mechanisms (such as legs), come into being through minor genetic mutations? The answer: they can't! Only a divine creator (a.k.a. God) can have been responsible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawkins finally reveals he is good for something after-all - writing creation myths","review":"An interesting science FICTION journey based on no reality but Dawkins' own childish fantasies.You'd think he'd look at the fossil record before writing a book like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good blend of scope and detail","review":"I was impressed by how much detail is known to science about the deep phylogenies Dawkins explains, and how well support it all is. I think working backwards as this presentation is structured is valid and unusually clear. The limits on the most distant relationships pale in comparison with the insights genetic and molecular methods have provided in tracing homologies and deep structures far into the past. Dawkins manages to include a great deal of information, in detail, into an entertaining read.My main complaint is the the sheer massive nonstep density of misspellings in the book made focusing on the narrative difficult, like being slapped in the face every few seconds. The book could have been significantly more readable with even minimal editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dawkins is no Stephen Jay Gould","review":"Dawkins spends a lot of time talking about how the book is organized, as if he's writing his thoughts down as they come to him. And this is especially annoying since the \\"Canterbury Tales\\" analogy simply doesn't work. Also, he spends a great deal of time on nomenclature instead of more interesting scientific facts, and alludes to things he's not telling us because they're in his other books, assuming we've read everything he's ever written. This is not the grand overview of evolution it appears to be. In fact, I'm not sure why it was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy---","review":"It is very rare that I lay a book aside before finishing it, as I did A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution. I found Dawkin's book to be hopelessly wordy and dense. So did my husband, who has a PhD in biochemistry. It may be brilliant in its conclusions, but in its delivery this book in not user-friendly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawkins and Evolution","review":"I am a fan of the writings of Richard Dawkins on evolution and have four of his books on the subject.

Acoustic guitars over a 4/4 rock beat? Hullo? Where is the marked Cranes seal of creativity and beauty? Alison's voice does not work in rock.

The Cranes NEED strings... rock is definately not their thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like commercialism...","review":"This is not a Cranes CD. It is a pathetically derivative piece of alternaschlock that begs for college radio.

If you want to experience the immortal bliss of this group, try Wings of Joy, Forever, or Loved. Cranes are dead... long live the Cranes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing sellout","review":"I consider myself to be a strong fan of the Cranes--well, I considered myself to be, I suppose. You can't imagine my disappointment, then, when I bought the extra-$pendy version of Population Four, only to suffer the trite and uncreative instrumentation of the top-40 indie scene. The first indicator of this slide is the uncecessary and repetetive use of our four-letter favorite in the very first track. It seems to go downhill from there. The only exception to the nonstop drivel that seeps from this putrescent album is Stalk, which surprisngly was the only song Alison did NOT sing or write. Perhaps Alison was simply going through a rough time when she wrote the other eleven songs, but I sense she had a larger hand in the songwriting this time, and it shows. This album had none of the mysticism of Loved, none of the dreaminess of Golden, and none of the melancholia of Wings of Joy. It was a sellout. It reeked of money and conformity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful vocals!","review":"While previewing the samples on all these albums, I kept waiting for the voice to change a little.

What a stinker!","review":"I can't tell you how many times the CRANES have restored my faith in the order and meaning of the universe. They give me a dark, cold corner in which I recoil, regroup, and marshall my forces to face the virulent rash of humanity. Each CRANES album is indescribably meaningful to me; each has its own unique features, flaws and facets that make my soul sing. But POPULATION FOUR just stinks. No two ways about it. My friend Liz interviewed Alison Shaw for a student newspaper (we were both friends of the editor) and says that she's quite intelligent, talks lots about Dostoevsky and such. God...what the hell happened?! I was very distraught when I heard POP4, and I wonder if the alterna-teen indie crowd that the CRANES have clearly gone out of their way to attract with this album, is any larger or more devoted than the gothic crowd they've alienated with it. My friends and I have come up with a puerile but amusing nickname for this album: FLATULATION FOUR."},{"rating":"1","title":"For recordings of mice getting stepped on - buy this.","review":"The Cranes music sound isn't bad, but is poorly written.

All in all, it is a very toned down affair with two rockers. Jim's attempt at singing is a novelty, fun for a while, and thankfully limited to one track. But hey, we all slow down at some point. This was a prelude--a transition--from \\"Loved\\" to \\"Future Songs,\\" and not a bad one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately not their best, but still worth the buy.","review":"While this album is extremely different from the Cranes normal songs I still enjoyed it. Alison's voice is what has always attracted me to the group and her voice sounds just as beautiful over rock music as it does over their usual goth style. I do wish that the cranes return to their earlier form however, with albums like forever and wings of joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty darn good","review":"With four or five artists on the album that I already liked, the other songs blend in to give a refreshing change to listening to the radio or a certain CD... if you like anybody on it... it's excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly wonderful","review":"This cd is sooo kool. i'm so glad i bought it. the two pj songs are sooo kool. it's great to know that we're helping people while listening to great music at the same time. i don't know how this cd can be worth less than 5+ stars. great."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must-have","review":"from the opening beat of \\"last kiss\\" to the final strings of \\"soldier of love\\", this album rocks.

You can imagine the difficulty of being so revealing of your own family in print! Without these insights, a reader would have been mislead about what it means to survive with others.I also listened to an unabridged book-on-tape, and the idea of a long story, well told, detail by detail was wonderful.

About 75% of the impact is against Mrs. Dole, her motivations, style and political aims, thereby raising questions about the true objective of the book. Also, one would expect that the name of the founder of the International Red Cross, Henri Dunant, would not be given incorrectly as \\"Henry Dumond.\\" This is comparable to calling George Washington \\"George Wallington,\\" and makes one wonder about other possible , and more serious, inaccuracies not so easily detected by the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of accusations; where are the facts","review":"The author concludes that because Red Cross makes a LOT of money on blood and because a terrible thing - AIDS- happened to patients, then the Red Cross must have profited from these terrible things. Well, that may be true (and there are Red Cross employees who did jail time in Canada, France, Japan, etc. to suggest there is something to that) but there are no facts here to support the connection. There has been no investigative journalism done here.

It's unfortunate the author did not present the facts as facts. I think this book should be placed in the fiction category. As a consumer, I think we have the right to know...the truth. It's obvious the author did not thoroughly investigate blood banking & Red Cross, but had her negative idea in mind before putting pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard).I didn't understand the author's purpose. This book doesn't hurt Red Cross, it hurts the patients awaiting and needing blood transfusions. Did she want people to stop donating with Red Cross?

However, it sells books to just state the Red Cross was the only one responsible for HIV/AIDS. The Red Cross does not make money on their blood supply. They charge hospitals for processing fees only to recoup the cost of the manufacturing, testing, processing, etc. of the blood it collects. It is the hospitals that are permited to collect the money, charge patients and insurances. Before criticizing the Red Cross, do some research yourself. FDA standards are met and exceeded for blood testing by the ARC."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch it.","review":"You'll cry. Very powerful movie. it lets you see things from a perspective that you would have NEVER been able to imagine. This documentary is beyond amazing <3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classroom","review":"This is an amazing documentary. I showed this film to my Spanish classes last year and they loved it. The students were amazed at just how brave the boys and girls are for leaving their home and traveling to the United States via train...alone!

He lived in the years, late 1800s to 1930, and wrote about morals and habits common to the time and place. By the time you get to this vol. you are very well aquainted with the family, their virtues and faults. If you are not English, which I am not, you may find, as I did, that there are many words, slang and otherwise, that are a bit confusing. But it was enjoyable to be exposed to this difference in language. (We don't really speak English here in America. We speak American!) But people are people wherever they may live and life experiences much the same. A very enjoyable record of a large and loyal family finding their way after the Big War, dealing with the scary changes in traditions and thought. I fully recommend it to lovers of sagas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is profanity required?","review":"The overall music is pretty good production-wise but does a talented rapper really need profanity to get his point across?Lyrically it's garbage and clearly lacking in maturity. I think this guy needs to wake up and smell the coffee and get pass the kids play. With the music talent behind this recording, maybe its time all rappers go beyond the street mentallity and move toward positive thinking. It would have a huge impact on an audience that is already riddled with life's hardships. We need to do more for the paying public than just spill our guts for a few bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a struggle","review":"This review is based on a CD set provided by the Amazon Vine program.Listening to this has been a serious struggle. First off, I've found I just don't like books on tape. I thought it would be good for my commute, but my car CD player jumps back to the beginning of the track when you start it.I like Patricia Briggs. I've enjoyed the Mercy Thomson and the Alpha and Omega series. I find them to be light and fun.As I said above, I struggled with Masques. This is obviously a first work. The writing is choppy, and even with a rewrite, this shows through. I also found the voice of the narrator to be annoying, and unimaginative.All in all, I'd give this a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great re-write of original book","review":"This a new book, although with the same story as the title of the same name published 15 years ago. It is an almost complete re-write, and much longer. See the explanation at the author's website here: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...?","review":"I grudgingly listened to four of the eight CD's in this book set and found not one thing I liked about it. Each time I put in the next CD I thought, well maybe something will start to click for me, but it never did. I was not familiar with this author whatsoever. I see that it looks like I am in the minority of negative reviews for this novel. I just could not understand anything in this book. I can't even tell you what it was about other than some girl who can turn into a mouse and a guy who spends most of his time as a wolf and the narrators annoying, nasal-like voice that sounds overly affected. I am a bit baffled that I really could not make any sense of the story at all, it just sounded like noise in the background and nothing grabbed my attention. Oh well, I certainly did not miss hearing the name E'Magi repeated anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A re-working of a first novel, and it really works; a darn good fantasy story","review":"This edition of Masques includes an introduction by the author, and it's worth listening to. We get the story of the story, then the story itself. The story itself promises to be a good old traditional fantasy story, but the plot goes places I hadn't anticipated, but places where, on reading, it feels right that it should go. The characters are strong, likeable, and human. The magic is consistent with itself; it's an interesting system. There is something especially appealing about the closeness that our heroes have with nature and with the animal world. Old Wolf is about as far from a classic werewolf as I can imagine.I'll be listening to this again, and probably again and again, from time to time. There's something satisfying about a well-crafted fairy tale, and this is one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great narration and story; first-time Briggs reader hooked!","review":"I don't read fantasy books because the few I've opened had a habit of going overboard with made-up and old-timey language. The ones I've started have come across as silly and heavy-handed in their approach.This book didn't have that at all.While I have not read the original version, I can say this book is well-polished and beautifully written with a strong heroine leading much of the story's progression. There's a great blend of suspense, action, and romance, and the story is engaging throughout. The female narrator's beautiful voice makes this book a great listening experience. Can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Patricia Briggs with an update","review":"I never read the story in it's original form, so I can't compare it, but I thoroughly enjoyed the re-release. It really doesn't read like an early novel, and the quality of characterization and world-building is comparable to her current work. I was sad that is part one of a duology, because there's enough good stuff here to set up a series. If you like epic style fantasy, with mercenaries and sorcerers, that's told on a more personal scale, then this is a great book to try. The direct sequel,Wolfsbane (Aralorn)is also quite good. Related books,When Demons Walk (Sianim)andSteal the Dragon (Sianim, No. 2)are also worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick moving fantasy novel","review":"This was the first book I read by Patricia Briggs and after reading her introduction, I was prepared to find the writing flawed. But the book turned out to be quite a page turner with an action packed story where your mind rarely wanders. And it was sweet :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Briggs, but not bad at all.","review":"MASQUES is an update/rewrite of Briggs' first published novel; this version is an unabridged audio CD. Caveat Emptor: I don't generally listen to audio books as they have, in the past, uniformly put me to sleep. This book did not. Katherine Kellgren was never boring to listen to, handled the various voices of a wide variety of characters in a manner that was not confusing to the listener. The story is fairly typical - bad magician taking over his world, good magicians fighting him, a romance that is obvious but not insipid. Fans of Briggs' more recent works will probably enjoy this. Fans of the genre ditto. I listened to it in small chunks of time (usually around 20 minutes or so) with a few longer trips of 45 minutes to an hour. I never lost track of where I was in the story. This has almost converted me to audio books, which was a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for a first book","review":"I began listening to this CD audiobook & had a really hard time turning it off. It was that engaging. Basically finished it in 2 listenings, one in the afernoon & the other the next day. The narrator was very good with her delivery & interpretation of the story. I'll be listening to other audiobooks by this author very soon plus recommending this audiobook to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A highly emotional work with a hidden agenda","review":"Undoubtedly interesting as a recreation of the shtetl life in Poland before 1939, this book turns into a wild anti-Polish fantasy while describing the events in Eishyshok between 1941 and 1945. Over the last decade Yaffa Eliach has produced several markedly different versions of the presumed \\"pogrom\\" in her hometown, none of which bears any significant resemblance to historical truth. The reader will be well advised to consult more balanced and scholarly texts on the subject, for example, Tadeusz Piotrowski's \\"Poland's Holocaust\\" (McFarland & Company, 1998, pp.91-94), or a collective work \\"The story of two shtetls: Bransk and Ejszyszki.

Unfortunately, the events surrounding the 2nd World War are not correctly depicted by her. She would have the reader believe that her family was killed by Polish guerillas because they were Jewish. However, there were other Jews living in the same region which were not harmed at all. It can be demonstrated that her parents had supported the Soviet invaders against the local Poles, and that is the reason why the Polish guerillas eliminated most of her family. The death of children is an unfortunate fact of war: How many Polish children froze to death on their way to Siberia after being deported there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"On the Same Genre as Holocaust-Denial Material","review":"How does a Jewish reader feel when reading that the Holocaust never happened? Well, the same way a Polish reader feels when reading this revisionist work. Unfortunately, the Holocaust deniers do not own a monopoly on falsification of history. This book is likewise departs substantially from historical reality. The reader is not informed that the author's parents were Communists, and that is the reason for their venomous hatred of Poles and Poland. Eliach's parents were killed by the Polish underground because they were Communists, not because they were Jews. I am also amused to hear her treat Soviet Communist sources as truthful representations of the views and policies Polish patriotic organizations..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pictures and information, but for the younger ages.","review":"Large print, full page color pictures, this book is for younger children with a beginning interest in astronomy, particularly the voyagers.

It explains how traditonaly society in the middle east has based itself around family/clan ties then religion and then state last of all.In fact the concept of people belonging to and owning loyalty to a state is quite new to the region in many places as they don't have the long history of it that Europe has. It also explains how long standing traditions within holy law govern such things at the correct treatment of non-muslim minorities (in theory).If you really don't know much about middle eastern and arab culture this book is a good introduction, to a society that is in many ways fundimentaly alien to western culture.It should be noted that this book is ONLY an introduction and in many ways has a lot of generalisations, but it's a good starting point if you don't know much about arab culture (like me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Identity Crises","review":"Identity CrisesBernard Lewis' work \\"The Multiple Identities of the Middle East\\" examines how issues of identity figure in the domestic, regional, and international tensions of the modern Middle East.

It was my introduction to Sacks when I read it originally. I think that what annoyed me most is that Dr. Sacks here seems so self-absorbed and pretentious that it distracted from his story - which is pretty fascinating in the abstract. You know I love Goethe, Nietzsche, Proust et al. too, but it just seems sophomoric and self-indulgent to dredge them up at every opportunity.I've read his other books in the meantime, and this one still is my least favorite. I think that he's at his best in An Anthropologist on Mars, Awakenings or Island of the Colorblind, when he's writing (primarily) about others. If you're looking for a good starting point to read Dr. Sacks wonderful stuff - pass this one up. If you've read the rest and still need more, look elsewhere.

Individual cases are presented clearly and succinctly and understandably for the layman. When he writes about himself, at least in this instance, he loses his way. I read somewhere that for this book Dr Sacks submitted well over 200,000 words to the publisher and a cadre of editors pared away two thirds of the content. What remains is tedious. With an enormously dramatic event (Dr Sacks attacked and mauled by a bull on a remote mountainside) and neurological complications as intriguing as any others he has written about, you would expect a riveting volume.

The story is an inspiring message about the power of books transcending time and space to bring people together. For me, the best part about The Red Book is that it's a book within a book.

The Smashing Pumpkins, among others, also made extensive use of it. I purchased mine back in '94 and was quickly impressed by its versatility. This Russian built beast has three knobs: volume, tone, and distortion and by playing with these, you can create many different sounds. This pedal can range from a simple overdriven sound to a full out crackling, almost uncontrollable roar. My pedal is now fourteen years old and I've never once had an issue with it cutting out. It's solidly built, so much so you could probably brain someone with it and cause some serious damage. Plus, it's fairly affordable as far as effects go. A solid buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean Thompson","review":"I have had the pleasure of meeting Sean Thompson in person and am an impassioned listener to his music.

I was so happy to see that someone had it ! of course it wasnt as good as when I was young but it brought back a time when I had plenty of time to curl up w/ a book and relax, I haven't had any \\"me\\" time in a long time so it was wonderful. The book is still a lil spooky makes you wonder when you get something in the mail should you really be reading this ? :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrongheaded Wrags","review":"The sound is admirably clear, the playing is crisp and articulated. Some of the fast playing is pretty eye-opening. But where'd Buechner get his notions of ragtime style? The slower rags are rubato-ed and luftpausen-ed to death, their line destroyed with herky-jerky. Quarter notes in the right hand are routinely syncopated, though not marked that way in the scores, or turned into triplets--a nice effect applied once or twice. But not always and throughout. And the fast rags? Is this a speed contest? All charm and most melodic effect is lost on the rush to completion. There's not a lot of Joseph Lamb to be had on disc, but this is an irksome misrepresentation of the composer. Sorry, but I have to say it: under Buechner's hands, this is Sacrificial Lamb."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product at a great price","review":"This is exactly what I needed.

This text is used at the 3000 level of university Spanish to teach advanced grammar and vocabulary, so colored pictures are not necessary since it is not for young learners. The book I bought has been used almost daily for 4 months and is not showing any signs of excessive wear, with the binding and all pages still completely intact. The vocabulary drawings and arrows to the objects are very useful and accurate. The paper is non-gloss making reading very easy in a variety of lighting conditions and the print font(with bold font where appropriate)is very clear. The discussion of grammar and vocabularly is logical, useful, and accompanied by numerous examples.

There are very few standout tracks on these 3 discs.....cd 2 is probably the best mix of the 3 but it lacks intensity throughout and falls back on the cheesy la la techno trance radio friendly [stuff] a bit too much for my taste. If you're accustomed to getting hard cutting, breakthrough songs (that's why I buy Gatecrasher anyway) then look elsewhere....they didn't arrive on this bus !! Save your money and pick up the new Saeed and Palash which is coming out later in July 2003 !!

I expected more documentary on the salmon shark. Instead, this video talked about jellyfish, sea otters, humpback whales, bears, glaciers, and eagles, even showing the humpback whales doing the bubble circle. Many of the shark scenes were repeated numerous times. I think I'm being generous saying 10% of this was about salmon shark.

I'm wondering what the other reviewer's of this product, with their rave reviews, see in this product that I don't.This purchase reminded me of two things: 1)If it seems to good to be true, it probably is.

This mattress has not held up well and has already broken down so that it does not offer proper support. IF you want a memory foam mattress, I guess you had better pay more money for a better quality product or purchase a better conventional mattress.

He does deserve to be applauded for not being the rapper or pseudo-balladier that many young black males are today, but his own musical talent is not too exciting. His singing is pretty substandard, the arrangements are repetitive and boring, and his semi-cover of George McCrae's \\"Rock Your Baby\\", entitled \\"A Letter To My Baby\\" should never have been made.Overall, not hate worthy, but many much better albums have been made."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost fabulous","review":"The album is representative Doris Day 1950. BUT if you have heard the actual film version you will be disappointed. Her performance on this album is very perfunctory to say the least.She sings with everything she\`s got in the film version. The trouble is that singers tend to perform under stringent standards for the motion picture and give an indifferent approach to the commercial recording. Examples abound: FRANK SINATRA performed without much expression the song Someone to Watch Over Me in the commercial soundtrack album. He gave a classic rendition in the actual film, emotion and all. BARBRA STREISAND did the same for The Way We Were. Need I say more. Still, this album is very good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"smart people use smart tools","review":"I have been writting in a journal for over 40 years.

There are a number of useful features, such as International Holidays, conversion tables, a year-in-view, time zones, distances between major cities and a ruler. Plus an address book and an envelope for any paper inserts you may accumulate - all held together with a useful black band. They were made popular by a British travel writer back in the 1880s, as he recorded his trials and tribulations.

This quickly proved to be a bad decision. Before January was over, the binding had completely separated from the front cover. My usage of the journal had been very light until this point. The monthly pages in the front of the journal are in a vertical format as opposed to the traditional horizontal boxes. The line spacing is so tiny it renders the monthly format nearly useless.On a more personal note, people kept asking me about the 'bible' I was carrying around the school where I work.

It is masterfully written, with an economy of phrase;second of all, that this book holds up so well to the test of time. Very little in the book seems dated and Blackburn must have had a crystal ball to foresee some of the situations that are presented.Don't judge a book by its cover (if you are looking at the cheesy picture of the bikinied girl on the paperback cover).Spies, mutations, twists and turns, a quiet horror that creeps up on you - I very much recommend this to anyone that enjoys the horror genre, or just anyone that likes a well-written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing era classics","review":"Anita O'Day's voice is rythmic and lilting as it floats above the driving Krupa beat.

In this case, the greatest white female jazz vocalist in history DESERVES better recognition, don't you think? Of course, you can only squeeze so much music on one CD, that's true. But Sony/Columbia has some explaining to do here. They've put out Complete multi-disc box sets of Helen Forrest with Benny Goodman, Dick Haymes with Harry James, along with other \\"Complete\\" series that'll fit on one disc. Some of the best material Anita did is lacking here, including some of my personal favorites. Columbia did a better job when they released a two-record set back in the 70s, (which also included Anita's duets with Buddy Stewart) Hopefully, Sony will correct this situation soon.

The straps bind up behind the knees and pinch your skin between the slot if you wear them with shorts. The top lip isn't high enough to keep your knees in the pad while crawling around.

I did fight though it though and wear them even until one of the gel pads popped and went flat. I felt like calling McGuire Nicholas and telling them a thing or two but I don't have the time during the week. Do these companies ever ask the tradesmen what makes a good knee pad?? Guess not.

I decided to reread these books as a break from graduate studies, and I have found the story to be lacking and the writing to be awful. The characters are highly emotional and the bestial descriptions -- e.g., Raistlin hissed and Tanis snarled -- get old quickly. It is no wonder that these books attract kids, for the characters' emotional levels are as solid as teens suffering through puberty. And if you have not read these books, I highly recommend to you not to listen to those who compare them with Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" Indeed, they are probably just as popular, but there is where the comparison ends. To site a friend of mine: these books are not even a scratch on the house that Tolkien built.

His books are issued in wrong order, or he wrote them set in different times, I am not sure . Anyway, these richly textured, multy-layered novels are feast for the soul. Nothing is simple ahd easily guessed in his books. People wear masks, there are secrets and deceit on every step. Commander Freddie Troy tries to find the truth in this mess. England in 1960's is a turbulent place, everything is changing. There isn't much difference between good and bad guys, or they switch roles on regular basis. Stunning book by this reclusive author. No wonder he avoids limelight if his view of the world is his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense Wrapped In A Character-Study Novel","review":"I read this book not knowing the history of Chief Inspector Troy and his other adventures.

Once the plot starts rocking along, which it does, I think it could come to a faster conclusion.

Here's something else you may want to consider. You can't hear it. If you drive with your windows down and/or play your music at anything above average levels, you won't be able to hear it go off.

With little fanfare they release their second disc, \\"One,\\" which abandons their club/disco roots in favor of mild adult contemporary pop. But in pursuit of musical maturity, Dirty Vegas has lost much of its edge and the promise it had on its superior debut. If the inoffesnive blandness of, say, Savage Garden is your type of groove, then this CD is right up your alley. Steve Smith sings without much in the way of emotion, and much of the songwriting comes off as flat and trite. The sole track bearing anything smacking of inspiration is \\"In This Life,\\" an acoustic-electro mid tempo number that'll probably sound great at your local cafe. But the rest of the CD comes up way short. Hence the title, \\"One\\" gets one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting departure for their sophmore studio album!","review":"After listening to this album twice, I have to say WOW! I really enjoyed Dirty Vegas' debut album, after first hearing Days Go By in the UK and then in that darn car commercial. The first album was very electronic and dance-oriented. The new album has more of a rock feel to it, while retaining that cutting-edge sound that we've grown to love from the Dirty Vegas boys. It's almost as if the boys have grown up a bit having toured arond the world and their sound has matured because of it. I recommend this album to anyone who enjoyed their first and is interested in continuing the journey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Purchase This!","review":"I've purchased this product in January. Since then, I've had some problems with the sound quality. I got this replaced a month after, and I still had the exact same problem, which means that the problem would be evident in every product. I cannot recommend this product to anyone. When it's playing MP3 discs, it would frequently make this weird and loud hissing noise in the middle, which I found extremely frustrating and annoying. Furthermore, this product is fragile unlike other 'skip-proof' products. This product is a battery drainer. A fresh, newly-charged NI-MH battery would only last about 3 hours on this product.

It was mildly entertaining, but less so than the very funny, \\"Have a Nice Day,\\" by Mick Foley. It had virtually no informational value as a book about politics. Basically, Ventura devotes a little space to different phases of his life without getting into too much detail about any of them. He tells few wrestling stories, no war stories, and devotes only a few pages to his campaign for governor. He devotes a bit more space to a somewhat vapid discussion of his positions on issues.

However, Ventura's proclamations remind one of the Ronald Reagan simplistic message -- lower taxes, raise defense spending and balance the budget. The criticism regarding what Governor Ventura chose to reveal about his personal life is laughable. I'm not sure if he was bragging or if he is smart enough to have done a pre-emptive strike. But had he not told us about his background, no doubt someone would have sooner or later. A quick read, and, while not spellbinding, he is Governor."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TRUTH","review":"Jessie is the man.

He is honest and that is what makes him so unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time will tell...","review":"Well, the guy laid out where he came from and what he did (or at least some of it) to get where he is. His story read better than I thought it would and I do admire his candor.At least we know what he thinks about a lot of the big issues (taxes, abortion, guns, big government). And since then, when he sticks his large foot in his large mouth, like with his organized religion quotes in Playboy, he doesn't seem to immediately backpedal.Whether or not he's indeed up to being a governor or anything else through tough times, I give him credit for saying what he thinks, and for not having a Lee Atwater or a Cueball Carville to throw his dirt for him.I think that his greatest tests are still in front of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely terrific","review":"Jesse the Mind Ventura has written an excellent book. He has become my ideal. A hero and model for others to follow. His position that each person must take responsibility for themsleves is magnificant. You may not agree with everything he says, but at least you know where he stands.A person's past does not always define who they are. The real character of a person comes out when they are the most tired and hungry. Throughout Mr. Ventura's life, he has been pushed, shoved, kicked, and starved. But he has proven that the only way to win is to stand up and fight again.A truely inspiriational book that has given me unlimited motivation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Story of True Strength","review":"The title of Jesse Ventura's memoir is taken from his famous line he delivered in the movie Predator. It is a great mantra for a former Navy SEAL, pro-wrestler, and man-of-the-people elected official. Once you get through the first chapter that explains Ventura's views on the issues of the day, the rest is an absorbing, humorous, truthful, and motivating memoir of a true tough guy who can put his money where his mouth is.Jesse tells all in this memoir. When he was a young man, he worked hard, and played hard. Drinking and sex are included here. My eyebrows went up a few times. It is clear he is not covering anything up in order to look squeaky clean.Anyone who reads this book will wish there were a million more Jesses holding political office, instead of the Democrat/Republican factory of career politicians who are addicted to power. I never seriously considered the validity or need for a third political party until I read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minnesota Embarassment","review":"Do you actually think that he wrote this book?

After reading Ventura's bio, however, I wish to God that I could turn back the clock and vote for Norm Coleman instead.

He has been a US Navy SEAL, a professional wrestler, and surprisingly, a Governor of Minnesota.Ventura is a six feet four inches tall and has been an athlete for a long time. He seems to be physically imposing. However his autobiography makes him seem like an intellectual light weight. He became Governor as part of the Reform party. Ross Perot had caused a surge of interest in an alternative to the Democrats and Republicans.Despite having served as a Governor he offers us few political insights. We learn that there are too many laws, and that people need to be responsible for themselves. I don't think we needed Jesse for that. You would think a political outsider might be able to offer some fresh perspective. The only thing I found surprising about the book is that Ventura seems astonished by gotcha journalism. What did he expect?I was hoping for more. In the end there is nothing much to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not so much what the book says, but what it stands for..","review":"The honesty and brevity of this book sometimes come at the cost of oversimplification, but that is the whole point. Many Americans, such as myself, are disgusted with the righteous facade of the those who expect our elected representatives to be perfect moral exemplars, though most Americans aren't. (isn't that contrary to the definition of a representative?). Jesse has the guts to come clean with anybody who will listen. His story may be controversial at times, but the philosophy behind it is so powerfully refreshing, it gives me hope. Maybe someday soon we won't have to watch our country humiliated on the world scene by sensationalized trash. Instead, like Jesse, we may just mind our own business while our leaders get on with their real jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful! I had no idea Stone Cold Steve Austin led such an interesting life. I never miss Steve Austin's wrestling show, and I've always looked up to him.

Can't wait for your next book, Stone Cold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you spell GHOST WRITER?","review":"If anyone thinks that Jesse Ventura actually wrote this book they also probably believe that the Onion is factual. The prose and the ideas are too pretty for a slob like the Governor. I imagine that Jesse communicates, except for his memorized, rehearsed speeches, with a picture touch pad like the really smart chimpanzees use, but with less accuracy. The ideas that \\"Jesse\\" presents in this book have all been heated and re-heated and then re-heated for the american public to try and choke down. I for one am tired of trying to pretend to think that his \\"concepts\\" are novel or even worth my attention. After this book I have to look at the people who live in the northern reaches of this great country and wonder if the frigid winters have severely affected their minds. I think that I am going to have to douse this book with my man juices.

We then work through each page (or set of pages) together on the overhead to solve the mystery. I have to say- it IS pretty tough, but I \\"cheated\\" and looked in the back for the answers, then guide the kids as to where they can find the clues.

All of these clues are revealed at the end, all except one: the name of the swan.I read this book when I was 9 or 10 and didn't quite understand the meaning of the book, so I opened the seal and read all the clues that I had missed (all of them) and fell in love with the book. Everything made sense, I looked back on all of the clues and saw how much of the book I had missed. I even took the time to figure out the name of the swan.I would recommend this book to everyone.

That said, each page contains clues to solving the mystery of the book. Each page also contains a mouse hidden in the illustration. By combining the clues on each page your child (or you) should be able to solve the mystery. However, the mystery is pretty hard to solve. Takes patience and an eagle eye!

For some reason that track is omitted on the remastered CD that I just purchased. It was replaced with a track called THE MEDLEY, which was not on the original vinyl release. Since the track order has also been rearranged it would seem that it should have been released under another title - especially since the Title Track from the album was not included.

I also would suggest a look at another Strassmann book, the The Politics of Informaton Management: Policy Guidelines. It has a set of \\"principles\\" and an \\"Information Constitution\\" that are worth adopting in part or in principle by those overseeing or concerned with informaton management, IS investments, and IT-related projects.

You have to be careful that the louvers don't get sucked up into the fan as the pins break off.I actually replaced all the plastic pins with brass pins, which I thought would make the thing work forever. It did last a couple more seasons, but the louvers continue to rattle and vibrate, and eventually even the brass pins gave up.After messing with it for four or five seasons, I am junking the thing and will replace it with a system of my own design unless I can find something better on the market, which I have not so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Cusco Magic ?","review":"Being a long time fan of Cusco Music, I eagerly anticipated the newest addition to the Cusco Collecion : Inner Journeys. Where is the Cusco Magic??? I was very disappointed. This CD has potential, but just as I began to enjoy \\"Orace of Delphi\\", the addition of the irritating vocals distroyed all of my enjoyment. The same situation happened on track \\" The Nine Nuses\\" If this CD did not try somthing new- high-pitched, screaching vocal sounds, I would have given it a 4 star rating. The other tracks were typical Cusco rhythms, but not magical. Do not bother buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Anticipation, Very Disappointed.","review":"Being a LONG time fan of Cusco, owning 17 Cusco CD's, I have been waiting for this new Cusco CD with high anticipation. Well, I was greatly disappointed. This CD is not up to Cusco's level of music. I thought that if I played it a couple of times it might grow on me, but to no avail. Out of 18 Cusco CD's, I rate on the very bottom of the 18. My recommendation would be to buy any and all the other Cusco CD's.

With most cds, like this, you see why the songs were not put on the cds, the suck. BUT that is not he case with this cd. There are a couple of stinkers on this cd MARINER'S DREAM & GINGER. But rest of the cd holds it's own very well. Songs like HEART OF GOLD, REALITY, I BELIEVE, I CAN'T WAIT A LIFE TIME, are up there with some of Asia's best song. All the songs, for the most part are good, but when looking back they really don't fit in the style of the cds that were released at the time, AQUA, ARIA, & ARENA. Plus some of the songs would have been great in the cds, but were not done in time to be included. This is a great collection of songs, that otherwise would have ended up lost. My only real complaint is that the cd cover is so dark you can barely see what is on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Album !","review":"I don't want to pass judgement on this album, but it is not late 80s / early 90s material.

The feature I like the best is that they update it every year. It is very handy and their ratings are always correct and meet my standards. Everything is current and that includes the restaurants prices which sways me one way or another.I noticed that one reviewer said he preferred the blue Ultimate books but they didn't suit me at all. I found them burdened and weighted with the authors opinions and difficult to read in parts. As a seasoned traveler I like knowing the solid facts and letting the unexpected surprise me. Traveling wouldn't be as much fun if there wasn't some mystery or charming local to fill in the blanks.I've used Frommers Hawaii successfully to snorkel and body surf. It provides just enough detail.

The DVD is very dry and mentioned that there was a high rate of thyroid cancer among the people in the area, but the casualties were low so it didn't seem to matter how many people were sick.

The product description and picture clearly state and show a rubber ducky. While my fiance was very pleased with the gesture and likes the bubble bath I was extremely disappointed that there was no rubber ducky.

It provides a concise history of metallic threads and explains the variety which exist. Colorful photographs, tables, and illustrations are plentiful and helpful. \\"Metallic Threads,\\" provides not only a history of this medium, but practical advice for present day use, and it goes one step further and offers a wide range of projects using metallic fibers to put your newly acquired knowlege to use. In short, it is a vital reference text for those involved in the needlework industry as a professional or hobbyist, but it is equally an inspirational text which provides fun and practical ways to get acquainted, \\"up close and personal,\\" with this medium. A job well done by Ms. Kreinik et al! I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same book others reviewed???!!!","review":"I found this to be a total waste of money. There actually is very little information presented about working with these threads, and what is presented is out-of-date and obviously biased towards Kreinik threads, which I guess is to be expected. What isn't mentioned is that 90% of the projects presented are hand cross-stitched and rather tacky, if you ask me. The rest are needlepoint and equally tacky.

However, for the rest of us it has little to offer. The book is narrowly focused on procedures one must follow before, during and after the grant writing process, but it fails to discuss writing strategies to enhance persuasiveness or improve the presentation of complicated technical subjects. I found it useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Model of Its Kind","review":"I live in London, am an interested observer of the relationship between local government and the private sector but not someone who would ever actually have to write a grant proposal.

Herein we learn not only canny methodology, but correct protocols and language to keep our proposals off the junk heap.Most remarkably, the material is presented in a jaunty style which belies the notion that grant-writing (or -reading) has to be an onerous or dryasdust task. \\"Realty checks\\" may spare you the agony of wondering whether your proposal dropped into a black hole. You can't write a successful grant proposal without inhabiting the mind of a grantmaker, and even failed proposals can fuel you for the next, successful foray.I wouldn't dream of attempting another grant without this book at my side.

While most books of this genre offer quick and deceptively easy pathways into the light, Bishop courageously asks the much harder question of how to deal with darkness - what to do with our internal resistance, the self-sabotaging mechanisms that derail us, and the wounded inner child, frozen by fear, that keeps us from moving forward despite our best intentions. The book is filled with insight, as well as practical suggestions tested in over 20 years of work with private clientele. But it is not for those simply looking for a comfortable new age read, for it ultimately demands putting the book down and actually doing the work. If you are serious about moving forward with your life, however, this book will become a treasured dog-eared ally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shamanism meets psychology","review":"Ross Bishop melds shamanic practice with deep psychological insight in this book, more successfully than others I've read. Interestingly I'd just finished Firestone's The Fantasy Bond, which is psych theory, and Bishop was saying much the same things, and better (for laymen). The journey excercises are well described and they do work! While much shamanic work involves dealing with our issues purely symbolically - or in detail via recapping or such - Ross' method merges the symbolic with memory recapping, something I've found effective. A great bonus is the list of books he likes, like an expanded Amazon listmania list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving lives...","review":"Shaman Ross Bishop has the unique ability of combining passion, with knowledge, with experience, in helping his fellow humans transcend to the place we were meant to be.

It's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to know. Explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and synthesis problems, in particular). If you're looking to become a chemist, this is not the book to learn from. I'd recommend Vollhardt and Schore's textbook, or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully (i.e., on exams or out in the industry)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Text","review":"\\"...I write to explain chemistry to students the way I wish it had been explained to me years ago.\\"McMurry has that line in the introduction to the text, and when I read that in the 3rd edition some years ago, it was one of the things that kept me from tucking tail and changing my major.He remains true to those words. This text is clear and unambiguous in its presentation. Rather than inundating the reader with details and overly rigorous academic explanations, as some texts do, McMurry presents organic chemistry in a straightforward, streamlined manner. The text progresses from basic physical organic chemistry and molecular orbital theory through functional groups and their reactivity, finally culminating in appropriate, but not exhaustive, chapters on biomolecules.After having learned organic chemistry from McMurry, I personally found tackling more advanced graduate texts (e.g. Carey and Sundberg) a more tractable endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"why the new edition???","review":"This is an excellent text! I have one criticism though. Why must a new edition come out every year/every other year? Its rediculous! The books are practically the same but the bookstore will never buy the old version back.

Thats pretty darn expensive!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't help me!","review":"This text is an easy read, and you will understand the reactions that are given in the text examples. So why the low rating? Organic chemistry is all about \\"prediction\\". And when it comes to teaching you how to predict the outcomes of reactions you've never seen before, it is lacking! You can study this text two hours a day, every day, and unless you have an uncanny ability to understand chemistry (I don't)--you will still not have this most fundamental skill you need to succeed. Try \\"Organic Chemistry as a Second Language\\" and \\"Organic Chemistry II as a Second Language\\". They will have you predicting and understanding Orgo in no time!!

Just be sure to use silicone utensils, as any teflon-coated pan can scratch. The color is a soft pink, not at all garish.

I should have done more checking and saved my money.This books consists of 10 stories set in the old West and more modern times. The stories don't run chronologically which I found somewhat jarring. The problem is the switch from a story about an Indian attack on a wagon train to one on neo-nazi punks planning a Columbine-style bloodbath to one on an old West poker game with a mysterious stranger sitting in, etc.The book's main failing however is the stories themselves. Overall they are pretty bland and uninvolving. The characters are superficial, the action plodding and several stories just kind of trail off without a satisfactory denouement.

She has always been a powerful advocate for babies to be born naturally into families who can express their own power inspite of the medical establishment.Every individual considering pregnancy should study her insights, and return to the book again and again, because a conscious conception is the cornerstone of primal health."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is the one!","review":"If you were going to buy just one book.... *to curl up and read on a lazy afternoon time and time again, *to fill you in and up on all things relevant to fertility, sexuality and life, *to speak to you of things beyond your wildest thoughts and imaginings, *to refer to when you cant find info anywhere else ....and sewn together most beautifully...then let this be the one, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow... big book. far fetched?","review":"Not an easy read... pretty \\"flighty\\" swoops around from subject to subject, really difficult to follow. Wouldn't particularily reccomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and thorough","review":"This book is really thorough and encompassing. From the rich illustrations to the complete and helpful text, Conscious Conception is a workbook that can be used to guide the couple in their journey through fertility. Jeannine writes eloquently and speaks to the heart of a woman. Abortion and chemical birth control is not the answer to fertility regulation; our bodies are not like a machine that can be turned on and off at society's convienence. This book helps women understand how they and their child are part of the universe. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work by relative unknowns","review":"I am a big fan of aggro rock, especially with synth and sampling, e.g., Linkin Park is one of my favorites. I had never heard of From Zero until last week while on a business trip in Chicago, heard radio station 94.7 giving this local band lots of airplay (track \\"Sorry\\", which at first I thought was Eminem pretending to be Linkin Park). Went and bought the album immediately and played the entire thing in the CD player of my rental car, enjoy it immensely. For a relatively unknown band, they have a lot of variety and layering. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"My so called life departs from One Nation Under.","review":"Where did the strong melodies that were so apparent on some of the songs in the first album go? Someone find them again and put them back. It's not funny anymore.What happened to this band? Please come back. PLEASE! Dont try linkin park, eminem or limp bizkit anymore... please. Let that originality shine through that was so apparent in the first album come back again on album 3. No more \\"everyone elses music\\" okay? These guys have so much potential and they had an original formula in the first album and it beats me why they would depart from it to sound unoriginal. From Zero bring back the real you on your next album. Thanks so much for One Nation Under. I hope \\"My So Called Life\\" is just a growing experience and not the end all be all. Remember... the basic winning formula is ... strong melodies, harmonies and hard no holds bar rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Zero has done it again","review":"I have been following From Zero since their major debut album One Nation Under. After 2 years of wating, they release My So-Called Life and it is an awesome ablum. A bit different than the first but still good. A powerful voice and lyrics along with great music. It proves again that these guys dare to do something different and get away with it. Anyone who likes new rock needs to go get this ablum. This band is what the new rock scene needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"My So called piece of sh*t","review":"wow. i cannot believe i even gave this BS cd a chance. i want my 35 minutes back please. after hearing the song \\"the other side\\", which is a great tune by the way, i read a couple reviews and went to the cd store and bought \\"my so called life\\" because they didn't have \\"one nation under\\". apparently the first disc is much better. anyways, long story short, this cd sums of the worst of the \\"nu metal\\" genre, and incorporates the likes of: limp bizkit (rappy garbage), linkin park (a lil metal), hoobastank (stereotypical nu metal). these bands are a DIME A DOZEN, please, listen, DIME A DOZEN. this band offers nothing new to the nu metal scene. please, save your money. this is the reason programs like kazza thrive, you couldnt pay ME to listen to these unoriginal bast*rds."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overlooked gem.","review":"Gordon is probably most famous for \\"Someday,someway\\" and for Red Hot, the former of which is on this record, but the real show here is the last four tracks.It may seem silly to give a record 5 stars when really only 5 or six of the cuts are true classics. But the last four cuts alone make this a great, great record. They're irrestible dance cuts, great rockabilly. Your biggest problem if you play this at a party is that you'll find it very hard to follow it up...everyone will be too beat to keep going after dancing through those four amazing songs.If Gordon had been able to match those songs again (he never did in my opinion) he'd have been up there with the greatest acts in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shrek fan!","review":"This game is awsome and funny.I think you should buy this game.Shrek has a fart attack and it is really funny!If you're a Shrek fan like me,this is the game for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome!!","review":"I've just recently been turned onto rock music and what better way to start then with YC?! Going from listening to rap and hip hop 24/7 to listening to something that actually has a meaning is a real change, but an amazing one. You will not find one bad song on this CD. And if you think this album is good you haven't heard anything until you've seen them live. I saw them about 8 hours ago at Warped Tour in Buffalo, they are AMAZING live. Not only is the music great but the views the band has on political issues are basically identical to mine. Bring our troops home and oust Dubya! Buy the CD, go to the website www.yellowcardrock.com and read up. peace! Tlowe52"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ocean Avenue, Spectrum of Taste","review":"Wow. That's all you can really say about this album. With the diversity of the mesh of pop, punk, and emo-style music speaks to all teens. The singles really shine on this album. \\"Ocean Avenue\\", \\"Way Away\\", and \\"Only One\\" are definitely my favorites. \\"Way Away\\" is a little more rock, \\"Ocean Avenue\\" a little more pop, and \\"Only One\\" is a sentimental story portrayed perfectly by singer Ryan Key. I reccomend this album to anyone looking for something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"Okay so i think this is an awesome album and i would recomend that if you don't have it already that you get it as soon as possible. I think that for there first album they did a great job. They have somewhat of a different sound which in my opinion is original and really suiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellowcard is awesome","review":"Yellowcard is awesome, and this song shows it. I love how they have a violin player, it really gives all of their songs a whole lot more flavor. This song is really good, especially \\"We were both 18 and it felt so right, sleepin all day stayin up all night\\" That is so true. I don't think there's anything bad you can say about Yellowcard."},{"rating":"2","title":"*yellowcard RULES*","review":"First of all I would like to say that YC is an awesome band who gives great live shows!

Because YC rocks, and they put their heart in to everything they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"yEllOwCaRd RoCkS!!!!!!!!","review":"BUY OCEAN AVENUE TODAY! Yellowcard is the best band ever.

They have so many good songs on it. I bought this CD for all my friends! You should really buy this CD. It's one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Yellowcard is one of the most musically diverse bands out there. The Violinist, Sean Mackin does a wonderful job of fitting this classical instrument in with the 'rock' sound. Ryan Key has developed some of the best lyrics out there, with a tribute to the firefighters and police in 9/11 found in \\"Believe\\" and a tribute to a close friend that was lost in \\"View from heaven\\". This is one of the must get cds of the year. Don't be left out in the cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing sounds from a wonderful band","review":"This CD offers a wonderful sound different from all the other bands out there.

Yellowcard has a violinist(Sean Mackin) Which makes them different from other punk bands in short buy this cd!!! I also recommend One For The Kids and The Underdog EP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yc yo","review":"I would have to say, this album has impressed me tremendously. Yellowcard has really advanced in their song writing, their ability to create a great sound, and over all conquer the challenge of having a violin incorporated in the rock sound. If you are interested in hearing something that has catchy tunes, a \\"classic\\" touch, and meaningful lyrics, this is the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"the same ol brand new!","review":"Wow!That could sum up this CD, or I just like to say wow!That would be your call.Ocean Avenue has a consistancy to it's songwriting, which is great! It is amazing how one could argue, and say what's the differance between simple plan, good charlotte, and yellow card.Good question, all bands have good songwriting, and have great pop melodies with some raw punk feel (some).Yellowcard brings the violen to the table. I am biassed since my ex plays the electric violen in a rock band. I think it makes a differance, a good differance.I am a songwriter and recorded a CD a few years back. Crappy budget and self produced, but what makes it hold it's own is the song writing.Yellowcard's Ocean Avenue does that, with great producing, and a bigger budget!I rank this CD up there with Kill Hannah's never and ever nad Good Challote's Young and the Hopeless, maybe better...maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"\\"Ocean Avenue\\" by Yellowcard greatly surpasses their previous efforts, and has largely assisted in getting their name associated with exceptional pop-punk music.The use of violin just adds to every song, giving Yellowcard a more refreshing and new sound. The hooks are there, the guitar riffs are there, and this CD can be listened to over and over.Some standout tracks: \\"Only One\\", \\"Life Of A Salesman\\", \\"View From Heaven\\" and \\"Believe\\".Great band, great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"can you say terrifico","review":"This CD is amazing!

Every song is good, there isn't a single weak track on the CD. The songs are catchy and well written. It hasn't come out of my CD player since it came out. The more I listen to it, the more I love it. Buy this CD now, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellowcard Rocks","review":"The new Yellowcard c.d. \\"Ocean Avenue\\" rocks. The wait was worth it. The songs are really thought out and picked well. This album has much harder songs than usual, but it still has Ryan's great voice doing some good slow ones too. I love every song on the c.d., but my favorites are \\"Only One\\" and \\"Miles Apart\\". I reccomend buying this c.d. and you won't even need any other c.d.'s."},{"rating":"1","title":"wannabe emo","review":"this is one of the worst bands ever. its pretty sad that some people think that these guys r punk. if u think this is punk u are a poser. emos pretty crappy. all emo is is just wannabe metle or punk. and these guys r just wannabe emo. if u wanna listen to some good pop punk(good charolett is not punk, neither is simple plan, NFG, or greenday, or blink 182)listen to the mr T expereanc. or dillinger four, or the decenants. and if u wanna listen to some pure punk listen to beerzone. i hope this review was helpful. this didnt even desurve one star. ps. blink 182 used to be punk back in the early 90's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not punk.","review":"This band is certainly not punk.They are, in fact, a wannabe emo band. I never thought i'd see the day when there would be a poser emo band. yeah, there are those stupid poser punk bands, [i.e. good charlotte, blink 182] but now this?In short, this band [and the music they play] sucks. majorly. If you are looking for poser punk, check out green day or blink 182. If you are looking for real punk, check out nofx, the offspring, or social distortion. However, if this is in fact what you are thinking about wasting your money on, then consider a lobotomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I KNOW WHY PPL LIKE THESE LOSERS, as a girl i know 50% is how \\"cute\\" the band is.

I'm sorry, I just don't get it. It's not like the band sucks, they're good musicians if you're into that poppy sound, but the violin just confuses me. There's a time and place for violin in rock music, with an ensemble arrangement for example, but not solo. IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Generic, Overall Blow-chunky","review":"This band is nothing but a joke. Another band made just to capitalize on a trend. I would not be suprised if this band was made by a talent search becuase everything they do is so generic. Since i dont know better, i would go to say that they didn;t even write their own songs, but rather they are giving to them like a pop star. this band is nothing but a musical circus, with everything from a fiddle played who does back flips, to two rythem guitars and no lead. Learn to play your instraments before you play a show. DO NOT BUY THIS, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh boy","review":"Oh boy does this cd suck.

You wouldnt be reading this if it werent for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yellowcard sux!","review":"Their music is so stupid, repetetive and sappy I'm surprised they aren't considered cristian rock. I think they fit right in with backstreet boys and good charlotte (who also suck horribly, perhaps worse than yellowcard)! Do not buy this cd. It isn't punk, and it sure as HELL isn't emo, by any means. Do not support these loser wannabees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Review...","review":"blah...thats all that i can say to describe \\"Yellowcard's\\" second release. some of the songs are okay, but some really suck too. plus, their albums called \\"ocean avenue\\", a popular hang out in santa monica, california.

Its really good.Though im not much of a fan for emo, this cd was suprisingly really good. Ive lsitened to it so many times i talk the words in my sleep. I would recomend this to anyone who likes pop-punk, this would make a great addition to your cd cllection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Awesome","review":"Just when you thought it couldnt get any better Yellowcard comes out with Ocean Avenue. This CD is full of songs with great rhythm and some emotional lyrics. My favorites are: Empty Apartment, the lyrics are just great, Breathing, very catchy beat, and Believe, which is a tribute the 9/11 with very touching lyrics. If you have never heard Yellowcard then i suggest you buy this CD you wont be disappointed. Each and every song is great. Good Job Guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ocean Avenue breaks the mold of alternative music","review":"Yellowcard, a band who entertwines violin into an alternative sound, creates a style of music unique to all. Ocean Avenue is a great CD with 13 incredible songs that will inspire and sooth you at the same time. Personally, I have over 150 CDs from various bands and Yellowcard is by far one of the most talented bands I've heard. It's unfortunate that they have yet to make it big. So definitely buy this CD and get your own taste of Yellowcard's unique sound, and be a part of Yellowcard's rise to fame!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"simply amazing","review":"Since I've gotten this cd I seriously don't go anywhere without it, free time at home, work, in the car. I've listened to it many times a day and it still has the same effect on me each time. This cd was well worth the wait and is amazing, every track has a something different and everything is relatable and heartfelt. The first listen kept making me wonder what was coming next..if you get one cd this year, make it this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a good cd, but it's not my cup of tea","review":"My friend burned this cd for me. It's a good cd, very fast paced, it's great stuff. It just isn't really my cup of tea. It's not the style of music I listen to. This cd is for people who are into punk rock music and stuff like that, not headbangers like myself. However, I did find the cd to be enjoyable. I recommend it for anyone who's into punk rock music or interested in rock music unlike what they usually listen to, cuz it's good for both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ocean Avenue - Yellowcard","review":"Ocean Avenue delightfully combinds brilliant lyrical content and mature musical talent with an edge. The edge being of course the violin playing behind some truely traditional punk tunes. It's this edge that defines them from any old punk band.'Way Away'shows a louder side of Yellowcard whilst 'Life of A Salesman' and 'Only One' display a more sensitive side to these 4 talented Americans.Good for listening to whilst chilling but also a great sing-a-long to let pent-up emotions out. Recommended to all alternative enthusiasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Let the Single Fool You","review":"When I first heard the song \\"Ocean Avenue\\" I was blown away by it and borrowed it from my friend to burn it. However, when I actually listend to the whole album, it was not at all what it seems to be by just listening to that one single. The lyrics die down and so does the music. It starts out with 2 really good songs just to keep you listening I guess, and then it just gets bad. I didn't even want to listen to the whole CD it was that bad. I would not at all recomend buying this album, if you liked \\"Ocean Avenue\\" just burn that song and forget the rest of it. The only good thing about yellowcard is their unioqness, because they don't sound like anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best bands around","review":"I went out and bought their CD about a year ago now. It was one of the best decisions I could have made. The CD was amazing and its hard to say one of their songs is better than the others. Yellowcard has a certain unique sound that makes them that much better. Sean Mackin, violin player, adds a whole new twist to the pop punk world. He plays extrodinary solo's on his violin that you would think could never be done. Ben Harper, guitar, dishes out amazing guitar lines along with Ryan Key who also does vocals. I would have to say if you dont already own this CD, buy it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"ocean avenue is amazing","review":"Ive been a fan of Yellowcard's for a very long time, and i enjoy every album they have made, but Im in love with their newest one.. Ocean Avenue. The songs on this cd are all so powerful and seriously, everytime I listen to this cd.. I get gosebumps. They put so much emotion and energy into every song and you feel as is if there performing right next to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD. Check it out, or you're missing out","review":"I listened to the whole cd today, and I must say, this is by far their best. Excellent job. Yellowcard is a band everyone should know about and appreciate. They're much better than other punkish bands such as Good Charlotte. This album is certainly worth listening to, you won't be let down.My favorite songs include Empty Apartment, and Only One, but I like the whole cd. It's certainly a CD you can listen to the whole way through; no fillers here. If you liked One For the Kids, you'll love Ocean Avenue.Also, check out their cover of Michelle Branch's \\"Everywhere\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I first wanted this CD because I liked the popular songs...but once my boyfriend got me the CD for Christmas I quickly realized that my favorite songs were the ones I had never heard!

I can't wait for their next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!","review":"I love \\"Ocean Avenue\\"! It's one of my favorite CDs. My top 5 songs are (not in order):1. Only One2.

I fist heard \\"powder\\" and thats one of the most powerful and emotional songs i have ever heard. This new cd is much better than there older ones, not to say the old ones were bad. The song \\"back home\\" is a beautiful poem about a rude awakening. In \\"rock star land\\" yellowcard sang about wanting to move to california, and in \\"back home\\" they outlined how their dreams werent what they expected.Anyone who says this band is a joke with pre-written lyrics and a laughable \\"fiddle\\" player, has not truely listend to their songs and felt their pain and happiness, and untill they do that they will never understand how great this band is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!","review":"Yellowcard is a wonderful band and their debut, One For the Kids was amazing. But with Ocean Avenue, they showed they have matured and personally I believe this is a better album than One for the Kids. The awesome combination of guitars, drums and the violin makes for a perfect song. The violin is what makes this band unique and good. Listen carefully for the violin and then you will be transported to the lyrics of the song. Yellowcard rocks and this album rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is pop/punk at its best!","review":"Catchy hooks, gret riffs. This CD is everything a great pop/punk album needs. I bought the CD last summer at the Vans Warped Tour, only a week or so after it was released. It quickly became my CD of the summer. I listened to it everyday in the car, cruising around town. I jsut never seemed to get tired of it. I still listen to the CD quite often, a year later! Thats gotta say something right there, since i genereally get tired of new cds after a week or 2. This is a must have for any fan of the genre, and if your not, buy iy anyway because its simply a fun album to listen to...DO IT YOU DIRT BAG!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellowcard Rocks Socks","review":"This cd is great!

I was listening to 88.7, my local college radio station, and I heard Ocean Avenue, the first single from Yellowcards latest CD, come on. I really liked it, so I went out and bought this CD. The sound is kind of hard to describe: it's like a rock or punk band, but it's fused with a violin. It just ends up being a very \\"nice\\" sound. So, I recommend this CD because it sounds great and because the lyrics an be applied so universally. Is that a word? Oh well, you know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Ocean Aveune is where you should be!","review":"This is an awsome CD!!! there's not one song on this CD(in my opinion) that you wouldnt want to listen too!!

Personally I like to listen to a wide range of styles of music, and I have heard a lot of variation, but I have yet to find a band like Yellowcard. Their unique punk style with a twist of electric violin is unlike any other band's out there. The range in speed and style, the up-beat digital effects, and the catchy lyrics all serve to make this CD their best so far (and their other releases, \\"One For The Kids\\" and \\"The Underdog EP\\", are still amazing).I would recommend this CD to anyone, no matter what style of music they normally listen to. The music is catchy and anyone can enjoy it. Also, if you ever have the chance to see Yellowcard live, GO! They pull off an amazing live show. I go to concerts all the time, and seeing Yellowcard live was easily one of my favorites.~PickleParty"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of the year!","review":"Ocean Ave is the most amazing CD Ive heard in a long time... Every song is a hit. You can relate almost every song on the album to something that has happend in your life. This CD is not your everyday pop-punk CD, always talking about GIRL, GIRLS, and breaking up with GIRLS. \\"Way Away\\" is about moving away, and \\"Empty Apartment\\" is about losing a good friend, and \\"Belive\\" is dedicated to September 11th. And there are so many more great songs. I can put this CD in my player and no-stop listen to it for hours! I recomend that you all get this CD, you wont be let down...

I have been attatched since. Its a great album that I recommend you buy. If you havent heard of Yellowcard, have you been living under a rock for the past few years.With their song Only One and their new hit Lights and Sounds blasting off of music stations such as MTV and Fuse, how could you not have heard of them? Also, they are famous for having something not many other bands have--a violinist, Sean Mackin whom I look up to myself, being a fellow violinist. Yellowcard is a band with a very unique sound.The CD consists of 13 songs1.Way Away2.Breathing3.Ocean Avenue4.Empty Apartment5.Life of A Salesman6.Only One7.Miles Apart8.Twenty Three9.View From Heaven10.Inside Out11.Believe12.One Year, Six Months13.Back HomeThere is much emotion in the album that is very clear. I hope this review was helpful to you.EskimoTheRockstar@yahoo.com, feel free to email me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dum,Dum,DUM.......Oh, I'm reviewing??","review":"Ok, I love the songs empty apartment and one year, six months off this cd and they are the only songs on here that will truly effect anyone to think whatsoever...the rest of this cd doesn't have meaningful lyrics. This cd is somewhat annoying and kinda makes you want to scream at some point becasue the songs get old and start to sound the same. C'mon people, don't listen to what MTV tells you listen to and find your own sound. I have listened to YC for a few years now and am sad to see them on MTV, that sucks. This cd is disappointing if you want a new sound or different lyrics in each song. Buy the Underdog EP, the song Finish Line I really love and recommend to everyone, great lyrics and great sound. Well, sorry YC, hope your next cd is a tad better. DON'T SUPPORT MTV!!! Support FUSE!!! enjoi."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"ocean avenue is an awesome album that is definatly worth buying! The lyrics are great, the songs are original and really energetic and Sean Mackin adds an awesome touch with his teriffic violin melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellowcard's \\"Ocean Avenue\\" Rox!","review":"Yellowcards \\"ocean avenue\\" is a big hit. The CD OCEAN AVENUE is the best CD i have ever heard. The melodies are great and the energy is awesome. If you haven't got the CD and love punk/emo rock music, you should definately go get it. The vocals are genuine and honest. The Band is definately unique, since they feature a violin player, Sean Mackin. The song's Inside Out and Miles Apart pump you up with energy to the fullest. Songs like Empty Apartment and Only One reach into the listeners, and allow them to be connected with the band members emotionally. The CD is awesome and now Yellowcard is my all time favorite band. The CD is definately worth buying and all the songs, not just the first half, are good from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW","review":"Yellowcard is such an awesome band. This Cd, Ocean Avenue is one of the best CDs that i own. There music is kind of different then a lot of the music that is out today. I love the violin in the band it makes for a really awesome sound. I also love how their songs are about stuff that went on in their lives. The songs are not just songs their meaningful. Also the enhancement on the CD is pretty fun. I watched over and over again cause i was laughing so hard...Definatly a CD to buy if you already dont!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Score one for Yellowcard","review":"My friend recommended Yellowcard to me this week and let me borrow the CD, only with the words \\"Yeah, they're like, punk and stuff and it's pretty cool.\\" Wow. Quite a review on his part, really. Then he added, \\"Oh yeah, and they have a violin.\\" What? A violin? My anticipation went up and I popped in the CD, and it hasn't left my CD player since then. All the way from the start of this record, Yellowcard demonsrates what they're apparently great at: writing catchy, melodic and suprisingly meaningful pop-punk songs. The violin adds a whole dimension of sound to their music. There is some novelty here, and it sometimes feels like one of those \\"high-school\\" style records. But so what? Sometimes that makes for a really entertaning album, as is the case with \\"Ocean Avenue\\", making it a solid record with some catchy songwriting and cool hooks. Anyone looking for something a little different in the boring old pop-punk genre should definitely check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisp, impeccably performed pop-rock.","review":"These guys can play. They're obviously a young band, but they play not only with enthusiasm and verve, but with confidence.It shows when they slow down the album for a song or two, and then ratchet it back up for a breakneck rocker.\\"Ocean Ave\\" is an irresistible summer single; \\"Only One\\" a nice follow-up. There are several other potential singles on the disc, and fairly minimal filler.Yes, the violin adds another texture to their sound, but it never sounds forced. It enables them to weave a country-ish thread to some of their urgent uptempo tunes. Again, I think it shows confidence in their sound.\\"Life Of A Salesman\\" is a brisk tune; it wouldn't sound out of place on a Blink-182 album (a more recent Bilnk, I should specify...).Another nice thing to say about the record is that this is my first encounter with Yellowcard, and hearing the album makes me want to investigate the rest of their catalog...a high compliment in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellowcard strikes again.","review":"Once a copy of Yellowcard's sophomore full length CD, \\"Ocean Avenue,\\" is picked up, it is guaranteed that the listener will not put it back down. From the borderline Country beat of \\"View from Heaven\\" to the incredibly fast paced \\"Life of A Salesman,\\" the lyrically diverse album touches upon contemporary issues that every youth feels, but cannot express as well as Yellowcard. The sincerity of Ryan Key's mellifluous crooning in the soulful ballads, \\"Empty Apartment,\\" \\"Only One,\\" and \\"One Year, Six Months,\\" is beautifully meshed with the playful songs, \\"Ocean Avenue\\" and \\"Believe.\\" Talent reeks out of the album, and it is a definite plus hearing more of Sean Mackin and his unbelievably suave strokes of the violin. The CD will ravage a bystander's senses and addict them with its uniqueness. Although popularity is an ill word for fans that have stood by Yellowcard's side from the very beginning, this album will definitely take them to the next level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome once again!!","review":"Well, I own two other Yellowcard CDs and this one did not disappoint!! My favorite song was \\"View From Heaven\\", #9. It was awesome because i sounds a little different. I love the whole CD and everyone should buy it!! It will not disappoint!!! Also \\"Twentythree\\" or song #8 is also very cool.Yellowcard has done it again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anytime, anywhere","review":"Yellowcard is easily one of the greatest and most innovative bands I have heard lately. Their sound is so original and refreshing. I am a long time Yellowcard listener and have all the cds they have ever put out and Ocean Avenue is by far my favorite. If you haven't heard them, get out there and listen! I highly, HIGHLY recommend this cd, and their others, for anyone who likes a new sound. Yellowcard is one of those bands you can listen to anytime, anywhere. And the more you listen to them, the better they get. If you ever get a chance, don't miss them in concert either. Buy this cd!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DOWN HILL","review":"WHAT HAPPENED???? i tell u what happened. instead of yellowcard writing songs from the heart like on one for the kid, they just wanted to become famous and wrote this album that is nothing like their others. This the album that every band hits that make them do DOWN HILL.Lets see the bands that have already succeded this-blink 182(duderanch was sweet)-rufio-new found glory-good charolotte. I DO NOT recommend this album to former \\"One for the Kids\\" lovers. However i do recommened it to the little bad*** girls that want to where their little bad*** yellowcard shirts to school and have never heard one for the kids and have never touch and intrument in their life.Thats right i play the drums and im said to say \\"WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINALITY\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"yellowcard suks","review":"yellowcard suks and i think they are ine of the worst bands except maybe good charlotte"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles Apart is one of the worst songs in creation","review":"Yellowcard sucks. They really do. The lyrics are really cheesy, and you can tell that they are really petty efforts to be \\"punk-rock\\" that are written by people that simply aren't. The real genre of punk-rock has lyrics that make people think, thought-provoking lyrics that aren't so simple-minded as that of Yellowcard. \\"We'll be miles apart - and you're always in my heart\\"?!?! Does anyone notice how unoriginal and fake these lyrics are? Coheed and Cambria, Bright Eyes and Taking Back Sunday are much better artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice try, but no go","review":"Its not that Yellowcard aren't talented.They are talented musicians.I've seen them live, and I've been listening to this record at work constantly, its just that there's nothing new here.I know I know, all the kids are going \\"but there's a violin!! and they actually harmonize!\\". Yes yes kids, this is true, but take that away and they sound like every other pop-punk band out there.On another note, their sound isn't \\"new\\" or \\"unique\\". Anna Waronker did it years ago, and much better at that.Check out any of That Dog's albums and you'll find an album with catchy hooks, great riffs, and beautiful 3-way harmonies.As for \\"Ocean Avenue\\", this one is for the dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no... is this what punk is becoming","review":"There is only one thing I can ask of anyone who would dream of buying this CD, please at the very least try a real punk band like The ramones, Rancid, The dead kennedy's, or The clash. If you try any of those bands and still like this garbage than my words will do you no good. You might realize that punk actually has a meaning not just whiny men with high pitched voices whining about stupid stuff. All in all this is not punk if you had heard otherwise you were informed incorrectly buy another CD immedeatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN AWAY","review":"This CD and releases like it will kill any shot of a \\"Emo\\"/\\"Screamo\\" world.

They are sellouts, they think they are so good now that there one song is on the radio. Big deal. They are going to be one hit wonders.

Actually, it wasn't.","review":"Let's just say I won't be cruising down Ocean Avenue again any time soon. I was highly unimpressed with many factors on this album, one being the usage of the phrase \\"Californ-I-A\\", which sounds alright when rapped but sounds atrocious in a soft-natured rock song. Many tracks on Ocean Avenue are backed with violin, some being ballads and some being plain old electric guitar-accompanied rock tunes. The most outstanding of the featured songs in my sight is the title track \\"Ocean Avenue\\", which has the previously mentioned violin factor, hard guitars, and an enjoyable cruising pattern to begin with. Aside from this track and a few select others, most melodies were uninteresting and either too similar to Simple Plan or too similar to crap. I would not recommend this C.D., but would suggest checking out Simple Plan for this style of music.I recommend:Walk AwayBreathingOcean Avenue"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and typical","review":"my friend owns this album and I have to say this is terrible, so what if there is a violinist in the band it doesnt change the bands sound dramatically to the point where they are original they sound like every other crappy, whiny pop punk band and there lyrical matter is the same too, its all about how their girlfriends broke up with them and stupid stuff like that and everything about relationships come on there are more things to write about, basically this album is annoying and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"we want real punk","review":"yellowcard is just 1 crappy band who tries to be like nofx and the ramones and just end up singing about their gfs and crap but if u wanna listen 2 real music listen 2 bands thta dont cry about their gfs"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing like... the same old","review":"Yellowcard, though signed to Capitol, one of my all time favorite labels, still refuses to produce anything new, invigoraing, unique, or fun to listen to. The band steals music from every single emo band that ever existed and throws it together with a violin player marketing itself as artsy or unique.whatever.For any emo fan this will sound exactly like everything else in your collection but so if that sells you, go for it. You can hardly hear the violin on some tracks and overall it doesnt' add much to the sound that a keyboard or extra production couldn't. For anyone who's not die hard emo, or pop punk (both dead genres), go looking elsewhere. there's so much going on in the world of music there's no need to waste time and money on this band. cheers"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the greatest cds i have ever listened to in my entire life","review":"this is one of the greatest cds i have ever listened to in my entire life. all of the songs on it are great. if u dont have this cd, go and buy it!and this stuff about 'not being original' ?!? they have a frickin violin in their band!!!buy this cd!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"anyone hoo thinks this is punk is stupid","review":"eeeew- this record is really bad. If you said yellowcard are being original with the violin thing, go buy a dave matthews album. If you think it's punk, do yourself a favor and check out the sex pistols-or maybe the offspring would be an easier transition. The vocals are totally grating, the lyrics are blah, and just think how big a dweeb the frontman would be without that guitar-not that he's using it right anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Magic","review":"I've never had a CD where every song can relate to my life and hope this will not be the last of it's kind.All the songs are great but the ones that just shine the most would be Way Away, Breathing, One year six months, Back home, and Empty Apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPEECHLESS?!","review":"I just heard of Yellowcard when I was watching MTV one day and saw their music video.

Yellowcard is the BOMB?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"Why are so many people giving this CD 5 stars? I've given this album several tries and it seems as if every time I put it in I only make it half way through. This album isn't full of enough variety. The violin does add some good sound, true, but not enough. Yellowcard sounds simple plan - ish , but a bit more um \\"hardcore\\" i suppose?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Get it out of my CD player","review":"After hearing 'Way Away' on the radio, I just had to go and get this CD. I've read a lot of reviews about this CD, and some people think that just because this band \\"sounds\\" like others doesn't mean that deep down they are like them, too. They are SO much more than that. This band really tells how it is. There are so many different songs for so many different emotions on this CD. I would reccommend this CD to anyone, but, if you do happen to go and buy this CD, or just listen to a few of their songs, all I ask of you as a listener is to hear and listen to their lyrics and sounds with an open mind. Don't be so caught up in their outside image to miss what's really going on in their songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"yellowcard is the best ever!","review":"This is one of my fave bands! i ecspecially love the song ocean av. and way away. i hope they have a concert soon cuz if they do i'll be there!

Their unique sound enhanced by Ryan Key's smooth vocals and violin melodies is what makes this band great. My personal favorite songs on this cd are \\"Death of a Salesman\\" which is perfect if you need to be amped up and the wonderful tribute to the ones fallen during 9-11 on \\"Believe\\". Those are just a couple of my favorites, but honestly, not one song on Ocean Avenue is bad or even less enjoyable than the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"YELLOWCARD ROCKS MY SOCKS!!","review":"Wow I just have to say that Yellowcard is one awesome band!! After hearing Way Away on Fuze I was in love! This band ROCKS!! there aren't alot of bands out there that have a violin, and thats what makes this band have its own unique sound.

You won't be blown away be incredible song layouts, vocals, or musicianship, honestly.You won't find anything truely meaningful in the lyrics either, unless maybe you're in highschool.

Well, wait no longer, because this is something worthy. Yellowcard's 'Ocean Avenue' CD is filled with a load of great songs, including their two singles, Way Away and Ocean Avenue. This isn't just your regular pop-punk band, they have something that sets them apart. Yes, they have a violinist. Sean Mackin rocks out on this CD and at shows on the violin, and it sure sounds awesome. If you want some songs for a road trip, or for hanging with your hottie, definitly check out Ocean Avenue. By- Jessalee"},{"rating":"2","title":"In my top 3 bands","review":"YC is one of the best bands I have grown to love this year. Right now Ocean Avenue is exploding and this album is really worth a buy. I'm sure you've heard a lot about the uniqueness they hold in being a rock band with a violin player but that's not the only reason I bought this cd. YC is diverse in looks and they don't claim to be something they're not. Yeah--they are punk with pop credentials and they know how to play their music without fear. I am so glad that that faith led me down the path of rockin' Yellowcard goodness. Some songs to check out are Only One--Believe--Way Away--and the last song on the album. But those are just the tip of the Cali snowcone...I suggest the Ataris and Hooba if you're interested in some more great music. Run out and buy this cd...despite your radio doubts."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rocks","review":"I love this CD so much.

Join YC Underdogs!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellowcard \\"Miles Apart\\" from other bands","review":"The album Ocean Avenue by the band Yellowcard is one of my favorite records of all time. It is one of those rare albums where you enjoy every song and there is no skipping tracks. Every song is unique and has its own greatness, which makes listening to the album very rewarding. I first heard \\"Way Away\\" on the radio, which made me want the cd. And after listening to all the songs, my favorites are \\"Empty Apartment\\" and \\"Miles Apart,\\" but all of the songs are special and I would recommend the album to anyone who likes well written and thought out lyrics with a great blend of instruments, including violin!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellowcard-Ocean Avenue","review":"There is alot to be said about this album. First off i would like to say that i have been a Yellowcard fan for well i would say a long time now and i believe this is one of their best albums. (but of course they are all very good!) Even hearing small samples of this cd i knew that it was worth purchasing. It has to be the best album this year.

They are an outstanding band with outstanding music! any ?'s email me at kmc09@sbcglobal.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock my Socks Off!","review":"Yellowcard's new album Ocean Avenue is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. Not only does the entire album from beginning to end hold true to Yellowcard's unique musical style, but it also showcases that they are capable of performing anything from straight up rock-n-roll to country to pop punk to rock-my-socks-off-incredible music! Some of the highlights from the album include Way Away the first song from the CD and their first single, View From Heaven - a song with a country sound that will get stuck in your head for days, and also Empty Apartment - one of the most well written, emotionally inspiring songs I've heard in a long time. All in all, Ocean Avenue is the best thing you can currently find on the shelves. I'd give it a 36 and a half out of 10, and I'd also encourage anyone who likes this band to go see them live in a town near you because that is the only way to truly appreciate their talent as musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellowcard strikes gold again!","review":"Ocean Avenue is one sweet CD!

If you want punk try something else. If your here for the violin don't even bother with Yellowcard. The one time I saw Yellowcard live I was dissapointed. The only one with any energy is the violinist, the only one with real talent is the drummer.Instead of this look around for a copy of Take Me Home-Zox. Zox is the most insane local band from Providence, Rhode Island. Excellent blend of rock/reggae/punk and Spencer Swain, the greatest electric violinist, Dan, the greatest bassist, Eli, awesome guitarist and singer, and John Zox, amazing drummer. Their live performances are the best live shows you'll ever see.

Of course, i purchased it. I swear, it is my CD of the summer!! I have never heard anything like it before. A lot of the bands i have listened to have the same sound as Yellowcard, but Yellowcard has that extra violin in their songs which adds a special sound to their songs. It makes it different and separated from the rest on a whole new level. I can't tell you enough, how much this cd rocks!! You must buy it, because I know you will love it!

A lot of times you buy CDs and only end up liking a few of the songs, but every single song on \\"Ocean Avenue\\" is very good! They all have the same good feel, sound, and energy, but each song is unique with real lyrics that people can relate to.In comparison to their other CDs, I think that this one is the best so far.. they have matured as a band over the years.The Ocean Avenue CD is a must-have, especially for those of you who like punk rock that's not too hardcore. Yellowcard has the same good punk rock feel without all of the swearing, screaming, and complaining that some other punk bands have.

They have no innovative qualities to them what so ever. Oh yeah, the violinist. NOW they're unique. It's probably a gimmick anyways, people and if not they still get my 1 star.

They do everything for MTv now and they think they are so good that there one song was put on the radio. I cant believe some people thought they were actually good. They are not punk rock they are a pop group trying to be punk rock. Check some real bands like BLink 182, The Starting Line, Story of the Year, and Red Hot chili Peppers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly one of the best punk albums of the year!","review":"Decisevly, Yellowcard have marked their elevated talent and potential in \\"Ocean avenue.\\" \\"way Away\\" starts off with a gloomingly dark introduction, that draws you into the raw power of the song. also songs like \\"Breathing,\\" \\"Ocean Avenue,\\" and \\"Life Of A Salesman\\" keep you hanging off of the seat lyrically with songs reflecting on relationships, desire, past influences, heartbreak, and the will to move on. Whatever Yellowcard lack in an ideal new school punk band, they make it up with their crowd raving stage presence, heartfilled melodies, and the will to set confidence and enjoyment to the crowd. In my Opinon, they are a great ideological band that are creating their own sound and strive on working as hard as they can to be proud. It is almost too amazing to hear what their next album will sound like. Needless to say i will not be dissappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this cd","review":"This CD is awesome. Every single song on this, Yellowcard's second - and defnitely best - CD is incredibly catchy and absolutely brilliant.

There are a few songs that are a little on the folky side, but the lyrics completely make up for it. Compared to their other cd's, Ocean Avenue is great as far as quality sound goes. The lyrics are also great, but many of the songs from their older EPs are classics, so its hard to compare. I definitely recommend it to people that were either fans before or are newbies. The content of this cd is amazing, so pick it up while it's still available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeward Bound and Deep","review":"When I heard the first few tracks I was like yep, this is my Yellowcard and then I noticed a few different sounds and beats. Almost a change in rhythm from their previous styles. It was a little more heartfelt and deep. I could sense the longing to be back home in the \\"Back Home\\" and I loved it. I can relate because I live in Jacksonville. A few songs caught me off gaurd with the almost country sounding \\"fiddle\\", I know its a violin but it reminded of a fiddle. It was cool, though, a fresh flair. Anyway, its a rockin cd and I think everyone needs to check these guys out, it will change the way you love punk rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rocks my beans","review":"I was simply amazed when I heard this CD. I had been waiting for another great Cd after \\"One For the Kids\\" from Yellowcard. They definitly came though. This Cd rocks. This CD was produced really well.

Now their not exactly my favorite band, but their definetly in my top 5. Their basically a pop-punk band with touches of emo here and there, think along the lines of New Found Glory but a little heavier and they have a violin player. Their very musically talented, everything on here sounds tight, especially their drummer (watch out Travis Barker). I'm sure their probably great live too, I'm seeing them on the Warped Tour this summer. The only things they are lacking in is lyrics, while they may be well written, they need to expand into other topics. The only topic they touch on besides girls/relationships is their fathers, thats it. If they can get over that little hump, they'll be an excellent band. If you like Yellowcard, try: New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Blink-182, and Simple Plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"What happened to Yellowcard? Yes, the cd was okay, but nothing more. They now sound like your average, run-of-the-mill pop punk band. The non-California-residing Yellowcard sounded better, small time band or not. Big disappointment. Hopefully things will get better for them and they'll have more interesting lyrics and sounds next time around. And I'm tired of the whole \\"Wow, they've got a violin!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing cd","review":"i think that the yellowcard cd is a great cd. It has unique music, because they have a violinest in there band, and it just sounds amazing. all of the tracks are very good, and everyone should buy their cd.

After hearing the next few tracks you realize how boring and plain this CD really is.If you want to hear something better purchase the new NFG, that will blow you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm just not feelin' it.","review":"I remember all of my friends talking about how great Yellowcard is, so I decided to pick this cd up. I listened to it right when i bought it, and once the cd ended, I thought it was still on the first song. Every song sounds similar! I gave it about 4 more listens thinking I would like it. Turns out I didn't. To me they sound just like any other band these days, even with the violin. The lyrics are alright I guess. The only song that I can stand is \\"Believe\\", just because of what the song's about (9/11). Basically, if you like generic sounding bands with the generic high pitched voices, but with a violin, pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music called crap","review":"This is an insult to pop-punk artists. Lets set something straight: this is not pop-punk its posssibly not even emothis is F***en POP MUSIC(forgive me for using music instead of crap) There's pretty much no such thing as a good emo/pop band. they are all just the same band that spell their band's name different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor","review":"...and go listen to some Death Cab for Cutie or Postal Service instead, because if you like this sort of emo-pop thing you might as well get it done right. They're usually pretty wussy too, as emo-pop is bound to be, but their songwriting is about 25 times more sophisticated than Yellowcard and they hit upon the occasional great song.So go get \\"Soul Meets Body\\" or \\"The Sounds of Settling\\" or something and bask in the emo-pop goodness. Why settle for the bland stuff?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Like Sum41, SR - 71, etc.","review":"I don't know how this album ended up on my desk, but I decided to give it a listen. Well, just how can anyone differentiate between this band and any other pop/punk band on the radio today? Don't give me that violin stuff either. The singer has the same whiny voice as everyone else, and there aren't any memorable guitar riffs.Bottom line. If you are in high school, feel misunderstood, and have that teen angst thing going, you might like this album. If you want to listen to some good punk, try the Sex Pistols or the Ramones or dare I say even Blink 182. At least they've brought some originality to the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKE IT STOP","review":"Man, what a crappy band. normally i write short, simple review, but this is different. This band reaches a whole new level of mediocraty. Oh, wow, a violin. well, i got some news for you people, that is not anything original. the only thing this band has going for them is a cool drummer. they sound the same as all of the other 'rock' bands on the bane of human existance itself, mtv. Please, do not give them any money.PS. why are they are on rock against bush? yeah, they are really political. they are only on because they are poser 'punk' and it is a fad to hate bush. nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this band a zero I would.","review":"Simply put, yellowcard sucks. They are a bunch of wannabe \\"punk rockers\\" that have a southern californian pretty-boy feel that i cant stand. Another band i cant stand is switchfoot. What is this world coming to.

I was obsesed with that song, and a few friends told me it was a great album. So I bought it. And was blown away by every song. They are simple songs (lyrics and music, I figured them all out on my guitar fairly easily), but they bring so much emotion. Some songs made me want to jump up and down, some made me cry, some made me smile. And I still cannot stop listening.MY FAVES:Way-AwayEmpty ApartmentOnly OneInside OutBack HomePlus, if you get the enhanced CD, you can see a previously unrealesed video, \\"Powder\\", which also rocks.

It is worth every penny, and these guys deserve it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"shut up stupid people","review":"ok first i would like to say that yes i don't think that yellowcard is \\"punk\\" exactly. i wouldn't classify them as punk so i get what people are talking about. BUT that doesn't mean that their music sucks. i think its pretty good rockish kinda music. if you like any kinda of rock or punk music i would say try it, but listen to other songs than ocean ave. personally, i think this album is worth buying if you like this sort of music. also, don't dis them w/o listing to other songs beside ocean ave. it pisses me off when people rate bands according to one song. give them a chance! so all you \\"yellowcard haters\\" try listning to other songs and if you still don't like it fine i don't give a crap but don't post it here. go rave about green day or some other \\"punk\\" band like that"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful multi-faith book to teach religious tolerance","review":"In God's Name is like a metaphor for the many faiths embraced around the world.

If you like the Cranes that you have and want more, I'd just suggest purchasing one of the regular albums. As a compilation, it's fairly lukewarm anyhow.

However, I purchased it for one very specific purpose and it did not measure up. I keep my head shaved clean and I want the closest cut I can get from a trimmer as my skalp is too sensitive for a blade or an electric face shaver. The reviews indicated that with the 00000 blade you will get the closest to a razor that you can get from a clipper/trimmer. Not so. I was disappointed. My Andis T Outlinner cuts much closer than the Oster Classic 76. If you want a clean bald look then I would recommend the Andis T Outlinner over the classic 76. I would suggest to Oster that they come out with a 000000 blade to accomodate those of us who are seeking a very close cut.

Tired of worrying about something failing in the middle of a cut, I finally decided to invest in a quality Oster 76 clipper. I was about to pull the trigger on Amazon, but then realized that this may be the same model that my Mom used to terrorize me with (OK, cut my hair) when I was a kid. So I called her about her old clippers and an hour later she had dug them out of her closet and told me to come get them; they were an Oster model 76!I did a quick lube on it and fired it up. It's way noisier than anything else I've used recently, but the sound screams precision instrument. Yes it weighs a little more than the cheapies, but really not as heavy and bulky as some of the other reviews make it sound.So, buy this as an investment.

Normally it would take me 30 to 40 minutes to cut my hair and beard then shave the remaining stubble but with these clippers I was done in 10 minutes. They are so pleasant to use no pulled hairs, no going over the same area many times and the best thing no loud buzzing motor just a nice gental hum.

It's a totally different tool. Very durable, easy to use, fantastic quality, worth every penny. Don't expect the \\"buzz\\" sound as you cut your hair, it just cuts. Also, I found it much easier to handle than some of the reviews suggested.Few cons: wish it came with a blade that was between the two that came with the buzzer, so will probably have to buy a new size. Minor nit - the product is actually dark \\"blood\\" red, not bright red as the picture may lead you to believe.Overall, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best blade available","review":"Cuts fast and thorough.

I decided to ante up for the Osters after going through at least one set of cheap clippers a year with pretty low usage.

I highly recommend this product.Easy to maintain (see youtube video). John"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The best hair clipper i've ever had, and i've been through many. It may not be the most ergonomic clipper but it sure makes up for its akwardness through its shear power and accuracy. This thing will cut every hair the same uniform length. it is a great product and I can see why many people give this thing 4/5 stars. Would give it 5/5 if they improved the design for better grip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, reliable!","review":"Great product. Built to last. So precise and on point. Good stuff. Great for trimming beard. Good idea to buy this instead of buying others for around $50 every year or two. This one will last and works great. Made from serious materials too, not flimsy plastic like others."},{"rating":"2","title":"doesn't miss a beat","review":"Make no mistake about it, this machine is incredibly powerful. I have thick straight hair and this machine cuts without any pulling no matter how fast I go. The construction is solid and the blades will last forever as long as they're resharpened every few years. I've tried other machines and even when they work just as well, they somehow manage to feel cheap. I would highly recommend this set of clippers."},{"rating":"2","title":"High performance and easy maintenance","review":"This is a great hairclipper. Heavy duty and cuts through even thick or wet hair without even slowing down. I've never been in the army but I would guess they would use something like this to cut their hair during boot camp. Powerful, and easy to maintain. I expect it to last forever but even if it doesnt the extra cost is worth it if for no other reason than saving the aggrivation of using the cheap retail models which get stuck and jammed and are hard to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"After going through several 15-30 dollar clippers. I decided to step up to a \\"hopefully\\" longer lasting better quality clippers. I was not denied. These clippers are awesome! They melted away the hair on my head like a hot knife through butter.

Smooth and quit running for such a powerful machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're just looking for a quick head&beard shave, you may prefer Andis 04710","review":"I bought this for all-head shaving, including beard. I don't like spending time with wet shaving and normal dry beard shavers don't work for me. I like to have the same hair length (as short/bald as possible) everywhere. No hair-salons, no wasted time, no fuss. Bought this as a replacement for Andis 04710. Got the Oster in combination with the 00000 blade, as I thought it would be shorter than the Andis. It's not. It's also less convenient to shave as the Oster 76 is very big. The Andis is the best for fast short head and face shaving I've come across, and it's cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tired of cheap clippers? - this is what you need.","review":"A professional grade clipper to last a lifetime.If you're ready to step up from the cheap disposables most people try to get by with, the Classic 76 is worth considering. All of the parts are serviceable and replaceable meaning it will be around for a long time.That said... these are huge clippers - and whether you can adjust to that or not, the size is still less than ideal. There are other models, from Oster and others, in this same price range that might be more appropriate for the average person."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT quality, powerful clipper","review":"I have thick hair, and have been cutting it myself, with store-bought clippers, for years. During a recent use, my clipper choked on the thick hair, and I decided to get a professional clipper, so I bought the Oster Classic 76.What a difference! As you might expect based on the price, the Oster is in a class above when compared to the clipper kits you buy at the local Rite-Aid or WalMart. It's a quality appliance and seems to be well worth the extra expense for regular clipper users.So, why 4 stars instead of 5? Two reasons. One, it doesn't come with the numbered plastic combs--you have to purchase them separately. Second, it's on the heavy side and it's a bit cumbersome to use compared to the lighter, cheaper models. I suppose that's the price you pay for quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic 76 is the Cadillac of clippers","review":"Pro barbers around the world use this clipper. This clipper should last you a lifetime, a true commercial grade clipper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What You Hope It Is","review":"If you're tired of cheap clippers from the drug store and were looking for what your barber would use, look no further.I was amazed by how much faster my hair cut went, no more running over the same area over and over to make sure it looks even. The powerful motor cuts without a tortured squeal when it hits a patch of thick hair as well.Couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best set of clippers I have ever had","review":"I have been cutting my hair since I was in Jr. High School (over 20 years), and the Oster Classic 76 is by far the best set of clippers I have ever owned. I have gone through several cheaper pairs of clippers (i.e. Wahl which you can purchase at Target or Walmart) over the years. The Oster Classic 76 makes fading very easy, and there is no vibration in the unit. I wish I would have purchsed this unit so much earlier on in my life. Definitely worth the money, especially if you cut/fade your hair every week or 2 weeks (salon charges $55 a cut and Super Cut charges +-/ $20 a cut)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great clippers","review":"i purchased this item a few weeks ago and im like re united with and old dependable friend.I used these clippers back in my younger days when i was a prison barber.I used them all day almost every day and never had any problems.And now that im older i decided to go with the best,only one bad thing is that they dont come with storage box to keep secure when not in use,other then that i recomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"Very durable and powerful machine.

Wow, compared to the Store brand models this thing can cut. It is really good for thick hair. The only bad thing is the clipper takes some getting used to when working fades. I would recommend another smaller set to handle the fading portion. Otherwise though this thing will last forever if you take care of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beast","review":"This thing cuts through my beard like butter.

This was confirmed by our local barber. What a rip off! We specifically bought these for their close/bald shaving performance. Now we have to spend more money to buy the correct blade. What a hassle! And to think, we spent $125 (with shipping) to still not be able to cut hair. What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to change blades","review":"I have owned Oster products before and thought this would be a good buy. Unfortunately, when I tried to change the blade, it was difficult, if not, impossible to do. The instruction manual obviously doesn't expect blade changes on the fly because there are no diagrams. I now have a product that is just sitting dismantled and have no way of getting it back together. I will be calling OsterPro and letting them know of my displeasure. For a product this expensive, the blades should change themselves. I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"love these clippers","review":"A couple years ago my wife started cutting mine and my sons hair regularly to save $$. I bought a $50 dollar ConAir clipper. It was loud and pulled hair from the get go. My son tolerated the hair cuts but would rather go to the barber. After some research (looking to see what the barber was using, and reading reviews), I bought a classic 76.I've been using these clipper for four months now. I love these clippers. No pulling what so ever. Blades are easy to change out. They cut though my sons thick hair like a knife thu butter. Other complain about the noise, but I don't think they are any louder than any other clipper. It's quieter than my old ConAir clipper. Love the fact that they are MADE in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"You can't go wrong with a classic! I wish they would have come with their own guards and not just the 000 and 1 guard. Other than that - they are fairly quiet and cut well. I had to adjust to the added weight and the motor puts out a lot of wind which can blow the clippings around."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I just owned them a short while but so far I've been impressed with how smooth this clipper operates.

There's no pretense whatsoever to fine art here; this is hardcore techno, and long forgotten at that. I picked this up at a CD shop in Cleveland just for the cover and title back in 1996, and while I'd pick hundreds of other CDs out of my collection as \\"something better\\" there's a strange charm to this sampler that's made me hang on to it for ten years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immigrants - Universal Experiences","review":"Matussem's story gently dominates the myriad stories about his family's immigrant experiences in the United States. (Variations on his family's story are played out by immigrants around the world.) Abu-Jaber writes on this universal theme with an authentic voice that reveals longing for origins - a place that feels like home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yecchh","review":"What a mess. The author has evidently seen more movies than she has read books; banal, cutesy and irritating, as well as badly written. My favorite line: a cake is described as being \\"hairy with sprinkles\\". Sparkling with sprinkles, maybe, or even poxed with sprinkles, but 'hairy'? This novel should be assigned to literature students as an example of how to alienate a reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven, but when it's good it soars","review":"Worth reading, though the first few pages (and some later) are extremely disappointing. Arabic names are mispronounced, the attempt at comedy is poor, and none of the characters are remotely sympathetic. As the book proceeds, we meet a very different kind of writing. Some of the passages in the book are exceptionally insightful and well written. For those passages it is well worth reading the book. I would rate the book between 1 and 5. It won't tell you much about Arab culture except in parody, but it portrays alienation and prejudice with candor and poignancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"This book bounces between the cute and the cliche. The reader feels there is a real story-teller waiting to get out, but suffocating under the author's clumsy craftsmanship. The immigrant \\"experience\\" is not deconstructed but frozen into solid pieces narrative, into obvious encounters with bigots and identity confusion/pursuit. My best advice is that the potential reader should get the book out of library and save the cash for another book that will deserve a re-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boom Boom Boom, Bad Bad Bad.","review":"I have bought other Masterbeat CD's before and I have really enjoyed them.

I would listen to the beginning of the songs and wait for them to take off but they never did. In a word, B-O-R-I-N-G! And repetitive with zero musical ability. Boom, boom and more boom.

We use these goals in our basement all winter long. Despite taking care to assure that they were installed correctly, which is not that difficult, they held up for one kick of a soccer ball by my 14 yo son. Now maybe a 4 yo might not hurt these nets with a power shot but a 14yo blew the ball right through the nets on the first shot and nothing but holes after 15 minutes. Although relatively cheap. You get what you pay for.

One of the main character's deaths at the end of the film is cut - you don't see the villain shot, you only see him after the fact. I wonder if this was the only available print that MGM could find in their vaults? In addition, MGM adds insult to injury by releasing a full-frame (pan-and-scan) version! Ouch!

I find it to be quite excellent. The review that claims the book is mostly made up of cheesy line art is a joke. If you can speak from nothing but ignorance of the subject, please don't speak at all. To the person who directed their review at the company, don't take it out on the book please. I too ordered a copy. Back in April I believe. I haven't received mine either. I simply bought one from Amazon. This book is filled with new and old art, spanning the various incarnations of the Transformers. For the most part the art is fantastic. Personally, I only found one dissapointing illustration in the whole book. Other that that, perfection. Looking foward to part two.

The lamp burned out in 3 months of use. We do not use the projector during the week and on the weekends we watch movies and TV for a total of about 3 hours/day. The last lamp I had lasted 3 years with this amount of use. This one needs to be replaced in 3 months.

I got this album based on the short low-fi demo clips. I expect I'll be checking out more. The musicianship is impeccable. The lyrics and vocal work are solid. The recording and engineering are excellent.The album makes some stylistic shifts. They range from fusion/progressive (The Devils Dictionary), to 80's power pop with a commercial sheen (Perfect Kiss), to the interesting and introspective (Little Town), to the experimental(Saddleworth Moor). It basically settles into a quality pop groove. They remind me a bit of one of my favorite underrated bands, Toy Matinee. They also recall Icehouse.There aren't any real duds, but some of the tracks feel a bit cookie cutter. Overall a very listenable album with a few absolute gems."},{"rating":"2","title":"The songs he loved to sing","review":"All the songs I remember hearing on the AM radio when I was a kid.

Anything you can learn from it, you can learn it faster and with far less frustration from other C++ books around (Like Lipmann's C++ Primer).

The stamps add a nice western vibe, and the buckle adjust is fine so far (had about 1 month). Within a couple weeks one of the faux jewels fell off. I super'd it back on, so no big deal.

From a literary point of view, this book is very poorly written. It is full of grammatical errors, historical inaccuracies, and mathematical guesswork. It is beautifully illustrated, but I wasn't looking for a picture book.I bought the book hoping that I would learn more about the equations used to complete a natal chart. The math used in the book is not at all difficult...just ridiculous.Quote: \\"In astrology, two and two sometimes add up to one and a quarter and sometimes five.\\"Yes, I agree the so-called \\"prejudice\\" held against astrology is sad, but this book only perpetuates the idea that astrology is a \\"pseudoscience.\\" It would have redeeming qualities if I wasn't afraid to trust the data presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"part of any astrologer's journey","review":"I think any astrologer in their course of learning astrology over their lifetime will benefit at some point in their journey from reading and having this book.

However, it suffers from a somewhat encyclopedic approach, that is, it is chock-full of information but not eminently readable. As a reference book, it suffers from the lack of a useful index. That leaves the only other alternative, which is to endeavour to read it cover to cover. The latter is not such a ridiculous thought; after all, the promises of God are so exciting that they should be fully devoured. Unfortunately, again, Lockyear's presentation of the material makes this a difficult task. It is a pity, because I am sure there are many, many gems to be found. The accompanying commentary is also sometimes very insightful. Alas, after this, I am still searching for a book that classifies all the promises in the Bible - all 8,810 of them - in a simple manner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read, will look for another","review":"Rarely do I find a book that disappoints like this one did.

The singer (James Wraith) tries awfully hard to mimic Bryan Ferry and all of his vocal mannerisms.But the biggest problem is the songs themselves are mere shadows of great Roxy songs or even Manzanera's productive solo period (Diamond Head through K-Scope). With the exception of the exciting Crack The Whip, all the songs here are D.O.A. Much too polite and without a whiff of energy or soul.Fortuntely, the Explorers vanished soon thereafter. I've even seen their one studio release repackaged and retitled as Manzanera and McKay.The best news is that Manzanera's Explorer experiment has done nothing to diminish what he had already accomplished over the course of a great career."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best item available for these bikes","review":"I am doing a hasty restoration (if there is such a thing) on an R75/5.

After I marked it all up, hilighting and adding notes, it was perfect.I gave it 4 stars, not because there wasn't enough info, but that I had to weed through it to get what I needed.

From the spanish sound of the guitar in Beauty, to the motives you can find in any other of the songs, Sakamoto's musical background is always present, not giving up even in the hardests moments. I mean, many artist usually fill up minutes in a record with tracks that really don't deserve the authory, but not with Sakamoto. For me, it's a fully recommended CD, for you or as a gift to anyone who likes good music (without adjetives)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old, Outdated, and Repetitive","review":"I thought I would love this award-winner, but the film itself (made in the mid 90s) was REALLY outdated. People were using computers from what appeared to be 1980, the clothing/acting during scripted moments was cheesy, and a good deal of the 'documentary' dealt with conservative religious groups and their views on shopping/family. While this is okay, I found the more recent and funny (and actually much less religious) film _What Would Jesus Buy?_ a better and more entertaining view on the same subject. I rarely give bad reviews on here, but this film is a turkey. It is not even worth showing to a classroom of students (h.s. or college), since it is outmoded and corny. I think the subject is really important and I applaud this films' initial creation, but it has become...\\"obsolete\\" in the face of newer, fresher, and more...detailed...documentaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tooth powder","review":"If you look at the ingredients in most tooth paste they have glycerin in them.

I used Monkey Brand black toothpowder alternating it with regular toothpaste for years. At some point in time I started trying Crest whte strips and other tooth whiteners and in spite of their high cost and exalted claims, I saw little increase of stain removal. After several years of spending big $ on costly whiteners, I have gone back to Monkey brand black tooth powder and my teeth are much less stained than they were when I rigorously used the new commercial whiteners.Yes, Monkey Brand black tooth powder leaves a dusting of black powder in the sink, but it is easily rinsed away with water and a sponge. I personally like the taste better than the nasty sugared toothpastes or weird peroxide taste of whitening strips which irritate the gums.Monkey Brand black toothpowder is an excellent product, inexpensive and efficacious.

It should have been the hit single. Another favorite is Merrimack County, a song with a Native American theme. Tom Rush's voice has always been addictive, and this compilation confirms the addiction for me!

If you are planning on using this with a software PBX like Asterisk, I recommend you see if you can find a good working example somewhere before you buy it. If you want to use it as a stand alone device to route 911 (and/or local) calls to a PSTN line and have it connect to a VoIP provider to save money, it will work great.

They spot a boat off shore with a running light coming in to shore in an area when summer homes are not as yet opened for the summer. The boat docks, a figure with a flashlight leaves the boat, goes into a home, does not turn on any lights, and shortly thereafter returns to his boat, and goes away. OK--these two law officers are in the area to investigate a handfull of thefts in summer homes not opened for the season and they do not investigate what they have just seen. They do not jump to their feet and run down the shore to see what is going on. What do they do. They idly wonder what the boater is doing (this in the middle of the night) and go back to whatever it was they were talking about. Nothing could save the book for me after this episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important Character...

By releasing four different episodes, which by the way are are not in sequence with the MAJOR \\"Buffy\\" Storyline, you can't follow along.Spike is the celebrity here, but Spike wasn't the only character to care about.

All there is on this DVD is 4 episodes of Buffy which included Spike in them. If you already have all 7 seasons of Buffy, you've seen those 4 episodes. There is also a little bit of special features with Spike, but again, these were included in one of the seasons of Buffy. Granted the DVD is not expensive, but still a waste of money when you have all of Buffy's seasons.

Though it is not the original four, Pat Thrall does a good job on lead guitar. If you are looking for a good live recording of some of the original songs, this is a good choice. The worst part about the CD is that the audience sounds fairly small, and you don't get the real arena feel as you did in the 1983 concert in Japan. This is a must for Asia fans.We can only wish that the original band members could work out their differences and stage a comeback with the style and flare they had in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst collection possible","review":"\\"Greatest hits of the 70's\\" yeah right. the part of the sentence they left off was \\"...for the tone deaf\\".

Once it began to sink in though, I really found myself loving it. The lyrics on this album are top-notch, as is the technical use of guitar and prominent keys. Their singer I've grown to enjoy. He's less operatic and dynamic than I usually like, with a kind of Dave Matthews-ish alternative or monotone sound, but I think he suits the band well and is able to give them something distinctive in this regard. The melodies and arrangements throughout the album are also excellent, yet I think at times their full effect is lost amongst production that is, I feel, less than impressive. All in all, this is one of the better prog releases I've come across in recent years (and it's still continuing to grow on me!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letters are difficult to trace","review":"I purchased these traceable letters, along with a larger size set, to use with a youth group (ages 7-12).

Their little faces brighten up during the first half of the song and then wither towards the end of the song when \\"Martin sang no more...\\" Every teacher (K-2nd grade) I have shared this song with has had a similar experience with their students.

It opens with the lilting The Lion/Gaiende, followed by the soulful Shakin' The Tree where Peter Gabriel contributes vocals, the lively, fast-paced Kocc Barma and Bamako, a jazzy track.Old Tucson has a charming R&B; flavor, Macoy is atmospheric and subdued, while Sama Doom is another polyrhythmic delight. N'Dour sings in both English and Wolof, his native language, but his voice is so expressive that language doesn't matter much.The instrumentation and backing vocals are elegant and graceful throughout - full marks for expert production. Although not quite as magnificent as his classic album Eyes Open, The Lion is very accessible without compromising the integrity of the artist's roots, a highly successful fusion of Western and African sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing early live album","review":"I had read the reviews here before I finally decided to buy the CDs. One of the reviewers had warned about the recording - he said the CD had been recorded from an LP and it would skip and crackle. When I got the CDs I was amazed about how good the sound actually is. And as far as I can tell, you can only tell from the intro of \\"Hip Priest\\" that it was recorded from an LP. Don't get discouraged to buy the CDs as I did! This is the best early live recording of The Fall - I have all the other ones, and this one has the best sound, and the band is very good!PS: Well, yeah, the album does skip occasionally and I don't think that's intended.

It is exhaustive on the mountain trails (including abandoned trails), but it does not include beach hikes, only mountain trails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate. Read at Your Own Risk","review":"Warning: This Book May Result in Serious Injury or Death! Multiple times on a recent trans-Olympic backpack this book let our group down, and a couple times trusting Robert Woods' advice placed us in danger. Most of the inaccuracies were related to campsites and where to find them...or that they even exist at all! The most extreme incident was his depiction of Bone Camp on the trail coming down from Hayden Pass. It did not exist, and there were no other campsites. As a result our group spent 5 hours hiking in the dark on steep trails to get to the next camp. Had his writing been accurate in this case and several others, we would have had a safer and more enjoyable hike.

This DVD does not have any useful historic information about neither the knights Templar nor Rosslyn Chapel. It only has few seconds of the chapel footage. Most of the film duration is computer generated graphics and psychedelic effects which resemble video games.This time filler is alternate with the author interview segments about his ideas on how Rosslyn Chapel could be a portal to another dimension.

Indeed, judicial review and the constitution focus on procedural rules that make democracy workable by protecting every individual's right to participate and vote in democracy. This is different from protecting substantive values, which Ely claims are more ephemeral and shouldn't be constitutionalized (see, 18th amendment).

This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest albums I have ever heard in my life. When she sings, she is right there in your soul and you can just sit back and let her take you away. She touches places that few artists ever do with a true and genuine magic. The quality of her music is so incredible that it is as if she is standing there in front of you telling you her stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amanda is a Gifted Artist","review":"They don't make them better than Amanda. Her voice is unique--although some might compare to Alanis or Cheryl Crow--but she actually has pipes. Why isn't a bigger presence in the States is beyond me. This album, like herself titled first one, is another masterpiece. While the first two tracks are my favorites, the entire album is easy to listen to over and over. Some songs make you fly; others get you down but not in a bad way. Her music can and will touch you. There is reason why many film makers use her music for their films here in America. Her third album is being released on Nov. 13 and yet I don't even see it here on Amazon. Something tells me that she has created another incredible album. The first single is very different for her--and quite good. Everyone has a story, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A proud Canadian","review":"After her first and amazing cd I was very excited for the release of this one.I like it almost as much but think the quality of recording is not good.Her voice is unreal especially on \\"If I didn't have you\\" and \\"Love lift me\\".All and all very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying for any one of its best songs!","review":"This is a wildly uneven album, but one whose high points are among the best in pop music this year. \\"Love Lift Me,\\" \\"Why Don't You Love Me\\" and \\"Out of Bounds\\" are all exceptional, as is the already released (and unfortunately shortened and remixed here) \\"Believe in You.\\" The real revelation here, though, is the Eric Bazallian-produced \\"If I Didn't Have You\\" - a great song with a real sense of acceleration and build, featuring a gutsy, emotionally raw vocal peformance by Marshall. This one deserves to be a BIG hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What are you singing?","review":"\\"Tuesday's Child\\" has the songs on it that some (USA) Americans might find familiar, but not know why. Two of the albums most inspirational cuts have been featured on Soundtracks. \\"I believe in you\\" was featured on \\"Touched by an Angel\\". It is one of the most touching songs of loyalty and faith in friendship that I know of. Similarly, \\"Ride\\" was featured on a movie that I loved \\"The Replacements\\" and again it is a song that moves me very much \\"When the world that you've created leaves you feelin' tired and jaded, under appreciated, I'll be your ride\\"But there are other wonderful songs that you might not have heard.Heartbreaking songs of loss (\\"Why don't you love me?\\", \\"Givin' up Givin' In\\", \\"Too little too late\\"), Romantic (\\"Love lift me\\",\\" Right Here All Along\\"), and even diversity (\\"Shades of gray\\").So here's the deal if you like singer songwriter music, here is a great album from a great talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and insightful","review":"The writers experiences are fascinating and at times exciting.

Well, i found wath i was lloking for. An album where the drums & percussions are the main stuff. Not the guitar, not the piano or keyboards or vocals.

I mean really, Ghost Freak for nearly fifty dollars? Stink Fly for almost thirty??? These were originally released for five! I waited for the re-release of Wild Mutt when I missed it the first time and saved a significant amount from what Amazing Plush/Amazon were asking for it just a few months ago. I'm disgusted with both companies. I think I'll wait for Bandai to re-release these and spend a lot less of my hard-earned money at a more popular toy store.

If you've noticed flies buzzing around a certain window, put one in the corner of that window, and you'll catch flies.My one complaint, and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars, has also been mentioned by a few other reviews: The sticky tape on the back that holds the trap against the window is not strong enough.

Put candy and sweets inside trap to attract flies to at least go near the glue....didnt work. The overall idea of the trap makes sense, but seems like it would need an actual fly attractant (not included) to get the flies to enter the trap and then get stuck to the glue--as it is now, you would have to just have plain old luck to have a fly blunder into the trap (no reason for a fly to enter trap as it is) and then blunder onto one of the glue pads (again, no reason for a fly to do that as is). Wish I could say it worked, it did not work at all for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!!","review":"We have a log home that gets Cluster Fly infestation every winter. We have used Black Flag's window fly trap sticky papers on the windows with much success, BUT you have to look at the dead flies. The Fly Motel conceals the flies so you can leave it up all winter.

Small inconvenience for an overall WONDERFUL PRODUCT at a reasonable price!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Does not work.

They are breeding somewhere and are still in the house after the weather turned cold. I am working on finding out where they are coming from but in the meantime I wanted to cut down on the numbers. I was using spray and was worried about it harming my pets.I bought 5 boxes to get free shipping. That equaled ten motels.

It's tough, heavy duty, and it does the job. It's actually too tough for me--the creases in the strap from being folded for shipping never really went away, and it won't smooth out to match where I have it set. So it's a little awkward to use and I generally go with my flimsy but comfortable Ernie Ball straps instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality and value for money","review":"Quality of stitching is excellent, there are no loose or open threads. The ends of strap have been heated properly to prevent fraying. At approximately 3 mm, its a little thicker than other straps I used. The ends are actually made of leather.Extras - small cord for acoustic guitars and plastic hook to hang the strap on a wall.Minor problem - The top layer of one of the holes is peeling off. Can be fixed with glue.Excellent value for money.

A bit pricey at the store, but worth the wait on amazon. It really does take a new appraoch to teaching flash animation. The cartunes were laid out in a very orderly fashion and the lessons were not all jumbled together. I have other flash animation books that deal with \\"principles of animation\\" and the poor designs & layout are quite confusing. The Flash Animator is great lesson in computer book design, even if the price was a bit much;)ps-I love the little skateboarding guy on the back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal Clear!","review":"As an art director, I had to supply my team of flash designers with some reference materials for our current project. This book was recommended to me at Flash Forward last week in NYC as the only Flash book, that will teach designers how to \\"animate\\". In other words, not just move things around, but give objects life, personality, and bounce.Well, I must admit...while other books attempt to do that, this one is by far the most clarified and well written. This book is very much like those old Walter Lantz or Preston Blair books of the 1960s. Its very visually stimulating and that's saying a lot for something deemed, \\"a computer book\\". It does a great job of explaining complex concepts without bogging down the artist in a myriad of rambling text.The artwork was superb and very engaging. Stylistically it's quite diverse, which I loved! Compare it to the other \\"flash animation\\" books out there, and you'll see its a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"Compared to the other books out there, this one is well worth the price. I especially liked the interview sections because the author didnt just interview flash animators, but all types of artists & animators. It's quite a compilation of talent. I also dug the various styles the author used through out the book. Whether it was intentional or not, the wide range of artistic styles he created kept it really engaging. I have always thought flash's animation's biggest asset was its maleability in terms of art direction.I'm hardly an \\"animator\\" as the author so boldly defines it, but this book has really given my flash design work some -ummpf-! Its amazing how making the smallest little changes to an object can drastically fool your eyes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO GASKET INCLUDED","review":"Good quality item, However I expected a simple gasket so I could install quickly.

The video piqued my students'interest because part of it was about Garfield park and they live in the Chicago area. Most of them had no idea that art like this existed. Chihuly is a great glass artist and a great showman. Watching glass blown and turn from a huge hot blob into a beautiful, luminouse work of art is fascinating.The color in the video was lush.The timing of the scenes in the movie was really suited to tired evening students' attention span.

I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Levels Without Save Points = Persistent Annoyance","review":"This is pretty decent game, not great but good. I would say that it's a good start. This game has better graphics, smarter AI, and battle field tactics than any of the Dynasty Warriors games. Infact the Dynasty Warriors game for the 360 was an embarassment to Dynasty Warriors fans like myself. DON'T GET DYNASTY WARRIORS EMPIRES FOR THE 360!!!! Anyway Ninety-Nine Nights drops the ball in a few places namely that the levels are long without save points, when you are fighting bosses who are impossibly difficult to pounce you end up having to start the entire level over again. This is a serious show stopper on the replay side. At least the game should have a difficulty gauge. That would be smart. Also, the blocking scheme for the characters is not real good depending on your character. Otherwise a decent game not great but good."},{"rating":"1","title":"N3 Review","review":"For the first few minutes, this game is great. It's basically just large scale battles. Which is fun, but it gets boring after a while. Also, I don't like how the saving works in the game. You can only save after a mission, and the missions take a while. So, if you die towards the end of a mission, you have to start it all over from the beginning.Pros:-Pretty good visuals-Easy gameplayCons:-Gets pretty boring, pretty quick-Saving sucks-Missions are longOverall, I give this game about 2.5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Hack and Slash.... no better combination.

Worth every penny I payed for it. Sadly i found that it was kinda short. It makes up for it with good replay value and beautifal graphics. One issue some may have is that it has the same game play style as Dynasty Warriors. Control one person and destroy an entire army while your guys don't do to much. The enemy tends to attack you far more often then anything else and that can be a bit frustrating. But I still loved the game and hope more purchase it. One note though, if you want a game with a twisting and hard to guess story line, just walk away now.Once you play it with one character, you can pretty much guess what will happen as you play the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright","review":"The game itself isn't all that difficult until the last fight. It does get a little repetitive when playing through the different scenarios for each playable character.

I would repeatedly get stuck fighting (read: hitting every random sequence of buttons possible, as fast as possible) in one spot for hours without being able to proceed regardless of what strategy I tried. Also, for you achievement fiends, you have to beat the game to get any achievement and the only achievements are for beating the game with each different character. talk about redundant and boring.The graphics were very good though which bumps it up a star for me.

Yes, the author can ramble and rant and turn a phrase with the best writers, but the whole \\"mystery\\" turns into a red herring and leaving me with a big \\"huh?\\" on my face. A lot of comments on everything around the wry detective with what little plot there was used as an excuse to pontificate some more. Sorry, fans.

The sheer joy conveyed by these musicians make these works listenable, and listenable time after time. I'm not a fan of most baroque music offerings on CD but this disc by Modo Antiquo and Signor Sardelli is one of the greatest of them all. Tactus' sonics are impeccable but the quality and finish of the playing is superior to anything Karl Richter or Trevor Pinnock ever fashioned. It's the style of the playing that's key to this recording's magic. Yes it is spirited with vivacious tempi but the added winds, the superbly timed rubato and the musical closure Sardelli gets this ensemble to communicate to the listener is something I've rarely heard on ANY CD.I highly recommend this disc to everyone who loves music because the artists here must love what they're doing.

This record's production values areconsistent with a record like the Byrds' \\"Ballad of Easy Rider\\"--it is dry and unpretentious. I rate this record as categoricallydifferent from McGuinn's later 1970s output, each example of which has the unfortunatequality of sounding like producers and engineers insisted on making McGuinn's records soundlike the soup-of-the-day sonically. In 1976, e.g., that was a sad thing--flabby drum sounds,utterly un-Byrd-like rock-radio guitar. This 1972 record is different. The genreis hard to name, because it alternates tracks with Lloyd's jazz licks with more folky tunes.But it is all pleasant, and does still manage to sound like a holiday from McGuinn's other workin this period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightenment","review":"What a relief to find health information that is helpful for everyone.

The sound output is anemic, and there is absolutely nothing in the rear speakers except a bit of reverbed drums.

It's an anthem to youth and making life count.The first concert I heard \\"Outside of the Inside\\" was October 2001. RT dedicated the song to the Taliban and had the audience's full attention. It was on University of Texas' campus and a lot of us were afraid we were going to war. The song made my hair stand on end.\\"A love you can't survive\\" is quiet.

This man was killing people for the simple pleasure of seeing the look on the victims face as their dying. He would get this warm tingling feeling inside as he was killing his victims. If the victim struggled any, the killing made it more enjoyable for him. The sad part of all this mess is that the victims, were newlyweds, they weren't even married for more than 2 days.

I must be in the minority as this is a successful series for him. I guess that is why we have so many books to choose from. Bring me more Alex Cross!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nails on a Chalkboard","review":"This is my 1st James Patterson book. I'm listening to the audiobook. I'm giving it 2 stars because I got more than halfway through. The reader makes me cringe and combined with Patterson's writing, well, I'm sure there is an audience for this book but it isn't me. The sexual aspect of the murders makes me wonder about the author, though I think he must be trying to appeal to an audience. Ditto for the concept of women banding together to solve the murder. It's all too, too cutsie. I'm embarrassed for the writer though he is probably laughing all the way to the bank. I wonder if this book was submitted anonymously if it would ever get published?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally found a book that I liked!","review":"After reading & falling in love with Harry Potter, I have really had a hard time finding books that I like. I find myself lost when I go into a book store, not knowing what kind of books would interest me. I've read Twiilight, and loved that also, but they still weren't my HP books =) After searching the net for books that I thought might interest me, this book came up in a \\"similar books\\" list. I thought, hey, why not? So I read it. I could NOT put this book down. If it was out of my hands, my mind was racing about it, dying to just read one more page. It kept my interest right up to the very last page. I must say, my only disappointment was Raleigh =( I am thrilled to say that I have found a type of book that has me excited to read again! I will be getting the 2nd book ASAP! Loved it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Kiss the Girls\\"!","review":"This has to be my favorite James Patterson novel so far. I thought until now that \\"Kiss the Girls\\" was my favorite but I was so impressed with the story line in \\"1st to Die\\". I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good suspense thriller. It's fast and easy to read and you won't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st to Die","review":"I am a big fan of James Patterson and especially Dr.Alex Cross and the novels about him. I never thought I would be interested in a new series or new characters, but James Patterson has made me change my mind!!!!! I could not put this book down and I loved every second of it.....the only thing bad about the book is that I finished reading it too quickly and miss the characters. I do hope that Mr. Patterson has more the of the \\"Women's Murder Club\\" coming for us!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1st to die","review":"I have read a few books by Patterson ie \\"Kiss the girls\\" which is a really good thriller. So when I started reading his latest book \\"1st to die\\" I had big expectations. But what a disappointment! The book is not at all exciting, it hasn't got the touch to be classified as a good thriller. The characters are dull and thin and I would say the book is the disappoinment of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Patterson has done it again!!!","review":"Totally intriguing to the very last page. A Page turner that will keep you up late into the night just to see what's going to happen next!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick read - but not up to his standard","review":"If I bought this book off the paperback rack to read at the beach, I'd be pleased. It was a quick read with a surprise ending. However, Patterson's attempt to get inside the mind of a woman and her group of female friends left something to be desired. The mystery plot was intertwined with the quickly developing friendship of four women and it was a lame attempt at best. I had to often suspend my disbelief that people make lifetime friendships within the space of a week or two, or even after one meeting. Some men, i.e. Memoirs of a Geisha, can get write well in the female 1st person, Patterson needs more practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awwwful","review":"I heard the audio version. It was a female reader and all the female characters sounded fine. Her male voice inpersonations were horrible, the sound a throat makes after 30 years of emphysema.The book didn't fare much better. It really pulled me in for the first half - a very interesting killer. But, it quickly went downhill with a distracting blood disease plotline and a terrible ending. It read more like something for a bad hollywood flick and should have never made it to print. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Implausible \\"club\\" , but I wish I had friends like these!","review":"As another reviewer said...\\"Not his best\\"....but I did enjoy it. I am glad that he has started this series and I think he can get a lot of mileage out of the four main characters and the situations that they may find themselves in. I look forward to the next one in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nancy Drew lives again!","review":"I agree with one of the other reviewers that if you enjoyed Nancy Drew as a kid, you will enjoy this book. It is not well written and the characters are not well developed. I listened to the entire book (unabridged) on tape and I am sure I heard the narrator laughing in the background a few times on the lines she had to read. Bottom line: A simple book not well done but will probably make some TV of the week mini-series because of location in San Francisco and Napa that will show well on the tube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, Weak, Weak!","review":"I've read a couple of Patterson's books (Kiss The Girls), and I thought they were OK. So, I wasn't expecting much when I started this, but I was hoping to be entertained. As I kept reading, I was hoping it would get better, but it only got worse. From the hackneyed plot twists, to the excruciating dialog, to the affectated pop culture references, Patterson obviously was fulfilling his contract obligations. His narrative from the female perspective is a cheap device, and it strikes me somewhat as pandering - as if he truly can get into the head of a female detective. And what was with that ending? I just let out one big groan after finishing it. Makes me wonder if I was reading a different book than everyone else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch Thriller","review":"I was a bit hesitant to pickup this audio cd because the \\"women's murder club\\" thing kinda turned me off. However, I am so glad that I chose to listen to it. Wow! What a thrill ride, right from the beginning to the end. James Patterson is an amazing writer but his Alex Cross series became a bit flaky at times but this new series is a winner!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheesey and gruesome","review":"The first two-thirds of this book were good and exciting. The murder scenes were a little gruesome for me, but I can get over that. What ruined the book for me was the incredibly cheesey last third or so of the book. It's like all of a sudden all you need to do is think to yourself is \\"what is the most cheesey over-dramatic thing that could happen?\\" and that's what happens. It's like two books squeezed into one, most of the murder-mystery part is at the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more great novel by James Patterson","review":"As usual James Patterson has come up with another masterpiece. I read 7th Heaven and got hooked, so now I am starting with number one of the Women's Murder Club series. This covers the formation of the club and what led up to it. It's a spellbinding thriller with a great twist at the end. A definite must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TX. Lady","review":"This was my first James Patterson book. Is NOT my last.

Can't wait to read all the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I've read all of Patterson's books and was becoming disenhearted with his writing as of late. Roses are Red was his worst book and almost didn't even read this one.It was a pleasant surprise to see that he can still write a good book. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good","review":"This is the first James Patterson novel I've read, so I can't compare it with his Alex Cross series. However, I liked the book enough to stay up until 2am reading it. The characters, especially the lead character, Lindsay Boxer, was fun to watch in action. I also enjoyed getting the perspective of the killer. The short chapters keep you turning the pages, so does the story. I can't say that I was all that surprised by the ending. But I will rank this an over all satisfying quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st to Die by James Patterson","review":"This book is dreadful. The worst instincts of James Patterson seem to have run amuck here. If I could, I would've given this a no-star.I can't understand why a man with writing talent would bother with this type of thing.The heroine is absurdly flat and uninteresting, the love story is a pain, the crimes are revolting and worst of all, the killer is boring and hopelesslyderivitive. Ugh.I hope that contract pressure isn't pushing James Patterson intowriting too quickly and trying too hard. I understand this is to be a series too, forget about it.I'm sorry to be so harsh, but I have enjoyed some of this author's earlier books and I am really disappointed in this dud.Perfectly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st To Die","review":"Everything I have read by James Patterson has great plots but horrible dialogue. Mr. Patterson seems only to be able to write in very short sentences with excessive use of \\"!\\" (exclamation mark) after every 2nd & 3rd sentence. He has brillant and exceptional plots. Very exciting. I just am no longer willing to put up with the inability to write complex sentences. Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"This is the first time I read James Patterson and I am not impressed. The characters are one dimensional and the plot is too easy to guess. If you think this book is a police-investigation procedural, you will be in for a nasty surprise. Although there are police procedural aspect in this book, it is sloppy and it does not drive the story. Patterson relies on contrived, melodramatic of conflicts/interactions between the dying heroine, her prince charming, her loyal friends, and the red beard evil advisary to drive the story. Standard recipe for a typical soap-opera episode... In short, there is nothing exciting about this book. Patterson likes to use adjectives in front of his nouns to get us to \\"feel\\" for his characters; he even italicizes them often as if begging us or commanding us to emphatize with them and to get excited about the story..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"There are lots of favorable reviews for this potboiler, which I simply don't understand. The plot is simultaneously full of holes, full of coincidences that crush any suspension of disbelief, and almost completely predictable. Anyone who doesn't figure out \\"who dun it\\" by the middle of the book just isn't paying attention, and the final plot twist is so clearly telegraphed that it's just a relief when it's finally over. The characters are cliches, the angst of the central character generates no sympathy, the egregious use of over-the-top methaphor and simile is numbing, and this male author should be legally prohibited from trying to write sex scenes from a feminine perspective. Only those indulging a mild curiosity about sexual sadism would enjoy any part of this. In the interest of encouraging quality in the genre, please do not purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another waste of good paper by the master huckster","review":"I can overlook Patterson's full-color photo inside backcover and self-wrote byline \\"America's #1 Thriller Writer\\" in the paper back (after all he used to write ad copy for breakfast cereal) but I can't abide the ego behind this poor excuse for a thriller. Patterson seems to have no respect for even the average reader and his pandering to what he hopes is a new audience with his version of a Sue Grafton novel is unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 1st Rate","review":"Definitely not one of Patterson's best and not a good way to start off a new series. I agree with many others that the characters are not well developed. Also Patterson continues as he does with Alex; \\"angsting\\" the life of his main protagonist in this case, Lindsay Boxer. I guess he just doesn't want his main characters to enjoy any personal happiness. Interesting. Also pretty unbelievable that someone that ill could work the hours that Boxer does. Aside from that, I felt the story was weak and I agree with another reviewer that the ending left you wondering who was the character in Chapter 17. So many chapters, maybe this one was suppose to be edited out and it wasn't. Makes no sense. I think Mr. Patterson needs to slow down and return to his original crafy, page turning ways and not become a novel mill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good fast-paced read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I'm not crazy about the Alex Cross series, but I liked these women. The ending was a surprise, and I was never bored during this story. I highly recommend it, and look forward to reading more about these ladies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and poorly researched","review":"I love murder mysteries. If you do too, skip this one. The plot was painfully predictable. The supposed fatal illness \\"Nigli's apastic anemia\\" that the main character has does not exist. I'm an RN and have worked with bone marrow transplant patients for 23 years. To have the chief detective of a serial murder investigation be newly diagnosed with a fatal hematologic illness, not tell her superiors and continue in her position is preposterous and would be unethical in the real world. That this condition is \\"treated\\" (and evenually \\"cured\\"!) with blood transfusions is ridiculous.I had similar reactions to the woman's group. No depth, unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't put it down","review":"Its been a while since I had a good book to read..Very captivating and so many twists! Good read!

A \\"grabber\\" that never lets go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work!","review":"Although the plot is engaging, with one decent twist at the end (the other \\"twist\\" was obvious), the characters were very underdeveloped. I like to walk away from a book still thinking about the characters and, in this one, I didn't even get to know them! Overall, I felt like I was reading the outline of a book and not the 'fleshed-out' version I would expect. It felt like the author was under pressure to deliver a book to his publisher and did not take the time to make this what could have been a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear James:","review":"I do for the most part like your books. I have read every one and like the best the Cross books. Your last book was ok but I would like to point out on page 257, I have never heard of a renfield 30-30. The only companies who made a 30-30 are Winchester and Marlin. What is a Remington 40.5? There is no gun of that caliber, and it's not even a caliber. Also there is no such gun as a {Glock Special 1990 issue.} There is a Glock 17, 19 and so on. Farther on in the book you write that Lindsay takes the safety off of her revolver, Revolvers don't have safeties.All in all you books are good but you need to do a little research on firearms, 10 minutes on the Internet and you could have everything you ever wanted to know about the subject. There are a lot of people who would read your books if you could get the firearm aspect right."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st to Die","review":"Definitely not as good as his others.

Women who have reached positions of authority in police ranks, the DA's office and Coroner's office would not work outside of their chains of authority in what amounts to a teenage after school club! The characters were one dimensonal and unbelievable. The plot was predictable to anyone who has read many thrillers. I found it to be a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st Nail In the Coffin for Crime Fiction","review":"This book came so highly recommended that I was eager to begin reading it. The book starts off with promising introductions to the heroine and villain, but quickly dissolves into a canned murder plot that is best left for low-budget Hollywood films. I'm not sure if the time-line for the plot was thought out, but most police officers don't solve murders in four weeks, especially while undergoing blood transfusions, but Patterson doesn't seem to be too worried about authenticity with this one. Furthermore, his characterization of women is horrendous. This book illustrates a point all authors should follow - only write what you know. Patterson is not a woman and therefore should stop trying to pretend he knows what it's like to be one.In short, I had expected this to be a knock out. What I got was proof that good crime fiction is dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is unforgettable","review":"so many books are forgotten days after you read them.

I was suprised .I was on the plane trapped with this book. I have never read such a copied mystery. Please do not try to copy Cornwell on the medical examiner, and please James do not use the words looky-loo in your next books because with things like that in your books you can barely put together a complex sentance. It started out with the murder on the 13th floor htan it was on the 30th. You ened a new editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Fist to Die was a big disappointment compared to Kiss the Girls. I thought the dialogue was poor and a bit cheesy (for lack of better word). It got to the point where I didn't care who the killer was.

My opinion, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicks as Dics","review":"Patterson sets a great pace with 3-4 page chapters.

I would also advise Mr. Patterson to never write about female protagonists, as he does not understand women at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising and Ironic- An Exciting Plot","review":"First to Die is a novel that keeps you guessing until the very end.

She and her three friends, all prominant women in the area, form a club to investigate the crimes outside the police department. The evidence is eventually brought together, with the help of the women's club, after many twists and turns. It's full of every emotion: confusion, hope, love, and determination. Plus, a shocker for a conclusion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not his best!!","review":"I think this book was okay. Has some entertainment value, but I think it could have been better. It kept my interest, but mainly because I had to see how it would end. I think his best writing was \\"Along Came A Spider.\\" That said, I'll still read what he brings out next, because most of the time I'm glued to his pages, and he entertains more that he disappoints. If this is the beginning of a new series featuring \\"The Murder Club\\", it will probably only get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expletive overload...","review":"Today I stopped listening to this audio book for three reasons. First, expletive overload. I'm not naive enough to think that cops don't swear (my brother was one), I just don't want to hear it or read it in every other diaglogue. Second, horrible reader. Third, murder nausea. Can't people just be murdered in a novel anymore without all the perversion added in? It makes me wonder about the mind of the author. Give me a clean or semi-clean mystery that has even a mild aroma of good writing. This was my first James Patterson novel and probably my last.

Everything is about Lindsay Boxer a homicide detective solving the murder cases of newlyweds with a few of her friends. Together they each help and eventually they all help each other and solve the cases. The book keeps you wanting to find out what is going to happens next. Each chapter will keep you jumping to the next and not put the book down. Lindsay and her friends aren't finished when the book is over. The woman's murder club lives on in three more books to follow. Lindsay and her friends still solve cases and each book will take you back in Lindsay's shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than disappointing","review":"I've read a lot of Patterson's books and, although I don't find him to be the best of mystery writers, his plots are usually engrossing. Actually this one has a \\"good\\" murder story, but the rest of it was extremely disappointing. I never found a good reason for these women to spend time with one another. I thought a really good detective could do the same thing, only better. Additionally, I saw no purpose bringing a life-threatening disease to the story (and then a miraculous recovery); it was an impediment. Thus, I'm off of Patterson for a good while, and I won't ever waste time reading another \\"women's murder club\\" mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read in a long time!","review":"This book is an enormous pile of fetid excrement! A completely unbelievable story. If you like reading Harlequin Romance novels than you might not mind the incredibly treacly \\"romantic\\" subplot. But even if you can put that aside you'd have to really suspend all disbelief to swallow the premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"The plot twists are ridiculous and cheap. Flat and unbelievable characters. The females are portrayed as embarrassing stereotypes; over-emotional - a lot weeping and bonding. Apart from having a juvenile's concept of women in general, apparently James Patterson also lacks a basic understanding of the science of forensics or police methodology. Not good for a crime novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generic plot, yet still a good read","review":"This plot is similar to most of the contemporary mystery/suspense/thriller/ good for Lifetime stories. The book starts out a little tough and uninteresting, with the graphic killing of a pair of newlyweds. The character development is slow and cliche, but overall somewaht effective. The middle of the book picks up some steam and the middle to towards the end is the best part. The very last part could have been left out in my opinion. It is an exciting read overall and will keep you turning the pages once you're in the thick of it. Recommended for fans of this type of story, but not for literary buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"First is first rate","review":"Have you ever read a mystery thinking you are one step ahead of the author, thinking you were smarter than the average reader who was buying the conventional wisdom that our heroine was onto? Have you ever read such a story, only to discover the author was actually a chessmaster, several steps ahead of you? If not, you must try out this outstanding book. Patterson leads you through a more or less conventional mystery, but then spirals you into a twisted set of plot turns that will leave your head spinning. The book is fast paced and very easy to read. Definitely a first rate effort. It reads like a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"3 stars is kind, 2 might be too cynical. This is a quick, semi-interesting read - a little too simplistic and implausible.

This book is definitely not up some of his previous books, nor does it stand with any of the other great mystery writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a promising start to a new series","review":"The premise to this book sounded interesting but Patterson does not write well enough to convince you about the villain, the heros or the plot.

Patterson makes you care about his Detectives as they play out the life and death they face in a race against time. Just when I thought I had it figured out -WRONG AGAIN AND AGAIN.

Or, possibly, border collies in America are very different from the breed we have here in Scotland. Border collies are fairly large dogs and I would really like to see one perch on somebody's lap looking out to the bay... makes for a very, very funny picture! Next, does Mr Patterson know that border collies are working dogs and keeping one in a flat is absolutely ridiculous and amounts to animal cruelty? And if the heroine of the books indeed keeps her collie in a flat, then it is highly likely that when she returns from work, the collie will have taken the flat apart from sheer boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"The lead in book to this series was great!

Treat yourself to The Womens Murder Club, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the WORST book I ever read!","review":"I cannot believe they released this terrible piece of garbage. The only reason I finished it (unabridged audiobook) was because I was on the road in the middle of nowhere. I should have listened to static. Everytime I thought this book couldn't get any worse, I was dead wrong. The book is poorly written, the plot is transparent, the characters are a joke, and the dialogue is so ridiculous that I'm lead to think this book was written by a gifted 8 year-old. What were they thinking? I'm actually very angry about this. I listen to DOZENS of books on tape each year, and this is the first time I've written any kind of review. Patterson has no respect for himself or his readers, or he wouldn't have released this piece of utter GARBAGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"First novel or deadline+lousy editor?","review":"This book is a fine example of what happens to authors to 'make it' as recognized names. First, they can publish their first attempts, which were too lousy to publish then and still are.Second, their editors push them to put out more books, and quality goes to hell.This is a simply terrible book: the writing is poor, the characters weak and the plot is so think as to be laughable.This could not be published by anyone except a well-known author. The fact that it was says a lot about the modern publishing industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This book was unbelivable!! There were so many twists and turns that I couldn't believe what I was reading! This book isn't one of those books that follow the pattern of most suspense/mystery books. The end is what shocked me the most. I hated the ending because it is not what I wanted, but it was all for the better. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to try something sinfully good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked this book, however on thing ruined it for me","review":"I found this book enjoyable enough. It was quick paced and mostly kept me guessing. However, one \\"clue\\" was so ludicrous that the entire book was ruined. Without giving anything away, I would just like to tell Mr. Patterson that \\"boys\\" can most definitely \\"get them\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe so many people liked this book.","review":"I picked up this book for a quick, enjoyable suspense read. Unfortunately, the book only annoyed me. There are many male authors out there who do a decent job writing from a woman's perspective. Patterson is NOT one of them. He took every stereotype of a woman and combined them to create these four women. It was extremely disappointing that the main character was supposed to be a strong, female lead was so stupid that her bright ideas constantly \\"surprised\\" everyone, including her. The plot was very predictable, the characters were not fleshed out, and the storyline was boring. This was the first Patterson book I've read...it will probably be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retelling of movie \\"Basic Instinct\\"","review":"This super-cumbersome plot is, like most cheap devices, designed to fool you and then come back at you with a \\"surprise\\" ending. There was not surprise for me, only the endurance test of reading through these one-dimensional, over-written characters as they stumble toward a conclusion. Nothing was particularly compelling and while it read easily, the total lack of challenge made it very boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A die-hard Alex Cross fan expands her scope","review":"I have long been a fan of James Patterson's Alex Cross Mysteries. I like Mr. Patterson's style of writing, as well as the depth to which he explores his characters. I was not disappointed with this foray into a female lead in San Francisco.I was up late at night to read this, early in the morning to find out what was going to happen next... it was great. Only a few disappointments, but overall a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner !!","review":"This is the first book I have read by James Patterson and I loved it. You go girls!! This book keep my attention up to the very last sentence. I have ordered 3 more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patterson Shines in \\"1st to Die\\"","review":"I am not a book \\"reviewer\\" so this will be short and unpretentious. I am a recent fan of John Patterson and have read only four of his previous books. I found \\"1st to Die\\" to be an elequent page turner and the best I have yet read of his works. Tightly suspenseful, superb characters and the twist and turns of his plot kept me awake deep into the night reading then being almost saddened to leave the characters once I had finished the book. I would highly recommend this book to all who enjoy a fast paced mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Thriller","review":"A serial killer who preys on newlyweds is the target of homicide inspector, Lindsay Boxer--who teams with three resourceful women friends--a medical examiner, an assistant DA and the reporter covering the murder spree--for help in piecing the odious puzzle together. Fast paced and laced with tension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I loved this book. It moved along so quickly that I read it in three days. Of course, that may be because I found it hard to put down. I'm looking foward to reading another of James Patterson's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out, Alex! You have competition!","review":"Through the eyes of Inspector Lindsay Boxer, Patterson has created a fast-paced and emotional tale that grabs you from the first page and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Complimented by a murder plot which is both sinister and complex, the reader is drawn into the Women's Murder Club and its four unique and intriguing members. With more twists and turns than a mountain pass, this book will keep you guessing, and make you cringe, cry, laugh, and cheer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PATTERSON'S FORMULA IS TIRED","review":"Any fan of the more recent Alex Cross novels in the series will recognize this as a cluttered attempt to use the same tired recurring themes from Patterson's Cross novels with a new cast of characters. Should have skipped the attempt at literature and just gone straight for the movie script. Let's see how bad Hollywood miscasts THIS leading character (i.e., Morgan Freeman could be Alex Cross' grandfather.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at his best","review":"I was looking for a good thriller/mystery. What I got was an easy read better suited to a quick trip to the beach. I enjoyed the story although it was a no-thinker. I guess what I didn't care for was the double-spaced, PICA type with 2\\" margins top and bottom. I would have liked the pages filled with more story. I was able to breeze through this book in one day. Better to wait for the... paperback...to come out later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson Going Soft","review":"I remember being thrilled by Patterson's earlier, hard-hitting, suspenseful novels. In \\"1st To Die,\\" we witness the four female protagonists frequently getting together to discuss their ailments, relationships, lonliness, and oh yes, how to catch a killer! This book made me feel like I was watching \\"Oprah\\" in book form.I couldn't help but think that Patterson's agent and publisher have reminded him that most mysteries are written by women, for women - and so he has decided to write like a woman. I think that from now on I will stick writers like George Pelecanos and Dennis Lehane."},{"rating":"2","title":". . . kept me gripped . . . !","review":"One reviewer of this book claims that \\"newcomers to his work will be enthralled.\\" And so I was . . . !Set in San Francisco, this book has more twist and turns than Lombard Street itself. The four women at the centre of the Women's Murder Club, each have their own vested interest in the recent spate of serial killings, and in trapping the 'animal' behind them.This book has the typical romance and personal tragedies but my only criticism would be that Patterson doesn't go far enough into his characters - something I'm sure he puts right in the second book in this series, 2nd Chance.I can't wait to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner","review":"I have read many of James Patterson's books. After being disappointed with \\"Cradle and All\\", I got \\"re-hooked\\" as a James Paterson fan with \\"1st to Die\\". 1st to Die is great for anyone wanting a quick read that grabs your attention and keeps it there. I read it while on vacation while trying to unwind from a complicated life - so it fit the bill perfectly.Hope his heroine and the \\"murder club\\" will be featured in future books"},{"rating":"2","title":"1st to Die","review":"All the charactors seem to be so real and likeable or not so likeable. The book just flows and you can't wait to get back to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st to die","review":"Great book can't wait to read all the other (women's murder club). James Patterson is such a great author love his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st one ever read","review":"I love all of Patterson's books. Wish i could get all of them. He writes so much it's hard to keep up. Saw the movie first and liked it so decided to get his book and LOVED it."},{"rating":"2","title":"1ST to Die","review":"it is an excellent book...easy read ....hoping the others will be as good....have started the secon one so we will see....1ST TO DIE"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was in very poor shape, not good shape as described","review":"This book was in very poor shape, not good shape as described. I've bought many used books and when they are described as good shape, they've come that way. The last two times I've bought used books they were not as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Patterson","review":"James Patterson is a great writer. Easy to read. Keeps the action constantly moving. I find it hard to put down his books. I never can wait to start the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"relate","review":"I could make myself fit into the book! Totally fit into the book - can't wait to order the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read the next one!!!","review":"This was a great book with a captivating plotline that had be hooked from chapter 1. James Patterson is a genius!!! I've been reading his books since I was little ^^"},{"rating":"2","title":"A companion on a trip","review":"I'm a college student that rarely read novels on my free time. But I was glad that I chose this book on my summer vacation. I was looking at a 12 hour flight but luckily I had this book to keep me company. 1st to Die, by James Patterson, is a fast pace novel that got me hooked into the story. At times I didn't want to put the book down. It's about a murderer preying on newlyweds. It's a must read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starting my vacation out on the edge...","review":"Read this on a plane on my way to vacation. Let's just say my vacation didn't start out very relaxed after reading this book! True to form, Patterson kept me on the edge of my seat. I really loved his characters and can't wait to read more about the murder club."},{"rating":"2","title":"kept me interested....","review":"This book was a little slow @ first, it took some time to get interesting. Once it got going it was ok. I could see this one on film. The ending was pretty dead though. I was looking for something with a little more excitement..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master does it again","review":"I definately consider James Patterson to be the Master of Suspense. I have not read anything of his that has disappointed me. 1st To Die was a fabulous read. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a book they want to hook them from the first page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"I found this book very groovy. Its nice to have a change of pace, a strong leading FEMALE character. The friendships between these ladies is warm and there input and perspectives, nice touch. The book is filled clues that made me want to go the back of the book ( I Didn't )What a great ending. I read it in one day, and couldn't wait to run out and buy 2nd Chance. James is such a GREAT writer, he may speed through at times but he keeps up the thrills."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st to Die","review":"It was a very good book and I received it when they said I would get it but the price on the book was 8.00 dollars and I was charges 24.50 for it as I came from another vender other than the one who said they would send it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I JUST COULDN'T GET INTO TO THIS BOOK","review":"I READ THE 3RD BOOK BEFORE I EVER KNEW IT WAS A SERIES. TODAY, I HAVE TRIED TO READ THIS ONE BUT JUST COULDN'T GET INTO IT.SO, I SCANNED IT.I HAVE THE 2ND CHANCE TO YET READ BUT I WILL WAIT AWHILE.ACTUALLY, I THINK I'LL STICK WITH PATTERSON'S NON SERIES BOOKS. I LOVED BEACH HOUSE AND LAKE HOUSE SO MAYBE IT IS THE SERIES. IN THE ALEX CROSS BOOKS, I DON'T LIKE THE WAY HE SKIPS AROUND WITH THE CHAPTERS SO I AM HAVING TO QUIT THAT SERIES.AREN'T WE GLAD THAT DIFFERENT WRITERS WRITE BOOKS????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson Projects Himself","review":"We can only see what we are is a theory of quantum physics.Therefore when James Patterson makes his serial killer a vegetarianand his detective a ribs eater, he is projecting his own guiltat being the serial killer of animals, at being the payer ofthe hitmen at the slaughterhouse.In actuality, violence is correlated so strongly to the murderat the slaughterhouse and the consumption of cadavers thatin the 19th Century, butchers were not allowed to sit on Britishjuries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not publisher' size of book edition","review":"I collect James Patterson novels, especially the ones featuring the Women's Murder Club. I order the first two books in this series (I have al the others)...you cannot possibly imagine my disappointment when the books arrived (separately) and they were the size and print that are used in book clubs. The are considerably smaller, print smears...I will not return them but will donate them to local libray. If an individual is selling a book or other collectible they need to notify the buyer that it is NOT the publisers size copy. I was truly disappointed and it gives me pause when I consider ordering from Amazon again. Also, the books did cost any less that the full-sized edition. Sincerely, fiona Eide"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"I started off by reading 3rd Degree it was so great that I couldn't wait to read the first book in the series. I was anxious to know how the girls got together. That was the only disappointment of the book. I love this series, because just when you think you have it all figured out,........think again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A man in the mind of 4 women.","review":"This book was wonderful. It's actually the firsrt JP book that i've read all the way through and I loved it! I had started to read Violets Are Blue until I found out that the Mastermind is revealed and there are many more Alex Cross books... Anyway, It's SO amazing to me that this man can put himself inside of a woman's mind and portray such nasty and depressing things and make you feel like you're stuck right in the middle of it with no way out. GO MR. PATTERSON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I have read most of Mr. Patterson's works and this is one of his finest. I read the entire book in one day because I just couldn't put it down. I find his style refreshing. I had not expected the ending and was fascinated by the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star as a \\"Book\\", 3 Stars as a \\"Genre Book\\"","review":"I read this book as an attempt to broaden my horizons as a casual reader - never much for mysteries - and I wound up wanting to put it down 1/2 way through.Like other reviewers, I found the characters to be fairly thin confections, and the plot to be overly twisty. But my biggest problem is simply that the Author \\"cheats\\". By that I mean that instead of simple misdirection, sections of the book are written that, in light of later developments, simply \\"aren't true\\".I guess I'm used to straightforward books where you read what is before you, and can more or less trust it. But when you read something that is abruptly twisted later on, or ignored, or given an almost unbelievable interpretation to make the plot creak along, well, my \\"suspension of disbelief\\" flies right out the window.The last chapter of the book was just too much. Ugh. I may try another mystery, but not in this series, and perhaps, not ever again one by Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncharacteristically lame Patterson book","review":"James Patterson is capable of much more than this book delivers. It definatly sounds like a Patterson novel, with the requesite style and character development. The mystery is good, as is most of the plot. However, the \\"women's murder club\\" idea sounds like a shameless plea to the Lifetime Network for a movie deal. I cringed with every page about Detective Boxer's personal problems and just about couldn't make it through the scenes about her murder club meetings.Skip this series and go read an Alex Cross Patterson novel instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for the Movie, but One Off for the Ending of the Book.","review":"Everytime the film version of this James Patterson book is run on cable TV, I just love to sit and watch the entire 4-hour adventure. Tracey Pollan, did a great job as police office Lindsay Boxer, and the movie was very fast-paced without getting as detailed as Patterson's book.Well, I have finally read the book, and am eternally grateful they left certain details of the crime scenes out of the movie, because they were pretty disgusting. I would also like to say, as another reviewer pointed out, that the ending wasn't too good, but the movie did it a favor. Now, why couldn't Patterson have thought of that version himself? Still, a really good crime thriller with lots of great twists and turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! Can't wait to read the next one!","review":"Love James Patterson, love the Alex Cross series of books. Can't wait to start the next one in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best","review":"This story has amazing twists and turns that will prevent you from putting this book down. Strangely the epilogue is the most twisted part of the story and is the true ending of the story. The characters are also verly likeable and well-developed throughout the entire story. I must say if you have not read James Patterson yet to definetely start with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thriller","review":"This was my first experience of a James Patterson novel and have to say it definitely won't be my last. Will enjoy reading the rest of the books in the series too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down!","review":"This was my first reading of James Patterson. I read for nearly 14 straight hours, I just couldn't stop reading. The action and criminal details kept me riveted. This book was absolutely the best read I've ever had. I bought a Kindle Fire and will be buying all his books for it.Try the first books, you'll be hooked, guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"caught my attention","review":"i like a book that gets me involved and keeps me wanting more. this book did just that. the charater development is deep and always helps me want to know what happens to them. i would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting mystery","review":"I've read several other James Patterson novels but this is my first in the Women's Murder Club series. The many twists and turns made it a fast-paced page-turner. I really enjoyed getting to know the members of the Murder Club 'personally' through Patterson's unique talent for character development. I'm looking forward to continuing this series. Bottom line: This is a very entertaining, suspense-filled mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"So many twists and turns had you guessing right to the end. Well worth reading. Can\`t wait to read book two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Lindsay is tough and I like that.Can't wait to start the next book.These girls cannot be stopped."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO glad i started this series....","review":"I love the characters in the book. I feel like i know them after just reading the first one. I usually can figure out how it's going to end, but one aspect of this ending TOTALLY SURPRISED ME!!! I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but i definitely didn't see it coming and now i'm totally hooked on the series...can't wait to read them all. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Characters","review":"I thought I would miss Alex Cross (which I did a little) The characters in this book are very \\"likable\\". I thought the interaction of the characters to support the story was excellent. I can't wait for the next book with these characters.The story was very well done and when I thought I had it figured out the next chapter changed my thought on the Who did it. This book like all his books is very well written and keeps the reader interested. A very fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st To Die","review":"Finally Demille has found a new character! Not that I didn't like Alex Cross but I was beginning to wish that Soneji would come back from the dead and get his revenge! Lindsay Boxer is a great new character with lots of room for development. The story grips you from the beginning, in typical Patterson style, and leads you down the road of suspicion and then you find that you're wrong on the who-done-it scale. Parts of the storyline are very predictable but you finish the book in record time feeling satisfied. I've read all the previous series' and this promises to be the best so far. A must read for a long plane ride or a weekend at the beach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great by Patterson!","review":"Thank-you ... James Patterson, for all your novels. When I get any of your books I am pleased, and entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder club","review":"This was a great read and kept you in suspense till the end.

Good read! The back and forth between personal and the case was well balanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st to Finish This Book Can Move On to Real Book","review":"I thought this might be a good and entertaining series to start reading. Boy, was I wrong. All the characters and thier backgrounds come straight from central casting. Not at all original. I was bored to tears and only happy when I was finished. I wonder what number Patterson will stop this torture at?? 7th To Kill Themselves After Reading a Women's Murder Club Book. 8th Person to Waste Time On This Dribble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast read","review":"It was good. Like all of his books it was a fast read (I love the big fonts). Interesting and kept me engaged. Planning on reading his next one this week (2nd Chance)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick, sick, sick!","review":"Not at all up to typical James Patterson quality. I overlooked the sick, sick, sick sexual aspect of the murders, but the twists and turns near the end -- without any logical explanation as to how they could possibly have happened -- did me in. I'm so sorry I wasted my time on this one -- and am at a loss as to why so many people liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed","review":"It was okay but a little too contrived. It gave me the impression that Patterson sat around and wrote a bunch of flash cards and said, \\"I'll go this direction, add this twist, then this twist\\" and then he filled in the space in between with filler material. In the process he creates this woman's group that would be preposterous I suspect in the real world. Then when he finished his book he sat back and said... \\"One more twist! Viola. I created a masterpiece.\\" Only his coup de gras looked like it was written as an afterthought and looked like it was written in 30 minutes. The real coup de gras should have been his published mailing this one back.The question now is do I want to try another Patterson novel. Answer: Yes. But if it's as lame as 1st to Die, I'll go back to Michael Connelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st to die","review":"got hooked on it right-a-way. After reading number 2 thru 9, each one getting more exciting, am half way thru #10 now. Can't wait for #11 to come out. Love the characters"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"First to Die\\"","review":"Another fine work of James Patterson. My husband read it before I did and assured me it was an excellent read. I can always tell when he is really enjoying a book. If it is one he truly likes he picks it up at every opportunity to read as much as he can in short time frames. He is already looking for another Women's Murder Club book. Excellent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st To Die - try it you'll like it!","review":"Fun book. Quick reading, interesting, and a few surprises. Just what I was looking for at the time. Always like Patterson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book's popularity shows the public's bad taste","review":"After seeing this authors books listed on the best seller's list for quite a while, I finally decided to read this one. What a disapointment. I would have expected the plot of this book to appear in one of the tabloids, it is that bad. A best selling novelist kills married couples on their first night in their hotel rooms after the wedding ceremonies and then sexually abuses the dead brides. This killer also abuses his several spouses. The author also creates a policewoman with a terminal illness and the secondary plot of her battle with her ailment which adds little to the storyline while she strives to solve this absurd tale of a serial murderer. The prose is very simplistic. I have difficulty trying to understand what possible entertainment or merit readers'can find in this work. If you have not read this book yet, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Attempt","review":"Patterson has not lived up to his typical high quality thriller. First of all, I find it odd that Patterson has attempted to write in the first person narritive of a woman. The gender-cross never seems to work out right. Then, this book has taken a decidedly different attitude to his other books, being that it is a light mystery that I would never have thought would be something he would write. Another complaint that I have is the way that the prologue and epilogue did not really fit with the rest of the book. After this I will be thinking twice about buying any more books from this new series that is being created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of ideas...","review":"There are some writters who only have so many good books in them. James Patterson is a prime example of such an author. Boring is the best I can say about this book. I was hoping that with a new cast of characters Mr. Patterson would come back as a strong storyteller, but was sadly disappointed. Any book that runs over 400 pages and can be read in less than three hours must suffer from severe lack of depth or childish prose. This book can proudly claim both.As a long time reader I keep picking up his books and believing I will find another gem like Along Came A Spider or Jack and Jill.This is NOT it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rarely Have I Been This Angry at an Author","review":"The book starts out promising...you like the main characters and wonder where it is going. Then you get to 3/4 of the way through --1. Did the author forget about the scenes he wrote about the killer in the beginning? (his end just does not fit and was directly contradictory to the chapters he wrote in the beginning)2. Did he find a likeable male lead just didn't fit the mold of the \\"Women's Murder Club\\"? That must be the case because he killed off a likeable main character with no reason or advancement to the plot.Rarely have I read a book where it was so obvious that the author was having trouble making his deadline. It's a shame because the promise of an excellent book was there. Hence, the only thing I felt at the end of this book was anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real mystery is Patterson's popularity","review":"OK... having said that, truth is I got hooked on Patterson a few books back when I realized how much I liked the detective he'd created, Alex Cross. But after several books with cartoon-character villains and ridiculous dialogue by his too-precious daughter, not to mention writing sorely lacking in description and procedure, I felt duped. Nevertheless, I decided to pick up the latest paperback and was stunned that such thin characters and another cartoonish villain was managing to be another bestseller. The \\"women's murder club\\" made me think of Nancy Drew and the idea that professional woman would gather that way, let alone dub themselves something that insipid, is beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelievability. Having been a crime reporter for a daily newspaper for many years, I know a little bit about what truly is ridiculous in crime fiction, and Patterson is at the top of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted plot","review":"James Patterson does a great job in engaging the reader in a novel that brings shivers down ur spine. Nothing in this book is how it appears to be. You assume that youve figured everything out at the very end you find out you were wrong. Great quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TRUE MYSTERY","review":"HOW DID MR.PATTERSON EVER MAKE THE GRADE? WHY DID I BUY THIS BOOK?I FEEL FOOLISH AND VICTIMIZED."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THE ALEX CROSS NOVELS!","review":"\\"1st To Die\\" is the first in a new series from James Patterson. The characters are phenomenal, the plot is intriguing, and there is fast-paced suspense everywhere. Brides and grooms are getting murdered on their wedding day around the San Francisco area and Inspector Lindsay Boxer is on the case. Lindsey, Claire (the medical examiner), Cindy (an investigative reporter), and Jill (a district attorney), form the Women's Murder Club. Along with their current jobs, they are all on the case of the bride-groom murders. Even though Alex Cross is not in this novel the suspense and action is just as good or better than the novels featuring him. This book is totally worth the money! The ending of this book will shock you totally, just like \\"Roses Are Red\\" did. I can't wait for his next women's mystery novel, \\"2nd Chance\\" to come out next year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I don't even know what to say about this book. I gave it one star because I did finish it to the end, but mostly because I was trying to figure out what led to the appeal of the Womens Murder Mystery Club. This is the first book of theirs and I won't be reading another.Total fluff--I feel like this is chicklit--written by a man about how he believes women talk to each other. maybe some do. Or maybe he read too many romance novels. I found the whole book to be totally unbelievable. The mystery itself was pretty good, but the other characters were not very real."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Alice series is THE BEST!","review":"This book was really good! I enjoy EVERY Alice book! I've read everyone so far, except of course the one that is going to be coming out soon. I recomend this book especially for teen girls! However, compared to the other books, this one was the TINIEST bit less interesting (but its still filled with REALLY funny problems and the great characters). The series is great though, so you should ead EVERY book in it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"It was entertaining but it doesn't compare to the great tried and true young adult series: The Anastasia books by Lois Lowry. Those are humorous and inventive, this seems as if it is a compilation of a lot of young adult books, dealing ineffectually with every problem under the sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moved to tears by this book, a heirloom forever","review":"Alice in Agony is an insperational introduction to the beauty of soap opras. This book requires an ability to read, but no other mental capabilitys. This is definatly fodder for the dog. Bronze this book, don't read it. A fine book for pressing flowers, a door stop, and a fly swatter. Theres is in no plot, no point, or any charactars, but I did like the type and the name of the publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!!!!!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite Alice books she gets her second boyfriend and also grows up phisicly .

It was hilarious when she met the red head boy, with his pant was down. And when she went to the clothing store to pick out some jeans. Not being insecure about you feels great was one of the good morals I learn from this fantastic book. Check out the series of Alice, feel the good and bad of life. Enjoy the adventures with Alice that takes you away from your troubles, also helps you solve them.-Marieta"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this book and intend to buy the whole series.","review":"This book is great for pre-teen girls.

There are entire museums devoted to the latter, and this book offers some insight into artists known to these museums, as well as ordinary people who don't think of themselves as artists. It also shows how people use what's at hand to create articles that are practical or aesthetically pleasing to them (vernacular technology, as the academics call it). And it does this with good humor; anyone who thinks the authors are out to embarrass their subjects isn't reading the book closely. On the contrary, the authors seem to have respect and sometimes admiration for their interviewees' nonconformist way of life. It's not a 'serious\\" book, but it's a worthwhile and amusing look at a part of America that doesn't always receive gentle attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This is the cooki-est and most hilarious book I have read in years. what an eye-opener and a great surprise on trailer trash culture. this book takes on a fantastic journey in a culture that most of us europeans know so little about or have so much disdain for.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"cracker ingenuity","review":"I loved this book.

I am really pleased with this latest set of Two-Step DVD videos from Shawn Trautman. I have several of his previous videos including the Basic Two-Step three DVD set. The first two DVDs of this intermediate level set that I have studied are just awesome. This second DVD in the series covers the cape and wrap patterns that will be the foundation for more patterns. The pattern moves are repeated several times and shown from different angles so that you can see all the subtleties of the different patterns presented. Then there are review and practice chapters on each DVD. And then there is a bonus chapter on each DVD with optional moves that can be added to the patterns presented before. I really feel that now I can go out on the dance floor and look like I know something about this dance. I am looking forward to the release of the remainder of this set of DVDs.

Some talks like \\"The Deathbed Perspective\\" and \\"The Winnipeg Nine\\" make it already worthwile to buy the book. However, for the uninitiated the context is not always easy to grasp. The talks refer to exercises and experiences, which mean nothing or very little if one is not familiar with \\"The school\\" which is at times referred to. I am quite sure that with a better introduction and background of Gold's teachings, the book would be more valuable. I didn't have this key to unlock the essence of some of the talks.

Humans so BAD this invented bear never finds a mate. The prose isn't really that great, unless you're really down with the message. \\"Childrens' environmental literature\\"--- good grief, run a mile. I'm not suprised Nestle picked up the author-- she does write a viewpoint well.Don't get me wrong. We need to be careful with our use of the world and clean up after ourselves.

I mean it doesn't get much better than this little media player. The only thing that I did find negative was the front of the screen. It smudges with finger prints just like the sony psp. I easily fixed that by putting a screen protector over it and problem solved. If you looking for a grate product and works with windows media player then you found it.

If not, expect to run any rendering overnight. The software is much slower than other programs out there for video editing. Also, make sure you've striped your tapes before EVERY record, or else the box will lock-up frequently. Once you've got everything in place, a systematic way to create your projects, and know how to overcome the poorly designed GUI, the box works great!

I was sorely disappointed. Most of the book deals with theory and background, with very little useful info for a martial artist. The only really good piece of info I found in this book is that your fine and complex motor skills degrade as your heart rate increases (such as when you are scared and fighting for your life). There was one chapter on firearms training for urban combat, but that would be more useful to a police tactical team or a military unit rather than a martial artist. A psychology major might find this book interesting reading, but for help on martial arts training, better books would be \\"Fighter's Fact Book\\" by Christensen, \\"Get Tough\\" by Fairbairn, or \\"Complete Krav Maga\\" by Levine and Whitman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lecture for The mind!","review":"I really took this book straight into my heart as a tool for selfeenhancing your mind and abilities!

Horrible!!","review":"Let me be clear, my score of this title is so low because of the horrible remaster job, not the content. The material and record itself is great; one of my favorite Plant records.Honestly, this is one of the worst remaster jobs I've ever heard. They apparently re-eq'd it and I've never heard anything so bright, harsh and shrill. I'm serious, it's like the high-end is cutting through your skull. It is so unbearable that I didn't make it through the whole CD - had to turn it off. This is odd, because the remasters of \\"Pictures at 11\\" Now and Zen\\" and \\"The Honeydrippers\\" sound good to great. Again, I have to ask \\"What happened?\\"Buy this album it's great! But buy the orginal release, still readily available.Your skull will thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, Great concert.","review":"This album came in 1990 which is the year I graduated high school and so therefore may be more sentimental for me than anything but I can't help but love this record. \\"I cried\\" is my favorite cut. A great song with some of the same mystical qualities that made the Zep records timeless. My second favorite track is the last one \\"Watching You\\" Plant opened his show with this song. I was suprised by that but it was awesome. All of that massive percussion in the beginning balanced with the clean strumming acoustic. I love this song as it is one of the best displays of desperation. \\"Should my darkness prevail, or does your memory fail\\" \\"Love on the wing carry my prayer cherish this moment in times of despair.\\" Another highlight was when the entire band picked up acoustic instruments (guitars and mandolins) and played Liars Dance followed by Going to California. I saw the Plant/Page show a few years later but it wasn't near as impressive. Anyway...good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Collection Of Songs But....","review":"There is no doubt that this is a strong collection of songs from the foursome. However, it highlights the fact that Avalon's record company, Sparrow, does not always release the group's best material. Consequently, songs such as 'By Heart, By Soul' and 'Love Remains' (from the album 'Oxygen') and 'First Love' (from 'In A Different Light')are not included here. That said, the specially recorded tracks 'New Day' and ' Everything To Me', showcase the group at their best, thankfully avoiding the dance orientated sound that dogged their O2 Remix album of last year. With Janna and Jody both releasing solo albums in 2002, this compilation surely opens the door for longstanding member, Michael Passons, who is a driving force behind Avalon's unique sound, to release his own material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Pop with Terrific Vocals","review":"I admit, I am picky about what Christian music I enjoy - so much of it is mired in amateurish production. But I had heard so much about this group for so long, I had to try out their Best Of CD. I'm so glad I did - this is a group of terrific singers with great songwriting and production teams behind them. The key to their sound, to me, is the amazing voice of tenor Jody McBrayer. His passionate reading of \\"Don't Save It All For Christmas Day\\" is one of the most glorious performances I've ever heard. Other favorites are \\"In Not Of,\\" \\"Testify To Love\\" and \\"Can't Live A Day,\\" but there are great songs throughout.

It's a harried, boring composition that wishes it were as delicately delicious as Hanae Mori Butterfly or Dior Hypnotic Poison but fails to come close to either; trying to please everyone by being mediocre.It is a highly forgettable gourmand/floriental that does not linger in one's memory nor draw comments the way an Angel or Flowerbomb would. If you want to be special, buy an *original* fruity gourmand (i.e. Lolita Lempicka, Coco Mademoiselle, Hanae Mori). If you want to be \\"me too\\", then get Pleasures Delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on","review":"To be blunt, this book is one of the most ridiculous and sorry literary efforts I have ever had the misfortune to read. I obtained a copy long before they were out of stock ( u snooze u lose, people) and was horrified by its stupidity. It has virtually nothing to do with the videogame DOOM or the action and mayhem that made this game (and the first two novels) so popular. I'm sorry, but if I want a novel about DOOM it means I want to read about monsters and guns and combat, not ludicrous aliens named Sears and Roebuck and a wacky space adventure that makes \\"Spaceballs\\" seem as intelligent as Shakespeare. Don't get the wrong idea, either, because I do not want you to think this book is \\"so bad it's good.\\" It is actually so bad it's nauseating, and my advice to any DOOM fan is to read the first two books and make up your own ending.

It is probably the worst one in the series (the others were better, but this one isn't bad by any means), but it is a good book anyways. The beginning part in Hawaii, the return to Phobos, and the scientists' naming of the enemies (they actually used the real creatures' names) made this book worth the moolah to buy it, or just to complete the series. Overall good but not the best of the four."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.","review":"This book loses all the first two had to offer, and fills the void with...nothing. It isn't funny, or scary, or has meaningful violence...it's just a filler to set the stage for book 4.

In what ultimately becomes one very very dark comic novel, Bedford sends his main character back to school - but this time HE is the teacher. His life has amounted to nothing and who else is there to blame but those who were supposed to prepare him for it? _Acts of Revision_ is the ultimate revenge novel.

That's all I'll say about the plot, but I remember liking the drawings and the anti-war ending.

If supposed fact, there are several glaring errors here. The film only mentions two shots, which in my humble opinion is worse than the Warren commission. This negates a lot of evidence which even the Warren Commission found.....and we know they are right....right? Second, the final scene with the \\"Assassin\\" bears but slight relation to reality, although the blood spatter on the wall is nice, he doesn't bleed after hitting the ground.If fiction then the film is very poorly made, even for an \\"independant\\" film.

It got pretty vicious out there. In space, you can hear ray guns go ZZZZT!!! Vacuum or not.

While their names would probably appear more than others in nearly any book dealing with this subject manner, the way in which the author expands on his own research while briefly summarizing that of other psychologists.In addition, this book address the concern of culture-centric practices on other cultures.

His style was caricatured by Claudio Arrau in conversations with Joseph Horowitz. Arrau dismissed Sauer as a salon player, a darling of frivolous Vienna. But Josef Hofmann (also disparaged by Arrau) gave a truer estimate, calling Sauer \\"a truly great virtuoso.\\" Although Sauer downplayed his association with Liszt, we hear on this disc of live performances -- even more than in his commercial recordings released by Marston -- Lisztian breadth and nobility, and also the refusal to take oneself too seriously, the hallmark of a gentleman. Sauer preferred Anton Rubinstein to Clara Schumann, and when listening to Sauer -- still at his best so late in life -- one suspects that Robert Schumann might have agreed. A must for all music lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sauerstoff","review":"The great Arbiter label has, once again, produced something pianophiles ignore at their peril. Sauer, along with D'Albert, was perhaps the greatest of Liszt's pupils to make records. Here, the Schumann Concerto is given the full late Romantic treatment, and I could not be more pleased. Sauer's tone production is deep and lovely; even his wrong notes are full of feeling. As usual, Sauer's tempi are relaxed, but his timing is perfect. Collectors will already own Marston's set of Sauer's commercial recordings. This live performance will only confirm the impression that Sauer was one of the greatest of Liszt's acolytes. If you like to hear the piano played in a civilized and gentlemanly manner, full of feeling, without kitsch, technically capable, singing.... please buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"First you have to get it open!","review":"I have not been able to even try out this pooduct because no one can get the battery door open.

The first one was defective--the FM band indicator was off by 5 MHz or so, and the TV bands didn't work. The replacement model I was given is also defective--again, the TV bands don't work. Also, the cell phone charger only charges while you crank the crank--no battery power stored will charge your phone, a serious defect. In an emergency, you could call if you continuously cranked during your call, but there is no spring like some other crank radios, which effectively store your cranking for long periods of time.

The weather stations could be pulled in with lots of static, but FM and TV channel reception were impossible. The receiver so lacks sensitivity that two local FM stations totally overwhelmed reception from all other stations, both on the FM and TV channel bands. AM worked okay. The manual that comes with the radio says that you'll probably have to crank the hand charger for 10-15 minutes to get a cell phone charge sufficient for a one minute phone call. And that's basically a dismissive guess on their part. Thus, this feature seems pretty useless. I was unhappy enough with this product to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eton Red Cross Emergency Radio","review":"This radio is poorly built.

The OFF selection for the radio and light are located in the middle of the dial selection and are misaligned so that it's unintuitive how to turn them off.

At times I would purchase an episode as an reward if he reached a goal. One take away was the story had one of the ninjas realize he was not intended to be the supreme \\"green\\" ninja, but instead his path was to give of himself to protect the would be green ninja. I thought this was a nice lesson on how to give of yourself for the benefit others. Action packed and fun for my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously? Who wants to teach their children to call women \\"Hot\\"?","review":"I have to admit my kids loved the first episode which is all I allowed them to watch. Most of it was okay, but there was one part where one of the characters is talking about rescuing his sister and his friend says, \\"Is she hot?\\" Seriously? Not the kind of values I want to teach my sons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite for my grandson","review":"This sure beats trying to record all the episodes on the DVR!

My 5 and 6-year-old sons are glued. They can't get enough. It's action-packed, but \\"clean;\\" no blood, no realistic violence, no bad language... all the things that all-too-often plague boys' \\"entertainment\\" these days. There are good messages of teamwork and doing good, too. There is no rooting for the bad guys here. I highly recommend this DVD for those with little guys. I've pre-ordered Season 2 already. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The product was ok, my son liked it. interesting story , little bit complicated for young kids but still very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sons love Ninjago","review":"This is an excellent addition for any ninjago lover.

He enjoyed the first movie so he asked for this DVD of Season 1 the TV series. According to him, it's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, and entertaining for boys AND girls","review":"The Lego folks have hit it out of the park with this fun series based on their new series of Ninja toys. There are fun references in the shows for adults to laugh at, but the stories appeal to children also. In fact both my four year old daughter and my eight year old son are in love with Spinjitsu and act out stories set in the world during play time. Few series can cross the age and gender divides so easily, making this one a must have for our family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Travelling is awesome","review":"This is a really awesome album. I saw Oakenfold do a set with many songs off of this album in Houston."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travelling through commercial songs instedad of originality!","review":"I must say that when i bought this album i thought it was going to be one of my favorites. I adore \\"Another World\\" the mixing was great and the selection of songs one of a kind typical of a king of trance. Travelling disapponited me very much. For a man that started the whole movement of raves and techno music, he has become so commercial and simple nothing new, nothing enticing. The mixing is good, of course he is a great DJ after all but the music does not give you the vibes and the feeling that other albums give you, like Digweed LA or the sort. At the end of the album i was wondering if it was really Oakenfold maybe he hire someone to chose the traks I do not know but I really think he has so much potential and this particular album does not give him the credit he deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dancing and peaceful listening","review":"I bought this CD after recently buying Swordfish. After listening to it I realised how bad Swordfish really was compared to this. This is so peaceful but uplifting. The songs are quite progressive which I like. The best tracks would have to be Timo Maas's Ubik and Bunker's Decent. Really good breakbeats and trancy tunes. However I think the Bullet in the Gun song stops it from getting 5 stars. It is totally out of place and just sounds stupid. I love this CD and I love Oakey. I want to buy Resident when I get $82 Australian dollars!! I can't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with one complaint","review":"Great album. Very good track selection...that's what I'd say about \\"another world\\" too. What would possess Oakey to put that many of the same songs on two \\"different\\" albums? Seaman wouldn't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"Lots of these reviews talk about Paul Oakenfold doing something special or something uninspiring on this album but I wouldn't be surprised if Paul doesn't mix these albums at all, rather having an engineer do it in a piece of software called ProTools. I don't want to come off as some sort of electronic-music snob--I thought Paul Oakenfold was the greatest at a point, too--but there're a lot of better trance albums out there, both in track selection and mixing. Without delving into any sort of underground, you can pick up Paul van Dyk's \\"The Politics of Dancing\\" and be much happier. Or, if you insist on something that sounds like Paul Oakenfold, save yourself ten dollars and buy the latest \\"Ultimate Trance\\" CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed","review":"I picked this gem up on a trip to London recently. It's probably not Oakie at his best but definitely worth the buy. You'll find a remixed Sarah Mclachlan and Dj Tiesto with a bit more kick, some yummy over sampled Utah Saints, Oakenfold is once again leading us down the path of electronic music towards his enlightenment. Moving the listeners more towards mellower progressive sounds. Over all I liked this album. I was disappointed at first but that Utah Saints song makes me want to listen to it again and again. I only wished when I was in London I had picked up their new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"greatest hits\\"?","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this disc. Although Oakenfold is an undisputed master of electronic music, this collection felt like it was produced on auto-pilot. If you have any other Oakenfold mixes, you are sure to already have many of these tracks. If you're new to electronic music, this might be a nice intro. But if you've got much of it already, you will probably find you've heard this all before, and in much more inspiring ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mixing","review":"If you're not convinced yet whether he's the best in the world, this CD will help you make the determination. Great mixes, quite a few of them are original, transitions are awesome. I saw him twice in Michigan including the absolutely phenomenal performance at the area 1 concert and this CD, together with memories of his mixes from live shows, just makes you want to blast those speakers while driving down the open roads.CD 2 - Song # 4 which starts with \\"you are listening to perfecto radio\\" is one of the best. So is \\"bullet in the gun.\\" A must have if you are a trance fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"HE CANT MIX!!!!","review":"i cant wait till sasha comes out with a new cd.this cd was absolutely awful.terrible mixing,unoriginal track selection.even i would be embarrassed to release something this terrible.save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travelling [IMPORT]","review":"Just a short review.I bought this from a high street record store and haven't stopped playing it since. Both CD's are equally as good as each other so you never know which to play. It's a typical Oakey style with trancey music as well as chilledish sort of stuff. it's makes great music to put on in the background, if your going out, basically anytinme really!Anyway, I thoroughly recommend that if you're interested in Oakey, you buy this CD, It's absolutely kickin'"},{"rating":"2","title":"All good, but CD2 makes it worth the purchase...","review":"One thing I've always admired about Oakenfold is his inability (so far in my experience) to include poor music in his work. \\"Travelling\\" is a perfect example. It, like other mix CD's of his, aren't always groundbreaking, but they are certainly good purchases. CD1 is the usual just-plain-good Oakey stuff, with darker themed music and a relative lack of fast-dance trance. CD2, however, is an absolute gem. He keeps the dark themes, but makes a much livelier mix. Darker, Gyromancer, Over Emotion, Flesh, Diamondblack, Sunrise, Silence...all are top notch. In the end, think of CD1 as his warmup, and the read deal coming on CD2. You won't be disappointed. A solid album from a living legend, Oakenfold always manages to impress."},{"rating":"2","title":"The, \\"Thriller\\"","review":"I have a lot of Oakenfold, but this is the big one for me; this is the, \\"Thriller,\\" of my Oakenfold collection. I can't get enough of this album. The first six months I had it I couldn't stop playing it and had to force myself to play other stuff.It is one year later and I still can't just play part of it. Once it's on, I'm hooked. \\"Travelling,\\" is the perfect name for this album. He warms you up in fits and starts, then, the minute you hear the first of, \\"Cry to Dream,\\" it's time to fasten your seat belt as you get blasted into the stratosphere. He keeps you high at that level right through the second disc. Bravo, guy! Six stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hidden Treasure","review":"I consider St Louis De Montfort's book to be a hidden treasure that begs to be discovered. I have prayed the Rosary nearly all my life but I did not truly understand it until now.

What a book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product had a chemical smell and taste","review":"In the past I have ordered this brand and type of nipples for my son. He only uses these. When I ordered them this time however, they came with a strong chemical odor and taste. I boiled them, ran them through the dishwasher and the odor and taste remained. I am not sure what happened with this batch of nipples but I had to throw them out. I am ordering from another company hoping that it was the seller and not the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"not right for me","review":"These are very small nipples. Also very oily when they arrived. I assumed they were the larger brown ones that I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similar to the disposable nipples used at the hospital","review":"My breastfed daughter refused bottles for what felt like the longest time (about 2.5 months before she finally took them), and this was the only nipple she was willing to eat with. I had tried probably 8 different nipples before we settled on this one. These nipples were very similar to the disposable ones that were used at the hospital. They fit standard-size rings and bottle openings. They were very oily when we first got them; but I was able to get them completely cleaned by first boiling them for about 5 min and then washing them w/ hot soapy water."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT slow flow - these are medium flow","review":"I'm sure these nipples work fine for older babies, but the title \\"first essentials\\" led me to believe that they are slow flow. In fact, the packaging clearly indicates that they are medium flow nipples designed for older babies.If you're looking for latex nipples for older babies, they're probably fine. But they are NOT a good solution for my newborn. I wish amazon would update the description to include \\"medium flow\\" in the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Para Ti Mi Historia cd","review":"Sorry to say never recevied CD, was looking foward in receiving it, it was a present for one of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took awhile!","review":"I selected a 4 star rating only because it took me longer to get into the plot. Typically a David Baldacci read is engaging from the first page so therefor I was surprised at the pace of this one. But once I connected (about half way through the book) I really cared what happened to the characters and I was absolutely thrilled with the ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"I'm a big fan of David Baldacci's suspense stories.

I hope he writes alot more along these same lines!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look at culture shock!","review":"This is one of the best books I have read recently, I could not put it down. What a wonderful clean read that could be enjoyed by anyone. The book emphasizes the cultural differences between city and country and does it with grace and respect for those who do not have modern conveniences but still have a strong spirit, determination and true grit. A perfect gift for the holidays for anyone who enjoys a good story with remarkable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wishing You Well","review":"What a pleasant surprise! I have read most of David Balducci's books and have enjoyed them. As a true mystery/suspense fan, I was reluctant to try his latest effort since it seemed to be quite a change in both subject and style. I am pleased to report that this author has been able to pull it off. While not a riveting story, the characters give us a flavor of the life and times of the early 1940's. Characters bring many warm memories to mind even though the readers' individual experiences may have been quite different. And, in these days and times, a happy ending is a real morale booster and treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"laughed and cried","review":"I loved this book and grew to know the characters so well that they became friends of mine. It took me back to my Missourian childhood and grandparents and summer days plus happiness and sadness. It tells us of when times were more family oriented and our country was more united, in a way what we have lost we would love to have back, I feel. Was truly a marvelous story written by a really great story teller and one I shall remember forever---Thank you Mr Baldacci------"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable!","review":"Not your average Baldacci--talk about changing horses! But it works beautifully. Set in Virginia, this novel brings to mind other books (think McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood or Kidd's Secret Life of Bees). And the writing is as good as those books. The characters in Wish you Well are very well developed and at times the novel seems larger than life. Whether or not you're a Baldacci fan, you'll love this fun, entertaining, wonderfully-written novel.Also recommended: Secret life of Bees and Bark of the Dogwood"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it...","review":"A friend recommended this book to me, knowing that I love to read books that evoke nostalgic feelings and that I absolutely love the Appalachian area. Unfortunately, this book, though I tried to love it, was not as good as I wished it would have been.The story is formulaic, with plot twists a reader knows are coming long before they do. I knew what the ending would be long before I got to it. And the reviewer who likened Jimmy to Huckleberry Finn without as much humor took the words right out of my mouth.If you want to read a book about Appalachia that will truly move you, read \\"Christy\\" by Catherine Marshall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic and Real","review":"Although my Mom has been encouraging me to read David Baldacci for a while, this is the first of his books I have read. I could not put it down. I grew up in a time just as the world was becoming much more fast-paced. My favorite memories are those of the times I spent with my Granny enjoying the \\"simple\\" things of life. I also learned some of the ways of survival in the rural areas. This novel took me back to those days and reminded me so much of my Granny. It was a novel that touched my heart. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I was expecting something on the lines of his absolute power. But it certainly dissappoints as there is no plot at all.it is the story of a girl who moves from newyork to a downtown area, and how her life changes and how she adapts to it.a very diappointing book from a great writer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet images but little depth","review":"Baldacci's intentions were good, and being a native of Southwest Virginia, I can relate to his emotion about his homeplace and his need to write nostalgically about it. However, the book is overly sentimental, entirely predictable, and thin. In his departure from thrillers to attempt more substantive material, I believe Baldacci over-extended himself with Wish You Well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at the Virginia Mountains","review":"Baldacci has changed his writing style for \\"Wish you Well\\". I must say that I purchased the book with doubt. I have read every book that he has written, and reading what this one was about, I thought it would be boring and dull. His published works have had mystery and violence, but never giving a clue to the answers until the last chapter. This undertaking has a wonderful, gentle style, that reviews the hardships and problems of life in the Virginia mountains in the era portrayed. It has the drawing power from page to page, to find what happens next in the life of the characters. The character of \\"Diamond\\", revealed intellegence, whimsy, fun and survival skills that came from knowledge beyond \\"book learning.\\" One chapter lead to another to discover if our characters could the hardness of life in the mountains. I believe it is a book for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Predictable","review":"I have never read Baldacci before, and I don't plan to read him again. I was forced to read this sappy, pat story because it was my book clubs book of the month. Lou, the little girl in the story is twelve years old, and I believe Baldacci was confused by this too often. He wrote her thoughts, and contemplations as though she were a very old, very wise adult. So much of this book was the author's dribble. He tried much too hard to describe the sceneries, and left too much lacking in his characters. His characters were way too predictable. I think he may even have copied some of them from other stories, Huck Finn perhaps. Don't waste your time, or your money reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"We all knew Amanda was going to wake up in the last chapter.","review":"Hello David Baldacci, what happened to character development!!?! To begin with, it seems as if a lot of authors seem to get entirely too caught up with surroundings, that they seem to forget about the characters.I read this book for my senior A.P. Literature class and I wanted to throw it out the window after the first 50 pages. Has anyone other than myself noticed that David Baldacci writes novels parallel to how I wrote descriptive essays in the third grade?!This novel stars a twelve-year-old girl named Lou and her brother Oz... and I knew that from the beginning. Yet, throughout the book I wondered if Baldacci forgot what it was like to be twelve. Most adults in their late 30s aren't even on the level of thinking that \\"Lou\\" is.Overall, the story is meant to play off of human emotions. In today's society, anything that people can relate to or pity, they love.Thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish you Well","review":"I really enjoyed the book. It was an easy read and a great story. I truly grew to love the characters and wanted a happy ending for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multilevel Back to the Basics","review":"Wish You Well is an engrossing story with strong characters evoking strong emotions in the reader. Set in Virginia mountain country, Wish You Well shows fascinating, simple ways to be in tune with the land and your neighbors, to make a living and a life, and to just plain survive the brutalities of wild mountains and weather and hateful neighbors. Author David Baldacci also takes the reader back to the basics of good and evil; human motivations don't get much more primal than they are in this story. Considering its laid-back, rural setting, this book contains plenty of action ~ relational, emotional, political, physical. It's the \\"many dangers, toils, and snares\\" of the song \\"Amazing Grace.\\" In song and novel, love and grace triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Wonderful","review":"This is a wonderful story. It had me crying and laughing.. It was a completely departure from his other books. I truly enjoyed every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Christmas Story","review":"Delightful, but predictable story. I felt I really knew these characters. Very heart-warming, and now I want to see the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was quite disappointed with this book. I enjoy Baldacci's thrillers and was extremely let down when I read this book. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. This book reminded me of the Oprah book club pick Gap Creek, which I read but did not really care for. Usually a Baldacci book takes me 2-3 days to read and I can't put it down. This book took me 2-3 weeks to read and I finished it only to say that I had finished it and I have never left a book unfinished."},{"rating":"2","title":"WISH YOU WELL","review":"LOVED THIS BOOK. I AM A NATIVE VIRGINIAN AND IT TOOK ME BACK IN TIME AND SPACE. LOVED HIS CHARACTERS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE VIRGINIA MOUNTAIN COUNTRY. HIS STYLE OF WRITING IS EXCITING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story.....Can't wait to see the movie also","review":"Wish You Well was a great story. Filled with both tradgedy and funny events, I both laughed and cried. It takes you back to a period of time long forgotten when children learned the world they know from their surroundings and not sitting in front of a computer or tv. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Have read all of Baldacci's books. I'm a fan of his suspensful novels, and am surprised and disappointed to find him straying so far off from what got him there. Seemed like a simplistic story to me, rather than the intrigue that he's so good at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"Yes, this is not Baldacci's usual high suspense mystery -- but it is equally well written! I really enjoy a book that gets me totally wrapped up in the characters. This is one of the few books I've recently read in which the characters have lived on in my memory long after I finished the book. In our hectic society, it is refreshing to read a book that talks about living life with \\"strength of character.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"a \\"can't put down\\" book","review":"David Baldacci has written a book that touches the emotions of its readers. The characters are so real and you become so wrapped up in their lives. Little OZ made me chuckle out loud several times, he is so precious. And Lou, what a charmer! Of course, there were some tears, laughter and joy. If you want a book that will absolutely give you pleasure reading it, then don't pass this one up. Thank you Mr. Baldacci!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avid reader in Alaska","review":"Though a complete departure from Baldacci's suspense style this is a wonderful story, beautifully told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Me Up When It's Over","review":"After reading the previous 67 reviews of Baldacci's Wish You Well, I am amazed and intrigued that people can have such varied opinions. I purchased this book after a store clerk compared it to Nicholas Spark's Notebook. I think not! This is a simple, predictable beyond words story, that I had difficulty completing. Imagine watching a made for TV movie, sleeping through 3/4's of it, and waking up only to discover you didn't miss anything at all....that's what reading Wish You Well was for me. Are you sure Baldacci wrote this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This will not be a popular review -- I don't like this book!","review":"I'm disappointed -- the reviews had led me to expect something outstanding. Instead, I found the plot improbable and the writing uneven. My first \\"gripe\\" came with the depictions of the children -- has the author ever SEEN or BEEN CLOSE to a child? Then, when the children are heading up to their great-grandmother's, the description of the mountain scenery and culture is definitely beautiful and compelling . . . but he talks about things that only an adult (and an adult familiar, for example, with architecture) could know -- while it is supposed to be seen through the eyes of a 12 year-old-girl. It gets worse, but I'll leave this to others to describe. Many people say they enjoy this book, so it's probably worth buying so you can form your own opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baldacci novel set to become a classic","review":"What a wonderful book! I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days. The characters are vivid; the setting is poetic yet realistically portrayed. The only flaw is the somewhat hokey ending. HOwever, this is destined to become a classic like Catcher in the Rye. I hope it's made into a movie with Vanessa Redgrave playing Louisa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring-nothing to it.....","review":"Did not like this book....Certainly nothing like his previous books, but I found nothing good about this one....I don't get all the good reviews, but I guess someone always likes something.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balducci","review":"I have purchased from Amazon and enjoyed Balducci for some time as a writer of suspense; Wish You Well was a emotional involvement of a totally different nature. The life of a country person, let alone one of the moutains, is incredibly different concerning its characters and motivation. As much as I enjoy his usual genre, Wish You Well, opened a door into the past filled with not just adversity, but hope and effort that reminds a great number of Americans of where they once came from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish You Well","review":"Very different than most David Balducci books, but a great story of what is was like to grow up without modern conveniences and having to depend on resourcefulness to survive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish You Well","review":"I found the contents not to be as thrilling/adventurous, not a great plot as his other books.

He really painted a phenominal picture in my mind's eye of what this mining town and surrounding area looked like. Thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Departure from usual, but excellent nonetheless","review":"I have read all of Baldacci's books (Absolute Power, Total Control, The Winner, The Simple Truth, and Saving Grace, as far as I can remember), and they hold a place of honor on my bookshelves. Wish You Well is a major tangent from his \\"normal\\" genre, but it grabs you from the first page and wraps you so tightly into the characters and plot that you don't want to put it down. I don't normally like \\"sappy\\" books, but this really isn't one. I shed many tears, though, and could not put the book down. It is gripping, sad, exciting, heartwarming, and triumphant all in one package. I look forward to his next book, be it suspense or another like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused schlock!","review":"This book is wrought with pain and suffering as the reader struggles to keep it in hand when overwhelmed with the desisre to pitch it across the room. \\"Wish You well\\" was my first Baldacci read and, had it not been my book club's pick I would have never read it.It is so blatantly stolen from Harper Lee, Mark Twain and Shirely Temple movies. It is trite, corny and down-right unreadable. The characters lack authenticity; their dialogiues forced and artificle. The plot is worse than predictable- it is annoyingly unimaginative and sachrine. I am shocked that this book ever got published and even more surprised that the editors allowed their names to be published in the book's's finale. I would have definitely remained anonomous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book, Mediocre Narration","review":"See the reviews section the actual book Wish You Well for my review of the content.The narrator of Wish You Well, apparently, has never been to Appalachia. Her Appalachia accent is appalling and inconsistent, and sounds more like its from Louisiana. Occasionally she forgets which character she is doing (at one point, she uses her voice for a 12 year old girl when she is supposed to be doing a grown man)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author should stick to mysteries.","review":"This book is about as far as you can get from Baldacci's other works. I found the story very slow moving.The narrator is a sure cure for insomina. I will never again listen to anything she reads.The ending of this book is so unrealistic that it defies any possible logic. Yet the way the story was written, this ending was telegraphed about one quarter into the book.Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up - please","review":"I slept throught this book. It was like rocking in a hammock on a warm summer day, with just a slight breeze and your eyelids grow heavy and the book slides off and falls to the ground -- and that is where I left it. What a snoozer. If you like gentle stories, with rich backgrounds of daily living this is it.

Different from anything I have ever read and I certanily love this story. David Baldacci writes vety well. I picked this book and didn't think it would be that good, but when I actuly read it, I liked it. The only bad comment I have to say is that to much people die(just my opinion, of course). It has a happy ending, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY SUPERB","review":"I will spare another recap of this book's plot & cut right to the chase. This book is superb! This is my third Baldacci novel, and I am hooked. I'm not an expert on literature, but I read a whole lot of books, about 3-4 per week. I read this one in two nights, I just couldn't put it down. The characters are fantastic, the imagery is poetic, and the plot is subtle but driving. There is no \\"slow part\\" in this book. If you consider yourself a person of depth, you will love every page of this novel. Of all the novels I've read from various genres, this is definitely one of my top five favorites. Read it & enjoy...it will leave you with a very satisfied smile & a nice warm feeling inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull dull dull","review":"As far as I'm aware Mr Baldacci has only written one non-thriller and on reading this I can see why. It is a boring and predictable story which was 200 pages too long"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish You Well","review":"The story in this book had many interesting details about subsistance living in the Appalachin mountains in the late 1930's and early 1940's. The writing was excellent thus being very enjoyable to read. The story line was very good except for the improbable ending. If you enjoy books about families working a difficult farm life and seeing the merits of their life, you should enjoy this book. It is a departure from this author's usual genre (mystery-suspense), as is John Grisham's book, The Painted House, which I also thoughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart warming novel","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. He described a vivid picture of the virginia mountains and the characters..well that's where he lacked something. Lou was supposed to be a twelve-year-old girl but she thinks like an adult. On the first hundred pages of the book, I found myself getting bored but when you go on that's when you'll really appreciate the book. It made laugh and cry at the same time. The ending was kind of predictable, yes, we all know Amanda will wake up but we don't know that Louisa Mae would be out of the picture. well, all in all, the book's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish You Well","review":"After a tragic car accident kills their father and leaves their mother in a comatose state, Lou and Oz Cardinal, are left in the care of their paternal great-grandmother, Louisa, in the back hills of Virginia. The young children's world changes dramatically as they are moved to a place they have never been, to live with a woman they have never before known. They are filled with doubt and fear of what will happen next. Will their mother ever recover? Will they find joy and happiness once again? Will they ever get over the tragedy of their beloved father's death?This book was very descriptive and well-written. It captivated my attention from beginning to end. Although very tragic at times, it was punctuated with humor. Mr. Baldacci brought the characters to life and truly engaged my emotion. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different Baldacci","review":"I'm not a huge Baldacci fan, but I've read few books and this one is just stunningly beautiful. Baldacci paints a vivid and heart tugging picture of life in the Virginia Mountains for two young nearly orphaned children. The writting is poetic and beautiful and will send your heart through a roller coaster of emotions despite the Hollywood ending. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci Bombs","review":"I should be a Baldaccci expert since I've read them all. This was the worst. The first part of the book drags. The reader expects \\"page turners.\\" I was turning in hopes of an interesting plot developing. Mom's in a coma and oh please don't tell us she's going to wake up when the day needs saving! But that day is so terribly implausible. What was the geologist doing hanging around the court so he could spill the beans? How could Hugh Miller think that natural gas in a pipeline would ruin the environment like logging and coal? Wasn't he suppose to be a smart lawyer? David, go back to suspense where you excel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I have read all of Baldacci's books and they were all terrific. This one however leaves a lot to be desired. Is he trying to get on Oprah's book club? The characters are not even interesting. I can't belive that I read the whole book but I did because I kept searching for a plot that never happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit dry, but pleasant enough.","review":"Though I would not race right out and buy this book, perhaps you could borrow it, as it IS an easy-paced, well-written story. Lou and Oz are orphaned at ages 12 and 8, their father has died in a car wreck, their mother is hopelessly comatose. They have no family except a great grandmother, Lou's namesake, living in the Appalachian Mountains. She is thrilled to take them in, but Lou and Oz must adapt from a New York City lifestyle to that of mountain folk, whose chores are endless, and where nothing you need is ever store-bought. Lou harbors a deep resentment of her comatose mother, blames her, in fact, for her father's death, whereas 8 year old Oz adores his mother, and believes with childlike faith that with enough attention and love, his mother will get better. There are a couple of side conflicts to entertain you, but not much excitement. Even if it doesn't keep you up at night, it will occupy a few lazy summer afternoons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its All Good..","review":"The Voice on the CD for this book is awesome. She really makes this book interesting to me. Hope you enjoy it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci's Worst","review":"Bakdacci would probably say this is his most personal book. Well, one man's personal is another man's self indulgent.He kind of redeemed himself with the court scene latre in the book, but then went and blew it right at the very end.One of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune to read. And most certainly Baldacci's worst!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good ending","review":"Good at spots, but a not so good ending. I am annoyed by books were people do stupid things, and both the kids and the lawyer seemed to loose IQ at the book limped to a close. Not as good as his others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of book","review":"Baldacci is my kind of writer but this is not my kind of book. I've read nearly all of his books and thoroughly enjoy his writing but this one was just boring. Maybe well written but not enough to it. If you've read the reviews and the publisher's write-up above, you know the whole book so read one of his others, they're great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullsville","review":"Baldacci tries something different and fails. His first three novels are super but this one, in my opinion, just does not work. Your reading time can be spend better elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic","review":"I am a Baldacci fan and did not get what I expected when I got the book but am not disapointed. I grew up during the depression and although in a different part of the country, can easily relate to the story. Times were tough but the will of the people saw us through. The book tells a warm story and is an excellent read for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillbillies R Us","review":"Reactions to Wish You Well will depend, in large part, on the reader's tolerance level for \\"hillbilly\\" dialect. Page after page of sentences teeming with double negatives and \\"ain't this, cain't that\\" is not everyone's idea of a good read. Worse, Baldacci's characters are one-dimensional, straight out of central \\"mountain people\\" casting. The scenes suffer from a stunning lack of originality and depict situations that have been sentimentalized and \\"Waltonized\\" in many, many other works before Baldacci. For example, Lou and Oz's first day at the one-room schoolhouse starts off with the local boys taunting them for Yankees, and ends with Lou giving them a whollop--thus earning the instant respect and admiration of their tormentors. Ho hum. The book rarely rises above that kind of middle-school level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Read This Year","review":"Never having been a fan of David Baldacci's courtroom/suspense books, I picked up Wish You Well on a whim. There is only one word to describe this incredible read---lovely. I felt as though I were living there on the farm with all of those very likable and believable characters. Would I ever love a sequel---how about it, Mr. Baldacci?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book on tape, great for a long drive","review":"I have not read or listened to any of David Baldacci's books before. My wife and I listened to \\"Wish You Well\\" during a drive from Georgia to North Carolina and back. We both enjoyed the storyline and descriptions of the Virginia mountains in the early 1940's. The main characters were quite endearing and the evil ones were easy to dislike. An example would be the humerous exchange with the character Eugene during the court battle. I almost had to pull the car over. I was laughing so hard my eyes were tearing making it difficult to see.Maybe it was the narrator, maybe it was the author, but I am inclined to read more of this writers works. I would even consider listening to another audio book of his while taking another long trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprise Package","review":"Having read and enjoyed all the other David Baldacci's books I was pleasantly surprised to realise he has such hidden depth's to his writing skills. I enjoy \\"thrillers\\" and would not have chosen this book if it was not for the author. A wonderful, touching story with many twist's and turns. Highly suggest you read it.Wish You Well"},{"rating":"2","title":"slow start.... but try to put it down!","review":"When I first started this I wondered if I was going to finish it.. then once into it I did not want to put it down... and basically did not... I can't keep reading a book every two days... nothing else gets done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish You Well Book","review":"The book is a good read. The reason for the interest in the book was a television movie was made in our town (fall 2012)and the surrounding area and I wanted to read the book before the movie was released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"I read one of the reviews on this page and thought I was in English Lit. class. I read a book because I think I will enjoy it's content, characters, and theme not because I wish to critique it. This is one of the best stories I have read (or heard because I listened to the unabridged version). It was superb. The narrator had the southern drawl to her voice that made it more interesting. I belive that Mr. Baldacci had exactly the right amount of character and setting development. You could actally picture the characters and the mountains of Virginia. I hope he writes another novel along the same genre as this. It was truly a pleasure to listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down to earth and heart warming","review":"I'm definitely a crime fiction fan but I did enjoy this story or hope and discovery. Maybe the ending was predictable but who cares - its just a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything But The Girl - Blame","review":"Who's to blame for BLAME? Everything But the Girl, of course, and on this single, there's no end of fingers to point. J Majik, who also produced the moody original, takes a harder stance with his \\"VIP Mix,\\" cutting up and filtering the vocals. Grooverider takes the horn from the original and lets it coast over the top in his thumping mix. But Fabio's mix really shines here, at turns atmospheric and melancholy. There's certainly enough blame here to go around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Mystery? Not so much","review":"The fact that this book was part of a series was hard to escape. Reading it gave me the distinct impression that I was missing something - like all the other books in the series which would have (hopefully) given me a better picture of who the main players were. The style was formulaic, the ending was predictable and the situations were right out of Diagnosis Murder or Murder She Wrote - with nuns. I found myself skimming most of it. Skip this for something with a little more substance. You won't remember the book after you finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's sublime","review":"I don't think I'm a talented enough wordsmith to describe this album in a few lines and do it justice. Just buy it... now... it was incredibly ahead of its time in 1989 (with songs written as far back as 1978), and there is still nothing to compare to it.And be sure to give it a chance... I didn't care for it the first time through. That was a while ago. Now it's probably the most important piece of music I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why, oh why, only one album by this artist?","review":"\\"To Cry About\\" is one of my favourate songs, EVER. This album is for people who appreciate someone who can sing. Mary Margaret is the polar opposite to x-factor and all the other rubbish the music industry is up to these days to try to flog any old tripe. It's time to sit down Mary and pull another rabbit out of your magical hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike anything you've heard before...","review":"I own the original 1988 version of this CD (bought from a guy named Roman who ran an underground record store in the ruins of a grand hotel, but that's another story). This album defies description; not quite jazz, definitely not rock, elements of country and blues, with MMOH's amazing voice carrying the whole thing forward. The first bass notes of \\"Anew Day\\" always bring me joy, as do the closing lines of \\"You Will Be Loved Again\\" (check out Cowboy Junkies' cover): the tension of \\"Not Be Alright\\" and \\"My Friends Have\\", the longing of \\"Dear Darling\\" and \\"Help Me Lift You Up\\", the cynicism of \\"Year in Song\\"... Oh, just buy the CD and listen! You will soon see why this album is still on my MP3 player nearly 20 years after I first heard it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains one truly awfull song","review":"Intersting that all reviewers want to dish out the 5 stars here. Im a fan of this artist and her singing is so unique and beautiful you will want to cry. In Tornoto, she is a treat to hear live. The production here is good, and some tracks are excellent. Actually her singing is amazing and rivals and/or exceeds many of the top Divas in music...But! ...A New Day is one of the worst songs I have ever heard...repetitious, unrelenting, horrifying, I sometimes put this track on repeat and wait until somebody screams. How did that track ever end up here. Takes two stars off the album, leaving it with 1. If you are into the worst songs ever, if you are into unlistenable music...'A New Day' is a masterpiece of cheese. CD worthy of a collection for the right and wrong reasons. See also 'The Henry's' and check out her sister (I think)actress Catherine Ohara."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long time fan writes...","review":"I bought this album in '88 and immediately fell in love. The songs are beautifully written and arranged, the musicians are insightful and edgy, and Mary Margaret O'Hara is wonderful. In the early '90's, MMO'H played a gig in London and it remains the weirdest gig I've ever been to, some very weird people shouting \\"rubbish\\" and an annoying photographer who started having a go at me, and the pair of us nearly going outside for a bit of argy-bargy!? MMO'H writhed and shook, the band clanged, boomed and steamed and I had one of the best nights of my life. Like Billie Holiday or Tom Waits, MMO'H is a true original and Miss America is a masterpiece. What more can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"This album makes me so happy, and finding it on CD makes me ecstatic! I ran out and bought this tape upon its original release after seeing her perform on David Sanborn's now defunct late-night music show (Night Music?). I was spellbound by her performance, and the album was a revelation. Thank goodness it's finally out on CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lonely Lovely Voice","review":"Too bad this is Miss O'Hara's only album. She has a very singular voice. Most of the songs shine: in particular \\"Help Me Lift You Up\\", \\"Dear Darling\\", \\"Keeping You In My Mind\\" and the fantastic \\"You Will Be Loved Again\\", sang sweetly and accompanied by only an upright bass. My only complaint is that the more rock-flavored tunes have a bit of the 80s keyboard influence, a bit overproduced and a touch malnourished, but they hold up surprisingly well. Oh yes, and I didn't find \\"A New Day\\" as bad as another reviewer states. It's a bit goofy, but in this crazy world, everyone could use a bit more goofy. A singular album from a singular voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real gem","review":"If you're looking for pictures, or to copy someone elses work, this isn't the book for you. However, if you want really good information and practical guides that work, this is the one. It gives a lot of history and information on the \\"old\\" ways.

Accordingly, Earth, Vol. 1 features a broad range of material. Paul Hunter's Poets of Thought project contributes much of the variety, including two hip-hop tracks and the Latin soul-jazz flavor of \\"Samba with JC.\\" Other highlights include the debut of Pablo (\\"Do What You Gotta Do\\"), Doc Scott's \\"Tokyo Dawn\\" and Bukem's \\"Moodswings.\\" What outlines the outstanding music of this compilation is Bukem's sense of conscious artistic vision -- each track is described, analyzed and given purpose, amplifying the impact of the album. Exactly what we've come to expect of LTJ: another must have compilation featureing a mix of moody, blendy, atmospheric, but nonethless progressive d'n'b/jungle tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the","review":"These guys dont know the difference between 1 and 4.

Coincidentally the lead singer's last name is Neal. James Neal sounds almost exactly like Rob Halford. Godz of Thunder is my favorite track. It sounds like it belongs on British Steel.

The program reduces your anti-depressant by 10% reduction at a time and benzo's 2 1/2% at a time. Anybody who reduces by this amount is likely to have less withdrawls. You dont need to buy a book to tell you that. We all know you cant razor your tablets in that small of a amount. The only way to do this is have a pharmacist compound them for you which changes the structure of the drug and strengh and dosage. Which I also did.

At first, the movie seems to be having a hard time making up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama and the resulting mish mash is a bit unsettling. Still, it was a great cast; Dean Martin was particularly adept at westerns, much more so than Frank Sinatra, who pretty much plays Frank Sinatra in this one. It is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies, in this case, Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress. The bad guys are well represented by Victor Buono and Charles Bronson. A fun movie but not particularly memorable.PS I meant to give this movie three stars but have not been to change the earlier mistaken choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont want a downloaded movie","review":"Very unhappy with this as I was intending to buy the DVD and not just be able to view it online."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mild West","review":"Opening with a slam-bang action sequence, \\"4 for Texas\\" (1963) begins promisingly as Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra enjoy a comic shoot-out in the Old West. Despite the best efforts of director Robert Aldrich and a colorful supporting cast, things go downhill pretty fast. With producer Sinatra calling the lackadaisical shots, the proceedings become relaxed to the point of boredom. Dino loved making Westerns, but Frank never looked convincing in the genre.

Nugent's early guitar work was distinctive, fluid and original, more refined than much of his later stuff. Farmer's songwriting antics were just as original, although his attempts at psychedelic \\"deepness\\" were sometimes hilarious. (And he hasn't changed much, check out his \\"Journey to the Darkside...\\")Nugent claims he didn't know the songs were about drugs... does anyone believe that for a minute?This disc is missing some notable songs, including \\"Surrender To Your Kings\\" and \\"Inside the Outside\\". Also, for no good reason, this version of \\"Prodigal Man\\" has been remixed, with instrumental passages out of their original order.

Some of the tracks might include, Call Of The Wild, Hibernation, though it might be a bit long for some people, and the largely forgotten but classic (especially if you heard it like I did; when Nugent and his crew played in St. Louis)-Papa's Will.

Or maybe just acid. Who knows? But anyone looking for classic Ted Nugent guitar may, and probably will, be disappointed with this album. And, if uncle Ted didn't know it was about taking LSD, he was the most naive sumbitch to ever play rock 'n roll music!

On this collection you get nothing from the excellent Tooth Fang And Claw, or Call Of The Wild period, just prior to Nugent's CBS solo career and superstardom.

Fu Manchu fans will be pleased with this offering - and even first time listeners will be drawn in by the band's energy and maturity.

If you like 70's/Stoner type rock I recommend the whole disc. \\"Squash That Fly\\" is a must have download I recommend for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus Tracks Are Available In The US","review":"For some reason not listed here on Amazon.com, there is a two-disk package with the US release of California Crossing plus the bonus track, which is actually entitled \\"Planet Of The 'Ape Hangers'\\", (ape hangers are customized motorcycle handle bars). You might look for the domestic US package before shelling out so much for an import."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Fu, hello Def Leppard","review":"If you are a fuzz-aholic and enjoy \\"In Search Of..\\", \\"Eatin' Dust\\" and \\"Action\\" etc. then you may be disappointed with the Fu's latest release. The songs are catchy radio rock songs and overall pretty decent. However they lack the all - out jam of Eatin Dust and the great guitar tone of all the other Fu discs. The Fu are obviously thinking radio here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fu Manchu - 'California Crossing' (Mammoth)","review":"Worthy follow-up to 2000's 'King Of The Road' disc.Fu Manchu has apparently road-tested their heavy guitar riffing.Sort of reminds me of early AC/DC,which is a good thing.'California...' appears to be maybe more melodic,that might be because the CD was produced by Matt Hyde(Porno For Pyros,Monster Magnet).Tunes that I liked best are \\"Mongoose\\",\\"Whiz Kid\\",\\"Squash That Fly\\" and the skateboard friendly \\"Downtown To Dogtown\\".'California Crossing' and the band's efforts here after just COULD land them to a wider audience.Let's hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"The editorial review is completely right.","review":"I was disgusted by the poor scholarship in this book. White quotes at will from primary documents and fellow historians without a single citation to show where he got his information. White is also guilty of broad overgeneralizations that are poorly supported. For example, the section on Victorian America includes a paragraph that claims that \\"a healthy society could not survive without the control of instincts\\" (p 4). White then quotes from an Irish \\"orator and parliamentarian, Edmund Burke.\\" No Amerian sources are cited, leaving the reader to assume that what is true in Ireland at that time must also be true in America -- a blurred and unprofessional perspective. This book wasted my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful for classes","review":"Very useful for my sociology classes on sexuality and popular culture. A concise, reasonably thorough, readable,historical survey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Lp had different \\"Doncha' Think It's Time\\"","review":"If you listen to the end of Doncha' Think It's Time, you may notice Elvis sings it differently than on the original Lp version of this collection. That's because on the original Lp, they mistakenly put Take 40 on it instead of the hit single version, which is what you have here. The hit version was a splice of Takes 40, 47 and 48. You can find both versions on Essential Elvis Vol. 3 - Hits Like Never Before."},{"rating":"2","title":"enuff z nuff","review":"This is only good Enuff Z'Nuff album out there and it is off the hook !

It is very easy to turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to go!!","review":"No question about it, definitely the best non powered hand held can opener made. I've gone through numerous powered and non-powered openers in the past. I would also recommend this model for seniors as it is very easy on the hands and requires little effort. It's always a pleasure, especially in this day and age to find a \\"quality\\" product that was manufactured to last!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed book for class","review":"I needed a later edition for this book, but decided to save some money and get this one. I made a good choice because we haven't really even used the book in my class. Even if I don't use it for my class, this book is filled with a lot of great information regarding teaching students with special needs. I will probably refer back to it in the future when I have my own class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard to find movie","review":"I had a copy of a copy of a copy.......you get the picture, a very poor quality one. I liked the movie, and wanted an original copy of it. It is a very hard to find movie, and as far as I know it's not available on DVD. The movie stars Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez playing the sam man in two different time periods of his life. A gripping tale of nuclear testing in the 50s, and how in present day the government couldn't care less about the health problems it caused the men it knowingly sent to their fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"great soundtrack","review":"this is one of the best soundtracks, especially for when this film came out. it has a dark, gritty feel that many movies try to capture, but don't... I've been looking for this soundtrack for years, but it's been out of issue for as long as I can remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadie talks too much!!!","review":"Unfortunately, I tried to like this DVD, but it is hard simply because Sadie just talk too much. She guides you into a pose but does not allow you time to experience the sensations of your body because she just keeps chatting away. The contradictory thing is that she uses all the \\"yoga\\" language but this does not feel like yoga, but rather like a workout. The routine itself is fantastic if your goal is to lose weight, and I guess her intentions are good with all that chatting, but maybe in her next DVD, she could add another option with less instructions for those who want more than a workout. That is, for those seasoned practitioners who just want to go deeper and connect with their body and mind during their yoga session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice deep core work","review":"This is a great DVD, working on more than just the abs, doing some deep core work with the soaz muscle, which I haven't found in other core workouts. It is challenging, and each time I go a bit further (surprising myself the other day as I actually made it into crow pose for a moment!). It's great to be able to do 15, 30, or 45 minutes to fit my schedule. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linkin Park-Reanimation","review":"This CD is a big disapointment to me. This is a bunch of remixed songs from there first cd, that sound terrible! I love the songs the way they were, this makes them sound terrible!

This is one of thoses cds you have to buy no matter what anyone says just to own it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat satisfactory","review":"I have to admit the CD was not exactly what I expected.

This is not the case with <i>Reanimation</i>. The tracks have been remixed by a diverse group of entertainers and promise a mix for all people's preferences.The songs are not exactly the same either. Some of the lyrics have been redone to create a new effect or meaning(s) to the song(s).This is a prime example of a remix album done right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique remix for all who love Linkin Park","review":"Linkin Park brought in other remix artists to \\"spice up\\" there songs and gave them a new edge.

STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT...!!!","review":"Just a remixe of their already ... Hybrid Theory to pump their fans for more cash. This isn't rock, so don't waste your money and make yourslef [money] richer."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This is seriously one of the biggest reasons why this band [is bad]. Look at what they do, they make a cd and then re-mix it. What a stupid way to gain a profit. The saddest thing is; it worked. And the fans. Dear god the die hard fans of Linkin Park are just as bad as the band. You people think this is metal? You are all so blinded by corporate media that you will take anything that's thrown at you as long as it's labeled cool. Get a life. Speak your own mind. Listen to some Iced Earth, that's metal right there. So I am giving you the fair warning; don't buy this cd. You will regret it. Instead buy some Megadeth or Pantera, they destroy Linkin Puke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Re-Mix CD","review":"I was very hesitant to buy this CD when it first came out because I thought an album of remixes can't possibly be good. But I bought this anyway because I am a big LP fan. I was very surprised to find that this CD was f*cking great! I loved Hybrid Thoery, don't get me wrong. But this CD...they went all the hell out remixing these songs! They do not even sound like the same songs on the first album...this isn't even like a remix CD! It's a whole new album. LP did everything they wanted to on this CD. The songs do not sound like your typical remix where they add more bass or take bass out or add a hook featuring some other artist...NO! They reworked everything...more guitar, different lyrics, more drums, more bass...louder. You can definately tell they had fun on this one. This CD definately showcases their many many talents. This is CD to bump in the car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park Comes Through Again","review":"When I first heard about this cd, I thought Linkin Park was destined to fall off the planet. It really takes a lot of balls to take your first studio cd and remix it into your second studio cd. Even more, it takes a lot of talent to make it work.After listening to this cd, I regret ever having doubted LP. They came through with some brilliant collaborations and excellent new beats. This cd really has a techno/rap feel with some remix tweaking...I would definitely recommend picking up this cd, it's destined to go multi-platinum with its quasi-twin, Hybrid Theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Back!!!!!","review":"Linkin Park scores once again with this awesome Cd titled Reanimation. The remixing is awesome with several rap beats to bob your neck with and guitar riffs simalier to hard rock bands. This cd is equally as good or better than Hybrid Theory.It was well worth the wait and new vocal tracks for the words to get stuck in your head again. Chester's voice once again amazes you Mike's rapping skills shine, Mr. Hahns scratching is a big role, Rob continues with great drumming, Brad has new and improved riffs, and Phoenix has great bass playing and also does all the orchestra instruments to show he's multitalented. This cd is great. Take it from me its a record breaker in the making and i am predicting for the second year in a row Linkin Park will have the best selling cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected...","review":"Linkin Park is everything they say they are, they are neither rock nor rap, its a hybrid theory that people still do not understand. If you are into strickly hard core rock or rock then I seriously think you should reconsider this album, if you are open to various sounds, riffs and samples then this is the album for you. The boys at Linkin park did a great job with their first album and on this one, they created a true hybrid theory,,,Good going guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's next? The old songs BACKWARDS? Sounds GREAT!!!","review":"Seriously, their manager better have gotten fired, then flogged, and then sodomized by very very large animals of assorted breeds and sorts. I can just hear him now: \\"Allright guys we forgot to book the studios so we figure your next album's gonna just be a bunch of mixing of your OlD songs. You take that song ook and save it for another day, we're milking this for all it's worth. And get this: meteora is just gonna be all THESE songs but played BACKWARDS! It'll be incredible, we'll drag 12 songs through the mud and get paid for it!\\"Linkin Park: If you haven't done it yet, fire whoever made this decision. Then have him flogged. And then sodomized."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I absolutely love Linkin Park. Before I discovered it, I was absolutely against punk rock. Maybe this CD was why. I loved Hybrid Theory, so I bought Reanimation. All the songs were taken and twisted into almost unrecognizable garbage. Do not buy this CD if you enjoyed Hybrid Theory, because it will ruin it for you. If you want more Linkin Park, buy Meteora, it's really great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Hybrid theory was GREAT. This does it no justice and I cant stand almost EVERY song on the CD. I'm glad I didnt buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled ...","review":"Linkin Park released Hybrid Theory in 2000. Two years later, these hard working musicians manage, not to provide thousands of fans with a new album, but remix the songs from their debut album. No one in the history of music has ever had the balls to indulge themselves this much. Get off it guys! Time to write some new music; people WILL NOT stand for recycled .... This is something a band does after achieving a career's worth of success, which says alot. Time to step it up or fade away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hybrid Theory it's NOT!","review":"I love Linkin Park. Hybrid Theory is by far one of the best albums I've ever listened to in my life, musically and lyrically. So naturally I bought Reanimation becasue I loved Hybrid Theory.BIG MISTAKE.Points of Authority was an exception, but any song that the fellas from LP don't remix are pitifull. LP should have never let rap artist re-mix their songs. They take liberties: add in words, cut out words..ect. The remixers are really re-doing the songs, not re-mixing them. Take \\"In the End\\" for example. In the first few seconds of the song, we hear a rapper telling us that in the beginning, it was just Linkin Park. But then, it was...'Oh SHUT UP!' Quit trying to take the glory for the re-mix! It's so stupid how most mixers just screw up the songs.So if you have Hybrid Theory, keep it. But don't waste your time with this awful album. About 4 good songs isn't worth your time or money. Just wait until the boyz from LP come out with an album that only THEY do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislabeled Linkin Park !!","review":"Got Reanimation Cd for Christmas and I gotta say I was a little surprised when I threw it in the Cd player !I didn't recognize the music but I knew one thing for sure ....It wasn't Linkin Park !!.Put the same Cd into the computer and what to my wondering eyes did appear ???. But a cd cover for a band called Trick Pony and music that made cover my ears !!!The cover and cd are all labeled as Linkin ParkAnyone else have this happen ?I don't know if I should return it or keep it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great band gone HORRIBLE","review":"Let me first say in 2000 Linkin Park was my favorite band now agrhhhhh.... I got to tell you I already bought this cd but it was called Hybrid Theory... Now they just re-released Hybrid Theory and made all the songs sound like the cd is skipping... All the songs sound like ... The originals were great hard rocking songs now they are slowish rap songs that sound like they are skipping... So this whole re-animation thing was not a good idea... Please Linkin Park release a NEW cd that has some NEW songs on it soo so I can still be one of your fans... I fhtere was a choice to choose 0 stars I would.... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IF YOU WANT A LINKIN PARK CD GET HYBRID THEORY... DO NOT BUY THIS CD... BUY HYBRID THEORY AND WAIT FOR THEIR NEXT CD TO COME OUT.... SINCERELY A VERY .... OFF FAN OF LINKIN PARK 14 YEAR OLD...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wky Linkin Park? Why?","review":"How can you top Hybrid Theory? The songs are great, the music new and innovative, and the vocalalists are the best around! Reanimation was disappointing at best. It left me with one buring question -- can I get my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mash up = crap","review":"This is your typical remix album, where a bunch of DJ's take a really good bunch of songs and mix, and mash them up until it sounds like crap. The original songs sounded so great, why mess with that? Also there's a lot of rapping on the album which isn't that great. I'm so tired of R&B; hip hop rap, and there's plenty of it on this album.There's one really good song, \\"My December\\", which is classic Linkin Park. They could have made a whole new album based on this song.When's Linkin Park coming out with a new album?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confused......","review":"I don't get it! So much rap on this CD! Not your normal LinkinPark =(. Get their other CD's, they are much better.*ADDITION* however, if you really like rap, then get this CD, it is full of rap."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece O' S....","review":"what the heck is up with this album? All they did was take the good hybrid theory songs and every other song from singles/import and then they added sound f/x. O yea the CHORUS, 75% of the songs is chorus. and the music video(re animated \\"Pts. Of. Athry.) which comes with the cd is stupid. Its about a alien war thing, Points of Authority isnt about war lol. I do not recomend this to anybody who really liked their first album. they were not original."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD really blows.","review":"I was a huge fan of LP until i heard this. I was really excited about their new CD after I heard crawling and I heard Jon Davis was on the CD too. I'm not a big fan of remixes, but they are usually better than this. Like other people have said, this remix is full of hip-hop/rap ... that really gets on my nerves. I mean, Hybrid Theory does have some hip-hop but it's all mixed in with real rock and makes a beautiful piece of music. But I could not stand listening to any songs on this CD other than Crawling or Run Away. I bought it yesterday and I already plan on returning it. Some people might like this CD, some people might not, but to me, it's not worth the time and especially not the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digusting","review":"Sure this cd is basically a techno rehash of Hybrid theory, but it's definately not worth the money. Do urself a favor and either buy hybrid theory or wait for their new cd that's coming out this fall. They killed some of the greatest songs of all time. The only thing worth listening to is Pts.Of.Athrty(which doesn't stray far from the orginal), Frgt10, Wth>you, and maybe H! Vltg3. These can easily be downloaded from Kazaa and will seriously save u 15 bucks, fosheazy. PC and keep it real."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Remix Album","review":"I like the idea of this album.It has beginning strays away from the point of the song. I don't exactly like the people who made the remixes but they did well. You should buy it if your considering a linkin park collection but don't think theirs enough hip-hop in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"... Boring...","review":"Well, I'm a Linkin Park fan, so I figured I'd be in for a treat when I heard this album... But then I listened to it. Somehow these guest artists manage to take Linkin' Park's best songs, knock the lot of 'em down a few notches in the tempo department, and take out everything that made the music interesting. Essentially, it's Linkin' Park's best work, made dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"linkin park going techno!!! WTF!!!","review":"look linkin park is a great band but im startin to get the creeps that there turnin techno. Do yourself a favor and don't get this album, and don't encourage them for releasing this album, like that they will never think about releasing a remix album of them. If you want a good album buy them get hybrid theory or there new one meteora. The reason why i gave them 2 stars is because of the cover pleaes not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Surround Mix","review":"This is one of those DVD's that you put in your DVD player, crank the sound, then sit down and close your eyes. It will take you somewhere else. Chills will run down your spine, and you'll wonder how you ever listened to music in stereo. The stand out tracks are Krwlng, 1Stp Klosr, My{Dsmbr, and P5hng Me A*wy.If you have a surround system, are fan of Linkin Park, and want to hear something that you won;t forget. Buy this DVD-Audio disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO GOOD!!!","review":"I am now a Linkin' Park fan and I listen to mostly rap!!! This album is the really good with the guest appearances and the production is on point.Anyone who listens to rap I think should check it out considerin' the fact that this album includes Underground rappers and I didn't expect that at all when I got it. And that's what makes this album good. I really recommend it!!!I know a lot of people are going to be like I am whack cuz I don't know anybody's name in this group...but the guy that raps is really good and it sort of remindes me of Rage Against the Machine...KEYWORD...I said sort of...Don't kill me please!!! Peace out Folks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately worth buying","review":"Reanimation is a remix CD to Linkin Park's multi-platinum CD Hybrid Theory. Not only are the titles to the tracks unique, but the songs are as well. Linkin Park had various different DJs redo their songs, which keeps gives each song a diverse taste.But what made this album great was that Linkin Park was not afraid to take that step into the rap genre, while still keeping respect in the rock community. Give this CD a try! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Hybrid Theory!","review":"I really like Hybrid Theory and thought this album sounded like a ripoff. I was planning to wait until they had a completely new album. I don't recall what changed my mind but they have done enough here that it feels like a whole new album. Highly recommend to fans of linkin park."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This is absolutely my best album purchase of the year so far. I loved \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and like this interpretation compilation as much, if not more. Even on my first listening, I am in love with it.

Fan-freakin'-tastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park....","review":"Well I got the cd, and well some of the songs are pure genius, some aren't exactly ruined but could ahve been better, maybe to much rap =P. Generally it's like a rap/rock/techno mix haha. I tihnk it's a great cd really though, and made me fall back in love Linkin Park =),"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Buy","review":"This CD is great. Everything you heard on Hybrid Theory gets changed to a techno feel. they also add more rap to it, and even though i really dont like rap, its cool, cuz Linkin Park does rap good! Definetly buy this album. Cyaz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"West Coast Underground!","review":"Big ups to Linkin Park on a great Remix album. It's definitely not Hybrid Theory, so if that is what you are looking for you might want to pass this one up. But if you're into West Coast underground and \\"real\\" Hip-Hop then this might be an album for you. I'm amazed that nobody so far has complimented them on the mix of artist that they were able to assemble for this project. It's nice to see a multi platinum band put on such artist as Evidence & DJ Babu (Dilated People & The Beat Junkies), Chali2Na (J5), Aceyalone (Freestyle Fellowship), Rasco & Planet Asia (Cali Agents), and Cheapshot (Lexicon). Hopefully it will expand the horizons of some of their fans......because I'm guessing more than 90% of you haven't heard of Aceyalone, Planet Asia, or Ev before this! Do yourself a favor, if you like this LP remix album.....pick up a Freestyle Fellowship, Dilated People, or J5 CD......it's some of the most under rated and under appreciated music around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many cd's get 5 stars...","review":"But this one is definately deserving of the high rating. It's a nice compliment to Hybrid Theory, which is more rock-based, and Reanimation has a more hip-hop feel to it. They are true to their form with unique, creative, collaborations and I really think they're opening the door for \\"fusion\\" music.With about 17 songs (20 tracks but some are just clips) I'm definately satisfied that I got my money's worth. I was not disapointed with the remix of my favorite song, Place for my Head, and Krwling sends shivers up my back everytime I hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LINKIN PARK BEAT EVERY OTHER ROCK ALBUM OUT THERE","review":"I AM A GANGSTA RAP FAN BUT LINKIN PARKBRINGS IT TO THE TABLE.

I got it the first day it came out at 10 am. Needless to say I wasn't to pleased.Mike Shinoda, who did the whole thing, screwed it up. Hyrbrid Theory came out with screaming, good guitars, and GOOD MUSIC. Then the remixes came out and most of them are either to \\"Rappy\\" or \\"Techonoy\\" or something. The hard-rocking Forgotten was turned into a slow techno rap song. In the End was runined. And there was only 4 songs I was pleased with, \\"with you remix\\" \\"one step closer remix\\" \\"crawling remix\\" and \\"cure for the itch remix\\". I recomend it for anyone whos a fan of techno or rap. Head Bangers will haft to wait for their next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Finish","review":"This is really a poor finish to their previous cd. All the songs has been stripped of their heavy riffs and replaced by unacceptable things, metal bands are made off. If you like metal and listen to bands like Korn, System of a Down and even Linkin Park's new cd you will consider this cd alot of [junk]. Do not waste your money on this, buy Hybrid Theory. Hybrid Theroy is what a real metal album should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"one word. this is the worst cd ever. i love hybrid theory, which is probably why i hate this cd so much. hybrid theory had just the right mix of rock and rap. this cd is all rap/hip-hop/.... this is not linkin park. why would you change something that was so great to begin with? i think linkin park are the biggest sellouts ever. don't get this cd. If you want a good cd, go out and get finch or offspring. this is not music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good CD Destroyed","review":"How can you so uterly destroy a bunch of great songs?! Some how they managed it with these remixes.

When i listened to the first track i thought man this album is gonna be sweet. After the second track i was like what were they thinking with that song, and after the third i just wanted to throw the thing away. I would only suggest this cd to someone who prefers the rap side of Linkin Park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold on the remixes...wait for the next album","review":"... This album, other than new beats mixed in with the old music, is a complete waste of effort. There are NO NEW SONGS on this album - just half-witted remixes that will leave you yawning and reaching for the 'eject' button. While the songs in this may be slightly interesting if you have never heard the original album before, I would without a doubt advise you do skip purchasing this cd and go buy a coaster that is a little more affordable."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent songs turned into crap","review":"there are only 2 nu metals bands worth listening to they are system of a down and linkin park her is linkin park with there first album cut in to pieces and stuck together with the weakest materials possible this album is a mess remixes of such songs as in the end are awful and do not compliment there actual songs there is some hope so it is worth one start if it wasnt for pts of athority (witch is better than the origonal) this wouldnt even be deserving of one star i was a linkin park fan when this came out i stopped and started to like bigger bands this band are the second best in the nu metal genre but this is probably the worst album in that genre if you want to see lnkin park play good music buy hybrid theory or meteora"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu Metal [IS NOT GOOD]","review":"Dear Linkin ParkThis new release is even worse than its predecessor, a weak album containing not a trace of creativity. I consider this and your other work to be personally offensive and a deliberate downgrade on the hard rock community. Like Limp Bizkit, Staind, Papa Roach and so many other acts, this release shows a total disconcern for how well metal has been done before and feeds on the fact that kids today have no background, and no not that at one time not so far in the past hard rock was done MUCH better than this.Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!!!","review":"OMG!

I refuse to buy any more of thier music becuase of this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for new material...","review":"I'm sorry - I can't agree with what has been said here. Admittedly, I bought the CD blind. I had no clue what the jewel case contained within. All I knew was Linkin Park had come out with a new CD and I HAD TO HAVE IT. I absolutely LOVED Hybrid Theory and was expecting something along those lines - incredible melodies, strong vocals, and FRESH MATERIAL.What I got was a complete re-hash of Hybrid Theory, but the MUSIC is gone and replaced with rap. It's almost as if Fred Durst had hijacked my beloved Linkin Park and forced them to follow his talentless lead. Listening to Reanimation I felt the same hollowness and betrayal as when I first listened to Significant Other - I just blew [price] on a POC CD.Save your money and wait until Linkin Park is FREED from this drivel. I resent paying money for a place-holder. The same effect can be had by putting Hybrid Theory in your CD player and hitting the >> button at random.Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I was highly disappointed when I found out that LP's new cd was only a remake of the songs on their last cd. LP was my favorite band. I listened to Hybrid Theory all the time. Now their new cd has disappointed me. I loved their style and now they've ruined it by making it hip hop. If you truly love Hybrid Theory as I do, then I wouldn't recommend Reanimation because you will be disappointed at the change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed...","review":"I thought this cd would be still in the rock scene while mixing. Though it was well remixed, It's to into the rap, hip hop, ghetto cr@p. I've give this cd the thumbs down i regret buying it...Linkin Park can do better then this, this was some rap garbage to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed by this CD","review":"Let me start by saying that I loved Hybrid Theory. I thought it was one of the most innovative rock CD's ever. So after 2 years I was looking forward to some more of that innovation. Unfortunately, Reanimation has nothing new. As others have said, its a straight-up remix CD and its not even a good remix. Its also more hip-hop than rock. So unless you want to buy a hip-hop remix of Hybrid Theory, I would suggest passing on this CD. Hopefully Linkin Park will stay true to its roots and record another ROCK CD, and forget putting out lame studio remix CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Trash","review":"How could Linkin Park do this to their fans. The only decent track on this CD is the Points of Authority single. I feel deeply cheated by this album. I hope this genre of remix albums dies here. How can you try to better the best album of 2001.....impossible. I am extremely open minded about all music and do like certain rap and hip hop but this is plain trash. A bunch of wannabes trying to make their names by remixing linkin Parks songs and failing miserably. Save your money and please, please Linkin Park don't sell this rubbish to your fans. Stay original and fresh and bring us more unique tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown","review":"What brought me to buy Reanimation were several songs I heard on websites. I think they're a unique and very talented band. However, if I knew this CD had all of these techno/hip hop remixes on it, I would have bought \\"Hybrid Theory\\" instead. I bought this CD yesterday and it's on ebay today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Hybrid Theory instead","review":"Now I know this CD took A TON of talent to make. And there's no denying Linkin Park has that talent. They're a great band. But this CD is just remixes of the already great songs off of Hybrid Theory, plus some old songs. These songs really did not tickle me pink. The originals are a lot better. The only remix I found myself toe-tapping to was the remix of In The End.I bought this CD because I love Linkin Park, and that was enough for me. And though it took incredible mixing talent to make this, buy Hybrid Theory instead. The remixes are too weird for me. The originals will do you much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, Sure, If Hip-hop's Your Thing...","review":"I'm not exactly current on the latest music scene, but I know what I like and what I don't. If you are into Rap and Hip-Hop, you might really appreciate the re-mixes on this CD. If, like me, you thought Hybrid Theory was awesome because of the driving rock beat MIXED with SOME Hip-hop sync, and heavy guitar chords that put the green light at a drag race to shame, skip this CD. It is like someone went into these tunes and deliberately ripped out all the stuff I like, replacing it with a bunch of rented-Rap. Serious disappointment. I hope they swing back the other way on their next effort. If not, I'll have to find other tunes to lift to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hybrid Theory Gets Gangsta?","review":"I am actually one of those people who enjoy Linkin Park's music. I feel that their combination of nu-metal and rap works fairly well and has lead them to some great music. This, however, is a disgrace to anyone who enjoyed their music.The CD consists of theirHybrid TheoryCD remixed with a few other tracks. The remixes are mostly horrible and are very annoying. They basically just took Hybrid Theory and turned it into a badly made Rap album. The new tracks aren't good either and I'd honestly consider them some of the worst of the disk.The few positives are that some of the songs like Crawling actually turned out very good. This CD lacks enough of these good songs to actually make this worth purchasing. Check out their new CD,Minutes to Midnight, if you want to hear real Linkin Park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be.","review":"I am a huge Linkin Park fan. I consider Hybrid Theory and Meteora to be two of the best CDs I own. I anxiously awaited the release of Reanimation, and I was severely disappointed. I always expect great things from Linkin Park, but they missed the target on this one. They focused more on the \\"rap\\" part of rap-metal, something that doesn't interest me that much. I personally do not think that their songs are meant to be re-mixed. The wonderful guitar is lost behind the techno-rap sounds, and Chester's great voice is replaced with people like Motion Man. I want to hear him and Mike sing more than the \\"guests\\" on the album. Aaron Lewis butchered their most amazing song, Crawling, and this was what I was most disappointed with. Others aren't supposed to sing their songs. I do not recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushed me away","review":"i'm a Linkin Park fan and though a few songd were still recognisable, some (In The End) and some even sounded okay, the cd was generally painfull to listen to. a complete mutilation of an encredable CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reanimation is not very good.","review":"I seriously dislike this album.Maybe its because I am not very big into this type of music on Reanimation,who knows.But all I know is that this isn't really good.Almost everything on here is a remix,and I prefer new work than just remixes.The new songs aren't that great,either.I'm not a Linkin Park hater- far from one.I thought 'Hybrid Theory' was pretty good but this is just garbage.Don't waste any money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"better animated\\"","review":"When i first heard linkin park was putting out a remix album i was upset.

So I highly recommend this cd, mind you it is heavy but with a rock and roll flavour to it , I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparable with the original","review":"Like Hybrid Theory, Reanimation is an incredible CD. It takes the unbelievable songs off their previous album, and sharpens them to a hip-hop edge. It works as a dual gateway, introducing metal-only fans to the world of hip-hop and rap, and also lets hard-core rap fans a view of the best in new metal. I recommend it to any music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park Reanimation Review","review":"Many people have said the first one is much better. But I think this cd is way better.

The music is way better than the first.I definetly recomend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like \\"Regurgitation\\"","review":"This was as big of a dissapointment as Evanescence's \\"Fallen\\" was to me. I REALLY REALLY REALLY liked Linkin Park's debut, Hybrid Theory. But this CD was pretty bad. I like the first track (Opening), track # 5 (Forgotten), and I kind of liked \\"My December\\" for a while. But the rest of the CD is pretty skip-able. I mean, the songs get kind of annoying after a while. The original HYBRID THEORY was 100x better than this. I see this CD as a ploy to get more money out of us. And boy, did they sure fool me! I recommend HYBRID THEORY over this. So, I'm pretty much saying to not buy this album. It's not worth the money. My favorite parts of the CD are they way they mixed up the words and formed weird words (ex. Forgotten to Frgt/10) and the CD cover art and stuff. But the CD itself wasn't that great. So, get Hybrid Theory before you get this!!! Enjoy! (um, kind of, hehe)"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Hybrid Theory, and even better","review":"I would like to contradict several reviews I read: I don't believe that Linkin Park were lazy, and didn't have the mental strength to write new songs. Instead, they went back to the studio, and made their album a whole lot better.One can only imagine the work those bands put in the process of making an album, and as for Reanimation, all the more so.Almost Finally, the guest appearances really contribute to the diversity of Linkin Park.Frankly, I haven't listened to Hybrid Theory, as much as I loved it, since I've heard Renoimation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Tight","review":"This was a great CD...

Listening to this cd, you can't help but nod your head to the beat...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much rap","review":"You may disagree with Linkin Park ever doing rap music but they just released a new album with Jay-Z so it's possible. Reanimation was too hard to follow and the music was really weird. I was really confused when I first listened to it but when I understood it I found I still didn't like it. They also really messed up the lyrics it was a complete mess. I know some people realy enjoyed this album and I can see how people would like it but it just didn't do it for me. I like Linkin Park when they're playing good rock music instead of techno or rap and if you want this album download the songs or borrow a copy of it because you really either like it or you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rap Rock","review":"I love all the linkin park CD's, even this one.

Half of the CD is absolutely amazing, and the other half is just rap/techno remixes with different artists which I find really annoying. Personally, I prefered the originals, but I love this CD because some of the songs are so unique and different. I hated this CD at first, but it's grown on me so much! My fave remixes are Points of Authority, With You, Crawling (Awesome at 5:40!!) and My December. If you're dissing this CD, remember remixes are always different and always have different beats. You will probably hate this CD if you hate remixes in general. This CD has a more techno and dance beat than the others.I listen to LP because it's different, and their lyrics are so awesome. If you listen closely, they make a lot of sense. As well as the fact that LP doesn't just fit in one specific category in Alternative (If that makes any sense)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it aint so","review":"Linkin Park had the perfect combonation of rock and rap, this album is entirely rap.

There are bands out there that I thought were the most rap-influenced rap metal out there like Crazy Town and (old) Primer 55 but neither of them made an almost all rap remake of their old album. This band, first of all, must be completely incapable of writing new songs because they've been living off of Hybrid Theory for the past 3 years now and instead of releasing a new CD they re-mix their old album as if it wasn't bad enough already.

Not rock at all!","review":"If you truely like the rock style of Linkin Park, don't buy this cd. The only good songs are KRWLNG, RNW@Y, and a few others.

I suppose rap fans might like what they did with \\"In the End\\" or \\"Papercut\\" but overall there wasn't much improvement. \\"My December\\" was originally an amzing song but it was totally murdered on Reanimation. It's too bad the original wersion is not on any albums except some expensive import cds. \\"Crawling\\" is the only reason to buy this album. Aaron Lewis and Chester are AWESOME together and the violin part makes \\"Crawling\\" totally amazing and the best song on the album by a long, long way. However, if Linkin Park really wants to be recognized, they need to come out with new music instead of recycling old tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweetness!!! The LP hits return","review":"Alright, here's the story. This isnt just some cheap collection of Remixes, its an entirely new artistic interp of the old stuff. This is LP at their best, with some of the other big names chiping in, and almost all of it is better in a different way than the original. Good stuff, includes My December and the best version of With You thats ever been made. A definite must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD-Audio reference disc","review":"If you have a DVD-Audio compatible player, get this disc NOW. It was designed specifically for this multi-channel format and takes full advantage of the surrounds. Its natural too and doesn't sound \\"pushed\\" or like you're listening to a CD in one of your receiver's Hall, Theatre, Jazz Club modes. This is the real deal. If I want to impress someone with my system and show off my new DVD-Audio player, this is the 1st disc I grab. Even if you aren't a huge Linkin Park fan, you will still smile while listening to the sounds coming from your surrounds while listening to this amazing disc.

Reanimation is basically a remixed album from Hybrid Theory, only that it has more songs. Also, the beats are rap instead of rock. A lot of rappers are featured in this album. There are a couple of rock songs in Reanimation, like X-Ecutioner Style. The new songs are:(Chali), X-Ecutioner Style, High Voltage, (Riff Raff), Intermission, My December, and STEF. The remixes to the songs from Hybrid Theory (Crawling, In The End, Paperkut, Place 4 My Head, etc.) are also in rap beats.

Vltg3. Another great songs are Enth E Nd and Krwlng (I especially like the easy beginning at this song). I also have to mention PPr:Kut which is remixed really great by Cheapshot/Jubacca/Rasco/Planet Asia (there's much more rap in it). This would be my favourites, but that doesn't mean that other songs aren't good. They're great.

The only song I found good in this album was crawling and the only reason was because the guy from Staind was in there to stop the song from falling apart. If Linkin Park consider themselves to be heavy, why on earth do they bring stupid rappers in their song?

From my perspective, this has two separate impacts on the novel: while it sometimes makes the individual characters more shadowy and difficult to discern, it underlines the reality that slaves of the time were viewed as possessions rather than as people.I recommend that those who read this novel also read 'Red River'.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant story","review":"Impressive debut novel spanning the history of five generations.

Beautifully written novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fredieu Family Member","review":"This book revealed my great-grandfather to be Emily's brother. Or, that would appear to be the case by information that is recorded in the book. I am interested in more discussion on the subject but cannot make contact through any other email address listed for the author. Is it possible for me to write to the author? My mother's maiden name is Fredieu."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stupidity of Racism","review":"I enjoyed this book and found it quite fascinating. However, it made me furious. I think it should be required reading for every high school student in the United States.Its' harsh reality points out the stupidity of racism. A man can love a woman, have five childrn with her, and yet, he is not allowed to marry her! To me, racism is the worst form of insecurity. The author did a good job but at times it was very confusing. She didn't put enough information about each woman. I had to keep going back to see who she was talking about.If you enjoyed this book, I think you would enjoy 'Sing Me A Bawdy Song.' It is written in the same way about an American family living from 1917 to 1945. The book is 70% true and you will find yourself laughing and crying. It is easy to read and all the reviews are begging for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"This book is a tribute to the strength of women of African descent. It demonstrates how this family was able to triumph in the midst of horrible circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but true","review":"I found this book engaging, and interesting. I commend Ms. Tademy on this novel. I just don't understand why generation after generation these women thought pairing up with a white man would make their lives any better. Generation after generation were duped out of what was rightfully thier's, and many of the children were never legitimized. Also, there was comtempt among the lighter blacks and darker blacks when the lighter ones were just slightly better off. They never seemed to learn year after year that you can have a white daddy, go to their schools and learn their language, but you'll never be equal because of your black blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This really was a great book. It was so interesting, it kept your attention the whole time, and it was a long book. I enjoyed learning about what the south was like in the 1800's & 1900's. I also enjoyed learning what it felt like to be a slave or black person of that time. I felt she kept the book very \\"real\\".

The story follows the lives of three generations of African American/White women from the Antebellum Days of the Civil War to the mid-1900s. Partially based upon fact and interspersed with real documents and photographs, the story leaves you feeling like you know these women personally as they face the struggles of slavery, servitude, and failed love. Their grace and resilience is an inspiration as each generation of this amazing family builds upon the accomplishments of the last. It kept me turning the pages. If you're on the fence about purchasing this book, don't be...it's a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"This is a great book.

Ms. Tademy took a big step to leave her prestigious job to write this book and she did a great job...this book stays with you long after it's finished and it keeps you interested until the very last word. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but the writing did not hold me captive","review":"I have taken a break from reading this book after going through one-third of the story. I think the idea to chronicle the author's family history is a great one, and I'd like to read the rest of the book at some point. However, the writing does not keep me interested enough. At times I feel that the symbolism is forced and that any poetic nature is lost. I'm not led to care about the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Starts Here","review":"Growing up 'black' in America means little to Americans of African heritage. Most of us don't know what countries in Africa our ancestors came from and we know even less of the reasons why our history has all but been ignored. Except for a paltry 28-day, month-long acknowledgement in February; does anyone really know what it means to be black in this country? As an American of African heritage I was lucky enough to discover some of these answers. Lalita Tademy touches on the deep, passionate and criminally painful truths of our lives in this country. She could have written my story for they are practically identical. Read this book and let it touch your soul. She writes about history and makes you wonder why it's taken so long to see this story in print. This is a solemn and serious book that leaves you craving the answers to questions about your own history. Don't deny yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what THE WIND DONE GONE could have done","review":"Intrigued by the clever title of THE WIND DONE GONE, I read it hoping for a moving depiction of the other side of slavery. I was disappointed. Then I read CANE RIVER and discovered that book delivered what TWDG had only promised. CR showed me strong women, caught in the horrors of slavery, who managed their lives and, as Faulkner would have admired, endured. Beyond that, they even flourished. Speaking as a middle aged white woman, I found much more to admire in the historically based characters of CR than the literally based characters of TWDG. If you're going to read only one, make it CAIN RIVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"I am a white Australian woman. Only one of the words in that description gives me something in common with Ms Tademy. But it's a pretty big thing. \\"Cane River\\" is incredible. It is an absolutely non-romanticised story of black slavery in America's south, following the fortunes of Ms Tademy's maternal relations. If you ever thought it was hard being a woman, just imagine being a slave and a woman. When you read this book, you'll feel sad and outraged at what these women must endure. But at the same time, you can't help but rejoice in the giant steps forward these women take with each generation, and the sense of love and loyalty which forms the backbone of their families and gives them the strength to struggle. This really is an amazing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"No boring parts.","review":"The book was intresting from begining to end. I loved it so much and i am now reading it for the second time.it's like a soap opera, my favorite person was palmire i don't know why, i hated the fact that she died and never saw her children. i think the book should be a movie, although whenever they turn books into movies it does not feel the same if you have read the book, since the movie cannot have every detail as the book.i hope that Ms.Tademy write's another book,i really loved this one and it being about a real life family made it more unbelieveable."},{"rating":"2","title":"very detail very good storyline","review":"I really enjoyed the book I first saw Lalita's story on Oprah I went out the same weekend and purchased the book I myself came from a very mixed family and I'm of dark descent this book really hit home for me andmade me open my eyes about things in my own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magical Event","review":"This has been one of the best books that I have read in quite a while. I was born in 1962 and missed most of this era, which has provided me such an insight of the South from another point of few other than \\"Gone With the Wind\\". It truly touches me that through it all, family was high priority. I find myself flipping back to pictures very frequently because I feel as if I know these people."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read!!!!","review":"If you love characters to stay with you long after the book is done--pick this up.

It made me reflect on my own family and why some of us see things differently. It also made me realize that some of the issues we (especially as black women) have today are very much related to our past. It's an excellent book. Everyone should open their minds and think about their own lives when reading this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cane River","review":"This is probably one of the best books I have ever read!! I literally could not put the book down because I couldn't wait to see what happened in the next chapter. I loved the way the author laid out the book by focusing on four generations of women and their struggles. This book took so many twists and turns there is no way you could ever predict what was going to happen which I consider a great book. Each of these woman had their own struggles and vision for the future for their family. They never gave up hope for the next generation. It was very interesting to see how each handled struggles and successes. It opened my eyes to slave life and what people had to endure during this time. At the end of the book you can look back at everything that has happened and how each generation did better for themselves and their family. I have already given this book to my Mom and a friend. I would definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A River of Family History.....","review":"Rich. Soulful. Interesting.These words describe Cane River.

Held at the Caf�� Soul in Los Angeles, CA, the group of 40 women united in an enjoyable and lively discussion of Cane River. Both book clubs agree that what moved them was how Tadeny's story demonstrated strength, love and loyalty for family through the lives of her ancestors Elisabeth, Suzette, Philomene and Emily.More than just an account of the old South during slavery times, Cane River presented a thought provoking lesson in African American History through what was endured by Tadeny's ancestors during the times which they lived. Joy was felt for the achievements which were accomplished by each women whom had little to no resources as well as sorrow for the hurt which was endured.Cane River is a must read for young adults as a reminder of the hardships of slavery and inequalities in American History."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to read","review":"If you liked Cold Mountain and are looking for a book that is written as well...read this.

There was something unreal about it and I couldn't \\"buy\\" all of the things that were happening. From the very beginning of the book the main character seems not to have an understanding of the difference between herself, a slave, and her mistress. Granted, she was 10, but it seems to me that by that age her parents would have tried to clue her in to the realities of life so that she would be able to handle and survive. Instead they just seemed to let her act and believe that she was different and it was hard and painful when she had to come to terms wiht life as it was. As a \\"family history\\" kind of book this book seemed to be infused with too much fantasy about how life was and it was still unbelievable as a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cane River","review":"I loved the book. It was really great reading and learning about the different families. It is really nice to find a fiction book that is about real people that is so adequately written. It makes me realize how great my family really is. I really understand how my dad feels when he is searching the internet and places for people for the family tree. It makes me which I could write a book about my family history. My favorite was Emily.It was really great learning about her lfieShe really had a tramatic time through out her life. I really liked how most every family sticks together through thick and thin. Even the men take care of the kids and his wife. A lot of men don't do that now. They either leave before the baby is born, say the baby is not their's, or just don't care about their kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cane River","review":"Cane River is a book that i will read over and over.I give praise the author for her courage and stenght.It made me cry and open my heart and mind and soul.It made me feel and love more and not to judge what i don't know.It is amazing i remember when she was writing the book.I am doing the same thing finding my roots.

Unfortunately, this book did not work for me. I'm sure most writers fictionalize family stories to a degree but the author was not able to create a world that I could lose myself in. She did not develop any of the characters sufficiently and I was left wondering about their motivations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cane River","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in several years. I have vacationed in the area the book takes place and it was totally accurate as a background. The strength of the women of color and the dedication to their families was wonderful to read. This was not an UNCLE TOM'S CABIN Book. More like a family of Steel Magnolia's. I hope this author continues to write historical novels. She is gifted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical and human insights from bygone American history","review":"This is a well researched historical novel written by the great-great-great-great grand daughter of a former Louisiana slave. The journey goes through the generations of negro and mulatto women who do what they have to do to survive and keep their families together. Most of the children of these women were illegitimate offspring of the white men who were their masters). The author makes you feel the burdens the slave women had to endure and give the reader insights into the hypocrisy of these slave owners.It was a difficult time and place where those of color were made to feel inferior and often did not mind that their children of mixed blood would be less black and perhaps have a better chance at life because of their color.I highly recommend CANE RIVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable storytelling","review":"The most heart-piercing book of the year is a timeless tale of the racial boundaries of the times.

I love the way Ms Tademy paints a picture of her ancestors and gives me a taste of life in LA's past. The book was pulled me in and I simply could not read it fast enough. It was as though there was a mystery me before me that I longed to solve. In the end, I came away from it valuing her family as though they were my ancestors too. This book should be a reminder to African-American women everywhere that we have and we can endure and soar despite our circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"It all about me !","review":"This book helped me learn a bit about the history of my own family and for that I am grateful.

Thank you Lalita !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for serious readers of literature or history","review":"Congratulations to Lalita Tademy for leaving her job as a CEO to research and write a book. One imagines that she was better at business then prose. To be kind, the writing is slip shod. No characters, not even the main ones, are more than stick figures. Why they make the choices they do is left a total mystery. Tademy has bravely taken on the ambitious task of telling the stories of three of her ancestors, two of whom lived much of their lives as slaves in Louisiana. She's bitten off far too much, often jumping the story years ahead seemingly at whim. I literally tossed the book in the air at the mention of Lincoln assuming the presidency in November 1860 (the month of his election, four months before taking office). For serious students of history, Cane River is more annoying than enlightening.Cane River is about important and compelling issues that surrounded the lives of many female slaves. Such a book should not be left in the hands of novice."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"I've read many slave narratives written by real slaves, and Cane River left out a lot of slave things such as singing, praying, joking with their family, playing tricks on the old folks, etc. etc. etc. Cane River had people talking like white folks, and hardly ever getting angry, or hooting and hollering during celbrations. Even though I know this lady was black, she didn't write like it. I don't know what the big deal was. Read narratives like UP FROM SLAVERY or I WAS BORN A SLAVE or BULLWHIP DAYS.

It is not possible to tell how large these cups are because the manufacturer does not state it anywhere. Other reviewers have been giving some guesses.. well, I measured it: 2 oz. You can put a tad more but then it goes to the rim and no way you can put sugar or a spoon to stir into it. So 2 oz max!!! Be sure you know that before you grow high expectations like I did. As it is, it is cute enough to keep and give coffee to guests but for me who prefers more coffee in my single shot espresso, I need to look for a 4-oz set! So why the 2 stars at all? the colors of te cups are cute. Why 2 stars max? Because there is no info about the size on the website! There should be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun little demitasse set - bright colors!","review":"This is the cutest and most useful set of cups and saucers I have seen yet - am enjoying using them -bright colors and dishwasher safe - I enjoy \\"cafezinhos\\" - as I used to live in Brazil - where it is alwayscorrect to serve \\"little coffees\\" any time of the day or evening.

The price for what I resiceved was a steal as you can see all are styleishhly painted in fun yet elegant colors many other cups painted silimalrly are three times the price. I like them because the are a little larger than a regualr demitasse so you can in fact pull a lungo instead of an espresso or a doppio (double). Heck even if you bought them for your daughters tea party the are well worth the money.The only reason I gave tehm a 4 star is beacuse they are ceramic instead of porcelin which is the gold standard for coffee cups other than that they are great for theose who like to serve coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource","review":"As with other Stokes books, this one is quite a good reference.

Despite having originated in the 1960s, these renderings are of decent quality and have been very well received by my children. We have the set of four DVDs and enjoy watching them over and over again. In total among the four DVDs, there are (22) 15-minute episodes, and (4) 30-minute specials.Highly recommended; watch them together and be blessed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Tired","review":"This movie might be good if you speak french and/or are hip to the french cinema scene.

I liked the dance moves and the instructor well enough but you spend way too much time learning the moves and marching in place to get a halfway decent workout out of it.

I use it on alternating days between high intensity kickboxing work-outs. But don't get me wrong-- you WILL get your heart rate up and you WILL sweat. You'll just feel really good doing it! The difference is that this is a work-out for ALL fitness levels since the movements can be adapted to your own body's needs or comfort level. The best part of this work-out is how you feel doing it. Since you're learning and dancing to incredible live music, you hardly notice how much of a full body work-out you're getting.By the 3rd or 4th time you use the work-out you'll have learned most of the basic movements so you can just really DANCE and have fun!

And this is the one. It's not easy, but still lots of fun. And I love the drums. So many exercise videos have such awful music I end up turning off the sound and putting my own CD on. This music is raw and basic, the moves sexy. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys an African beat and some hot latin moves. This is a FIVE STAR video.

The so-called \\"music\\" had no rhythm whatsoever and was so annoying that I kept turning down the volume and then had to mute the sound. It was an hour of tediously repetitious and monotonous drums that were reminiscent of a bad head-hunter movie--with the needle stuck. I have listened to many percussion bands and they were lively and made you want to get up and move your body. This one just made me want to grit my teeth and end the torture. The workout was interesting, but much of it was just marching in place. My disappointment was extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"It all depends on your coordination","review":"For me this video was easy to follow even though you are following the dancers who are facing you. The combination is given to you in pieces in four steps, first at full pace (you're supposed to watch), than at half pase several times which you can follow with, next at full pace, and then you combine all the sections. I love to dance and was looking for an outlet, this definately was not it. Doing the entire video without stopping at all does get your pulse up a bit, but not quite what I was hoping for. If you are not that coordinated and/or are not familiar at all with dance this video would probably be good for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"annoying!! the production is awful, with terrible camera angles and in some parts the sound doesnt match the video!

Nor is it a great workout tape. Vanessa tries to break it down to easy to learn segments, and then build from there. However, I found it hard to follow and a lot of jumping around and marching in place. I hoped the dvd would focus on latin body movement that would add flavor to my dance repertoire but that is not the case. With all the breaks to focus on complicated sequences it's hard to work up a sweat so I didn't get a good workout. Further, with the jumping around I felt injury to ankles could easily happen.

You'll burn a pithy amount of calories for the hour you've invested, and personally, I was bored. I didn't like how they previewed the combination before breaking down the moves, because you are relegated to standing there and watching. Based upon other reviews I have the minority opinion, but before buying please consider what kind of workout you are looking for. If you want a more active workout, this is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun!","review":"I liked many things about this video:The instructor, who was fun without being annoying, broke down each of the moves well, and increased the tempo at a reasonable rate.The moves were super fun, and combined together well into a fluid combination sequence.I was sweating without feeling like I would pass out.I like how the teacher invited the students to demonstrate the moves, rather than making the video all about her.The length of the workout was just right.The live drumming was fantastic.The scenery was beautiful.Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !!

I was a bit worried at first, thinking that it would be like other aerobic exercise but uses latin music instead of regular aerobic music. But I was wrong !

That's the point, because if your workout isn't fun, you'll get bored very quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Forget You're Working Out!","review":"I really enjoy this video.

The video is broken into 2 sections. First is the Afro-Brazilian style of dance. She only goes through the moves twice at half tempo. Then you run through the whole thing from the beginning. This music is not so bad but the music on the second part with the salsa moves is cloying. One beat going on and on.You run through both sections at the end only 2 times. So, after you do learn all the steps, it does nothing to get your heart rate up.Not recommended and the end salsa steps are not good for your knees!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun workout.","review":"This workout is easy to follow and fun to do.

My mother did the original Calanetics every OTHER day, didn't change a thing about her food intake, and lost 65 lbs. in 6 months...for REAL! Her secret was she did each of the different parts when she could, throughout the day...not all at once! She was lean, hard muscled (for the first time in her life!) and had the energy of a teen. If you are severely over weight, you can actually DO this...and if you are thin and want to change the SHAPE of your body...this is IT! In some ways this workout gets harder as you get stronger, absolutaly. This grows with your ability, and you'll never outgrow it.

This is not one of them. It's bad on almost all counts: scholarship, unworkable thesis, far too much quoting from primary source with too little analysis. It's a silly little book. But worst of all is the oppressive idolizing of Shakespeare that Bloom parades with glee throughout the book. Far from being a viable point of view, to say nothing of the fact that it's so treadworn as to be a cliche nowadays, Bardolatry is an obstacle to meaningful criticism. Bloom should know better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it \\"sullied\\" or \\"solid flesh\\"?","review":"I think that the other, negative, reviews are the result of expecting some kind of senior thesis. I, for one, am glad he doesn't spend much time quoting other scholars. The problem with thesis-country is that it tends to be boring. I think that the spirit of the book is the very personal feelings that Hamlet invokes for Harold Bloom. While I do not agree completely with Bloom's interpretation of Hamlet, it has given me much to consider. Without question, Bloom does prove that Hamlet is eternal, and will continue to be studied, puzzled over, and - most importantly - enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Doom Metal Classic","review":"Well, when i heard of this band(courtesy of mp3.com) they blew me away. Although... I bought the cd and it seemed to drag on. Now don't get me wrong people. I encourage you to buy this album... but that is only if you are a fan of doom metal. Doom metal includes such bands as: My Dying Bride, Theatre of Tragedy, November's Doom, and Without Face. Now if these bands are not appetizing to you, I would not recommend this cd. It is probably one of the longest cd's i've ever heard. But it is well worth the time in my opinion. It displays Forest Stream's abilities and is a great piece of work especially on keyboards. They do not have a drummer, but the programmed parts(done by the singer) are pretty cool. All and all, i love this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"Tears of Mortal Solitude is the amazing debut CD from Forest Stream! Take a young Opeth and add keyboard elements with a sadder theme of lyrics and this is what pops out. If you visit the official website, it says this album is part one of a three part \\"series\\". This album is Sorrow, which fits the sound completely!Amazingly clear production with great quality, all of the instruments and the vocals are mixed perfectly. The drums on the album are programmed, but they have the best sound I have ever heard for programmed drums. The next release will have a real drummer, check out the official website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this translation!","review":"Having just finished my first run of \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" I was utterly distraught to discover that the Kropotkin translation omits two key chapters, including the incomparable Book Five, \\"The Grand Inquisitor.\\" I've never written an Amazon.com review (besides this one), but I feel a great duty to save future readers from making an enormous, even fatal, mistake in purchasing this particular translation.

As stated in the book, women, under the disguise as men, fought for their country or to follow their male family members or husbands into war. Often the true identity of these women were not discovered until their death. For such a private and secret matter the book had a lot of information to give on a subject that you think would lacking. I enjoyed this book and God love those women who had such guts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sister against Sister?????","review":"Blanton and Cook's book about women soldiers serving in both the Northern and Southern Armies is entertaining. But be forwarned, it does have a halting style of writing. It drags in places and flies in others.Well researched, the book does advance the topic of women serving as men during the civil war. And it does cover a few battles. However, if you're looking for light reading or looking for a general book on the civil war, then you need to keep looking.As I worked my way through the book I did keep pondering the question of sister fighting sister, or mother fighting mother. We certainly make much of the brother against brother of son against father aspects of this conflict. I wonder how many woment really did fight during the civil war in both armies? I don't know that we'll ever know that answer, but not because Blanton and Cook didn't try to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"slightly biased","review":"this was an interesting book, but it does not contain hardly any information on women from the south. there are some opinions expressed that show the authors are biased toward the union. so if you are searching for information pertaining to the Confederate women, don't read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good mixer for the money.","review":"I researched and read reviews on this one before I bought it and they were all good.

My feelings of desperation, confusion, loss, and wondering where I went wrong were all validated. I have already started trying techniques recommended. Even if it doesn't change my daughter, my perception has changed so that I'm better able to cope. Very readable (not a bunch of jargon) I'd recommend it to any mother of a teenage girl. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because there were no illustrations. Of course, as an adult I don't have to have them, but I like them. Sometimes a well-placed cartoon helps to illustrate a point. It may be the authors thought illustrations are inappropriate for their book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great advice if your kids perfect already!","review":"I wouldn't have bought this book if I wasn't dealing with a VERY defiant, and manipulative teenage daughter--so when this book assumes that I can just say the right thing and everything will be fine, is an absolute joke! This advice would be great if it worked as simply as the book says. But if you already have a tough kid, these tips are NOT going to suddenly make her see the logic in my rules. Kids don't care about the explaination of why it's wrong to dress trashy or wear too much makeup...they want what they want. This book assumes that your kid obeys you in the first place! The title really drew me in--I thought that I had finally found a book that understood what I am going through.

Photographs and graphics are of high quality. But the many errors that I recognize make me wary of the rest of the information in the text. Examples: Michael Graves, in his introduction, refers to the street fronting the campus as McMicken Street rather than Clifton Avenue; the most recent additon/enclosure of the Law School is attributed to the wrong architect; President Steger is mistakenly credited with initiating the idea to commission the campus master plan, when the credit should go to Dean Jay Chatterjee. If the publishers plan a second edition, they should see that their writer gets his facts right."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book, despite failings mentioned in other revie","review":"This is another book in the excellent series by Princeton Architectural Press covering US campuses. The book gives a 15 page history of the campus with reference to its architectural roots.Then there are chapters covering each part of the University. Each chapter starts with 3D view of the area to be covered. Then a colour photo of each building is shown together with a page or two of text describing the buildings history, architecture and use. If you are interested in architecture I can strongly recommend all guides in this series. I bought one and was so pleased with it I buy them as they come out and have never been disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would've given it a 3 but...","review":"I like rock. This is not rock. This is jazz fusion. The mix from the board sucked hard. I played it in DTS 5.1, and it was still bad. Steve Morse is on the left channel. The violin is on the right channel. When they play dual leads, the violin buries the guitar. Plus, violin is not rock. When Steve plays lead alone, the rhythm violin buries his lead. The acoustic section is not lead guitar. It's all rhythm music, and gets boring quickly. All in all, very hard to listen to eclectic music. The bassist (Dave LaRue) is the best player in the group period. I saw him play at G3, and he was better than Dream Theater's guitarist (John Petrucci) too. The drummer (Rod Morgenstein of Winger) is the 2nd best player. Steve Morse to me wasn't as good as his band, but with the horrible sound quality, it's hard to be sure.If you buy this, don't buy it to be awed by guitar like with Satriani or Vai, buy it to hear the rhythm section. But still, none of it rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Production - Sorry b/c I love Morse","review":"The Dregs portion of the show looks like it was shot on a old camcorder and the stereo sound is horrific. All Jerry Goodman NO MORSE!!!! Would you like to buy an Eric Clapton DVD and hear everything BUT guitar? I didn't think so and this is the same thing. One guy claims it sounds great if you have a state-of-the-art 5.1 surround sound. I just have a Bose stereo system and it sounds like dirt. Every other DVD I own sounds like butter so explain this to me. Huge dissappointment on my part. Sorry, b/c I LOVE Steve Morse but I can't watch this disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please release another Dregs performance!","review":"The mix on this one is unbelievably bad.

Are there any older videos in the vaults somewhere?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great, especially for the price","review":"This CD had several very danceable pieces, and some great drum solos. The music is from Morocco and Lebannon and uses traditional Middle Eastern instruments tabla, bendir, tambourine, viola, bendir, guitar, violin and drums.Not all of the pieces are ones that I would use to dance to, though, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but there is more than enough here to justify the price.

Most experienced dancers will like it more because it changes tempo and has many accents difficult to pick up to begginers. The only tune I was expecting to hear and never came up was a slow one, you know, so that you can use your veil or get into floorwork, but this is really a great cd to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap I guess","review":"... bought it because it was such a good price, however there is a reason it is so marked-down; the tracks are cheap. The music is mainly drum beats, the same ones over and over.

There are much better CDs for bellydance music out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's OK, nothing special","review":"I expected more, too sweet to me and seams a bit old by smell.

This means that the uniforms for the armies of the United Provinces, Batavian Republic, Kingdom Holland, the French Empire, the Netherlands in the War of Liberation and the Kingdom of the Netherlands are a vast subject to discuss, and it simply doesn't fit into one Osprey volume. The book by R. Pawly and P. Courcelle, \\"Wellingtons' Dutch Allies\\", covers one period and is a lot better. To do justice to this period would be the addition of a volume on the Batavian Republic and the Kingdom Holland. This book simply is too minimal, and it has too many mistakes, since all clich?'s are summed up (again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was awesome!","review":"I love this CD!

This is evident in that she keeps bringing up the other author to slam her.Further,the author admits to the weakness of her thesis, in that there are many examples of prefiminist comics and of postfeminist comics but that the transition between the two mindsets is not documented within the comics.

This saw is comparitively light and very easy to handle. I've never used a saw that ran smoother than this. I use the adjustable handle less than I expected...but It comes in handy when cutting 1/4\\" ply ect. I keep it down for 2x mat.. My only contention with this saw is the exhaust on the casing should be hooded, if you move your head to far down to watch your line you get a blast of sawdust in your face. Also, changing the handle position is awkward. Those are minor annoyances, I still rate this saw 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Read all the reviews here and decided to give it a try. The saw I previously used was a 20 years old SKIL saw. Let me tell you,this saw doesn't hold a handle to the old SKIL. It sounds like any other cheap saw from Harbor Freight (kind of rocks instead of bearings feeling). Besides, a pretty strong vibration would come and go while you are cutting. I don't know what I'm going to choose next, one thing I know for sure, I'm not going to keep this saw. The hight adjustment leaver got jammed and it took all my strength to loosen it. Bottom line, it would be a good $30 saw, not a $130 one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Circular Saw I've Owned","review":"I bought from Amazon about 3 years ago. The LH saw is great for a righty - the blade is much more easily visible than on a RH saw.This saw has a very easy to use blade depth adjustment, and a convenient handle position adjustment. Both are welcome features, and make day-to-day use of this saw a pleasure.I use the 6391-21 to primarily cut sheet goods. The cut quality is excellent. The saw has ample power for 3/4\\" plywood at a rapid pace. The feel and balance are very good.I recommend this saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"Bought this to place a heavy worm drive saw for cabinet making.

A serial killer is on the loose in a small southern town called Eureka, Georgia and the only clue they leave is a small white Bible beside each of the victim's beds. Helen Tyler comes into town and soon begins working for the sherrif, Matt Clevenger, and finds herself also involved with this confusing mystery. Together they work to uncover the identity of a killer and come closer and closer to the answers. The book had a very surprising ending and left me turning the pages for hours at a time.

Here, Lewton delivers something more frank, less mysterious, and thoroughly engaging. \\"No Bed of Her Own\\" reads like a companion to \\"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\\" another novel of the despair borne of poverty. Lewton's writing is spare, clever, and artful, and his heroine, Rose, is pitiful without being pathetic: her slippery slide from stenographer to prostitute is frightening and tragic without being manipulative. The book is a quick read, and the period is captured quite well: along the way we encounter several intriguing characters (both benevolent and poisonous) and Rose learns the limits of her shaky morality. Those who have admired the director's films should find the same kind of sensual detachment that distinguished his thrillers from the forties. Worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book about Benny's work.","review":"This is a large-format hardcover catalog that was produced on the occassion of a large exhibition devoted to Benny's career at the Museum of Television and Radio, New York, in 1991.

But this album is a bit disappointing, knowing what he is capable of. I expected a little more innovation, but it's not only quite unimaginative, the sounds don't seem to fit together well, esp. that harsh sound on track 2.

As for the marrow stuffing, who would be able to access it inside such a long shin shank?

I am hoping the Wii Banana Blitz is better. This game sucks. It sucks because you have to play through the lame story mode to unlock the party games. It sucks because of the horrendous loading times. It sucks because the timed stages get very difficult very quickly, where the others in the series had a progression to the more difficult stages.

That's it.GAMEPLAY 2/5 - The first problem you'll notice are bad camera controls and excessive loading screens.

But this one is completely different from the other two. It was done by a different developer and that's the main reason. In the main game (story mode), you do a lot of exploring and helping the other characters, which can be fun, but gets boring.

Having read and enjoyed his previous work \\"On Killing\\" I couldn't help but be disappointed in this read. If you can tolerate the use of the word \\"WARRIOR\\" in almost every paragraph there are some redeeming sections in the book - especially about perceptual distortions under life threatening situations, how to best train for this, and more than enough 'war stories' to satisfy those so inclined.Readability - 3/5 (some good charts - but the link to research a bit tenuous).Content - 3/5 (too much filler material in my opinion).Humour - not that I can recall - serious business this book.Worth a look.

I also keep contact with many serving members of the armed forces both presently in the field and after they've returned. I've recommended this book many times to troops AND THEIR FAMILIES. I emphasize the latter, because this book may be the one place to get a real insight into what those who put their lives on the line for the rest of us have to deal with.

Like all of his other books, if combat, death, or psychological responses to stress is your thing, this will be a book you cannot put down.

Written in stream-of-consciousness recollections, each paragraph flits from reminscence to reminscence, with Clark as the central figure, raising her daughter and reflecting on the meaning of her marriages. Unless a reader is familiar with all the vacationers crossing paths with Clark, many of the paragraphs in this slim volume will be puzzling more than illuminating. The book may be of value to dissertation writers sifting through Audeniana for obscure name references or datelines; for general readers this will vie for longest 120-page book.

Set in a rural New York county seat outside New York City, it is a courtroom drama of a woman accused of murder and theft, and of the men and women who defend her case. The surprise ending is perhaps as unexpected as any in crime fiction. Cooper used the novel, among other things, to express his discontent with changes in New York State's judicial system during the 1840s, with the corruption of courts and juries, and with new ideas of women's rights. The accused woman, Mary Monson, is a notable character in her own right. The Ways of the Hour should be considered a classic in the history of the mystery novel -- as it is perhaps the first novel to revolve almost entirely about a courtroom murder trial."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well made, attractive soap dish","review":"I bought this soap dish to keep bars of soap from sitting in their own puddle in my flat-bottomed soap dish, and it's worked very well.

There seemed to be another bad song every few minutes. I finally quit the movie halfway through because I got tired of hitting the mute button. Yes, the songs were that annoying. The story was not engaging enough to make me want to tolerate them. I don't think there really was a lot to the story, which is why they had to fill in so much of the movie with singing.

Kayley goes off into the Forbidden Forest to search for it and she meets Garret who used to be a stable boy but went away to live as a hermit because his eyes were blinded in an horrible accident. He lives alone with Ayden who guides him along the way. As they go off in search for Excalibur,they meet a two-headed dragon(s) who hates 'each other'. Together, they search for the magical sword.Any fantasy-lover would love this movie. The voice of Garret is Cary Elwes and Kayley's voice is Jessalyn Gilsig. Sir Ruber's voice is Gary Oldman.

The cringe-worthy songs are poorly have terrible lyrics and unimaginative ballad feel. The main character is generally unlike-able. The comic-relief characters have groan-worthy annoying jokes. One of the worst family animated movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious movie","review":"I think this movie is hilarious. It is so terrible in some aspects, that it makes you almost die of laughing. Take the song, \\"The Prayer\\". Beautiful song, terrible for it's scene however. It is trying to be Disney. The dragons' song? Genie from \\"Aladdin\\". Kayley is so much like Belle, it's not even funny. The only reason I give this 4 stars, and not 5, is because Garret and Kayley's relationship is far too cheesy. I mean, the other cheesy stuff was funny, but this is getting ridiculous! I recommend this for adults with a sense of humor and small children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful soundtrack!","review":"This is one of the greatest animated movies I've ever seen. It's sound track is excellent. I find myself rewinding certain parts just to see my favorite songs over again. The movie is very funny and has a good plot as well. It also shows how someone can overcome obstacles such as blindness."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Arrived In Two Days! Very Quickly!","review":"We ordered it on 4/28/11 and it came on 4/30/11!

A well done \\"kids movie\\" can be \\"ageless.\\" That being said, the producers of \\"Quest for Camelot\\" didn't have a clear idea of the target audience: going from ridiculously extreme childishness in some parts, to other parts in which the humor is likely only going to be appreciated by adults familiar with old-time R-rated movies. Now, that may be forgivable, but...Using five-star \\"Mulan\\" as the standard, \\"Quest for Camelot\\" lacks quality in so many areas. The animation itself is poorer, the story rather less uplifting, the soundtrack more raw. \\"Quest for Camelot\\" is not completely without redeeming features - that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1 - but it's a far cry from the excellence of \\"Mulan.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Quest for a good Animated Movie","review":"I enjoyed Quest for Camelot. I am a complete movie freak, and I've seen just about everything. Quest for Camelot has everything. Humor, drama, romance, and a good WaFF(warm and fuzzy feeling) for the kids. I personally believe they could have done alot more with Merlin, him being an obvious favorite to most King Arthur and Camelot lovers. The characters were well rounded, even including blind-stricken Garett, which adds to the whole anti-perfection thing. The only thing about this movie that puzzles me, is a trivial question of why they chose to make the Griffin and Dragon(s) speak, but not the Silver-winged hawk(being previously Merlin's who is a wizard). QfC gets a 5 from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I love this movie. The dragon's are great, bicker bicker bicker. The music is good, I bought the soundtrack.

It's a good Disney story that ends right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Animation with By-The-Book Storyline.","review":"I've seen this same storyline about 100 times before; plucky heroine on a quest, meets partner to help with quest-- and, oh yeah, goofy creatures/animals (that talk, natch) to provide comic relief. This one lands in the BORING category. Not worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fun and More!","review":"Stretching the truth of the Knights Of The Round table, just a little, this is a great story for kids. Teaching them courage and trust and friendship.The voices are great, Cary Elwis, Pierce Brosnen, Jane Seymore, John Cleese, Don Rickles and the singing talents of the Corrs, Celene Dion and Steve Perry. This has a wonderful score and the soundtrack is just as good. Great lyrics and music.The DVD has three fun features that make it just as interesting for the adults and the kids, but I am sure the kids will have far more fun. Technically it is a well put together film and the music and sound effects are brilliant.The story is sweet and touching and the comedy sprinkled throughout. A must for every family or animated feature fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great movie","review":"I happened to be watching Scooby Doo: Zombie Island (VHS) when I saw the commercial for this movie. I was intrigued and not at all swayed by some bad reviews of it. I bought it and watched the rental at least three times, and I love it. I loved all of the musical numbers, especially \\"I Stand Alone\\" and the one that the two of them sing. The bad guys were a little cheesy looking and not at all deadly. But I loved how they made the major bad guy Ruber look pretty twisted. It's definitely apparent who the bad guy is right off. I don't have anything really bad to say about this movie. It was delivered about a day and a half ahead of schedule, which is always great. I just wish I had a Kindle Fire so I could download it. No, I just have a second generation one. Anyway, this movie is definitely a good one to watch with little kids--they'll love the music, the adventure and aren't knights pretty cool to kids?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many big names, so much disappointment","review":"I can't believe how many big name actors signed on to do voices for this fairly lame story. First of all, although it's not Disney, it follows the Disney formula of the time having a \\"girl power\\" message and featuring lots of sappy songs (none of which were sung by the actors who did the speaking voices). Second of all it was generally very formulaic: heroic girl meets heroic but unappreciated guy, they fall in love and save the day and everyone starts to appreciate the guy. There is the obligatory sidekick (two in this case, the two-headed dragon Devon/Cornwall). Ruber's a typical 'evil looking' bad guy. His minions are straight out of Disney, too. The dialogue was unexceptional; the songs were sappy and we couldn't figure out the words. I am glad this was on Amazon's bargain rack because if I'd paid more than the $7.49 I'd be really, REALLY disappointed.My 8-year-old son liked Devon & Cornwall but otherwise was rather bored with the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treasure of Camelot","review":"Beautiful animation, great message and most importantly - the amazing music. \\"Quest for Camelot\\" beats some of the Disney animated features and is a true must-see for both children and adults. If you find the plot somehow lacking, the Broadway-style songs with a pop sensibility to them will make everything up for you. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for some mindless history...","review":"Not a bad book, you could be reading something completely devoid of content. However, I am very concerned about not only the content in this book (\\"Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy\\"???) but also the way is presented. At various points throughout my reading, I felt as if my intelligence were being insulted. Perhaps this book is aimed more at a non-history lover kind of audience and is written in a \\"verbal-candy\\" kind of way. At any rate, if you can't get the middle name of one of your main subjects right (it's Robert FRANCIS Kennedy for anyone not in the loop), then what about all of the other details? I am left wondering how much of the content was historically accurate and how much is there purely for entertainment. If books were newspapers, this one would be somewhere between the New York Post and Star (the tabloid)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some feuds that changed history.","review":"This is a nice easy read. Each feud is roughly twenty pages long and makes for some nice light reading. Some I wouldn't rate as world changing, but they are interesting. I did not know much about any one one dispute--except perhaps Montgomery and Patton. The McCoy-Hatfield feud was also very interesting and I can't remember that much written about that from other sources. This is an interesting bit of history, and perhaps there are some other feuds that may rate higher than what the author selected (Shah versus Khomeni).This book is a nice weekend or beach read. The reader will be amazed at the hatred these feuds generated. Evans does a nice job of detailing these pointed conflicts in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS TAMAGOTCHI","review":"This tamagotchi is the best thing for kids 8 and up.

You can even put it on pause or turn the sound off if you don't want to hear the beeping. Version 3 only has a passport where you can travel. Also, if you log on to www.tamatown.com to get passwords and then type them into your tamagotchi you will receive prizes. She can pick the meals and snacks for version 3 only and there are no treats.

Some of my friends have V3s and love them. They look so cool. Tamagotchi is so cool and I would not regret getting a V3. I think anyone who wants a pet and can't get one would lovethis pet. Anyone who does have a pet would love it too. And, it's not just a girl toy. I know a lot of boys who have them and really like them. I can't wait to get a V3 and play with it all the time. Another cool thing is, it has so many different characters. You will get something different almost every time. I hope my advice about the coolest toy ever has helped you make your decision.

There is no setup for \\"The Journey.\\" The editing is amateurish with some segments lasting way too long like the grueling Mark Chapman interview recalling the moments before and after he killed Lennon. The clips are just not that interesting. My impression is that the producer(s) had access to some third-rate archival footage and decided to make a buck.

Same bashing, same point of views."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timely Read","review":"For those of us trying to make some sense of the tragedy of Sept 11 2001, this book is a must read. The author spent years living and traveling in the Middle East. His interpretation of the Arab culture and subsequent behaviors, published in 1990, is chillingly pertinent to todays events. Time and again I found myself relating his explanations to the events happening currently and finding answers for every behavior in his relation of the Tribalism, values, society, familial relationships,and acculturation of Arabs over the last 500 years. Particularly chilling and uncannily prophetic is his conclusion. To paraphrase, the West should avoid involvement in Arab affairs but if it must get involved, do so with overwhelming and sustainable force."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hateful","review":"Mr. Pryce-Jones has managed to put together a multitude of reasons why we of the advanced West should never trust an Arab. They're untrustworthy, they care only about their own clan, they make a practice of political murder, etc, etc.Mr. Pryce-Jones has apparently never experienced the upside of dealing with Arabs, such as their ability to negotiate reconciliations and the basic freedom of belief that exists in most portions of the Arab world. This book reminds me of the kind of material printed about the Japanese during World War II. It provides us with all we need to hate the Arabs.How fitting that a new edition is coming out now, just while the USA is planning another war against Iraq. Perhaps the publisher should consider a gift-boxed edition for the Christmas season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on the ME I have ever read","review":"Even though it dates from the late 1980's, DPJ's \\"The Closed Circle\\" is one of the finest books on the Middle East I have come across and is as valuable today as ever. Rather than giving a very dry and distant overview of this complex region, the author uses his own experiences and intimate knowledge of local customs and history to give us a startling view of the culture and logic of the Middle East in general, and the Arab world in particular. For a historical overview of the ME, I would recommend any one of Bernard Lewis's books, but to really get an understanding of how different, and yet predictable, Middle Eastern logic and values are, this is by far the best resource.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patai's Arab Mind again","review":"This work has many similar themes and conclusions of an earlier work , Raphael Patai's\\" Arab Mind\\". Both authors see the Arab world as in a sense imprisoned by its own Culture, unable to escape the force of Custom and Habit. Both see the Arab world as being unable to overcome and recreate itself.A third major voice which reads the present Arab world as one in decline is that of Bernard Lewis.Pryce-Jones focuses on the honor- shame nexus as a major element in the Arab world's relation to others. He also sees how life closed in on clan and tribe prevents the kind of free alliance and association that helps make Democracy move.This work is filled with evidence for the contention that the Arabs not only have not learned to modernize, but they are not likely to soon.This work does not make for happy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I couldn't believe that on this CD there are 13 songs of which 10 are also on \\"Broadway Phantasy\\" of Timothy Breese.

But as it nears the end the story falls into incoherence and suffers from obviously deleted scenes. If the script were tighter then this film could have been great as David Twohy's direction is not really to blame.He creates a unique atmosphere and nice underwater visuals that give the film an original look. I just wish that the horror/spooky aspect of the movie were stronger. When the ghosts appear they do so in a genuinely creepy way that seems 'realistic'. It's these parts of Below that I like but it gets way too silly towards the end. The cast is unusually solid with the exception of Olivia Williams, who is horribly miscast and fails to make any connection with the audience or bring her character to life.The DVD is sports a powerful Dolby 5.1 soundtrack with a great looking 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"wake me up","review":"This was slow paced for me. The horror was too subtle and delicate to leave an impression on me.

The entire cast is annoying, the thrills are hackneyed tricks, (doors fly open with a blast with people suddenly standing there, etc). I couldn't relate to or cheer for anyone, and it was disjointed, predictable, with a soundtrack that made it difficult to follow dialogue, and parts of the period just did not look period enough.

I would rate this film at four and a half stars and say it has been overlooked by the general public. It is an American-British collaboration with some very solid performances and chemistry between roles. The story boils down to what a sailor calls a \\"malediction\\" in the movie, a wrongful death with a spirit left to haunt the ship seeking justice.

The men depicted on this sub would never be allowed into the miltary, especially around the time of WWII. How would it have hurt the story to have these men actually act like men? Answer; it wouldn't. Just part of the agenda. Anyone else notice this?

But even while actively looking for it, I still almost missed it! It's distributer, Dimension, a subsidiary of Mirimax, just plopped it out with virtually NO advertisement at all. The only TV commercial I saw was while visiting Dallas, with no ads ever seen in my home city of Houston. Still, my persistence paid off and I did see it on the big screen, thinking what a shame it was that this unique and high quality film should receive such shoddy treatment from Dimension. This could have been a sleeper hit, had they advertised just a bit more. I strongly recommend Below as a cross-genre success, with superb sub action a la Das Boot, and sublime creepiness a la 1963's The Haunting.

You never really know if what is happening is real or not. You really feel the same way that the characters should be feeling at the same moment. You feel confused and scared. The whole movie is covered in eerie goo. The movie is practically dripping with it. There is a little bit of a plot to figure out that lends itself to explaining why things are as they seem to be. But, then again, are they? Does any of it happen? Or, is everyone suffering from guilt and letting their minds play games with them? I don't know, nor will you, but you will be just as confused as they are in the movie and that is a good thing. This will disturb and scare you.Far better than Ghost Ship is. But then again, what movie isn't better than Ghost Ship?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty Thriller","review":"I went into this movie with rather low expectations, having failed to realize its obvious connection with Pitch Black (which I loved). Frankly, I rented Below from the library and it was due back today, so I began watching it last night at midnight, giving myself the option to turn it off if I was bored. I never was.What impressed me most was the emphasis on suggestion rather than gratuitous violence - a refreshing change from the usual movie fare these days. Several other reviewers have mentioned mood. In fact, mood plays such a big part here that it almost upstages the actors. This is actually okay because what is required of these actors is tough to pull off - \\"authentic\\" human response to weird and unexplainable stuff.I keep returning to the notion of \\"nifty.\\" I was consistently pleased during the entire film - also a tough thing to pull off. Because of Pitch Black + Below, I have added another director to my list of favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splashes.","review":"An effective movie that was extreemly well lensed, BELOW is one of the better submarine movies out there. Tense and claustraphobic, this story of WW2 submariners dealing with supernatural happenings hits the mark with some erie momments and cool visuals. The very end of the picture has some silly scenes that could've been better orchestrated, but other than that the film is solid- it moves quickly and with purpose. The DVD is very good and the sound on the disc and in the film is nothing less than awesome. A great scary movie for late night viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the acting that makes it great","review":"All the positive reviews are right....this is a great genre film.But it's not the pitch perfect subtle horror....or the best underwater action since Hunt For Red October.

The cast works together so well you imagine they must have rehearsed for months....there is not a \\"wrong\\" moment on screen.....a master script!The releasing company buried this great film...and if it wasn't for the reviews I read on Amazon...I might have missed it.Thanks to everyone who writes a review....good or bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found the section on listening problems in this book a big disappointment.

While it's not bad, I'll probably never listen to it again because I could name at least 200-300 funk/soul CDs that are better than this one.

From the funky title track to the warm and moving ballads she displays a talent that has not been heard of since early Nancy Wilson. With the help of great producer Mtume, Phyllis has been given the chance to strut her stuff and not be afraid too.

I often wondered (Like many others I'm sure) why there wasn't a follow up to \\"You Know How To Love Me\\" which turned out to be the biggest selling album of Hyman's career.

I will be switching to the individual AVON cleanser and AVON toner, only because I've read that using a 2-in-1 cleanser/toner is not as effective as using them seperately. Besides, the Avon ANEW RETROACTIVE+ 2-in-1 Cleanser cost $12.00 for 4.2 oz, where the cleanser and toner by themselves cost $12.00 each but you are getting 5.1 oz.

In his hey day I don't think there was another boxer who gave us such a brutal display of raw power. This documentary is very good, but there are a few issues with it that kept me from giving it 5 stars. The biggest reason is that at certain points the producer uses a split screen with multiple bits of dialogue that over lap and this is not only distracting, but actually brings on unintentional humor as it makes it look like Tyson is just rambling! It's a heartbreaking story and all the makers of this film needed to do is turn the camera on. We don't need any optical tricks as Mike's tragic to inspiring and then tragic again life is more than enough to hold one's interest.

There are always two sides to every coin or story and when the public only gets the media's side...there are things not revealed.

He reveals the good, the bad and the ugly from his youth, his rise in boxing, his relationships, jail, rape allegations, the rich life and being broke, among many other chapters in his life. We get a close look at his kids and see the fatherly side of him. Along with his narrative, you see clips of footage from boxing matches, interviews, etc. The infamous ear biting of Evander Holifield is analyzed and gave me a new perspective on that fight.

His is not an analytical or honest mind. The monologues that comprise the vast majority of the minutes taped for this documentary are endless and cannot be trusted. What I hoped for here was historical analysis and that is not what Tyson, the movie, offers. Ten minutes of interview with our subject would be profitable but ninety minutes is a waste of everyone's time. I suppose this endeavor is deemed artistic and poignant by critics, but I disagree with such a conclusion. A worm's eye view remains the view of a worm. This film was a serious disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"After looking at this taped interview. It really was almost like watching 60 minutes.

Putting a little slot for the stylus on the outside would have made more sense.There's a very thin layer of foam inside but I'm quite skeptical of this case's ability to protect from falls or impact.In short, poor ergonomics, cool look. I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the line","review":"I wanted the best and I got the best. The Rhinoskin cover is the best way to really protect your Palm PC. It fits the PalmV like a glove and has a thin layer of rubber inside. While it will not act as a wallet or credit card holder it provides a permanent fix to bumping the on/off button, is very heavy-duty and durable, and just looks darn cool.The Palm device mounts on a stylus-shaped rod that is also hinged in with the two halves of the case. So by opening the case fully and swinging the Palm out between the two halves of the case it is possible to fit it in the Hotsync cradle on a flat surface. However, if you really want to have the Palm device in the cradle and see the screen, you can set the cradle on a book or just slide the Palm device out of the case.I haven't found any of this to be much of a hassle(just descibing it is).I am a farmer, so I need extreme Palm protection. If you do too, I suggest the Rhinoskin cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Scenery","review":"The acting and screen-play are poor, but the scenery, and the cinematography that captures it, are beautiful.I would suggest Enchanted April instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in substance","review":"I purchased this movie because of the star power and because of the location on Lake Como. Redgrave wasted her time and was surprisingly awful in this movie. The plot was weak and seemed to have little direction. What a shame!

And rightly so, the scenary is nice (not magnificent) and true. It looks like all scenes, including indors, are filmed at location.But the story and the acting suites as an afternoon tv movie at best. Specially Uma Thurman looks like overplaying every scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever","review":"This was an incredibly boring, poorly acted, dumbly directed movies I have ever seen. I was surprised how poorly even Vanessa Redgrave acted. My wife and I sat through the whole movie thinking something interesting will happen. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A month was too long","review":"This movie did not do anything for me, unless causing irritation counts. I love Vanessa Redgrave and all things Italian, especially the beautiful scenery. But even they couldn't save the day, especially since I didn't care for Ms. Redgrave's role in this. She can do much better. I felt the movie was shallow and not very well scripted. I didn't bother to finish watching to see what happened to the characters at the end, because frankly, my dear, I didn't give a -----."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic contemporary surf...from Boston???","review":"A store clerk recommended this album to yours truly while I was purchasing some old 60s surf guitar classics. I was skeptical, to put it mildly...most contemporary surf music really leaves something to be desired. Bands turn the reverb all the way up and call it \\"surf\\", but it's just not the same. And these guys aren't even from SoCal! How good could it be?But this is true, honest-to-god, bust-out-the-boards-and-hang-ten surf, in the tradition of The Chantays, The Pyramids, The Avengers, and The Ventures. The guitar riffs sound great, and the band is clearly having a lot of fun, which is what surf music is really all about. In fact the only feature of this CD that makes it obvious this is a contemporary band and not out of the 60s is the quality of the recording. The \\"spooky Halloween\\" theme can be a little silly, but the music's good enough that it really doesn't matter.It doesn't have to be 40 years old to be real surf music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricing","review":"I agree with the assertions posed by the other two reviews, however my jaw nearly hit the floor when I saw the price... $99.99, ARE YOU INSANE!

This book is absolutely horrible, with a depressing ending that sends a bad message to anyone who is multiple or anyone trying to learn about those who are.And of course, we have the same old \\"must integrate!\\" message being drummed out, which in this book really seems more like murder than healing.I'd give this book 0 stars if possible. People who want a decent book should read The Flock, by Joan Casey or Set This House In Order, by Matt Ruff. Neither of those books are the best things in the world, but they are certainly much better than this garbage.If you have this book, burn it and go do some research on multiplicity that doesn't involve the \\"poor abused victim with the stereotypical alters she must battle and smush together\\" mind-frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Equivalent to Donkey Dung","review":"Being a multiple myself and knowing a--forgive the pun--host of others, I must say that this is one of those books that gives a bad name to our community.

Hanh's simple stories, and delivery of our need to find and be Peace within before there will be Peace in our world, transformed my thoughts on meditation and prayer. It is an excellent starting place for a new journey in self-understanding/spiritual adventure. \\"Breathing in, I calm my body; breathing out, I smile....\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Intro to TNH's Basic Teachings","review":"TNH represents a confluence of the Zen and Theravada traditions, and is a wonderful representative of Buddhism around the globe. His writing, like C.S. Lewis's, is very accessible, yet very profound as well. C.S. Lewis was Christianity's best apologist, and while I would not go so far as to call TNH a Buddhist apologist, he is very good at simplifying abstract concepts for a modern day audience. This book covers such topics as interbeing, interdependence, the five aggregates (what we are made of), the Triple Gem (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha), the meaning of suffering and the value of peace. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Buddhism, or the topic of peace and harmony in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace starts with you","review":"I have never heard something more true.

I could not agree more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provokes insipriation in any one's heart","review":"This book contains a conglomeration of eloquent lectures that will truly stimulate emotion in the heart of the reader.

Her analysis of the limitations of mainstream feminist and lesbigay movements complements Urvashi Vaid's Virtual Equality beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disapointment","review":"I read this book hoping to be empowered by a transgender rights leader. Rikki Wilchins is the founder and president of Gender pac. The book was a total disapointment. Wilchin's bio was not moving at all. The book was filled with graphic sex talk about Wilchin's artifical vagina. She talks about workshops where biological women touch her genitals. The book is vulgar and could make more people have hatred for the transgenderd.

The printed list will serve no purpose if you want to use it for a quick reference at a glance.

Better Than Ever","review":"I had a much earlier version of Hallmark Card Studio and really liked it. I think this new version (Deluxe 2006) is even better. This program is so easy to use and yet able to create some beautiful cards. My favorite part of the program is the Event Planner. The reminders are wonderful. I haven't missed a lecture, appointment, or any other time commitment since loading this program. I love the fact that I can set reminders for days and days ahead. Get this set for yourself and don't be afraid to get it for someone who is not too computer savvy. It should satisfy any user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt Receive Item","review":"We did not receive the item and didn't mention the reason for the refusal to mail the program.

I mainly make greeting cards and having the ability to send the card as an ecard is great, especially with postage increasing soon. I will now use the program to make more cards than I usually have done in the past. I like the ability to change the card format from quarter fold to half fold before you print the card. The ease of printing an envelope is a plus also. This program also has the feature of picking the type of card that you want, funny, sentimental etc and that helps to limit what cards you have to choose from instead of looking at all the cards in a category. My family is very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Very disappointed with this software.

I previously had the 2004 version and loved it. Then I decided to go for the newer and Deluxe version. I have found that there are several cards that are unusuable as there are mistakes on the cards that can't be fixed. Considering that I haven't even got started properly and have already found these cards, I can only imagine what I am going to find as I REALLY get into the program.

The island scenes, the flamboyant shipboard sets...etc. However, the story is too stupid to be believed. I believe there is supposed to be some kind of mystery tucked in and amongst all the vapid and shallow subplots but you will find your mind wandering so often you will not be able to figure out what the mystery is.Then there is some kind of philosophizing which goes on when the main character Gabriel Angel (I guess that name is supposed to have some kind of significance too but who knows what?) makes her speeches about what life is about but, again, it's almost impossible to figure out what the point of these speeches is either.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEFOUR","review":"Brian Auger & The Trinity's 1970 album; re-issued in 1995 by One Way Records.Nine tracks: I Wanna Take You Higher / Pavane / No Time to Live / Maiden Voyage / Listen Here / Adagio per Archi e Organo / Just You, Just Me / Rain Forest Talking / Pavane"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews written by author's friends","review":"Worst book I ever read for a class.

It takes 2 minutes per bowl in the microwave (so if you are 5 people it takes a little time), is seemingly healthy, and our junior (3 years) loves it, too.It can be prepared with water, milk, or a mixture of the two. More milk makes it thicker and smoother.A kind of downside is that the consistency (\\"thickness\\") depends on the mixture of water and milk, the microwave's energy, and even the bowl shape and size (probably it's all about the diameter). One needs to experiment a little with the timing the microwave is set to to prepare it to one's liking.It mixes better if you stir it after a minute in the microwave.All in all, we all love it, and in particular the brown sugar flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"New and Improved Recipe anything BUT improved.","review":"I have been eating this stuff since the '70s or shall I say HAD been.

I do appreciate some of the commentary here, such as those who spot problems with the translation and see overt politicizing from Mahfouz in this work. However, this book so captivated me, and the writing style is easy and fluid (I hate convoluted writing, and this is not like that at all). From the opening pages to the end, I was riveted by the plight of the Kamel family as they struggled through a life of poverty and humiliation in Cairo after the passing of their father/husband. Each of the characters just made my heart ache, and this was especially true of Nefisa. Poor Nefisa! And what courage she had, really. She deserved such a better life, as they all did.This is a classic tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. I really recommend it, and look forward to reading the Trilogy, which is waiting for me on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellis Does His Thing","review":"Herb Ellis's first record for the Dot label was also his last, and his last solo project (apart from a Columbia release around the same time) for the next eight years, during which time he mostly played sessions on other people's albums. With tenor saxman Teddy Edwards, organist Ron Feuer, bassist Monty Budwig, and drummer Stan Levey, he has put together a tight pop-jazz ensemble, in which Ellis' guitar is surprisingly understated in its prominence. This may actually disappoint some fans, though the playing by Edwards and Feuer is certainly pleasing enough, even if Ellis does most of the really interesting improvising, most notably on Ray Brown's \\"AM Blues.\\" \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" is also well worth hearing, for Ellis' and Edwards' playing.

But after having worked on both PCs and Macs for years, like Kelby, I can only recommend that people use Macs.You may pay more, but with Macs you get machines and software that are more reliable, and easier to use.Don't believe me (or Kelby, if you read the book)?Just try a Mac ... believe me, you'll switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't get it","review":"It's funny, I don't go off and write fake reviews for PC books...

You've got to be kidding!","review":"This game has a lot of promise. It has really inovative game play, somewhere in between an rpg and a city builder. The problem is, I haven't been able to get beyond the survival gameplay aspects, in this game because...IT DOES NOT COME WITH A MANUAL, AND THE TUTORIAL IS WORTHLESS!Yes, that's right. And believe me, a game like this is far from self-explanitory. Even after struggling around with it for days, I still have no idea how to play.

Fricker, Jr. and Marc N. Elliott, Conducting Research Surveys Via E-mail And The Web is a practical and accessible guide to applying the pervasiveness of the internet to the gathering of survey data in a much faster and significantly less expensive manner than traditional means of phone or mail communications. Yet online surveys have their own pitfalls that can adversely skew data results. Individual chapters cogently address how to take maximum advantage of the Internet while preserving data integrity, and provide an invaluable look at the future of internet-based survey methods. Simply put, Conducting Research Surveys Via E-mail And The Web is a \\"must-read\\" for anyone in academia, government, social issue activism, or business who is contemplating running a survey through the use of electronic mail or a webpage."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Mpessed","review":"This is the best CD we have ever heard here at the University of Tampa.

I felt that the book was heavy on antecdotes and light on practical principles and motivation. The author failed to show how his examples could be used in life outside of the real estate business.For business motivation I much prefer Brian Tracy's works. His books are organized, well written and universal across the board; for all sectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You're a Realtor","review":"This book is about the importance of appearing strong in the context of dealing with people you depend on in business transactions and with whom you rarely interact and mostly do so from a distance. Its about disguising your weaknesses to people who are very likely to never put you to a serious test. This is no dealing-with-difficult-people-or-bullies book. It won't boost your confidence. It won't teach you anything other than a few external tactics on how to trick people into thinking you're better than you really are, in business transactions. Great book if you're a realtor who feels intimidated by property owners and lenders. Plus its an easy read as a lot of the book is based on stories of his past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I tried to read this but just couldn't get into it.

Over the years, Ringer has had to fend off misunderstandings derived more from the humorlessness and literalism of critics than any great lapses in the book. I'd have been happier with just a new afterword responding to critics. Still, some of the rewordings and additions of this edition are of interest, and Ringer fans should look at both books. (I do wonder why he leaves intact an anecdote about a ruthless lender who knows that the borrower from whom he has just extracted a slew of concessions on the terms of a loan agreement is already in default as soon as he signs that agreement.)

For example, whereas plans had been for Danny and Vicki to get together, it ends up not happening for fear Danny not single would ruin the premise of the show. Thus, we are left imagining only what could have been. Also, Michelle is now definitely out of her cute little kid phase, yet the plots tend to focus more and more on her and her friends. They are fun and entertaining plots, but you have to get used to her at this age and not everyone is a fan of that, I understand.

I'm tired of listening to techno that doesn't convey an image when you listen to it. If you like to let your imagination roam with the help of good electronica then Lifeforms is for you. Like 'Dark Side of the Moon' by Pink Floyd this music allows for introspection and reflection . This to me outdoes The Orb or Aphex Twin by a mile. Although it might not be melodious 100% of the time it still conveys emotion through its thought out production. This is a must for any die hard ambient or idm fanatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm feeling old.","review":"So is this the new wave of music?

This album was recommended to me by a sales clerk when I told him that I had enjoyed FSOLs work on \\"Papua New Guinea\\" and \\"We have explosive\\". Boy, was he off-course. As much as I tried, I just couldn't get into this album. I sat with the lights off, burning candles, doing yoga, etc. and all I could think was.. whatever. It doesn't seem that FSOL put any thought into this album whatsoever. It consists of randomness and not much else. Frankly, if I could return this cd, I would. I don't recommend this to anyone that enjoys structured music, or who likes rhythm: this album will drive you mad. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifeforms review","review":"This CD is great.

It seems in Newford the only way to discover the magic now is to come from such a crippled and abused background that you can't function in this world anymore. All the stories devolve into subject of the year abuse stories with hints that magic acts as only as a counselor.

Just stay clear of this book as a starter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice collection of short stories","review":"I was first introduced to Charles De Lint's short stories in other anthologies, and that spurred me to find one of his collections. The stories are well-crafted and introspective, although the author occasionally becomes a bit heavy-handed in getting his themes across. \\"Saskia,\\" \\"The Big Sky,\\" and \\"Held Safe by Moonlight and Vines\\" are memorable pieces in this anthology. _Moonlight and Vines_ is the first book I've ever read by this author, but I will go searching for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"PCT lessons learned","review":"I read Ray Jardine's PCT handbook after a grueling California hike.

It stars Patrick Swayze as a tough convict who kidnapps his own kids from a dasterdly Foster Care Center in rout to \\"The Big Final Score\\" and then the mayhem begins. Also in the cast is a young Halle Berry as a newspaper writer trying to help Swayze, Sabrina Lloyd (Sliders), and Brian Bonsell (Whose The Boss) as the unrully kids.

Of all the footage that could have been shown to portray the signature diva there sure didn't seem to be much thought put into the footage that would represent her true artistry. Compare her 20th century women DVD or even the BET live footage and you can see a dramatic difference. Although, it's not terrible, the whole concert is short and just not felt. I've waited for some time to hear/see her older hits, minus all jazz, being put to DVD, but I was greatly disappointed because many a time I've seen and heard better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rx for Fear","review":"Overcoming the Fear Within provides illuminating insight into the spiritual, psychological and physical dynamics of fear and its effects. As well, and as the title indicates, this book contains a helpful testimony and hopeful remedy to overcoming fears unrelated to present physical danger. The author offers a balanced treatment of the subject matter through concepts illustrated with examples and practical solutions that can be readily applied. Overcoming the Fear Within has a thoroughly scriptural basis, and is well-appointed with helps, notes and an appendix. This book should be read by those struggling with fears, phobias, or fear-based illness and any who wish to minister to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just a CD, sure...","review":"This is one of my favorites from college back in the 70's - it was only available in used vinyl for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you missed this one in the 70's, now is the time!","review":"I have been collecting music since the early 70's but somehow I missed this one.

My only beef with this DVD was that it should have inlcuded the full versions of Making the Video, Launch and the BRIT award performance. Also I did think there were too many live performances of the same song (Like I Love You & Cry Me A River). I wouldve like to have seen a live performance of Rock Your Body or Senorita.

You have to feel sorry for some of the stars who signed on, especially Whoopi Goldberg, who as an OSCAR winning actress, really deserves better. Eric Idle comes off unfunny, even irritating, which, as a Python star I'd never thought would be possible. Sly Stallone seems fed up, but maybe thankful for the work after his career was beginning to dry up (though his career seems to be revived at the moment).It says a lot when the parody (this film) seems worse than the movie genre it is taking a shot at.

The component itself looks okay, since I just received it I am not commenting on it. I paid an additional $10 for the remote, which was dirty, sticky, and broken. The batteries would not go in easily and looks they will not stay on track. I had to tape the cover to stay on and it looks like that was done before because the item was sticky and the glue from the tape was still on it. I had a hard time getting it to work with the component because it looks like the remote was pulled open before and all the keys do not function because of that. Not worth returning because of amount, but I will have problems with it until a new one I ordered today from the manufacturer comes in. I hope it will work with the component and I don't have in problems there. I usually don't write reviews, but this inconvenienced me and I had to spend another $20 dollars for a new remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"dv2140 is the unit I ended up getting","review":"I had to return this product, could not get the dvd to work, so I sent it back to shipper, did not experience any problems with vendor getting RMA # and permission to return defective item"},{"rating":"1","title":"Draw your own conclusion...","review":"...Technical Data link for this product says:\\"Item Package Quantity: 1\\" - nothing more, nothing less. Doesn't say much for this item does it?!Who's responsible for that anyway, Amazon or GoVideo?

It is a lot of ambient tracks, with some voice-overs and vocal expressions, but nothing that really captivates the listener. If you are a fan of really experimental music, you may like this. If you are looking for song structure and melody, then you probably want to check elsewhere. I took nothing away from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned into my mind","review":"I've read alot of books in the past 50 years.

The gun was broken after the first day of using it in the jobsite. I was so frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and fragile","review":"This gun has a serious problem, the \\"air tube\\" is thin-wall aluminum and structurally supports the plastic handle. It gets stressed, fatigues, and snaps right where it enters the metal body. Even if you find the part, replacing it is very difficult, because Wagner glues it in!! Another problem is the clunky fluid control, you have very little control and cannot reduce or increase the fluid flow beyond a tight range. All in all, the gun functions adequately if everything is within specs.... perhaps it will even last long enough to finish a single project--that was not the case for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time and money","review":"This does not clean down deep! After using it until the water ran clear, as per instructions, I had to hand squeeze and rinse as much as I usually do without this gizmo.

But the very obvious lip-sinking of their own voices destroyes the enjoyment for me; as does much of the camera work. The editorial states that the director of the film wanted to stay with Puccini -- but the ending of the first act is definitely not Puccini. For these reasons I did not like the first act, but remained to the end. The second act almost saved it and alone is worth watching. The rest is dreadful."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Boheme: The Film w/Villazone and A.

My library had the dvd and I brought it home with great expectations.What a disaster! The video quality may be o.k. but it takes someone who is definitely not an opera lover to put up with a production where the singers are OBVIOUSLY lip-synching. (Pavarotti's Rigoletto with the incredible Victoria Vergera as Maddalena is an even worse example of a production rendered unwatchable because of the apparent idiotic presumption that the viwer would accept it because of the star power involved)Shame on everyone involved in this mess. Zero stars if allowed.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape of a masterpiece","review":"It's inconceivable, a terrible production with no chemistry no soul, everything else is being said by other reviewers.

I would have killed to see thison the big screen in full surround, et al. Suffice to say,this film captures a 'La Boheme' no Metropolitan Operasatelitte simulcast ever could - meaning, it preservesthe performances of Netrebko and Villazon as, what arelikely to be, the definitive Mimi and Rodolfo.

McKenna's ramblings are virtually incoherent. His voice and cadence is so annoying, I actually had to stop listening. It makes me want to slap him in the face and shake him by the shoulders and tell him to GET TO THE POINT! The only problem is that McKenna HAS no point. He's just a nut job with a microphone.The music itself is so cliche it's embarrassing. Didgeridoos, and other over used quasi-psychedelic samples play over and over with no direction whatsoever while McKenna drones on over them about nothing whatsoever.This sort of music could only possibly appeal to a stoned college kid without the sense to know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good For Background Music","review":"I've enjoyed the more recent offerings from Spacetime Continuum, so I thought this might be something worthy of my collection. I was wrong. While the music is good, it's often overpowered by the annoying, nasally ramblings of Terence McKenna, a man who randomly spouts off ideas that only a tweaked-out raver could appreciate. Of the six tracks contained on this CD, there were only two that were really worth listening to again: the only two that Terence, thankfully, was not a part of."},{"rating":"2","title":"detailed Culture Club in its heyday","review":"This book was compiled by two journalists at the height of Culture Club's fame, during their \\"Colour by Numbers\\" season. The book has a discography, drawings from fans, and much, much more. Most notably, there is a photo of Jon Moss kissing Boy George smack on the mouth. Remember, this was 15 years before VH-1's \\"Behind the Music\\" documentary. Further, there are photos of Mickey Craig's children and Roy Hay's (ex?) wife. Additionally, attention is paid to the other members, though Boy has a disproportionate emphasis. I still own my copy of this book and I am pretty sure I'd never part with it. If I ever met Boy George, I'd probably want him to sign this book as much as I would an actual Culture Club LP (I am dating myself) or CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessory For Old SkyFi","review":"Needed another to augment my system at home.

So I did, and I was extremely happy with it. It described the characters very well, and the words and how Christa Faust worded everything was just amazing. I read little sections of the book all the time, just like I watch the movie all the time. Very good book overall. If you loved the movie, or any other movie from the series and haven't seen the third, I suggest you do and read the book. People who loved FD3 will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Regrets About This One!","review":"This book consists of a lengthy main story that is a fascinating tale about the murder of a ship's pilot by his wife. It is followed by multiple separate but equally compelling stories that while tragic, are poignant and quite interesting.Ann Rule continues to unfold stories with great attention to the backgrounds of the people in her novels and the locations relevant to their lives. She has a clear interest in why people do what they do and obvious respect for the justice system and crime victims. Her \\"way with a word\\" just gets better with time. This is a must have book for anyone that enjoys true crime stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as interesting as her other books","review":"I have read most of Ann Rule's books, but somehow found this one less intriguing than her other books. I felt that the main story of the ship pilot could have been omitted. However, I will keep reading her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann Rule writes another winner","review":"Ann Rule only enhances her reputation as the world's best true crime writer with her latest book, No Regrets. No other writer, true crime or otherwise, connects with her readers and draws us into the lives of the people she writes about like Ann. The pictures serve to give faces to the pictures Ann paints with her words. And her compassion shines through, as always, with each word she writes. We care because she cares. My only regret is that Ann can't write faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"good reading","review":"Always good. Fast delivery and the book arrived in the condition that was promised. You can not go wrong with a purchase of one of Ann Rule's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This was my first Ann Rule book to read. I found it to be very interesting that I bought more. Great book Ann!~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting stories, but poorly written","review":"I usually try to enjoy Ann Rule\`s books for what they are...decent retellings of infamous cases. Although her longer works are usually better than these collections (Green River Running Red stands out) I thought this book was rather poorly written. Her phrasing was often lazy as she used certain descriptive terms over and over again. Also, in the book\`s second story, she reports several items wrongly, most notably the name of the song that supposedly enraged her while she recounted that particular tale. Overall, it was a disappointing writing effort from an author who should know better."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER HOME RUN","review":"ANN RULE reinforces her status as the best true crime author EVER. NO REGRETS is a compelling read. As always when reading ANN RULE, I felt a need to reach into the book and protect each victim from his/her inevitable fate. The short stories that follow the book length feature are tragic but brilliantly written and filled with ANN's signature compassion. This is another ANN RULE book that I will add to my collection and re-read in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rule Rocks!","review":"There is a real good reason why Ann Rule has had such a long and successful career - she's very good at what she does. All of her books are impossible to put down and her style of writing draws you in and sticks with you. \\"No Regrets\\" is truly a page-turner. At our house, a new Ann Rule book is a mandatory buy so maybe we're a bit prejudiced. But when I tell you that a new book from her is an occasion for us (my wife and myself) or that we buy hard cover AND paperbacks of each book AND we pass them around to spread the word, it's true. I highly recommend \\"No Regrets\\" to anyone from the reader with a casual interest in true crime to a professional forensic scientist. This paperback would make a terrific, inexpensive gift.The only bad part of being an Ann Rule fan is waiting for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Read !!","review":"Ann Rule must have run out of good stories to write about. I have read all her books, and every one has been great, and I usually zip through them in a few days, but this one was just awful. It took me 2 months to read....I actually had to FORCE myself to pick it up and read it. It was awful, and it was boring, and didnt get better by the end. Very disappointing. Very boring. Just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standards","review":"These stories are not very compelling. I found it hard to be interested in the cases. I usually finish a book in this series in two days or so, but this one lingered for a week, and I skipped the endings of at least two of the chapters. Here's hoping for a return to her past mastery, next time out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I'm sorry I purchased this book.

Most of the Trixie Belden books are really good, but this is pretty weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civility Is Not Dead","review":"This tell-it-like-it-was gem about the author's thirty years of public service is nothing less than remarkable. Adroitly written with good humor, Stone's quiet, but dogged steadfast nature is wonderfully evident in every page and makes you count your lucky stars that people like him actually join the ranks of our government. These experiences should serve as a guide for future generations of civil servants tackling the often thankless and misunderstood job of government service. But more than that - there is a lesson plan for all of us who navigate the treacherous waters of small and big organizations alike. I for one, plan to give this book to my twenty-one-year-old college graduate to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"This cd was awful, I also bought \\"travlin songs\\" by the same label. My kids kindergarten class could have done better. It sounded like a bunch of kids screaming at the top of their lungs.

Ekkk I would not recommend purchasing this or any music from this recording label Kids Direct."},{"rating":"1","title":"The kids like it, but I sure don't","review":"This album is atrocious. Some of the singing on it will undoubtedly make the listener reach for the dial to shut it off. But my kids keep asking for these songs, so what really matters here? My perception of it? Or the kids? There are plenty of standards here that can be found on other albums, and performed much better I'm sure.

A shame, because they were easily on a par with their contemporaries - Genesis, Yes, etc. Live Tapes not only showcases the best songs from the Octoberon and Gone to Earth albums - the zenith period of the band's career - these songs actually benefit from the spacious live sound. Taking Me Higher is thus transformed from a cracking song into three minutes of sonic glory, while Poor Man's Moody Blues stretches the limits of orchestral grandeure. The vocal performances are spot on and the harmonies send goosebumps down my spine. Essential listening, I would say, for fans of symphonic rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"BJH best livealbum","review":"This is the Barclay James Harvest album that introdused me to Barclay James Harvest. It caputured me, I played it again and again. Later I baught all the other albums.The classic songs from Child of Univers, Poor Mans Moody blues, Mocingbird, Taking me Higher, Suicide and Hymn are given a new dimension from the original soundtracks. The songs have a stronger dynamical and emotional feeling that goes straight to your heart. Guitarist John Lees, bassplayer Les Holroy and keaybordist Wooly Wolstenholme all gives their distinct voices to some incredible good harmonies. Together with drummer Mel Pritchard they are one of the most underrated bands of the 70's. It's not to late to discover them, try this album first!My favourite song?

I am pretty dissatisfied with the cd. In the more dramatic parts of the piece, it just seemed like they were going through the paces. The little elaborations of the music in my opinion took more away from the performance than they added. I would reccomend buying a different copy of Carmina Burana if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds nothing like Bad Co","review":"With apologies to fans of Mott, I'll send my CD to you if you pay the courier! Ian Hunter's vocals are pretty thin (despite his macho appearance (& image). He manages to sound like a poor imitation of Bowie on Ziggy Stardust, with a more pronouced accent (eg: six string 'raii-zer', instead of 'razor') The lyrics don't necessarily rhyme (they're probably not supposed to) and are cringe-making-ly pretentious. The only star on the album is for the Mick Ralphs penned song (I'm a Cadillac), which he also sings, instead (thankfully) of Hunter. Ralphs left Mott to join Bad Co, which is more up my street. Buy this only if you've heard Mott before or are a fan, don't associate it with Bad Co or Def Leppard for whom Mott was an inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Glam Rock","review":"I was never a big fan of the Glam Rock gender until I bought this album on cassette back in the 70's. Mott, along with David Bowie made me appreciate this great rock and roll. Memphis and Whiz Kids are among my favorites, and now hearing this great music on my ipod brings back pleasant memories of my youth. I highly recommend Mott too anyone who is fan of rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! Rock Classic!","review":"This is got to be one of the greatest albums of all time!The songwriting, production, playing everything. Too badit was Mick Ralph's last album. I first heard this frommy older brother and I was just blown away. Drivin'Sister is just a rocking classic. All the way to Memphisshould be played on every classic rock station. AlsoHonolochi Boogie should've been a mega hit. If if wasreleased today, it would be considered genius. It's soashame Mott was overlooked.

This has to be cool. Buy it, take it home, put it on the turntable, and WOW! this IS cool! Not long after everyone at school (my friends, anyway) are talking about this band, trying to pound out All The Way From Memphis on the piano in the music room. (But what about that GAY song All The Young Dudes?) Too bizarre, dude, this it COOL!

Rameau was an imaginative instrumental colorist, and these dance pieces, taken from several of his operas and ballets, show him at his best in that regard.While the conceit of calling this a \\"symphony\\" may seem strange, the pieces are arranged to form a nice sequence and, most importantly, are engagingly played by this early music ensemble. The interpretation is lively and the playing stylish. The sonics are detailed without being analytical.I would recommend this to anyone as an introduction to the joys of French Baroque, but would encourage a follow-up purchase of one of the full operas."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a glorious treat this CD is!","review":"To answer a reviewer's question: Yes, according to the CD's maker, the stunning orchestration is not a modern transcription but is indeed Rameau's own.

The \\"advice\\" contained in this meaningless tome is about as useful as an anchor to a drowning man. His touchy-feely approach to mental illness shows he has not experienced the living hell himself. He should stick to giving advice to pre-schoolers and leave the psychological work to those better qualified, if not better experienced, in these matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Habits can be broken","review":"The most profound thing I've learned through Dr. Luciani's book is that depression and anxiety are merely habits. They are simply ways of thinking negatively. Ultimately, these habits are driven by insecurity and can eventually be broken.I have just finished this book, and feel quite enlightened. It took me a little over a week to complete it because I had to constantly put it down in order to think. I found that I related to many of the stories presented in each chapter, and am actually curious to learn more about myself. If nothing else, this book will give you eye-opening moments and allow you to believe that you can overcome your depression and anxiety with strength that you already possess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply an amazing piece of literature","review":"Anyone who reads this book will be able to do more than they ever imagined possible. This is an amazing piece of literature that has not only been an inspiration, but also a valuable educational tool. Since seeing the movie K-Pax with Kevin Spacey, I have often wondered about the possibility that all animals are capable of self-therapy for many types of mental illnesses. Our brains are an incredibly powerful tool that many proclaim are only being used at 10% capacity, yet Dr. Luciani ensures that anyone who reads his book can learn to dramatically increase this statistic. His advice is adequate for all ages and all educational levels. Being a fellow doctor, I find that this exceptionally high quality of work is rare in the industry today."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful.","review":"I did not like this book at all. I thought it was very negative in its attitude towards people who are depressed. It seemed to make light of the subject and act like if you just think positively everything will be great.

If you are the type of emotionally sabotaging snake woman who likes to move on from relationship to relationship, but you want to make yourself feel better about the complete lack of authenticity in your life, then this book would be perfect for you to have 6 or 7 copies of.

If anything, in ancient days they may have been just as aggressive and destructive as men, because they were just as powerful. Certainly, this book made me realise that at any time in history, in almost any culture, there are women who take up arms, whether in wars or barfights, and if a minority, they are not a myth or \\"a twisted male fantasy.\\" This would have been stronger as a history, or at least an encyclopedia arranged by dates rather than alphabet (it has been done).

However, I can't forgive Ms. Salmonson for her gross error in the death of Aethelflaed, warrior daughter of Alfred the Great. While Aethelflaed did help her brother drive the Vikings out of England, she most certainly didn't die in combat as alleged by the author. Please read the excellent biograghy, \\"The Lady Who Fought the Vikings,\\" by Don Stansbury. She did lead her forces but was more known as a peace and treaty maker, and she never fought in combat.I feel that Ms. Salmonson may have taken literary license with other historical figures so please investigate further any women warriors that interest you. I have my own copy of this book but believe it may have other flaws.

Blaming Sony for a flooded camera housing is unfair, blaming them for taking legal precautions is plain ------. A responsible diver would always check his equipment prior to a dive. So would a responsible underwater photographer. I give it a 4 stars because it does what a cheap housing is supposed to do: it lets you take nice, non-professional, non-artistic holiday (underwater) snapshots. It is by the way very slim and fits nicely into a BCD pocket. Setting it up is very easy and the 5 minute post-dive maintenance is straightforward. Good product, if the user is not foolish. Naturally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer follow-through","review":"The underwater case we received was not what was advertised. It did not fit our camera. When we tried to put the camera into the case it bent the lens cover. The next day we e-mailed the seller to inform them of the situation and they have not corresponded with us despite several attempts on our and Amazon's part to resolve the issue. At present we seem to be stuck with a fairly expensive underwater camera case which we cannot use. The case was advertised as new but it did not come in a manufacturer's box and it had no instruction booklet. New? Very suspicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed on the first dive.","review":"The case flooded and ruined the camera the first time I used it underwater.

It you are not a Baptist, especially Southern Baptist, you may not like this hymnal. Yet, this hymnal has retained the best-loved hymns in the Southern Baptist hymnic tradition, but has broadened the repertoire to include well-loved hymns from other denominations. Theologically, the hymnal is a bit contradictory, which I believe shows disagreement within the Baptistic tradition concerning Arminianism (\\"I Have Decided to Follow Jesus\\") versus Calvinism (\\"Not What These Hands Have Done\\"). The language updates are a bit conservative concerning the \\"thees\\" and \\"thous,\\" yet it does not foist inclusive language at the expense of theology and poetry. The musical arrangements are traditional so they lend themselves well for 4-part harmony. The hymnbook is arranged in an almost church-year format, which is a welcome addition. In short, this hymnal is thoroughly conservative yet modern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Terry Fretheim's God and World in the Old Testament (as the cover suggests) explores God's relationship with the world, as seen through the Old Testament.

They are not your run of the mill mtv punk revival band and they have never stated to be ''emo'' .If you want to educate yourself , Please go to allmusic.com and learn that bands are not really one genre anyway .I am really tired of the anti everything kids . This is getting really pathetic . Youre NOT core cause you can make fun of every band that gains a good number of fans . You are not core cause you can search and find a band online that nobody knows . Get real .. Get over it .Please check this band out and determine this on your own .."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but derivitive","review":"This starts out as a farily decent, if increadalby average Punk/Pop album. The problem is, is that the best parts of all of their songs are stolen from other groups. Not taken and improved on, but stolen outright. Like on Patron Saint...the last track, the chorus is taken directly from Taking Back Sunday's song Timberwolves at New Jersey. They changed a few words and called it a new song...lame. The first track does the same thing, but I cant remember the song.They would have been better than other groups in the genre (i.e. Blink, Good Charlet, Simple Plan, etc.) if they had stayed away from stealing others work. Oh well.P.S. If you get a chance to see them live, do it, they are amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"midwest represent","review":"Definately a good cd. midwest represent for the chicago boys. their song titles are definately unque. it works though. i'd have to say my favorite songs are calm before the storm and grenade jumper. calm before the storm because of the guitar work and singing on it. the \\"what you do on your own time\\" is the best part of the song. grenade jumper is good because of that little 2 second drum opener. right after the guitar ends, it has the best drum opening. ( i am a drummer myself, thats why i pay attention to this stuff.) overall its a good cd. pretty good singing usually and the guiatr work is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Def. better than their newer cd","review":"I heard one song of this cd at least a year ago and began to love Fall Out Boy. I listened to it for months non-stop and I'm still not sick of their songs. I love every one of the songs on here and this album is, in my opinion, better than \\"From Under The Cork Tree\\". Their most popular song is probably \\"Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy\\". It's really too hard to pick the best ones but some of my favorites are: \\"Tell That Mick He Just Made My List of Things To Do Today\\", \\"GTA/WIYB\\", \\"Saturday\\", \\"Chicago Is So Two Years Ago\\", and \\"Grenade Jumper\\". I saw them in concert and they put on a great show. The music wasn't too great, but they were very entertaining. If you are choosing between \\"From Under the Cork Tree\\" and this album, definately get this one (at least first and then get the other one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall Out Boy Rocks All Things Holy","review":"Truth: Pop-Punk really isn't my thing.

Fall out boy is a reason why the music industry is so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"the CD sucks, how did they get to make a 2nd one?","review":"Please stop watching MTV and please stop supporting bands like Fall Out Boy. Every song of their's sounds like every song that blink-182/Simple Plan/Good Charlotte/The Used have come out with. There is absolutely nothing original or talented about this band.Oh, and I hate the singer. I could find lots of people on the street that can deliver better vocals than this ******. His voice gets intolerable within a minute and I feel like smashing the radio (which sucks, too) whenever I hear his little ****** voice.I recommend that you go use your money to buy any music from these bands: Led Zeppelin, the Doors, the Clash, Queen, the Pixies, the Strokes, Blondie, Dead Kennedys, the Cure, Aerosmith, old Metallica, old Misfits, Black Flag, Bad Religion, Black Sabbath, Slayer, White Zombie, Queens of the Stone Age, Fugazi, the Sex Pistols, and pretty much anyone else that has been mentioned by the one-star reviewers that don't watch MTV or listen to the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok i guess","review":"Well I have recently heard fall out boys take this to your grave.

Be warned stay away from the second album it's all a bunch of MTV promoted music and is made only to become popular!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These \\"boys\\" aren't for real","review":"I can see why certain people could like this kind of music. However, I hate to tell you this but the members in this band are all fake. All they probably do is listen to their managers and write and play their songs according to how they tell them to write them. A real rocker says to heck with the manager and writes their music how they want, regardless of how much fame and popularity they get for writing it. And how can you call them original, all they sound like is the typical green day wanna-be? This band sucks, and for them to be considered rock is a disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD EVER RELEASED","review":"I honestly think so. Just amazing.

Unfortunately guys, I hope your follow up is better. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"stupidly catchy and surprisingly clever","review":"I stumbled upon this group almost by accident, and a happy one it was. Pop/punk with emo leanings, FOB sport surprisingly clever lyrics, a lead singer with an incredible voice, killer hooks and emotional peaks, and a great live show. Go to www.fueledbyramen.com and download the free MP3 of \\"Dead on Arrival,\\" a catchy track with an excellent lyrical metaphor goin' on, realize you love it, and then buy the album. Trust me on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This has got to be one of my favourite albums i own. Patrick Stump's voice hits every note perfect and the lyrics by Pete are just amazing. :] I definatly reccomend you buy this! The best songs are: The Patron Saint of Liars and Fakes, Grand Theft Autumn (which is absolutly amazing live!) and Calm Before The Storm (the original version is quite better though, Patrick wrote it!) and also The Pros and Cons of Breathing is great! I hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than Most Pop","review":"Catchy rhythms mixed with smooth lyrics, this cd is well worth listening to. The songs flow into the next, with the end of this 40+ minute cd seeming abrupt and unwanted. The songs are such that they get suck in your head; and the musicianship is intriguingly good. It's better than almost all the pop on the market, and even stepping a little into rock. They don't sound completely original, but Fall Out Boy is different enough to get my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far The Best","review":"Fall Out Boy is by far the best band ever period. I have had Take This to Your Grave since it came out and I cannot stop listening to it. The greatest guitar riffs and the lead singer's voice is awsome. I recommend Grenade Jumper, The patron Saints Of Liars and Fakes, and Grand Theft autumn."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG this cd is my life","review":"In my whole life of 15 precious years i have never even come close to a CD that has more meaning than take this to your grave. FOB is the best punk/pop band to ever be created. The lead singer voice has the most unique voice and he can really sing unlike most of the annoying singers of this new punk sensation.The words are so meaningful really well written. Its a really good cd to have fun to because the music is so emotional that it overcomes you. The words are so hard once you learn them its so great. Some of their songs kinda remind me of gospel but they dont sing about god. Every song on the CD is catchy but \\"the patron saint of liars and fakes\\" and \\"Chicago is so two years ago\\" are by far the best songs. Seriously get this CD its so amazing i swear you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"F*** ing Awesome!","review":"This is the best cd I own!

The songs are catchy and not depressing. My favorites included \\"Grand Theft Autumn\\", \\"Chicago is so two years ago\\", and the first song. Although the last song strangely sounds exactly like TBS's \\"Cute without the E\\" (I think they shouldn't have put that one on the album) the rest of the cd was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good FOB release","review":"Honesty I do not usually listen to anything mainstream, but when I heard Fall Out Boy's first single I decided to make an exception. After listening to FOB's major release I decided to check out some of their earlier stuff. My first impression of this album was mediocre, but I decided to listen to it again. After the second time it found a permanent spot in cd rotation. To make it brief, Take This to Your Grave is a great album which you will enjoy more every time you hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far the BEST","review":"I started listening to Fall Out Boy about a year and a half ago and since then they have definately become my favorite band ever. I've tried hard to find another group to alternate their cd with once i listened to FOB over and over again...but no other group compares. Take This To Your Grave is a great CD that that leads into a completely different yet outstanding 3rd cd,From Under the Cork Tree. LISTEN TO THEM...i assure you that its worth your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy Mindless Garbage","review":"This CD seems to have been written with angsty 16 year old guys in mind. The lyrics are lame at best, and though they might cheer up the heartbroken teen who thinks he'll never love again, they'll annoy anyone else. All of the musicians, but especially the singer and drummer, should be in groups of much higher caliber than this. A few catchy lines and a record label willing to pay for a good recording studio put these guys where they are now, but there's nothing more to it. Don't be fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently ignorance is bliss","review":"I got this cd when it came out. I regret stil having it, but nobody wants it. Not to my suprise.

Oh wait, I have......everytime I believe these reviews written by \\"pop/punk/emo\\" fans. If you want to sound exactly like another band, at least choose someone with a hint of originality, because then at least you're the second band to have that sound instead of the 487th. Are the lyrics and instrumentation good? I don't know because I couldn't get past that whiny voice that 12 year old girls find oh so emo. Gag. I'm vaguely reminded of Rufio, only they scored major points for including soundbytes from Hook."},{"rating":"2","title":"OBSESSED WITH FALL OUT BOY!!","review":"This band-the new music and the old-is the GREATEST BAND ever. There's nothing else to it. After listening and buying both the cds and the other acoustic products and stuff, I was like, \\"What do you mean I didn't write this?!\\" These guys are AMAZING (and SO hot might I add) and I really don't think people should be mad because they made it big. They started out the same way any other band started: new, inexperienced, and not so popular-YET!!

Republicans may not like it so much.Highly Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Moore's \\"The Big One\\" is a Big Hit!","review":"This movie states what many Americans think but are unable to express. While Michael Moore is promoting his new book, he puts corporate America on the spot. The classic footage of the film is when Michael confronts Nike's CEO about his child labor practices in Indonesia and broken promises to factory workers in Flint, MI. The underlying question in the movie is \\"If companies are making billions of dollars in profit, why are they laying off workers and moving to third world countries?\\". This movie will enlighten viewers on the unjust practices of corporations in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells the truth about where our tax dollars go...","review":"This is a great, sarcastic view of what is really going on today in politics and big business. Things have changed a lot in the last 30 years or so. Corporations care very little, if at all, about their employees. Government tries to entice corporations to do business in their communities through bribes of tax breaks and discounted or free community services in an effort to bring more jobs to their communities only to have those same companies pick up and move to greener pastures and lay off those same people. Companies are being paid to do this over and over again. Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Trick Fans will like the Interview with our favorite 'Trickster, Richard V.

I love bowling for columbine and roger and me was revolutionary for its time period. However the same thing can't be said about the big one. It basically in short summary is a cheap way for moore to promote his book tour for his first novel, Downsiize this. The film lacks depth and purpose and while it does make some good points about Welfare and welfare reform it basically says the same things that were stated in roger and me except in a less convincing way. The moore fan many like this. The casual movie watcher should stay away. It'll put you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"I turned it off half way through.","review":"Michael Moore can be really funny at times, but most people should not take this goofball too seriously. About half way through 'The Big One', I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn't know where Moore was going. What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick? This is not one of his better films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Moore is an idiot","review":"This was a ridiculous documentary. I watched with an open mind, and after it was finished I was so irritated because he showed such a one sided biased view, it was ridiculous.

Let me warn you now, don't waste 2 hours or 20 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star is too high","review":"If it were possible to give zero stars this film would receive a -5 stars.

But, any real story teller will exam all sides which this does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Roger and Me, but close.","review":"Here we go again with more brilliance from Michael Moore. This time he's a little short on irony but makes up for it with some really funny stuff. He just doesn't have someone as shameless as Roger as a foil.My guess is, folks who don't like this are a bit uncomfortable with making fun of great Americans like Steve Forbes.

The Lost Levels, Super Mario World, and Super Mario 64. Also, it borrows some the top features of Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, and Super Mario Sunshine. It combines all these great things nintendo players have come to love about Mario into one great game, while making its own mark in all these categories with well designed levels, pleasent sound effects and theme songs, and innovative game play. If there is a flaw, it is that the save feature (which is designed to allow for short bursts of game play) is wasted, as you'll find yourself never wanting to stop playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Forever","review":"Super Mario Bros is fun and has activites for you to do even after you defeat all the bosses.

Next thing you know, I get hooked. This is similar to Super Mario Brothers that I played on the Super Nintendo as a teenager. There are some interesting twists like the ability to shoot your opponents and a super mushroom that allows you to just destroy everything in your path. It does a great job incorporating the touch screen.What I also found entertaining were the mini games, when you want to take a break from the frustration of the main game. I admit, some levels are easy, but there are some levels that are a bit challenging. There is a good entertainment factor but certain sections have a high level of difficulty that needs to be planned out.Overall, for a 'retro-type' game, it is well done and will entertain all ages.I highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this, buy this NOW!","review":"If you love Mario, you'll love this game.

There are a wide variety of levels, a lot of good power-ups, some new some old.

I rate this game 95/100."},{"rating":"2","title":"New And Improved","review":"This game is fun but hard. I have beaten the game about a month after i got it. The best part is the minigames and multiplayer. After u beat the game u get to choose to play from mario or lugi. There is new items like the mini mushroom and bowser jr. etc... U see that when you beat the game it skips two levels. These two levels can be unlocked by using the mini mushroom and going into secret pipes spread throughout the worlds. The graphics r good for the background and charecters. The graphics r good for a DS. This game is very hard but it is still fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the Original Nintendo Spirit!","review":"This game is GREAT! It reminds me of Super Mario 3 -- I loved that game when it first came out! This DS game is highly similar in the way the levels are set up, but there are a few more options (e.g. you can bounce off walls, new characters, etc.).I think one of the reasons I love this game so much is because it's been years since I played Super Mario 3, and this DS version really reminds me of that -- I'm an adult, and I'm really enjoying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake copy of the game","review":"There are alot of fake/ bootleg copys of nintendo ds and game boy advance games sold online.

If you want to play the classic NES Mario games on your DS, then buy this. If you want a challenge or something new and different, then do not buy this. You will be sorely disappointed.This is the same stale gameplay that plagues many generic platformers today, no matter what console. Just because it is Mario does not make it any better. The worlds themselves are mostly recycled, with some variances, from Super Mario 3. The boss battles are exactly the same. The only time the touch screen is even used for the gameplay is if you want to use the power up you have saved.With the incredible potential this game had, it is wasted on rehashing the old NES games with better graphics. Once again, buy this only if you want a portable NES Mario game. Everyone else, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun, for a week tops","review":"i got this game for my birthday some time ago. at first i was amazed at how fun this game was.

But what happened to levels 4 and 7. What a rip off, why not just have six levels then to skip two levels of fun?

If you play the original part of the game, it gets boring after a while. It is still fun though. The mini games are a blast. I actually like them more than the original part.

I look forward to when I, finally, win the game. Then I can go back and replay it, going to the worlds I skipped (2 of them, I believe), being able to save at every junction.

The graphics are wonderful (my previous handheld was a GBC - so you can only imagine.) The colors are vivid and the sound is good. And it is also easy to control.

Oh, two worlds have to be unlocked, but if you go on gaming websites, you can find cheats that tell how to do this, PLUS a cheat almost every one of us who has the game knows: how to play as Luigi.

I'll agree with another reviewer that the definitive hits package by Alabama is their double disc set, but for those of us who may not be able to or do not want to plunk down a nice hunk of change for the double set, this one will suffice. Also, if you aren't a huge fan of Alabama, but want something representative of their work in your collection, I highly recommend this disc.It's Alabama, so just about anything they put on a disc will sound great. Personal highlights of this album include \\"If You're Gonna Play In Texas,\\" \\"Jukebox In My Mind,\\" and \\"Roll On.\\" Everything else contained here is great.Once again, this is an excellent introduction for the casual country fan, but hardcore Alabama fans probably already have everything on this disc.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate Alabama 20 # 1 Hits","review":"Only 10 songs were downloaded for a 20 song album.

From the moment I saw the Caption, \\"Blackpool by the Sea\\" - superimposed over a wide shot of the city - I knew I had to visit there. Just returned from a week-long visit in June - my third since 2000. Oddly enough, the people of Blackpool are not all that different from those depicted in the film. Many are quirky, offbeat and super friendly. Have watched the VHS tape many times and still laugh at the variety of brilliant comic set pieces, particularly the \\"audition montage.\\" Many heartfelt moments in this picture.

First you have the Ernest character who is a comedy gem all by himself and needs no enhancing, then you have the fantasy element of the Arch-Angel of Basketball giving Ernest the \\"Magic Sneakers\\".The best part of the movie was Ernest's early interactions with the other guys on his clean-up crew and his attempts to be one of the guys. Instead of solving things with sneakers they should have have had a series of scenes with Kareem Abdul Jabaar as a sympathetic gym owner or even a janitor teaching Ernest how to play ball, now that would have been hilarious.This is only a must have if you want to get them all, otherwise just get \\"Scared Stupid\\" and \\"Goes To Jail\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"laughter is the best medicine","review":"i purchased this movie for my two kids for x-mas. my youngest son has not laughed this hard in a long time.he repeatedly watchs the movie and i get the same reaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Fantastic, Hilarious, and it's good too :)","review":"I had almost forgotten just how funny the Ernest movies where.

FORMER NBA SUPERSTAR KAREEM ABDUL JABAR APPEARS IN THIS MOVIE AS A BASKETBALL PLAYER. UP BY THIS TIME, ERNEST MOVIES STOPPED GOING TO THEATRES AND IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE SERIES IS GETTING OLD.

When one thinks of Ernest, one's mind goes right to Slam Dunk Ernest. That movie was delightful. No. No. It was brilliant. No, no, no, no. There is no word to describe its perfection, so I am forced to make one up. And I'm going to do so right now. Scrumtrilescent.

But now that I have seen the movie, a tear trickles down one cheek and I sit here speechless, unable to look at anything else in the world without thinking of the beauty that is the team of Ernest and the Basketball Angel, played marvellously by none other than Kareem-Abdul Jabbar. I will not spoil plot details, as other reviewers have covered that ground.

We made love to this sweet movie, timing our passionate thrusts to the dribbling basketball."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Ernest movie.","review":"I found the magic sneeakers plot very stupid. I'm sorry Jim (may you rest in peace), but this one was one I looked forward too and it was a let down. But I'l still watch it, just because it's an Ernest movie. Sorry Mr./Mrs. barb@favorites.com, but in case you haven't heard, Jim Varney died earlier this year. I know it's sad, I'm still mourning over it.

This album is a vital addition to anyone's collection. White Witch don't stick to any one style here, there's something for everyone. The MASTERPIECE on this CD is Crystallize And Realize, an acoustic space ballad that picks right up where early Bowie leaves off. Auntie Christy is a scary guitar driven hard rock jam, Walk On has a very Beatle influence- all of these styles are done without compromising the individual sound of this band. These guys were UNBELIEVABLY good! Till I found their band website on the net I had no idea this was even out on CD. The mastering on this disc is terrific compared to the vinyl (now I know what is said at the beginning of Slick Witch). This disc is different than their first CD but equally awesome. You will NOT be disppointed if you buy this disc!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Pathetic Red Fox Version","review":"Yes, it's cheaper than the legit Capricorn version, but you get what you pay for.

I'm not a fan of modern R&B to start with but I thought that, being a real fan of 70's Marvin, the overall favourable 5 star reviews of this album needed to be balanced by another view of it. The covers are awful elevator music. Admittedly covering Marvin Gaye has to be a supremely difficult task, but I think this album should have had more artists from a variety of styles. Listen first before buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good covers of a great artist","review":"I was very pleased with these recordings I felt that all the accomplished artists did a good job singing Marvins music, what I really liked was their own twist to his songs that allowed them to explore their own sound.

None of the adapters fit, so I just used the tool w/o it and it fit just enough to bite. At first it didn't fit at all, so I cleaned the piston's surface which had a little bit of rust. The two round tabs never fit in all the way into the piston, but enough to turn it easily.Still, this tool is better than using needle nose pliers (although that worked just fine on my friend's 2001 Accord. Got lucky I guess)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timesaver","review":"Went to the Honda dealer for an oil change and a state safety inspection which would be paid by our purchase of an extended warranty. After our 2009 Accord with less than 28K miles was up on the rack, the \\"technician\\" informed my wife and I it would cost us $395 for an air filter, a cabin filter, and rear brakes.Amazingly the other two couples in the waiting room needed exactly the same replacements. Anyway...I did it all by myself,the filters, the brake shoes and with the help of this tool, everything went very smoothly. I did it all for about 75$.

Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"I got the job done!","review":"I bought this tool set because I found out that to replace the rear brake pads of my VW 2003 Jetta a tool like this is a MUST item to do with. The rear brake caliper is so built that its piston shall be turned while pushed in to be back into the caliper to make a room for a new thicker pad. This is easy to think but very tough job to do with a normal tool found in your tool box at home unless you have very strong muscle arms. This tool kit made it easy for me. I was able to complete replacing the pads without damaging the piston. The tool and adapters look very good quality. Case is good for long term storage because I will not use this so often. There is one thing that I believe mistake in an instruction sheet; it says \\"turn clockwise\\" but I believe it shall say counterclockwise, though it is not a big deal you can figure it out how to use the tool even without the instruction sheet. Just like a simple brain quiz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the Doctor orderd for my 94 mustang!","review":"Great for winding back the caliber on whatever car this sets fits.I used It to change the back breaks on my 1994 Ford Mustang 3.8 litter.If you still have the Stock calibers be patients because the caliber notchesmight be worn down making it a little difficult for the tool to grab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price.","review":"Looks sturdy, like it could last you for several brake jobs without a problem. The problem I found was that my piston was really far out, and it took a lot of brute force trying to wind it back in. So I used a breaker bar to help out, and the bar bent... So yeah, I don't know if any other tools are made with a stronger bar, but I ended up using a pipe wrench to catch both sides of the bar and it turned easily. I know some caliper tools don't come with a bar at the end, they have a socket end instead. I would opt for one of those instead and try using a breaker bar or heavy duty socket wrench to turn the caliper. Even though the bar bent on me, the price of this tool helped me not really worry about it. Adios!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Usefull tool, don't let the name fool you","review":"This tool is useful for doing brake jobs. However, don't let the brand name Neiko Tools USA fool you.

I would return it but my car is disabled and I need to get it going, so I had to modify the tool with a grinder. A comment mentioned it works fine on the S model, which is probably due to the larger caliper size (unverified).

Here he collaborates with members of the rock group Living Colors and tries to make what sounds like acid-jazz. There are parts of this CD that's very bottom-heavy, and can blow out your speakers. He sounds rather lifeless on this recording, as opposed to his past two albums. There are some good songs on here. \\"Think About It\\" is the best. Nice acoustic guitars with Alpert doodling on muted trumpet, only to break into an upbeat passage. \\"I Want You\\" is one of his better solos, and \\"Colors\\" sounds like a Miles Davis tune. \\"Look Of Love\\" is okay, but the vocals are terrible on this. \\"Dorita\\" is just a bad song. \\"Magic Man\\" has its moments, but drags on too much. This is clearly not one of Alpert's better efforts, and this Herb Alpert fan is disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a huge fan, this is truly a surprise.","review":"Two stars, and one and a half are for the great sound of the music, the music itself being Alpert's obvious total denial of the Tijuana Brass, my favorite band of all time.

If you are a fan of Disney movies in general, or you like their Animal Kingdom theme park, you will probably really enjoy this movie. My kids loved it too. There are a few emotionally tough spots, so be sure to watch it with them. But like most Disney movies, just about everything works out to a happy conclusion.

Unfortunately, the human actors don't keep pace with the computer and mechanically created star. There are two sensational chase sequences and some charming (tear-jecking moments). Unfortunately, the film lacks the depth and texture found in the best of films dealing with fantastic subjects (such as Jurassic Park) with the human characters more two-dimensional and less life-like than Joe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mighty Joe Young","review":"I have yet to see the movie the reason I have not watch the movie is because the DVD did not work in any DVd player.I was told after I got the disk it takes a certain type of player in order for the movie to play.

Theron is both stunning and a talented Oscar winner for \\"Monster.\\" Bill Paxton is believable as always and so is the cast of familar faces. This is fun for the whole family with only some mild profanity and violence (I wouldn't let my youngest child see the needlessly graphic \\"electrocution\\" scene of the villian in the end).

They cared so much about each other. Honestly, this isn't a common friendship you'd find. The movie has a great contrast in it. Sometimes it's hilarious, sometimes sad, sometimes exciting.

Overall the selection is solid, although the addition of \\"You're Making Me High\\" would have made this a perfect collection, but Braxton is one of R&B;'s finest singers and this collection is further proof that her voice is missed on radio.It's worth mentioning that \\"How Could An Angel Break My Heart\\", \\"Maybe\\" and \\"Spanish Guitar\\" are featured here in remix format, making this a good listen for both Braxton diehard and casual fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow what a beautiful voice","review":"We have just about wore this CD out!! one of the best.

That is, unless you want to see what a body looks like having fallen to the ground feet first from a great height. I am annoyed that I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this DVD, despite my wife warning me against it. (And she has also read the book.)Daniel Craig is a great actor but, despite a couple of scenes from his lectures, I couldn't even work out what subject he taught. Having read several genuine stalker cases from the legal angle, I couldn't understand why he didn't call in the police, or at least threaten to do so, against Rhys Ifans.This film should have gone straight to 4:3 TV. It makes no use of the big screen or widescreen.The musical score was actually half-decent, but wasted on this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I did not like this film, surprising to me because I have liked all the other films in which Daniel Craig appeared, after I saw him for the for the first time in Casino Rayale.Also, the copy of the film which I bought used hat many black spots in it, a first for any used products I have ordered from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"A hapless existentialist and random stalker make for the loony bin. The acting is decent, but as the mystery unravels, it becomes clear the plot was as poorly conceived as any other stalker movie (e.g. Scream II). The main character, the professor (the new Bond), never does what you want him to do, making him predictably annoying. The unwieldy camera effects and cliche or alternatively random dialogue do not help make the movie any more convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Park Stars","review":"One has to applaud an efford that combines the artistic endeavors of writing poetry, painting landscapes, and making semi-classical music. All of this is combined in a sort of table-top book plus DVD celebrating the three stars in the firmament of the National Parks system----Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and Yosemite. The poetry is primarily nature-descriptive, and provides a catalyst for the 20 artists from across the nation asked to interpret the words. The artwork is uneven, some is outstanding, some is illustrative, and some is mundane. But the overall impression of the book is very positive, and worth buying for anyone who has lost their heart at one or more of these wonderful places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Combination","review":"I found this book through their website when looking up the Grand Canyon, and that is the best way to look at what it has to offer, because that way you get to see all of the paintings included in the book. The paintings, commissioned from 20 artists all over the United States, were apparently inspired by the poetry which describes numerous places and vistas in the Grand Canyon, Yosemite and Yellowstone, and the poems and artwork appear together on the pages. It is art-directed in a very 1940's postcard format, and would make a great gift for anyone who has visited or cares deeply about any or all of these wonderful parks. The poetry and paintings are further enhanced by the inclusion of a musical DVD, an unexpected bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing recording","review":"I was looking forward, based on commentary on this album that I'd read elsewhere, to hearing a master at the top of his game, someone who \\"was THE living master of old-style strathspey playing.

It's a far better alternative than just tossing your knives in a drawer loose. This not only protects your knives, it protects your fingers!

I felt that the author spent too much time writing about the 'false leads' of the investigation. For a book that is 257 pages, the real killers names are not even mentioned until page 216.

A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Let Down","review":"I was so excited to get this book because I had been reading about the tragedy for a long time and wanted to find our as much as I could. Unfortunately, this book did not provide anything useful that I already had not heard about. Half way through the book I was sick and tired about reading about what the detectives had for lunch or who their father's were. There was more background about the investigators than there was about the victims. Not to mention Possley's writing style is god awfully boringI had to struggle to get through the book and guess what? It doesn't have one sentence about the trial at ALL. It is stated that they will be coming up for a trial in a few years. What a let down!

I don't know why they say it heats up to 430 degrees, didn't feel that hot to me. It took me so long just to try to straighten out one section of hair, and it still did not make it smooth. It made my hair frizzy and the straightening effect lasted only about one hour. As I type, my hair is getting back to curly again.Don't waste your money on this please. The people at the pro store even told me that this is the lower end brand.The better irons for more money I have now found are GHD and H&R.;By far and away, you can DEFINITELY do MUCH better than this iron.

The image of one First Lady referring to another in that manner shows a sad lack of civility - not to mention a rather vicious, juvenile turn of phrase. (Which, now that I think about it, is not inconsistent with the \\"Ha-ha!\\" and smiley face Mr. Russo used in his review.)Sorry, but I can't find value in this review. Perhaps someone more....discerning....has read this book and has an opinion? Is there something worthwhile apart from the Mrs. Clinton's petty sneers and self-aggrandizing comparisons of herself to Mrs. Kennedy?

Will need to send item in to Creative now and wait. I will not be surprised if the third one I recieve has the same problem.

I had to modify the shocks because the bolts inserts were too small. It made my truck bouncy on city streets, but seemed better off-road. After a couple of weeks I put my old oil shocks back on my trunk. I would have returned it, but I took these on my trip to Ethiopia so bringing them back is not worth the hassle and luggage weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parade of the Athletes Review","review":"Parade of the Athletes is the soundtrack to the Opening Ceremonies of the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. Obviously, the opening ceremonies had more music than can fit on a CD, so this it not the entire soundtrack, but a collection of some of the songs played. The album is so well-mixed that you'd be hard-pressed to find a single flaw or missed beat-match. DJ Tisto offers up his own unique 'tense,' grande style, but make no mistake, this is a dance album through and through. With only two really popular singles ('Adagio for Strings' and 'Traffic'), Tisto shows that he doesn't have to rely on smash hits to get a party pumping. Overall, if you're looking to pick up a great dance album that can slow it down and speed it up, get a party jumpin', 'Parade of the Athletes' is your best bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympic Gold","review":"This is an album you wanna get wheather you're new to the whole trance scene or been in it long time. It's real Tiesto Gold with all tracks written and produced specially for the olympics by the master himself. If only the first track was something else, there would be five stars on the top. You just can't top playing under the Olympic flame for people from all around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing ceremony, amazing music!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Having been there, the cd would be a definite buy.

As an amateur photographer I take 100's of pictures each year and then select the best of that year to share with friends and relatives. I have an HP Envy ink printer and this works very well when set at the Premium HP Photo Paper selection. I have printed out a number of 8 x 10's of some of my favorite shots and I have to say I am blown away with what I see! The affect is like a painting and the finished artwork makes for great gifts as well as for personal wall hangings. I am an avid backpacker and have found myself \\"in the right place at the right time\\" for some great shots. I could not give this a better rating. One thing I should mention is that I tried to find my printer on the InkPress website and could not find it but risked it anyway.

I only just finished the 2nd (the 4th part of the movie). All I can say is that this one is a keeper. It did start slow for me, but there is so much information in here and St. Teresa seems to have been different from many saints in that she was a regular person who just tried to follow God's will in her life. That is what we are all called to do. We are all called to be saints, but many of us just cannot give up our comforts and self love. I recommend this movie to anyone discerning the religious life.

On pages 50 and 51, for example, the area of a triangle is repeatedly miscalculated by dividing the base in half twice (the base should be divided once), which gives what appears to be a valid (though wrong) answer. The arithmetic is correct, but the key concept is completely botched. This is only one example of many I have spotted.I agree with other reviewers, this is more than simple oversight. For a so-called \\"self-teaching guide,\\" this is negligent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with Errors!","review":"I was disappointed as I worked through the first two chapters of this book.

If angle D=48 degrees and angle E = 17 degrees, find the measure of angle F.\\" It turns out that there would be no angle F in that triangle! If there were just one or two errors in the book, I could let it go, but I've found one such error on almost every page! I'm giving up on this book.

And more than that-it distracts from one of the most glorious musical segments in history with an absurd and meaningless concept that really has no bearing on the rest of the opera(s). It really breaks all rules of good taste and shamefully disctracts the listener and viewer from what they should be feeling as Wagner concludes this epic. I am flabbergasted and appalled that such a crock of sh****T was allowed to ruin this otherwise wonderful production. I recommend the Die Walkure as the best part of this set.The End--a group of people wheel out televisions and sip martinis while a blond boy and girl decide to hold hands.(In this ring--all walsungs have red hair so dont go there) It is even worse than what I have described because I am too upset to go on. FOR SHAME!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid production","review":"This is in many ways a splendid production of a mightly opera. The staging is pleasing to the eye and the direction is imaginative. The acting of the singers has reached a level rarely attained on the operatic stage. The singing here is also fine, although perhaps a notch below the level of acting. Fortunately, we have the magnificent Brunnhilde of Gwyneth Jones to anchor the entire enterprise. Handsome in stage presence, Jones sings with great power and abandon from start of finish. This is really an exhilarating portryal of a hugely demanding role.

The drama unfolds powerfully on the stage, and the direction is always appropriate, often superb.The singers make a fine team, headed by Gwyneth Jones's glorious Brunnhilde.

I prefer using spatulas when I cook because they are friendly with my non-stick cookware. The size and shape makes it perfect for stovetop cooking. It is a sturdy piece that gives my utensil caddy a little pop of color. It appears very well made and hasn't failed me yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update - Okay, finally can get the handle out!","review":"This tool works well, but one must remove the handle before putting it in the dishwasher. When first obtained, could not get the wooden handle out of the spoon. Now that I have had it a while, it can be removed, but it still troubles me that the handle, which does get exposed to food when using, can't be sanitized in the dishwasher. There are other silicone spatula/spoons that have dishwasher-safe handles and I'd recommend those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented","review":"I ordered this spatula in another color, (Carribean), and the description, like all the other colors stated that it was heatproof to 800 degrees F.However when I received it, the sticker on the handle stated that it was only heat resistant to 482 degrees F.This description is a misrepresentation... I saw that all the colors state an 800 degree heat tolerance, however, if you look at the sticker on the handle when you receive it, you will notice it says 482F/250C. I'm really disappointed as I need one heatproof beyond 500 degrees.As I stated in a review on the color I purchased, this description needs to be corrected. Don't be surprised if your spatula melts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented","review":"I purchased the same spatula in a different color, (Carribean), and was excited to find a spatula w/a heat tolerance to 800 degrees F, as the highest I have found is 500 degrees F, which isn't always enough.Unfortunately, when I received the spatula-spoon, the sticker on the handle stated it was only heatproof to 482 degrees F.As even spatulas with a heat tolerance of 500 degrees can melt or fray, (I know this from personal experience), a spatula with a heat tolerance of 482 degrees is not helpful.I suggest the description be corrected. When I saw the 800 degree tolerance, I thought it was too good to be true, and I was unfortunately correct. This was a waste of time and postage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"I use this spoon for baking. It helps mix the batter and move the batter from mixing bowl to pan beautifully, and it also doesn't get batter stuck all over it as it's silky silicone head makes the batter just glide off. If you'e ever battled with stiff scraping spoons that just seem to transfer the batter back and forth (and on to you!) you'll appreciate what a difference this makes. I didn't need it for high heat, though I have used it for sauteing vegetables as well, and it's worked just fine. I have the smaller size as well.Edited to add that I use this daily to help get smoothies out of the machine. Having a spoon that food glides off is enormously helpful, and having gone through repeated uses/washings, this spoon looks as good as the day I bought it (a year ago? something like that)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented -- Disappointed","review":"Most my spatulas are heatproof to 500 degrees, and that isn't enough for some types of cooking, so I was thrilled to find one heatproof to 800 degrees. I bought more than one.The description on this spatula states that it is heat resistant to 800 degrees. When I received the product, it had a sticker on it stating it was only heatproof to 482 degrees F. I am really disappointed, as I wanted a high heatproof spatula-spoon.This has been misrepresented and I suggest that the product description be corrected so this does not happen to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good practical info, a great addition to my Maya library","review":"There's so much to Maya that the doorstop books are jammed full of how-to-do-everything (which is certainly important!). But when it comes to just handy tips for working, this book is a great find. Now that I know everything I CAN do with Maya, here's some advice about what I SHOULD be doing to make my work experience as efficient as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR EXCUSE FOR SOME GOOD THEATER MUSIC","review":"The best of Broadway? Sure, if you consider the best of Broadway only those songs taken only from RCA Victor cast recordings. Expect the expected: Tracks from \\"Ragtime,\\" \\"Chicago,\\" \\"42nd Street\\" and \\"Man of La Mancha,\\" sung by the likes of AudraMcDonald, Bebe Neuwirth, Jerry Orbach and Brian Stokes Mitchell. Including a live recording of Barbara Cook warbling \\"Losing My Mind\\" from her \\"Mostly Sondheim\\" CD isn't exactly kosher. But then again, neither is this gimmick-riddled release. Curtain up?Half-way, maybe. Light the lights? Dim them, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Broadway 2.","review":"I purchased this cd because i already have the first cd.

When reading Roger Ebert's film home page in 2009 or 10 , i vividly remember him writing about this documentary . I made a mental note to see it . Tonight i streamed the film and just found myself really taken with Bill Withers the man , his family , his story , music , friends , stuggles , upbringing and so on . Thanks so much for sharing your life with us Bill . I'm certain i write for many when i write , we've truly missed you and are thrilled to learn what has occured in your life in the last thirty + years . Great artist and human being .
