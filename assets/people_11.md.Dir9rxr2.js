I was surprised how many of the lines came back to me after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob In Top Form","review":"I'm so glad Fox came out with this set. The Bob Newhart Show is funny, sophisticated, clever, and a great example of top-notch sitcom writing. Bob Newhart, as usual, underplays his role perfectly, and is supported by a full cast of ace standup and screen comedians that have become sitcom legends.Many of the best episodes are here in the first season. Also significant is that the film transfer looks substantially better than what has been on TV for years, and the episodes are full-length instead of truncated synidicated cuts. My only complaint is that the menus are a little hokey.But overall, a great set for a very small price. If you enjoy shows like TAXI, Barney Miller, The Odd Couple, or Cheers, you will really enjoy this set. And if you're already a Bob Newhart Show fan, this is a no-brainer purchase. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book is good for inspiration but title has flaw.","review":"The book is certainly enjoyble and inspirational but starts with a flaw. Perhaps the author himself does not encounter the problems me and many of my peers do, but that doesn't give him the right to lie by saying that latinos are a race. This is certainly not true and it enhances ignorance among both hispanics and non-hispanics. Nevertheless, I still recommend the book to anyone because the ultimate purpose of the author is to construct a model for inspiration so as to motivate others who have gone through similar circumstances. The title, however, should be changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review!","review":"This book starts off pretty good and sucks you in, but about halfway through it feels like it's dragging on and on.

I finished reading it and started reading it all over again because I read it so fast I missed some of the details. The story is fast paced and very exciting, full of mystery and suspense. It pulled me into the story with heart pounding adventure so that I had to read faster and faster! I love that I could download a dictionary as there were some unfamiliar words I wanted to look up. It also tells you how many pages you've read, the total number of pages in the book, and what percentage of the book you've read so far.

The escape in a balloon and find themselves stranded on this island. Adventure, wonder, tragedy, and humor ensue. Unfortunately I couldn't imagine out a map, but Verne's descriptions were beautiful, and very imaginative. This is also a very character-driven book. You could even love Top, their dog. It hooked me on as well. I felt very satisfied when they established Granite House, I smiled when Pencroft was presented a cigar, almost cried when Herbert was shot, and did cry for a few seconds when Nemo ... and one of Verne's other beautiful creations, the Nautilus, an alter-ego of Nemo ... below. Words can't describe how good this book it is, and I reccomend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome classic","review":"While the cadence is somewhat slowed by the style of its time, this story is pretty awesome and inspiring.

That includes the element of human organization in its simplest and most effective form. The society is made up of members who are earnest, friendly and selfless and a leader who is trustworty, compassionate and unassuming.Jules Verne, throughout his books, portrayed his main characters as decent and noble. His personal view may be that all humans are decent underneath. Only when subjected to ills of over-civilization, they become destructive.Mysterious Island is not only enjoyable with interesting plot with scientific support, but it is also uplifting in human spirit. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Bravo Verne, youve done it again!

Stupendious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I would have read it 20 years ago!","review":"My first introduction to Verne's work, was sadly, the b-rate movies on late night TV. Mysterious Island. Giant critters harassing hapless castaways. Forget any visions you have from the movie. This book was inspired on the real life adventures of a castaway. That was also the inspiration for Castaway, Robinson Crusoe, and even Lost in Space and Gilligan's Island.Basically take the Professor from Gilligan's island and multiply the skill a hundred fold. Unlike the campy TV series, these creations are realistic. We don't meet Nemo until the last few chapters. Until then he's an unknown benefactor coming through in the castaways' times of need. It's a big book with small print, so get ready for a long - but worthy - read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding Amazon??!","review":"Why would you put the ending of the book in the \\"Book Description\\" section of the book page?!?!

Even in an adaptation, one should at least conserve the names of the characters and translate correctly what the author wrote.The leading character in Verne's novel is \\"l'ingenieur Cyrus Smith\\". In this version, he becomes \\"Captain Cyrus Harding\\"! Cyrus Smith explained to his companion that coral is built by \\"animalcules\\" (in French animalcule = microscopic animal). Captain Harding is obviously less informed in natural history, as he stated(locations 2344-48)that \\"Coral INSECTS... made the island of Clermont-Tonnerre...\\" As far as I know, \\"animalcule\\" is a perfectly good English word.

Each time I cheer for the colonists, marvel at what they have accomplished, and can see Lincoln Island as a real place.A warning to first-time readers: don't read Caleb Carr's introduction.

Jeffrey Round clearly knows the business he is writing about, and gives the story a pleasing twist when he injects his narrative with high drama in the form of Warden's affair with Joshua Behrens, a radical pop star with political ideals, who will drag Warden into deeper trouble than he can possibly imagine.A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance, action and adventure - what more could you ask for?","review":"What more could you ask for? The writing is graceful and stylish and the plot leads us down the catwalks of Europe and into the bedrooms of rock stars. Round explores these topics with a literary astuteness seldom seen.

These cables come joined together by their insulation, but it's easy to separate them as you would with any lampcord speaker wire. I ended up braiding all three cables together to combat RF interference and I noticed a little cleaner picture. While I'm fairly sure I would have got an even better picture if I had spent the money for a Bettercables set, I am happy with the AR for now. For [price], you really can't go wrong. However, if you're VERY picky about picture quality and don't mind spending more, go for Bettercables.

Like one of the other reviewers said, then the story gets very strange. Maybe it was that same reviewer who said you've also seen this movie before and I agree. Hitman kills for a living and stays alive by following 3 rules. Then for whatever reason, midlife crisis maybe, violates those three rules and then everything goes to he** in a hurry.

Nic Cage is completely unbelievable as a super assassin who is tasked to carry out four kills in Bangkok. Along the way, he befriends a young Thai, and teaches him the secrets of his dark art (for example, \\"squeeze the trigger, don't pull it\\", he says, in one scene, duh... or \\"use reflective surfaces to look behind you\\", duh...). He also hooks up with a Thai girl (who, predictably, is mute) and eats really spicy food. If you like thrills, suspense and action, then AVOID this movie. If you want to fall asleep, then watch this.Nic's deadliest weapon is his awful hair, which completely fails to conceal his repetitive, painful acting. His star really has fallen very far, and rubbish like Bangkok Dangerous will not revive his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected","review":"It's a little cumbersome to get in and out of our RV storage, because of the handle.

Even though it is Puzo, who has done some great work, this story is mediocre at best. I have read every work of fiction by Mario Puzo and I would place this one at the bottom of the pile. It's not a terrible book, but you could do a lot better. The story is about post WWII Germany, and an American soldier named Walter Mosca who is stuck in a daydream of post-war reorganization and exploitation. The story is slow at times, and I found my mind wandering a lot during the middle. It comes together nicely at the end, and is certainly well crafted, but I would recommend this book only to Puzo fans, especially to those interested in reading his complete catalogue. That is basically the only reason I read this book, and it is not one I care to read again. Nor is it a story that will live long in my memory.Mark McGinty is the author of Elvis and the Blue Moon Conspiracy"},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite of a 3 year old cowgirl","review":"This is a classic book that our almost 3 year old daughter loves to look at again and again.

He clearly describes what you can do to avoid violence in the first place, and how to prepare for those cases where violence cannot be avoided.

I won't go into all of the details of this movie, but I can tell you that the scenery was stunning and Helen Mirren was even more so. That woman can act! She made me feel compassion for her in every scene even when I was thinking that she should wake up and realize what was going on with her paramour. Also, late, great Anne Bancroft played the Contessa to the hilt. Everything about her, including her appearance, made her treachery apparent. A good movie that I wouldn't mind seeing more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fearless Helen Mirren","review":"This is an interesting film based on a play by Tennessee Williams. I have not read the play, seen it performed, or seen the original film version starring Vivian Leigh. Having said all that, I can't imagine how anyone else would play this part. Helen Mirren is marvelous as the aging American actress having an affair with the young Italian con man. The scene where the two are sunbathing nude is a brave move on Ms. Mirren's part. Can you think of another leading actress, while nude, would hold her hand up to the sleeping form of her character's lover and contrast how her skin has aged compared to his?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggg...","review":"Tairrie B has tremendous potential as a vocalist. Unfortunately, her talent continues to more and more diluted as My Ruin's song writing slides downhill album after album. The Brutal Language continues in the direction of THoB, abandoning the nu metal nuances of APUPoVA in favor of straight ahead hard rock. However, the hooks are far less memorable than THoB. The song writing revolves around bad lyrics (far weaker than previous material) and hackneyed riffs that a B grade bar band would reject. Overall, it just seems to lack any real inspiration or direction. Surprisingly, Mick Murphy's guitar solos have actually progressed to the point where they are somewhat interesting, but his rhythm playing is completely one dimensional. Finally, the albums production is flat and lifeless. I don't sell off many albums I buy, but this one is going straight to the used rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"silver","review":"If you want to know more of the details of the history of the Jews, you will find this book very interesting.

The dust jacket notes mention that some of the pieces had previously appeared in periodicals.What strongly recommends this book is Mr. Waterman's writing. He is an excellent writer with a terrific, almost conversational, style who writes about the outdoors. The stories in this book cover many topics but all are readable and enjoyable. Many of the stories are sentimental but they all convey a love of the outdoors.In contrast to much contemporary outdoor writing, this book is free from product plugs. It is also not a how-to book.If you are interested in the outdoors, you will enjoy this book.Mr. Waterman wrote a number of other books. I have bought several of them and they are very good too.

Much of it comes from the ease with which you get to know his characters, ordinary people, familiar and likeable, before realizing that each in his own way, is spinning out of control. These are alcoholics and, as any alcoholic can attest, an alcoholic is usually the last to acknowledge how bad things really are. Thomson's portraits reminded me of \\"the mass of men\\" Henry David Thoreau described over a hundred years ago leading \\"lives of quiet desperation\\", and reveal how some choose to deal or forget. Readers should not be surprised to find a friend or loved one -- or themselves -- on these pages, so perceptive are Thomson's observations.

He creates characters which embody the ethic of Christian love both in its best form and at its worst incarnations.

Having dropped out to find himself in Big Sur, Darin doffed his toupee, grew a moustache and delved into his social consciousness. The transformation was even more astounding than his morph from rock 'n' roll singer to nightclub hipster. Darin proved himself with the thoughtful anti-war \\"Simple Song of Freedom,\\" and hardship tales like \\"Jingle Jangle Jungle\\" and \\"Long Line Rider.\\" The fluidity with which he moved between folk-rock, soul, blues, jug-band and country flavorings was astounding.For those schooled on \\"Splish Splash\\" and \\"Mack the Knife,\\" this set is a real head-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your usual Bobby Darin album","review":"If you're into Bobby Darin's \\"hippie stage\\", then this one is for you.

The format was definitely kid-friendly; with simple instructions, and great illustrations. I also found the recipes to be fun to make, and they appealed to my boys. I will say, however, that the book contained only 21 recipes and many were very simplistic (including scrambled eggs and spaghetti).

WOW. Even on the blurb @end where the title of next volume is misspelled. So, the book. Reads like someone who read outlander series when they were in high school, and now that they are in college, have been given assignment to write their own historical romance. Sure, she mentions the attraction between the main characters, but this woman is so shallow, it's hard to see how they fell in love. It seems like it's a paint by numbers version of outlander series to me. She endures three miscarriages, yet spends little time thinking about it. When Alex commits to join the uprising, we read her pleadings for him to stay for page after page. Not all that likeable, IMO. Her motivations are not explored, all Alex gets to say is \\"I love you, lass\\", sorry, won't be reading the next volume...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd hoped for...","review":"As a Gabaldon and Donati reader, I looked forward to reading this historical novel.

The characters are real and I never found myself questioning their thoughts or actions. You appreciate Mary's struggle to come to terms with life in the Highlands which is so different from her easy & boring life in London (before Alex came along). Alex is charming, funny and romantic. It's easy to see why Mary fell for him, he respects her mind and heart and never treats her terribly, as I've seen a lot in romance novels, man treats the woman horribly yet because he's attractive she puts up with it and falls in love. Mary is an intelligent woman with a good heart, she is very likable. It's a good book to curl up with on a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERY HISTORICAL ROMANCE FAN WILL LOVE THIS BOOK!!","review":"Do not hesitate to buy this wonderful novel.

Alex will steal your heart just as he did Mary's. Just when I finished this book I went ahead and looked for the sequel The Rose of Kilgannon which is being released in November. I hope to see more books by this wonderfully talented rising star!

The sequel, The Wild Rose of Kilgannon will be out in November (1999) and I'm looking forward to reading that one too. Alex was the perfect hero - a tall gorgeous man with integrity and a sense of honor. And he's in love with his wife. Who could ask for more? Well, it would be nice if he stayed home. Watching Mary grow up was great - she was bored with London and her life at the beginning of the book, but she certainly knew enough to grab this man before someone else did! She had to grow up in a hurry, but this gal was up to the challenge and I liked her a lot. Whenever she and Alex were together the dialogue was fantastic. I laughed and I cried and I stayed up almost all night. This book should come with a pack of tissues - but be warned - you'll have to read the sequel to find out how it all ends. I've got my calendar marked already! I just can't forget these characters. It would make a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put them down!","review":"I ordered both Kilgannon and The Wild Rose of Kilgannon at the same time. I ended up reading them both in two days. The story is excellent. After reading (and loving) the Gabaldon series it was nice to read a story set during the Rising of the '15. While Ms. Givens's kept me very interested in the characters, settings and historical sequences, my reason for the one lacking star is that I felt that some of the characters would not have reacted in the ways that they did. Without giving too much away, I don't think that Alex would have been so kind to his brother, even given the family history.Overall, I loved the books and hope to be reading a new Kathleen Givens novel very soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok story, full of typos","review":"The story and plot are ok.

The writing is fair and while the story line works for the first part of the book one soon realizes that many plot points are really for an upcoming book. As this was a first novel by this author I thought that it would stand on it's own but ***SPOILER*** when I got to the end I was right in my suspicion that this was all set up for a second book. I love series and don't have a problem with plot points scattered as seeds for upcoming works but usually those books stand on their own and have a conclusion on their own. After the first part (noted as such), it's all set up for the sequel. When I don't race to finish a book but feel that \\"I might as well since I'm half way through\\" it's not a good sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy Kindle edition","review":"This book is nothing at all like the Gabaldon books as previous reviewers have so enthusiastically promised.

I read the reviews saying Crank 2 wouldn't work in the older blu ray players. But I just bought a new blu ray player a couple months ago, so I didn't think it would affect me. I was wrong, all I saw was a little 6x6\\" picture on my screen, exactly how the other reviewers had described. Even though the comments suggested a firmware update, that was not the solution. I put it in my PS3 I bought in 07', which I havent updated since 09'. It worked perfectly in my PS3, It still pisses me off it wont work in my brand new blu ray player. But it works in my PS3 so it's not a problem for me. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The movie itself was pretty unbelieveable to the point it was dumb.

If you google crank 2 bluray problems, you will come up with a slew of forum posts about it not working, because it has some sort of new java something or something with bd-live, I don't really know. However, it seems like to get it to actually play you need internet, a sd card or usb flashdrive and to accept some sort of eula agreement. Pretty ridiculous. I still can't get it to work. Crank 1 plays fine though.Hopefully a future update will help fix this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage BluRay Disc","review":"Got the 2 pack from Best Buy...Crank 2 - I don't even use BD-Live; yet they produced this so 2.0 version players require a minimum memory for this feature, and if you don't have it then you can't play this disc at all.

No problem with that one. So Topeak can make a chain tool that works. I might have just gotten a bum pushpin in my Super.I bought the Super in the first place because I figured the chain tool in the Alien II would be flimsy.

An example is that a 65 Chevelle model from the Kansas City plant will have more undercarriage parts painted than the car assembled at the Fremont, California plant. The book tends to state \\"the part appears this way and this way only\\" on a properly restored car and makes no accounting of mid-year changes or manufacturing location difference.

Unfortunately this group does not have one ounce of Latin blood or spirit among them and it shows in this CD and their performance. One of the pieces they attempted last night was Mandinga, a great Cuban guaracha/son which they simply botched. Los Hombres Calientes must be trying to capitalize on the current popularity of Latin music, given their name and billing, however they should call themselves The Hot Men and play New Orleans jazz instead, a genre better suited for their style.

In one episode, a group of Argentinosaurus travel to the nesting place in consistant danger of Giganotosaurus. In the other, Nigel finds a 28 inch claw. New dinos, such as Therizinsaurus, Tarbosaurus and Argentinosaurus, have appeared, with I liked. You can also watch Chased By Sea Monsters on the disc. In Chased By Sea Monsters, Nigel goes back in time (again) to countdown the seven most dangerous seas of all time. Going all the way back to before the Permian Extinction, I was glued to it. Chased By Sea Monsters, in my opinion, was better than Chased By Dinosaurs, but that dosn't mean I don't recommend it. If you liked the Walking With series, then you'll love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More adventure with Nigel","review":"Having seen Prehistoric Park when it was screened in Australia last year, I was anxious to see more episodes of Nigel's adventures. While Prehistoric Park is about Nigel capturing dinosaurs and bringing them back to the present, Chased by Dinosaurs is about Nigel and his intrepid band of cameramen and sound recordists being placed into different situations in the ancient world. Being a dinosaur nut since I was a young boy I found Chased by Dinosaurs an enjoyable piece of escapism coupled with some information about dinosaurs and ancient creatures. I primarily bought it for my little boy, who is a big Prehistoric Park fan, but I found myself getting just as much enjoyment out of each episode. I would recommend this program for anyone who enjoys learning about the prehistoric world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chased by Dinosaurs","review":"NIGEL MARVEN man talk about exciting!

A great pity that Nigel Marven didn't make anymore shows in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainment for both adults and children","review":"I purchased this video thinking it would be used currently for my own entertainment. However, my nearly three year old daughter saw the DVD case and figured she was ready to see it. Now she has a large appetite for viewing Chased By Dinasaurs. She is allowed one hour maximum of video daily, and Chased By Dinasaurs is regularly requested. I have seen the program many times now, and continue to enjoy it. The CGI technology produces surprisingly realistic scenes, and placing Nigel Marvin in a prominent role is an excellent choice. This is an entertaining, somewhat educational video that a wide range of ages will enjoy. Chased by Dinasaurs is one of the relatively few shows that the whole family can enjoy watching together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chased by Dinosaurs","review":"This has kept my 4 year old son entranced, not to mention the rest of the family, it's a kind of docu. jurassic park without people getting eaten and you get to watch and learn about dinosaurs some of which you would never of heard about before, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I liked this program.

Walking with Cavemen was still watchable and this one could have been cool had they removed Marven.Why change something that worked so well? We want to watch the dinosaurs, not Nigel. Trying to play off that Nigel and his film crew were there with the dinosaurs in real time was nothing more than an Ego trip for Nigel or a way to get by having any kind of entertaining story that the other aforementioned series.I got so bored with listening to Nigel talk that after a while I fast forwarded to when they finally introduced the dinosaurs and sea monsters.Worst of the 4, I recommend either skipping it or have your remote ready to fast forward when Nigel starts to ramble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chased By Dinosaurs","review":"I find the episodes Land of Giants and The Giant Claw with having Nigel Marvin in these two series dull and a real disappointent, I give them two thumbs down.I even find the chased by Sea Monsters dull I also give it two thumbs down.I've noticed there is a pterosaur called Ornithocheirus in Land of the Giants and a Liopleurodon in Chased By Sea Monsters, and I perfer those two in Walking With Dinosaurs.TO THE BBC CREATORS OF THESE SERIES WHEN YOU READ MY REVIEW I RECOMEND IN THE FUTURE IF YOU PLAN TO MAKE MORE WALKING WITH DINOSAURS AND BEFORE THE DINOSAURS WALKING WITH MONSTERS SERIES PLEASE HAVE ALL OF THEM BE NARRATED BY KENNETH BRANAGH BECAUSE I FIND THESE SERIES BEING NARRATED BY KENNETH BRANAGH IS TEN TIMES MORE BETTER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid that I can't watch this in England","review":"Having seen most of these episodes when they wereoriginally aired in the UK, I would buy this in aheartbeat - were it not for the stupidity of DVDregion encoding, which means I wouldn't be able towatch it here in England.

It does work all the time in my dvd player and normal cd player. It works in my car but has trouble being ejected all the way (because of the thickness). If you are going to buy a dual disc I would suggest trying to make a copy to a normal disc ASAP, if you can. I don't understand the use for this format. If they want to include DVD audio/ video extras just put it on an extra disc. Also one side of the disc is always exposed so scratches can pile up real quick.

I do 2 pans at a time, rotating halfway through, and this size is easy to manuever and probably fits any oven.CON: These get so hot I can hardly handle them w/ regular oven mits. Cookies bake quickly, but you have to get used to how quickly and even adjust time for subsequent batches as the pans get hotter.I am not an experienced baker, but I assume being able to control baking time would be better.

PreDiddly-Ictable!","review":"Of course One expects a formulaic novel when you read a romance, but Ride a Dark Horse is a repeat of the same scenes over and over again. The woman and the man smooch then they fight, the woman rides the horse brilliantly, the woman and the man smooch and fight, then the woman rides the horse brilliantly, and so on and so on.The author knows her stuff where horses are concerned, but the tedious, unoriginal romance between two wounded, but otherwise flawless characters is like reading through mud. I LOVE adult horse books. If you want a grown up version of those young adult books we know and love, read Riders by Jilly Cooper, or Trophies by Ainsley Sheridan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly accurate","review":"Having ridden hunter/jumpers all my life, I bought this book skeptically. Most authors that try to write about the circuit end up annoying me with their lack of research. Laura Moore knows her horses and life on the show circuit very well. There were no jarring details out of place in this book. As a veterinary student, I can also say she knows her medicine. An excellent first book, this subject matter was perfect for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride A Dark Horse","review":"I loved this book. The characters were very developed which I enjoyed and their lives were fully intregrated into the romance format. Their love affair took its' time to develop and was very satisfying.Laura Moore is a wonderfully descriptive writer who obviously knew her subject matter of show jumping very well and it was very exciting to watch rider and horse as well as the rest of the cast of characters develop over the course of the spring and summer.The other aspect of the book that I throughly enjoyed was the use of parralel story lines. It was really a pleasure to read. I would read another novel by this writer in a minute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut","review":"This is a great debut novel from someone who obviously knows her stuff regarding the hunter/jumper world and veterinary medicine. If she isn't a rider, then she's done some fantastic research.Cassie and Caleb's romance blossoms slowly, which is a refreshing change. I dislike this trend I've seen developing over the past year or so in contemporary romance which gets the H&H in bed way to soon--before there's even a friendship between them in some cases. Thankfully, Ms. Moore didn't do this, making this a very pleasurable read.I'd definitely recommend 'Dark Horse' to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good horse details and believable story","review":"I liked the characters in this book quite a bit, and the love story between the protagonists is developed in a fairly believable way. The author does have the characters work together and get to know each other before they actually give in to the passion that they feel for each other. The equestrian details are also accurate.As with most romances, so of the conflicts that the characters have to work through to live happily every after seem quite contrived. I wish that wasn't so here, because this is an enjoyable story. I wish that the strong characters had the sense not to get caught up in the personal conflicts that frustrate them here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to believe this is a first book!!","review":"An extremely well written book, in a class with Nora Roberts, Sandra Brown and Linda Howard.

But what I will remember most is the authors way of creating intense sexual desire. The reason I am on Amazon today is to order additional Laura Moore books before I finish this one. It's been a fun book that both my sister and I really enjoyed. I hope you will enjoy it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable for a first novel!","review":"I know nothing about horses, but was fascinated to read about the horse shows. It certainly seemed to me that Ms. Moore knows her way around animals. Wonderful love story and very special celebration at the end of their unique love.

Hope to see a story about him soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"This book, as well as Mr. Shaara's previous effort about WWI, did not live up to my expectations. His prequel and sequel to The Killer Angels didn't skip a beat from his father's memorable novel about the conflict at Gettysburg and that momentum carried over to his tale of the US-Mexican War and his 2-novel series on the American Revolution. Perhaps it was those lofty expectations that left me disappointed with his most recent work. After 2+ years, I have yet to finish The Rising Tide as I have been unable to immerse myself into this story -something that would occur naturally for the reader in his early works. I do hope that after the WWII series is completed, he goes back to his roots and is able to find the inner storyteller that captivated us all as in Gods and Generals and The Last Full Measure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Mediocre","review":"Poor Jeff - he has to live in the shadow of his father, Michael Shaara, who wrote the excellent novel Killer Angels. I thought Jeff did a good job with his civil war novels, and ok with the WWI novel.This book is not exciting. The author gives the reader a long (over 100 pages) background of WWII. I do not think that is needed - who but WWII buffs are going to read this? That makes all of the background history unnessary. When you finally do get into the dialogue between the characters, it is two dimensional and reveals nothing new. I think the author should challenge himself and the reader providing something unique.As other reviewers have pointed out, there are technical errors in the book as well, which means you have to take that aspect of the book with a grain of salt - so why bother?Don't believe me - take it from the author himself - he says in his own introduction, what can he possibly add to all that has already been written about WWII? Indeed, Jeff, good question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old REAL fast","review":"Okay Jeff Shaara, we get it. Your opinion is that everyone in WWII spent most of their time bitching about one thing or another. That's fine.

The cover art is inviting, but the prose is dull and predictable. I am a WWII buff, but I started looking forward to the next book on my to-read list a dozen pages into this tome. Historical figures like George Patton, Churchill, Eisenhower and Irwin Rommel deserve better than they received at the hands of Jeff Sharra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rising Tide -- Falls","review":"Shallow. Definitely lacking in any sort of history: political, military, sociological or human. Page after page of insidip dialog and ruminations, often by characters only obliquely related to anything having to do with WWII, Torch or the basic nature of armed conflict.A great idea to create an inside look at Torch and the early history of WWII, but it didnt happen in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Warts, Please","review":"This book was disappointing to me. I have never read a more sanitized novel about WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"I have read every book that Jeff Shaara has written and have enjoyed them all. This book, however, did not go as far as his others in providing me new insight to the personalities involved as I was more familiar with Eisenhower, Rommel, and Montgomery than I was with the personalities of his previous books covering earlier wars. Mr. Shaara continues to do an outstanding job of presenting the perspectives of the individual Soldiers which are incredibly valuable. I recommend this book to anyone at all interested in WWII and I look forward to his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his others","review":"I'm a big fan of all of Jeff's other books. I think he has gotten better with each book that he's written. That trend ended here. Unfortunately, I believe the reason was a tactical error. What made his other books so good where the portrayal of the war and hardship that the protaganists had to experience. By choosing to spend so much time on Eisenhower and other generals, there just wasn't anything exciting or riveting happening. He spent too much time dealing with planning and not enough time on the experiences of the men."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good entry for Shaara into World Way II.","review":"This is a good read on the beginning stages of the U.S. effort during World War II in the European Theater.

It is an excellent portrayal of the details of the war we rarely hear about. I could not put the book down and read through the entire trilogy without stopping. This is technically a \\"historical fiction\\" because Shaara wrote imagined conversations that the key figures might have had. It was done so carefully and with complete adherence to the truth of the narrative. It is every bit as good as the Gods & Generals trilogy. A must read and should be required reading in schools!"},{"rating":"2","title":"El Alamein","review":"The Rising TideJeff Shaara has intertwined real life people such as Rommel, Monty, Eisenhower & others along with fictitousbattle ready troops.

His handling of political and military matters conerning the French of North Africa are unmatched by any of our great leaders. JEFF SHAARA was able to point this out from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big step backwards","review":"I've enjoyed every Shaara novel until this one. In his Civil War novels, Lee, Jackson, and others were real three dimensional characters with unique voices, and the pace of the writing changed in tense battle scenes.Now he's adopted a breathless writing style using compound sentences continuously, regardless of the tension. He even uses them in the dialog which makes every character and the narrarative all sound alike.It feels like the work of a research team, not a novelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical accurate novel","review":"I feel that Shaara did an excellent job interweaving historical accuracy with fiction. The story takes place during the North African Campaign and the invasion of Sicily during WWII. The author takes WWII history and uses fictional dialogue and some fictional characters to bring history to life.

This book is excellent. It takes you into the mindset of the big and small players of WWII and takes you back to a time that has almost become ancient history for some.I like the other works of Shaara and like his other work this series is \\"Excellent\\". Great read for those who like history and like to get beyond the places and dates approach to history. He has a way of actually taking you back in time and into the anxiety's, fears and doubt of the various players."},{"rating":"2","title":"A commanding view of the war","review":"We have come to expect the best from Jeff Shaara and with THE RISING TIDE we are not let down. This is an epic work on an equal level with his former works on the revolutionary and civil wars. But now, Shaara has stepped onto the biggest of all war time stages and he does so in typical grand fashion. From inside the minds of Rommel, Montgomery and Patton and down into the trenches with American tanker Jack Logan and Airborne trooper, Jesse Adams, we see the war from all angles in a truly compelling story. I did not have the opportunity to read this extraordinary book until just recently but I will not wait to pick up the next in the series. RISING TIDE has forced me to revise my list of favorite WW2 novels. Here's the revised list:War and RemembranceNight of Flames: A Novel of World War IIEye of the NeedleThe Rising Tide: A Novel of World War IIThe Winds of War"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not great","review":"(review by her husband)The Rising Tide is Jeff Shaara's first part of a WW II Trilogy. Having enjoyed both his Civil War and Revolutionary War histories, I looked forward to his approach to this conflict. Unfortunately, the book lacked the spark that Shaara imparted to his earlier writings. Herman Wouk did it better in his set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Jeff Shaara once again writes an outstanding historical fiction. The North African/Sicily/Italian Campaign is often forgotten in coverage of the war falling as a footnote to D-Day and other battles. This well researched novel places the reader as an intimate witness to the American introduction to war and their subsequent maturing as a dominant fighting force. You are exposed to the delicate politics and frustrations experienced by the planners as well as the bravery of the common soldier. The writing is swift and engrossing. It is a shame we will have to wait another year for the next installment in the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"History? Fiction?","review":"It's hard to think of this as a novel, rather than a recycled \\"WWII 101\\" history sprinkled with fictional vignettes.

However, as a novel, this one, \\"The Rising Tide\\" left me cold. In fact, I was unable to finish the book. I found it dry, factual, and frankly boring. I mean, the war was over 65 years ago. The allies won. So facts and figures and drawings of battle plans and casualty figures just aren't that compelling. At this point it doesn't matter much how many tanks Rommel commanded and how many tanks Montgomery or Patton commanded. I wanted a story about the men who fought those tanks and the infrantry soldiers who fought alongside them!I was looking for a good novel about the men and women who fought the war, told from their viewpoints. Something I could get emotionally involved with.I say again, good book as a dry history. As a novel, not so hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Shaara","review":"If you liked the rest of Jeff Shaara's books, you'll like this one too.

It reads more like a textbook, so I recommend it for a counselors ( psychiatrist, psychologist or therapists) manual only, not for clientele or families to read. It seems to be very helpful in understanding all aspects of codependency and how to apply treatment that will aid in facilitating change within the individual and families. It has concrete information to use as a guide as well as ideas to suggest that the professionals revising the DSM-TR that perhaps this diagnosis may need to be included in the manual as an adjunct reference in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"the big fisherman","review":"I would really like to write a review but cannot because I have not received this book to date 5-11-2009.

I particularly enjoy how it interwines some from 'The Robe'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly boring","review":"I first read The Robe (multiple times) beginning when I was about 7 or 8, saw the movie when it came out. Then I saw that The Robe was on Kindle, got it to see if it was still worth reading after 50 years or so, and I enjoyed it. (Douglas does tend to overwork the verb \\"drawled\\" for \\"said\\").I'd never seen the movie \\"Demetrius & the Gladiators\\" or read Douglas' \\"Big Fisherman\\", so I tried both. \\"Gladiators\\" was rather fun, a good old Hollywood costume flick (sword fights, dancing girls), but the book \\"Big Fisherman\\" is a hopeless bore, full of anachronistic nonsense.I slogged through several chapters of this Arabian Princess & Palestinian Greek Prince romance (with no hint of a biblical/Christian connection yet) that wouldn't have entertained me when I was age 8, and gave up. I deleted it from my Kindle and if it had been a paper copy I would have recycled it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Fiction Read, Not Accurate Biblically","review":"Others have outlined the story in their reviews accurately. Only one so far has pointed out that it is biblically inaccurate. It is an interesting story, although I thought the ending was disappointing (as far as the story of Fara goes). If you hope to gain insights into Christianity by reading this book, go to the Bible instead. This book explains away many of Christ's miracles, and the account of the Loaves and Fishes is sincerely warped. I'm not sure how religiously trained Mr. Douglas was, but he didn't seem to have much biblical knowledge. If he did, then he was trying outright to cast doubts upon the faith of those who read his book. His interpretation of Christ's teachings was sometimes very flawed, although at times he quoted him accurately, and there were powerful teachings."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you care about the origin of Hawaiian names, read this!","review":"A well researched and presented book from an authority on Hawaiian legends and history.

It features some really nice songs. Dusty recorded the album in Nashville. Some of the songs are a little weaker, and the production isn't always great, but the cd is still pretty good. Her voice is very warm and strong as usual. \\"Roll Away\\" is an excellent album opener. \\"You are The Storm\\" and \\"Go Easy On Me\\" are great ballads. \\"Wherever Would I Be\\" is a great duet with Daryl Hall, although I like the solo version better (found on her HEART AND SOUL compilation of rarities and live tracks). The album closer \\"Where Is A Woman To Go\\" is a great bluesy track and a good way to close off the album. A few tracks I don't care for much are \\"Old Habits Die Hard\\", the Diane Warren song \\"Lovin Proof\\". Otherwise it's a fairly good album of songs from Dusty, which would be her last album of new material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It Sems","review":"This item, which I mistakenly purchased, is not what it says.

It not only mis-states facts but the interpretations are often just as wrong. Leider's conclusion, \\"Valentino helped deflower postwar America,\\" must take its place in the purple-prose hall of shame. Michael Morris's 1991 book, Madame Valentino, on Valentino's wife, Natacha Rambova, set a standard with its accurate exploration of their relationship and his historical and critical discussion of the Valentino films. That standard is unmet by Leider, leaving the task of a truly commendable biography of Valentino himself still to be undertaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate but not great","review":"The basic life story of Valentino is told, but it is the telling that is off-putting. A curious style of unscholarly writing together with the misuse of terms (e.g., \\"hoi polloi\\" is used to refer to the \\"elite\\" when in fact it means the \\"common\\") detracts from the narrative. And, as to one of the persisting questions regarding Valentino's sexual orientation, her descriptions of his relationships is at odds with her conclusions. Not the definitive text this subject needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Condescending","review":"I was disappointed in this book because I really felt that she looked down on Valentino, and many times insulted him by calling him \\"naive\\", and putting down his acting abilities in his films, etc. I also felt that she spent too much time and too many pages on printing the bad reviews of his films, and not enough of the positive ones!!!In this case, I feel that this woman did not understand how difficult the film industry is, and obviously she has never worked in or on a film.She was more like a critic that looked down on Valentino, and even defended Natasha, who never really loved him! She did not understand Valentino, and how difficult show business can be for a star that is set apart from the rest.There were many times when I was really angry with this author. She neglected the human side of Valentino, and concentrated more on everyone around him, mostly the negative.I do not like this woman... Rudy would have been upset at this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intoxicating","review":"This book outlines the life of Valentino behind the scenes and in the public eye to a point where you feel like you are walking hand in hand with the legendary silent star...emotionally striking, especially towards the closing...a story which has been unparalleled by any other biographer I have yet encountered on this remarkable soul with profound talent and beauty. It has not only become one of my favorite biographies, but favorite pieces of literature overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"400-500 Page Tabloid","review":"I have read 6 books about Rudolph Valentino and after a long waint I am disappointed with Ms. Leider's book.

I did learn more about his troubled childhood, his close friends, events of the Mineralava Tour and the details of his business negotions. Ms. Leider has done extensive research but some of theses sources could be slanted or erroneous. So we have a chatty, gossipy book about what everyone had to say about him. To the Amazaon com reveiwer who called Rudy a lightweight; Mr. Valentino was fluent in 3 languages, he had a large library of books, he was a sportsman, an accomplished horseman, and had tastes for art and history.\`He was somewhat of the dilletante Ms. Leider's book is a book for the nineties in which people were defined by their faults and weaknesses, rather than their disposition or motivations."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT COLLECTION OF TUNES; HER VOICE IS A WONDER","review":"In my opinion, Milva's voice is one of the greatest of our time.

Her approach is almost operatic, though her voice is a popular voice. She also sings with a great deal of strength, emotion and soul. This is an effort from the mid-70's, a very fertile period for great Italian pop.

I don't know if Don was suppressing the guitar on this album or not, but John doesn't get a chance to shine. This is a total sleeper. Why does Don Dokken keep putting these psychedelic, Beatlesque sounding songs on his albums? Where did his voice go? It's so soft and meodic. Is it too much to ask for an album to rock? I've read the other reviews and, no, this album does not rock and its not a return to the classic Dokken sound. Some bands can progress and some cannot. Here, the latter holds true. He had such a powerhouse of players in Norum/Sparks that I thought this album would have some life to it. Sadly it has none. There are a couple of songs where the guitar takes off, but sadly it's in the final 3 seconds of the song ending and fading out. What the hell has happend to this band?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My top 5 album of the year","review":"This isn't what I expected from Dokken. And That is a good thing. Don sings better than ever and although I skip through a few I love these songs. Although John Norum (ex Europe) does a good job, It doesn't sound like him. I have John Norums solo albums and the chops are just not here. But this is 2002 and all my favorite albums have no solos. Norum is one I would tolerate ripping. Radio will probably like \\"Sunless Days\\", \\"There Was A Time\\", \\"You\\" and I can hear \\"I've Found\\" and \\"Goodbye My Friend\\" on radio as well. \\"Under The Gun\\" shows who was writing those rockers as far back as Paris Is Burning. Guess Don Dokken is still running the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled.","review":"This isn't really Dokken. Not the \\"real\\" Dokken. Without Pilsen and Lynch this is just \\"Don Dokken\\". As far as I'm concerned \\"Back for the Attack\\" was the last real Dokken album and it hasn't been the same or as good since. Why can't Don get all the players back? Well, if you do some research online you'll find that there is a lot of bad blood between them. What a shame. I saw Lynch play a show last year (2001) and he still rocked the house and even played a good medley of old Dokken tunes! It was AWESOME! I look forward to his forthcoming studio effort with Pilsen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad, don't waste your money","review":"Next to Shadow Life, this is the second worst CD Dokken has put out. I don't understand why they choose to write this stuff when their fan base is from the 80's. I've waited for their writing skills to warm up, but I can't wait any longer, this is the last Dokken CD I buy.For starters, it has no energy. The guitar sounds like a gas powered chain saw. It doesn't evoke a mood or feeling. The production is terrible, I can't even say that any of it sounds good.This doesn't even come close to Tooth and Nail or Under Lock and Key. It's sad to see a great band fall apart and go down in flames."},{"rating":"2","title":"In A Word-Great","review":"I don't hear the grunge, this is a logical folow up to \\"Erase the slate\\", Don's voice sounds great and Norum does as well!!!

I was a little disappointed with alot of the guitar work on this album as it always seemed to be more powerful. I have always been a George Lynch fan and have missed him the last 2 albums, but the previous album, Erase The Slate, was done excellently with Reb Beach. Now with John Norum at the helm, it definitely has a different sound, but that is not a bad thing.The lyrics seem a little dark and depressing on most of the songs, but Don's voice still remains. And this album rocks pretty good.Sunless Day, Under the Gun, and Magic Road are 3 good rockers and the song I've Found is a great ballad. I'd say there isn't a bad song on the CD.I didn't like this one as much as Erase The Slate, but it's a definite buy for any Dokken fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!...","review":"First, let me start by saying I have all of Dokkens' cds and Don's solo stuff. I love Dokken, they are one of my favorite bands. Let's cut through all the B.S., to say this CD stinks is being too nice. John Norum is boring,unimaginative and couldn't fill George Lynch's shoes if he could play 2 guitars at once. This isn't a Dokken CD, it's a solo Don Dokken CD. Dokken used to make you want to bang your head, this CD makes you want to throw yourself off a bridge. I gave the CD to another big Dokken friend of mine and he gave it to another and another, ect. You get the picture. I imagine at some point and time it will end up ... where it belongs. Lastly, some of you ... that review music use the term 80's hair bands as if it were a bad word.

Written in a 19th century literary style with a modern sensibility, it has the kind of \\"Turn of the Screw\\" mood which I found a perfect antidote to the \\"yet another serial killer\\" novels that abound. (Not that I don't love a good serial killer story too!)This is a great story for a stormy evening, tucked up in bed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so scary!","review":"I purchased this book because it is supposed to be a very scary ghost story and I love ghost stories, but I was sadly disappointed. While there is, indeed, a ghost in the book, she is mean and evil rather than terrifying. When the narrator first encounters supernatural happenings in the bog it is not a heart-thumping moment as I would have liked. All in all, it was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the scary part?","review":"this is probably a case where reading the reviews caused me to have unreasonable expectations.

This was a gift for my birthday and what a great gift it turned out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is In A Class By Itself","review":"This book is perhaps one of the best ghost stories ever written. It's what most authors hope their manuscripts will grow up to be. This book made me nervous. It's painfully suspensful.

You will never regret buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully atmospheric ghost story!","review":"If you like the Gothic genre, you will love this book. It is so descriptive that you feel as if you are there. Genuinely spooky and suspenseful. Put me in mind of Wilkie Collins style of writing.

I saw the trailer and it looks amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Woman In Black","review":"Absolutely chilling! By far the most frightening ghost story I've ever read.

It has wonderfully whimsical illustrations which add to the sense of the book as a reproduction of an older tale & maybe that's the problem.I really love a good ghost story, but this just didn't do it for me. I found the writing to be mannered to the point of distraction & the story to be a cliched set piece with nothing new to add to the genre.I wanted to be scared by this book, but the ghostly happenings are just so predictable - the woman in black with the wasted face that pops up all over, the deserted house in the marsh that no one will visit, the ghostly sounds of pony trap & chair, the callow narrator's journey from youth to experience, etc., etc., etc.I really like this author, but this isn't one of her better outings.

However, we all agreed that it was more of a \\"Trick\\". The ending was telegraphed from the beginning and speaking of telegraphs we were all confused as to the time period.

Same problem with movies. This book was so boring to me the first 105 pages, it felt like all filler. The book only has 138 pages so that should warn you. I hate that I wasted my money on it. The library didn't have any copies, that should have told me something also. I can only say I wish I could be so easily scared by a book as the readers that gave it 4 & 5 stars. If anyone can tell me a really scary book, please let me know. Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I must not have read the same book the others did. For me this book was very average. I don't usually do well at guessing what is going to happen, but I was way ahead of this book all the way through.

My guess is that they didn't want people scanning or photocopying the pages. Maybe they thought this would cut down on people copying the pages, but what a let down! It is also incomplete! I do have some original Sears Christmas Catalogs that I ordered on Ebay and that is a much better way to go. Would have gotten five stars if it had color pages and was more complete! I DO NOT recommend this book. Buy the Totally Tubular 80's Toys book instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it was in color!!!!","review":"I agree with the comments above.

Beofre I purchased the greatest hits album i knew only a couple of Springsteens songs primarily the \\"Born in the USA\\" stuff from the radio. I was incredibly excited to get this CD and was never disappointed. The changes in Bruce's style from the renegade hero of Born to Run, to the sad man who had lost all his dreams in the River, to the hero returning from Vietnam and becoming disillusioned with America, in Born in the USA. THis also has some of his softer love ballads, Brilliant Diguise, Human Touch and Secret Garden. Everytime I listen to this CD I find something new that I love about it. Since buying this CD I have gone on to buy every other album of Bruce, and while there are some notable exceptions (I'm on Fire and Two Hearts) the album is still the definition of Bruce Springsteen as it encompasses all that he wishes to write about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BOSS","review":"My husband and I just loved this album.

You can see it in this collection. Springbean was a product of the late 1970s and ever since has just been repeating himself. As Phil Spector recently said about Springbean's career, he has \\"protected himself with three new songs and 25 old ones.\\" With minor variation to the quote, it could serve for this release.It's a cynical compilation of the multi-millionaire working-man-poseur's most superficial songs, with a few previously-unavailable numbers thrown in to entice die-hards to spend their money.The new \\"modern\\" mastering of it is wretched, from the engineering school of \\"Turn everything up in volume and boost that treble to 11.\\"The best Springbean song that's missing here? \\"On the Dark Side,\\" which Stephen King recently put in his list of all-time best rock and roll songs. If that had been included, they could have eliminated half of the selections they did pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's \\"Jesse's Girl\\"?","review":"I can't believe they have the nerve to call this Bruce Springsteen's greatest hits.

A bunch of junk is more like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He's not even an American, people!","review":"Greatest hits? How about renaming the title to Bruce Springsteen: Songs Nobody Listens to Anymore. Ever since Bruce changed his name from John Cougar Mellencamp his career has gone down hill fast.Also, what's with the guitar on the album cover? Sure, he's decent at playing piano, but trying to make him into some rocker who plays guitar is a bit of a stretch.While Born In the U.S.A. is a great song, and it's been widely used in political campaigns, the song is ludicrous considering this man is a Canadian citizen. His single claim to fame is a song about being born somewhere that he wasn't.Don't buy new, buy one of the 300,000 used copies for .99 cents if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound and fury signifying nothing","review":"Look, it's rock and roll...it's not going to save the human race.

I do like Bruce and still can't figure out why he would not let fellow Jew Bette Midler record Pink Cadillac, claiming at the time that it was not a song meant to be sung by a woman. He \\"changed his tune\\" a few years later by allowing Natalie Cole to do a disco version of the song and score a top 10 hit with it.It just seems to put in perspective, a new meaning to the original thought. Is life fair?...No. Are the Democrats and Republicans the same? Yes! It's all about contradiction~It's hard to listen to this CD with the free spirit I once had in my youth. When now I hear how I am mislead to follow the leader.

The CD cover was as advertised. Even the title printed on the CD was \\"Bruce Springsteen: Greatest Hits\\", as advertised. However, the actual music on the disc was \\"Toni Braxton: Greatest Hits\\". I thought this was just a one in a million fluke and that Columbia must have just had a little burning accident. I returned the disc, and reordered through a different seller. Unfortunately, once again I received Toni Braxton's Greatest Hits. What are the chances?!? I would avoid this CD unless you are willing to make multiple trips to the UPS Store to return the product... Update (2/21/12) Third time was the charm.

In hindsight, I should have just purchased the higher quality songs I wanted on iTunes or Amazon Digital..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the purpose of this CD?","review":"I always thought of Bruce Springsteen as someone who made albums, and some very good ones at that. His 1975 album BORN TO RUN is one of my 10 favorite albums of all time. Why anybody would want to buy a geatest hits compilation of Bruce Springsteen songs is beyond me. I hate this CD simply because I love Bruce's original albums so much. And if you're only going to have one Bruce Springsteen CD in your collection, then I suggest that you get BORN TO RUN."},{"rating":"2","title":"They call this his greatest work???","review":"as a springsteen fan i can't believe they call this his best work! Yes Born in the USA and Dancing in the dark are great hitsbut for example my Hometown left me thinking. and where is tunnel of love? surely they don't think Brilliant disquise is better than that. And i also have to agree that putting new songs on the album isn't so good as well. Sure i like This hard land and murder inc but those aren't his best work. I think this CD is quikly put together and that really puts me of.I only give it four stars because it's his name on the cover of the CD. So don't waste your'e time and buy a good album like Tunnel of Love or Born to Run."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Back Would Be Turned Away Also.","review":"Even Springsteen did not like the song selection for the greatest hits cd, that's why his back is turned away to show his shame at Columbia. 8 good songs I see (1-5,7,8,&10) but how could they leave off fan favorites like \\"Rosalita\\", \\"Cadillac Ranch\\", and \\"10th Ave. Freeze Out\\". or other good songs \\"Prove It All Night\\", \\"Promise Land\\", \\"Jungle Land\\", \\"Pink Cadillac\\", \\"She's the One\\", \\"Out in the Street\\", \\"You Can Look (but you better not touch)\\" and \\"Cover Me\\".

I primarily like his earlier works, but have listened to a lot of what he has done over the years. Missing from this Greatest Hits collection is Tunnel Of Love and One Step Up. I am sure that their are others but, those two stand out. This may appeal to someone who is just trying to add some of his music to their collection.

If you're a big Springsteen fan, this CD may not satisfy your wants, but if you maybe just enjoy listening to him from time to time or are a beginner as a fan of his, this CD is a worthy buy.

That's just to name a few of the MIA's from this travesty. So finally the 2-disc \\"Essential\\" comes out and all is well, right? Guess again. It too is an uneven, incomplete collection. Will someone please help us casual Boss fans with a single or 2-disc set that \\"contains all the hits\\" career retrospective of this man?

Of course I'll still ask where's \\"Tunnel Of Love\\", \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\\", \\"I'm On Fire\\", and my personal fave \\"Pink Cadillac\\"? But, it does include \\"Born To Run\\", \\"Dancing In The Dark\\", \\"Human Touch\\", and \\"Secret Garden\\", and that should please most casual fans, which this collection is for anyway.

Namely, his songs are alost universally better live. And his \\"Hits\\" are not close to his Greatest songs.There are exceptions: Thunder Road, Born to Run The River come to mind immediately. But this leaves out too many of his staple great songs to be worth a purchase. If this is your only Bruce purchase, your understanding of his music and why his fans are who they are will never come to be. Without Rosie, Jungleland, Sandy, Incident, and others, you are missing the Bruce mythos.Spend more money, go buy Live 1975-85, or buy Live in New York City. You will get a better overall picture of The Boss, and those albums are just magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection","review":"Great collection spawning from Springsteen's early rock (Born to Run, Thunder Road, Badlands) to his cheesy pop hits (Dancing in the Dark, Hungry Heart), his story ballads (The River, Atlantic City), rock anthems (Born in the U.S.A., Glory Days), and his newer rock hits (Human Touch, Better Days). At the end he throws in soundtrack hit \\"Streets of Philadephia\\" and some new tracks.Overall the collection is excellent; it shines from the \\"Born to Run\\" album through \\"Born in the U.S.A\\" album and then the song quality drops a little for the rest of the album. But every songwriter has a \\"golden period\\" and sooner or later will decline. Still, even on later tracks such as \\"Murder Incorporated\\" and \\"This Hard Land,\\" his ferocious singing and deep lyrics are impressive. My one qualm is not including the haunting ballad \\"I'm on Fire.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"You know how it goes","review":"It is true. You'd be much more pleased buying a Boss album than this. Imagine a video of the greatest scenes from the greatest movies. It'd be a mere novelty because everything would be out of context. Like it or not, Bruce always makes concept albums. There is little to link the songs on this effort except their recognizability. I happen to like \\"Secret Garden\\", but please do yourself a favor, beyond everything else, and buy ANY of his normal albums. Have a couple beers and \\"prove it all night\\". You will find so many gems left off this collection, as the above reviews are quick to point out (Racing in the Streets, Downbound Train, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce Sold Out","review":"The hits, are well known by all us fans. I must say I'm shocked \\"The Boss\\" claims he dropped the ball on the Wal-Mart deal. Are you kidding? He took millions from Wal-Mart and then throws them under the bus, all the while, taking their cash. Most of us shop at Wal-Mart and like shoping there for the great deals during these tough times.

As he preaches the Gospel of Bibical eating, he invents a new way of life - one that is destined to change the world. Of course, it soon becomes apparent that this tale follows the Christ story (in explicit detail) - from the ragtag group of followers, to the shunning masses (who STILL don't get the real message), to those who only care about the miracles to the raising of the dead and, at last, sacrifice and resurrection and a new life in his teachings.On one level, there is the story of the mystery man - the one everyone knows - who becomes the great Teacher with the all of the attending attention. He is the moral teacher, the one who breaks the rules and must decide how far to go. Like Christ, he is aware of his own impending doom and sees that his message will only be greater after his death. This is the book that most authors wish they could write but never do."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for the diet, 2 stars for the book","review":"I agree with the others that this book should be taken to \\"heart\\" (as well as the rest of the good- for-your-body food) but the message gets distorted after that. Even for a health-nut like me, the fanatical obsession with food gets boring.

I finally decided there were too many good books out there and not enough time left to waste on a turkey like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horror book that fails to break new ground","review":"This was a bargain-bin book and it met my expectations. I did finish it but I had initially given up towards the end. Although this story was written in 1989 it could easily have been written decades before that. There were no new ideas within the covers and it felt like it was set in a 60s/B-Movie sort of film. The characters seemed very thin and based on stereotypes. The storyline based around the passing down of the Book of the Dead was pretty bland - it would probably make an OK film because the director could add flesh to the story that isn't really here. The author's descriptive ability didn't bring this tome to life! This is very average fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was very good and diffrent","review":"I'm not much of a reader but when I started reading The book of the dead I couldnt put it down and it took me two days to finish it. I wish I could find his other books so I could read them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possible the worst example of a \\"horror\\" book...","review":"Three words best describe the book: cliche, trite, and garbage. The story is a pitiful twist on that seen in The Monkey's Paw among other stories. The characters are boring and unrealistic, the story is too fast paced, the ending is the epitome of cliche, and it fits the bill of bargain bin horror all too well: nice unnecessary, gory descriptions and a bit of nudity. Skip it. Maybe even burn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh..","review":"I couldn't even finish the first volume of this sophomoric manga. The story develops lightning fast, making it a bit confusing. It feels like the author was in a huge rush with this manga. The story line isn't cohesive at all and doesn't flow very well. Every situation just seems so randomly placed, like a small child wrote it. Worst of all it's really cheesy, especially in the fact that it implicitly STATES that the setting is fictional....I mean how lame is that?The style and art are nice, but nothing exceptional. I prefer mangas with art that sets the mood by showing detailed images of the setting in between story development and dialogue. I didn't really see any of this in D. Gray-Man.D. Gray-Man might be enjoyable by a 10 year old boy with a short attention span, but not by most adult readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting bit of history","review":"Pipes does a very fine job of eliciting from scant evidence the details of Degaev's personal story. And he exercises due caution in interpreting that evidence. The young Degaev, Russian ideologue and terrorist, emerges fairly distinctly from the evidence -- though one has the impression that there's more to his story than the available record indicates; the older Degaev, professor of mathematics in the midwestern US, emerges less distinctly. That these two Degaev's should have been one and the same person, is fascinating indeed. What the fact says about terrorism and the rise of terrorists is less clear to me. I think RP does well not to infer too much on this score. He leaves it to the reader to draw his/her own conclusions. TGA is an exemplary piece of historical reconstruction, and a very entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much scent, sticky","review":"Really wanted to like this product. However, it has some flaws.- The container isn't opaque, which means that the product is exposed to the sun. Retino - the key anti-wrinkle ingredient in this product - is known to break decay with exposure. So it should be kept in an opaque tube that is tightly sealed. That is not this product.- The smell is very strong, and they clearly color it and use tons of perfume. I can't imagine that this helps with anti-wrinkle or healing properties. But it does have the effect of driving my cat away at night because it is so strong.- After applying my hands become sticky. Really sticky. Strange feeling, like they're becoming puckered. I immediately have to wash them. I don't know what this is attributed to, but it's quite unpleasant.Overall, disappointed in this product. I don't think I'll be buying again. After doing some comparisons, I prefer the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loaded with silica, did not get absorbed at all","review":"This cream felt exactly like a primer, loaded with silica and it had a very strong perfume too. It felt sticy and did not get absorbed into my skin at all. I did not see any difference in the morning. I have been using this for 2 weeks. Will definitely go back to the total effects night cream. That one was a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed again!","review":"I was anxious to try this product due to all the advertising hype but again felt it was only another moisturizer on the market but not something that made any definite changes in the skin. Hopefully they will find a product that will really make a difference. Probably have to spend more money than what this item costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD reaction.","review":"Although this cream seemed to moisturize well, it made my forehead break out in small red bumps that turned into white heads. I mean TONS of bumps. It was a pimply rash of about 50 white-heads. I washed my face and thank God the bumps went away in a day. I normally don't react to creams this way. I would try a small amount to test it before use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"To be honest ladies, when I buy a moisturizer I don't expect it to get rid of wrinkles; all i expect is that it will do a good job of moisturizing my very very dry skin; Up until this past month I used Clinque Moisture On Line exclusively; it is a wonderful product with no scent; that product was discontinued. I have spent the entire month buying products on the internet and at the drugstore trying to duplicate Moisture On Line; guess what, the only product that is the closest is Olay Night Recovery Cream; yes the color is putrid (sorry Olay) and the smell I could live without (but I can tolerate it); this is a really good moisturzing cream; if I want to get rid of wrinkles I'll get a facelift; If I want a moisturizer that makes my skin moist and smooth, I will use this product. By the way the only difference between a night cream and moisturizer,as I understand it is that moisturizer has suncreen and night cream obviously doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks!","review":"I just received this yesterday and used it for the first time last night. Oh, it smells. It is heavily scented, and I can't for the life of me - in a time when everyone is going back to natural, organic and unscented - figure out why they loaded up a product for use on your face with so much fragrance. And it's floral. Ick. If it were lemon or peach... maybe. But old lady floral? I kept getting whiffs of it as I was trying to fall asleep. I'm not sure that I can use this product long enough to give my honest opinion of whether it works.I will try it again tonight, using less than last night, and applying with a tissue (I could not wash the flower smell from my hands). The things we do for beauty! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cream!","review":"I love this cream. I just started using this a couple of weeks ago and I have seen dramatic results already. My under eye dark circles lighten a bit, the wrinkles in my eyes are now softer, and my facial pores are smaller. I have few people commented already about how my skin improved a lot and they wanted to know what product Im using.The only negative thing is that, a few days ago, my skin started to break out (under the jaw). I just used an Acne wash to control it. But Im not sure if it is this product that is causing the breakout or it is that monthly thing where our hormones (women) are all whacked out. I think it is the later because I always break out when my period is about to come (sorry too much information)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for those of us \\"of an age\\"","review":"I have to laugh when I see the 20-something reviews complaining they don't see a difference. There's no difference to be made for 20-something skin - the most important thing is sunscreen at that age. Don't waste your money on a night cream that doesn't really do anything for you.That being said, all of us older gals DO need something that does make a difference. I became hooked on this product several months ago. I cannot go a day without it. Would be one of my stranded-on-a-desert-island choices. Makes my skin feel ultra-smooth and the crinkling I am seeing now in my neck is much less noticeable when I use the cream - not gone away but much less noticeable.

My skin is really soft and even now."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word ... AWESOME!","review":"First i'll say that at 54 years old i've tried my share of products including quite a few very pricey items. This is frankly a fabulous moisturizer with a great scent. It feels crazy good going on ... and that's the key to moisturizers once you have 'em ya got to use 'em. And this one I do. So much so that I get regular shipments. I took one star away because it really doesn't do anything for wrinkles but I don't believe that any OTC (pricey or not) does that. I have Retin-A for that. But since I'm using Retin-A I need to follow up with a great moisturizer and this product is a terrific moisturizer. I love the scent but if you're sensitive to products with a strong scent this may not be right for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works!","review":"I buy this product for my mother all the time and she truly loves it.

I think it is ok, but I don't usually have the discipline to use it every night. For the week that i did use it religiously, I found that it did make my skin nice and soft and smooth. One concern I have is that it feels a bit oily and I worry that it will clog my pores. I only used it for a week, so I can't really say that it had any effect, but it is something I worry about. Since it is an addition to my usual beauty regimen that is hard to keep up, I can't give this 5 stars, but it did have some positive impacts on the softness of my skin, so it is worth the money if you are willing to smear it on every night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Feel Good\\" cream","review":"I've been using Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturing Treatment for about six months now, and it makes my skin feel good.

I would definitely recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels nice but NOT nice for your skin","review":"I have purchased this item several times before thinking that it made my skin smooth...BUT this product contains Mineral Oil!!

After having it for 4 months, I can't bring myself to finish the jar. I really like it's sister productOlay Total Effects Night Firming Cream for Face and Neck, 1.7-Fluid Ounce, which is not as thick and is mild in scent. I've purchased MANY Olay products to find the best ones and this Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment wins the medal for strongest perfume smell. Since my nose can't handle it, I am unable to rate it's performance but it is too thick of cream for my normal-to-oily skin. Sorry, Olay, I can't rate it high like the rest of your products."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 month","review":"Used regularly for one month, no visible result.

As one ages, the skin becomes dry and this was the problem which I have been facing for several months now. Everyone had to go through the natural process of aging, but I believed that there were several products on the market which could make me age gracefully and beautifully. It was a good thing that my friend recommended this moisturizer from Olay! I simply love it because it really works! Just like how the product has been described, it really hydrates the skin while you're sleeping. After using it for several days, I have noticed the wonderful effect of this product on my skin.

Oh my...))) trust me, if your skin tried the BEST- it will NOT accept an imitation.I gave Regenerist 3 weeks of try- every...EVERY time I am using it, my skin breaks in bumps, next morning it feel very greasy and definitely not refreshed.Anyway, to make my story short- you can try it ( 20 dollars not such a big loss) but you will come back to your $300 cream-since ITS WORTH IT!)))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Allergic reaction?","review":"I bought this cream because of the Olay rebate.

I do LOVE the songs on this CD, it's just that they all sound like they're coming out of two bad speakers (and they're not). The music sounds a whole lot smoother coming from my Spirit VHS movie. The music from my CD (bought brand-new) has a sort of scratchy sound to it, not just Bryan Adams but the instrumentals as well, no matter how I adjust the sound. Just in case this is how it is supposed to sound, I would advise you to listen to the music before you buy the CD, because to me the soundtrack is a disappointment compared the the music in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Bryan Adams Fans","review":"Daughter & I really like this CD...although it varies quite a bit from the actual Spirit movie... Definitely worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"boy are they smart","review":"i see what they did. they made the movie to be bought for the kids then they used bryan adams to make the soundtrack, knowing that most of the parents of the kids who enjoyed the movie grew up listening to him would love the music. they were right. it worked. the soundtrack is great. it also gives poor mom something else to listen to in the car instead of the \\"wheels on the bus go round and round\\" or \\"pop goes the weasal\\"seriously, the soundtrack is fabulous. true brayn adams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Song a Winner","review":"I bought this CD for my 3-yr old daughter who loves \\"Spirit\\", the movie. I have to admit that we both sing the songs together. The music is beautiful. While I love the duet with Sarah Mclachlan, my daughter loves \\"Get off of My Back\\"! Great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"Since this movie had barely any talking and a lot of singing.. you really have to listen to the words of the songs to determine the story.. I felt this was an awesome CD. Bryan Adams did a fantastic job and the writting on this CD was fabulous. I can't say that every song was wonderful but on a whole I rate it one of his best ever.."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!!! :)","review":"This is a really great soundtrack! My favorite tracks are 1, (Here I Am) 4,(Get Off My Back) and 10, (Homeland.) Only thing is, though, they could have gotten a country singer to do it. Imagine how \\"Here I Am\\" would sound as a country western song! Other than that, it's the best soundtrack is the whole world!!! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music","review":"Its good to finally hear Bryan Adam's voice again... and coupled with Hans Zimmer's music - you know that this has got to be a wonderful creation! The words are so inspiring and the music puts you in a happy \\"spirit\\". The best track is \\"Here I am\\". A must-have for Bryan Adam fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bryon Adams is still putting out great music","review":"This is a very up beat CD! If you are missing the eighties and nineties type music, you will love this CD. It is long and is great inspirating house cleaning music! About a quarter of the songs on the CD are just instrumental, but boy they are great. I am not a classical/instrumental fan at all, but I sure like it! The music is much more meaningful once you have seen the movie. I highly recommend both. Several of my friends have bought the CD after listening to mine. By the way, Amazon is the cheapest place to get it! I'm kind of glad now that I went to see Spirit with my nephews just for the music I found."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Stars","review":"A Complete Masterpiece. Oscar for best musical score assured.Best Soundtrack in history of movies......\\"Here I am\\" is a very moving song. Track #10 is a completemasterpiece of classical music. The blend of Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer makes this CD something truly special.\\"You Can't Take Me\\" is a raw rocker that truly highlights Bryan Adams vocals.\\"Brothers Under the Sun\\" is a magical moving song that hits youright in the heart. What a great song.In this day of lip-synched ... music, this CD is a must tothe true music fan who likes instrumentals and great vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zimmer bests himself","review":"The main reason to buy this cd is for the song \\"Run Free\\", it is perhaps Zimmer's best piece of orchestral work ever, and the best piece of score that I can remember in recent years. The Bryan Adams songs get better everytime you hear them, but it really helps if you saw and liked the movie (which I did)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adams and Zimmer better than Collins and Zimmer","review":"A number of great new songs of Bryan are awesome! Since So Far So Good, Adams has really made his comeback to to the big audiance. Besides, the best score-composer ever, Hans Zimmer proofs again he is still creative with his orchestra and musicians. The score is awesome good, better because he composed also some tracks for Adams which results in a great album. My advice: Buy it, don't try it!!! Don't download this album from the net, it's a waste of your time and critical listening. I love you Hans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Song from Trailer","review":"The song from the trailer is sung by Michelle Branch.

I listen to it all day, loving each moment of every song! When you're feeling down in the dumps, \\"Sound the Bugle\\" is there to lift your \\"Spirit\\"s! Feeling romantic? Try \\"Nothing I've Ever Known\\". When angry or under stress, why not listen to \\"Get Off My Back\\"? This CD has a song for everybody, and it's definetly worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good That...","review":"Being a huge Bryan Adams fan since mid 80s, I have mixed feelings on this masterpiece soundtrack in 2002 featuring Canne winning title track HERE I AM. How I rejoiced when I found Bryan name on Billboard when this album came out. And I am glad to encounter great composer Hans Zimmer. I WILL ALWAYS RETURN is Bryan's best style of ballad which is used in two more versions in this album, and GET OFF MY BACK ,classic style uptempo rocker ,is my #1 favorite. It is good for Bryan Adams fans since 90s who love his ballad movie hits but for me it is a bit of frustrating because I still reminisce \\"The Summer of 69\\" Bryan. I bet he will return with his uptempo rockers that \\"Bang The Roof\\". Rick Springfield just did that in recent album why not Bryan?Recommended for Bryan Adams, Hans Zimmer fans and soundtrack collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so bad","review":"As I didn't expect this CD, I was a little bit surprised at his gooood sounds because his work was more than I expected in this CD. In my opinion, if you were his fan, I think you would not feel losing money for purchasing this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed and Appreciated By All Ages","review":"This was originally a gift for my daughter who fell in love with the animated movie. We are both enjoying and listening to it now. Each song stands on its own but it does take you back to the scenes of this great movie while you are listening to it which is a 'plus'.The CD comes with a full-color lyric book and the back of the CD has one of the best symbolic scenes captured from the movie. If you haven't seen the animated motion picture, buy it. It's one that you'll want to have in your collection. If you don't have this CD and you've seen the movie and/or you like the music of Bryan Adams, then by all means, get it. It's a win-win no matter how you look at it. We're supremely pleased with our purchase and will be getting both the movie DVD and this CD as gifts for my daughter's friends in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put...","review":"beautiful. I heard one of the Hans Zimmer songs recently and decided to check out the entire sound track (I haven't seen the movie but it is now in my Netflix queue). Previewing all the music, I didn't find a single track that I didn't like. The instrumentals are absolutely magical and Bryan Adams carries off the vocals flawlessly. Ordinarily I would complain about being forced to buy the entire sound track rather than individual songs, but in this case I think it is a good thing because the music seems to flow from one song to another (and the price of $7.99 ain't that bad). I know I will listen to this one a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!","review":"i loved it so much i created a petition for a sequel! he did a awsome job,buy it you will not regret it!

No doubt the lyrics aided in the telling of the movie but they just do not stand alone.

Although I thought more could have been done for this movie, I felt it was a pretty good one and kept my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace is Gone","review":"This was a very dramatic and sad movie. I think it would be good for any family with individuals in the military who have lost loved ones, who have loved ones who are injured or have died. This movie might be able to show what mistakes not to make with children when a parent is killed overseas. I can't relate, because I am one of the lucky ones who does not have any relatives or friends in the service. I recommend this movie as one of Cusack's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Cusack","review":"I believe that this is one of John Cusack's best films. I got this movie apprehensively because I had not seen previews but I love Cusack. \\"Grace is Gone\\" is a wonderful, touching movie that shows the loss and pain that Army families have gone through over the past six or so years. I've recommended it to several friends. I would suggest a box of Kleenex!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Acted and Touching Film!","review":"Grace is Gone is a very real and emotionally touching film of love and loss.After losing his wife, Grace, a father grieves the loss and ponders how to tell his two children.Instead, they take a road trip...and he cuts loose a little.In the process, the three of them grow closer to each other and realize the sacrifice that Grace made for her country.This is a well-acted film from all involved.Highly recommended movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, tender little drama about loss","review":"If you like quiet, intimate, well-acted dramas, this is the movie for you. John Cusak plays a frumpy, bespectled superstore manager who loses his soldier wife in the Iraq War and can't accept her death. He takes his two young daughters on a road trip to an amusement park, temporarily trying to escape from the horror of reality. Cusak can't bring himself to tell his daughters that their mother is dead, he is so in denial.What I like about the movie is that it shows what the families of the fallen soldiers of the Iraq conflict go through, their pain and suffering. Whenever a soldier dies, everyone who loved him or her is deeply affected, too.Cusak gives one of his most subtle and touching performances of his career and has great chemistry with the actresses who play his daughters, especially Shelan O'Keefe. Their relationship felt very real.Hopefully, Cusak's other Iraq war movie, War, Inc, gets a wider release soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grace is Gone DVD Review","review":"I ordered this DVD expecting it to be the same release that can be bought in retail stores. I was surprised to see it was the exclusive release issued to Blockbuster Video which did not contain as many bonus features. I do not remember seeing the Blockbuster release mentioned in the description. I would not have bought it if it was as I wanted the additional bonus feature. DVD condition was great and shipping was quick and fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quietly, Beautifully Effective","review":"This story is done well as it is a very \\"normal\\" family trying to deal with the issues of a loved one away in Iraq and family members who support or do not support the war effort. The father (Cusak) wants to cling to the normalcy and the innocence of a life slipping away from him. The kids are not know-it-all brats telling the dad what to do, but are either confused, happy, sad, smart at different times, which is a realistic protrayal of many kids. We get to learn who these kids are and really, who the father (John Cusak) is before the kids are dealt the devastating blow that...Grace is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"When, during the movie, you start to be pulled along by the music then you know the content is shallow. In my work I've encountered a number of children who have lost either one or both of their parents and I will categorically state that the movie is totally misleading and unrealistic in terms of how that tragedy is dealt with. The behavior of the father from the smallest details such as what to eat or wear to just jumping into a car and driving nearly nonstop a thousand miles to an amusement park was irresponsible and unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!!!","review":"This could have been a really good movie. The lack of quality dialogue was its downfall. The movie drags on and on. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't. Cusack doesn't deserve the praise for this role in my opinion that I have read in other reviews. All he has done is grown his hair out, put on on dowdy eye frames and moped around. There was no true acting or emotion in this role.Again, it could have been a very touching story, but it wasn't. It could have been an opportunity for the story line to show what a true hero his wife was and how his daughters could cope with his loss. Instead there is alot of silence and a big road trip that just whittles away the minutes in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking","review":"Heartbreaking story starring John Cuasck (playing mostly against type). His wife ('Grace') has been killed serving in Iraq, but he's too overwhelmed himself to bring himself to tell his two young daughters about it. So instead he decides to take them on a road trip to Disneyland (or the generic movie-equivalent). Surprisingly non-political, other than the fact that it helps bring home the message that behind every fleeting headline of war casualties, there are hundreds of lives that are devastated and forever changed.I always have a tough time finding movies to watch on planes, given the violence and/or sexual content of so many adult films. I thought this would be a safe one to watch (and it was). But I'm sure the woman sitting next to me was wondering why I was crying in my seat at the end of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy mainstream listening...","review":"Although, the WB television show is a favourite of mine, and I also own the first 'Dawson's Creek' soundtrack, this follow up OST surprised me with it's mainstream appeal, almost like Billboard released a compilation with all the chart topping artists thrown on it. But don't get me wrong, it's not a flaw. The stand out artists are Wheatus, whose \\"Teenage Dirtbag\\" is infectious and guaranteed to put a smile on your face with it's comical lyrics, Mary Beth's excellent version of \\"Daydream Believer\\", which was a feature song in season two of 'DC' and Evan and Jaron display their newly found success with \\"Crazy...\\" All in all, it's a must for all 'Dawson's Creek' fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It has its moments of goodness...","review":"I like this cd, but I think that it could have been a little better. Where is the song \\"Don't Tell Me\\" by Madonna? Where's the song \\"That I Would Be Good\\" by Alanis Morissette? Both of those frequently played tunes (on the show) should have been considered for this soundtrack.The best songs on the cd are Jessica Simpson's hit and the remake of \\"Daydream Believer\\" (which I like better than the original version). True fans of the show must have this cd for their Dawson's Creek collection. B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"PETE YORN ROCKS!!!!","review":"the soundtrack is OK...i would normally give it a 2-3 stars..but since PETE YORN is on it....i have to bump it up to 4 stars...his song \\"Just Another\\" is quite simply my favorite song of the year.

Dawson's could find a much better collection of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Australian version rocks!","review":"I have the Australian version of this CD at home. The Australian version contains 4 extra tracks (by Australian artists). Now, I have to be honest here, the 4 extra tracks are the best tracks on the whole album. It's a little sad that the USA customers were deprived of these excellent songs.Anyway.. I give the Australian version 5 stars, and the USA version 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best blues albums I own!!!","review":"I am so happy that I bought this album, Buddy guy and Memphis mix it up so very well in this classic recording. You will be hooked from the first time you listen to this. I hope I can find more material by these two together, they sound like they have been playing together for years.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush orchestral score","review":"A lush orchestral score along the vein of John Barry. Oriental themes mixed with romantic melodic music makes this soundtrack one of my favorites. I'm talking as good as \\"Henry V\\", \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" type good. Can't stop humming two of the themes. Everyone I'm played the themes for loves them. Click on \\"add to shopping cart\\" now. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a let down","review":"First, I like jazz. I like country swing. I heard good things about Bob Wills. The songs were good on this CD. The music was good. Themain singer was good. But, each song had some guy singing things like \\"ah, ha\\", \\"oh, yes\\" , \\"yes, yes\\" over and over and over again. It ruined each an every song. Now if they can remove that annoying voice, I would buy the CD again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"While the readers of the celebrated series of books may enjoy this film, to someone who has not enjoyed the pleasure, this is an increaisngly boring film. By the end, nothing, absoluetly nothing had happened. The parents disapper or die, the kids get carted around and the villian escapes (and he alternitive motive is never revealed). The story of the littlest elf would have been more entertaining.The acting itself is fine and the costumes captivating, but the actual storyline...like I said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fortunately The Movie Is Here!","review":"I saw the movie in the theatres 3 times. I thought it was very well planned out and true enough to the books. It was cleverly laced with the secret of VFD and the treacherous past of the Baudelaires, and was definately above satisfactory. I would DEFINATELY suggest the 2-Disc collectors' Edition due to the extra content in the disc. I have been awaiting the arrival of this for months, and I am extremely pleased that the day has almost come. I really want another movie made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie-Not so good book representation","review":"I saw this movie in the theatres, and was the only one in my family who I saw it with that had read the books. I absolutely love the books, the villainy in it is very well written. I also think that Jim Carry is perfect as Count Olaf. What upset me about the bad representation of the book is that the order was totally changed. I just recently re-read the books with my little brother, and I realised how much they had missed or changed in the books. I was really upset that the orphans went back with Count Olaf after being with Aunt Josephine because in the book it wasn't that way at all. This changed the flow of the entire movie, and showed that the books were much better. My recommendation is that if another one comes out that you read the books first so that you can really get the most out of the movie. You will be able to enjoy it or hate it much more if you know what was really supposed to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!","review":"I haven't seen the DVD Version yet, but I watched the movie last night at the theater. It was great. This is a wonderful children's movie, the dialogue is full of humor with out being offensive or full of innuendo. The sets and sfx are simple yet they are full of minute detail that will keep any viewer happy. This is a movie the whole family would be willing to watch from a small child, to those pesky teens and preteens. A must see. I'm sure the DVD will be excellent as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unfortunate Review","review":"If you're looking for a cheerful review, look somewhere else. I'm sure there are tons of cheerful reviews with happy little fluffy bunnies that romp through a colorful and mystical world. This isn't one of these reviews. If you're looking for a review that says that the movie, A Series of Unfortunate Events, is worth watching then you've found the right review. Jim Carrey is terrific--a word that here means \\"very good\\"--as the evil Count Olaf. Carrey is a bit too wacky to play Olaf, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy, Was I Surprised!","review":"I wasn't overly anxious to see this movie. When I seen the previews to it, it just didn't appeal to me. BUT my oldest daughter was dying to see it so we rented it. This is a REALLY good movie. Very creative and it keeps you interested from beginning to end. Jim Carey is a comedic genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best since James and the Giant Peach","review":"I honestly think that this may be the best children's movie Since James and the Giant Peach came out in 1996 (Peter Pan is fighting a close second). The movie is very silly and very dark and mysterious all at once, and like all good children's media it never once presumes to treat viewers like they can't handle the occasional violet outburst.The structure is certainly understandable: Book one had the strongest ending, so the other two books where nestled into its plot. This caused the whole to hang together in a way that would not have been accomplished had three mini-movies been created (as would have happened had the books been followed verbatim).The visual style of the movie is beyond amazing, so much so that I actually stayed in the theater to watch the entirety of the ending credits BOTH times I saw the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull, dissapointing movie for all!!","review":"When I heard about this movie, I thought this movie was going to be awesome. I was dissappointed because I read the books and it did not follow it at all. Bottom line: Gigli 2, Special thanks to Benifer and Martin Breast for helping. I hated this movie and if you liked the books, you'll hate the movie, if you hated the books or have never read them, you might think the movie has its moments. By the way, Emily Browning(Violet) is hot!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fine Drama","review":"\\"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" was a particularly great and entertaining film. I felt that the film captured the book very well, especially the descriptive scenery. Also, I really liked the acting, especially on the part of Jim Carrey. He played the troublesome part(s) of the evil Count Olaf.Now, I did feel that there were a few inconsistencies, such as the spy glasses (you'll see) which were never referenced in the book. On top of that, I expected the film to be almost too funny; however, it was almost too depressing because it lacked much of the grim wit that helped define the Lemony Snicket series (emphasis on wit).In conclusion, I would recommend seeing it in theaters; however Snicket lovers may be a bit disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER¡!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the absolute worst movie ever.

A complete disaster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not engaging","review":"I have read several of the series of books. They are O.K., but not as inspired, and not the least bit as engaing as the Harry Potter series. This movie however, doesn't do the books justice. The ambiance is darkly contrived, Carey is WAY over the top, the children don't seem as likable or as capable as the books characters, and all in all, not one I would see again. The very best part of the books is the vocabulary definition comedic touch, and the movie takes a whack at introducing that, but it is half-hearted and soon abandoned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but the books are better!!","review":"When I got this I thought I would like the books better and well I was right. Don't get me wrong it was good but it was hard to follow if you didn't read the books. Defintely read the books before watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a Bad Nightmarish Story.","review":"There is a reason for the $1.6 New-price. Shallow characters are well played by the cast, but it does not add-up to much. Evil repeatedly wins over innocence in a sort of repetitious theme. Bad, bad stuff..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for the whole, but none for Carey !","review":"Movie far too dark for children to enjoy, I believe. The main characters, a fourteen years old girl, a twelve years old boy and a two years old baby girl are, indeed, adorable and act honestly, as well as the other players, except for Jim Carey, who tries in vain to steal all the success from them using his endless stock of grins and buffooneries. While he should represent an excentric character he does not offer any memorable performance. He does not play, he acts ham. His make-up, supposed to transform him physically, clears out, wiped away by his too well known clowneries and we do not see the Count Olaf who he is supposed to perform, but just Jim Carey, equal to himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was very much like Big Fish.....","review":"I had a really though time getting into this movie it felt like every other scene it was ok, then it would get strange and odd. I am a Jim Carrey fan, but it was almost too odd for me. It was a really nice \\"looking \\" movie, they has wonderful costumes, and sets. This movie kept the same feel from start to end. It was just really though to get into.. But I had the same problem with \\"big Fish\\" Just not my type of movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pointless and ridiculous story!","review":"After \\"Me, Myself & Irene\\" this was the worst Jim Carey movie I've ever seen. although this is not completely a Jim Carey movie, but they sold it under the name of Jim Carey! the story was pointless and specially ridiclulous at the end. only two good scenes were in the movie, first the train scene and second, the storm scene! these scene were really worth to be watched on the big screen. Children may love this movie cause it's based on one of their favorite books, I've never read that book but some said it's much better than the movie. Let me suggest you something, if you've liked this movie, so enjoy it, buy this really good collector's edition pack, but if you only want to buy it for your beloved children, there is a cheaper single disc edition! cause this movie does not worth to pay 25 dollars even for a such brilliant 2 disc collector's edition DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful !","review":"The visual effect of the movie is worth seeing it, it was stunning ! The three children playing the rolls of Violet, Klaus and Sunny were right on the money for these rolls.They could not have chosen better actors for the three children. As for Jim Carrey, he pulled off being Count Olaf to the letter in my opinion. It's a great story with beautiful background settings. The cinemaphotography was dark but clear, the backgrounds jump off the screen almost as if it was some type of 3D effect (but it isn't 3D). Just rent or buy this DVD and watch it with the whole family, it is worth the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my top 5 faveorite movies of 2004","review":"it kind of goes from book to book. they start out with one then skip some and go to 2 but it comes back to one later.but still a really great movie! and i can not wait until it comes out on dvd on April 26 2005 it is a must see and also has kind of a happier ending than i pictured.and thats why it is one of my top 5 of '04 and it keeps you on the edge of you'r seat.if i were to give it a grade i would give it an A and i would give raise your voice an A plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie of 2004","review":"this movie is based on the first 3 books it is the best film of 2004 it is a must see for any LS fan great film for hwole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst movie ever","review":"I bought this movie at Wal-Mart today. It is so bad that I am returning it tomorrow for a refund because it is so awful. The only other movie I've returned in that manner was 'Dick Tracy,' because of Madonna, and that's saying a lot. 'Unfortunate Events' has no plot, virtually no story line, and it's hard to imagine that stars such as Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman appear in it.

What kind of cruel joke would they play on us by putting the funniest man alive in the saddest movie possible... messed with my head at least. Anyway... about the movie...The whole time people were dying and then everyone was dead... these poor children were being tortured through that whole movie... there was absolutely NO attempt at ANY humor WHATSOEVER to even lighten the movie up a TINY bit.

There's only one thing I can say bad about it: Klaus (pronounced Kl-OW-ss and not Clause) just wasn't right! He didn't have glasses and his face just wasn't, well, right! Liam Aiken is a great actor and all but just not right for the role. Other than that, it was great. I will admit I was a bit worried about Jim Carrey as Count Olaf (I thought he might be a bit TOO goofy) but he turned out to be great for the part. And all the other characters were great, too, especially Violet. I definitely recommend seeing this movie.

Over rated as a comedian he hams his way to an easy paycheck while the children, paying subtle roles as the MOST important characters are almost chased from the scene by Carey. They are constantly upstaged by a manic Carey waving his hands, grimicing and acting like a spoiled child who cannot bear anyone else getting any attention. The bad parts were anywhere Carey is present; the other actors performed very well. But it was like any other movie Jim Carey has been in: a person in need of psychotropic medicine. I doubt that Mr. Carey even read ANY of the books. Avoid the movie and buy the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"not true to the book AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When I saw this movie I was really disapointed.

Classic! I know I'm going to be 13 when I see this but I don't care because this film looks absolutely great and nothing's gonna stop me from enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning-you might want to consider a tame fairy-tale instead","review":"I had no idea what to expect when I saw this in a theater a few months ago - I had not read the books. I liked it enough to see it again in the theater, buy the DVD, and read one of the books. I happened to come across a later book in the series, not covered in the movie, and found I was right at home with the characters and the tone of the movie and books are a perfect match.If you like wry humor, sometimes bordering on pathos, in a gothic atmosphere, this movie should be right up your alley. The children are put through one gloomy predicamant after another, but always rise to the challenge. Jim Carey is perfect as the multi-faceted villain. But if you're afraid of danger, gloom and doom, you'd better look for a Smurf's movie or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie Iv'e ever seen!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best movie iv'e ever seen!!! i love the movie so much!

It's not fair to judge the movie on how the book were written. With that said, the movie is original. The visuals are stunning and the plot quite intriguing. However, I found the children to be uninteresting and rather annoying. Meryl Streep was wasted in her role as the nervous aunt. Overall, it was a great idea that just couldn't find itself. Hopefully, the sequel will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like the books!!!","review":"Yes, most of it are the books, but some of it aren't!!!! So if you want a movie that shows something just like the book, this is a bad movie for you. Its still a good movie, with some parts put in and out.

Still, its a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the books?","review":"You will love this although there is some differences from the books it still works.Jim Carey was a great choice he is so hilarious"},{"rating":"1","title":"I disliked It","review":"I disliked this film and regret that I bought it. It failed to hold my interest. It has many great actors, but the storyline leaves much to be desired. It is too dark to be endearing or fun, and far too predictable throughout. It seemed to me like a poor imitation of a Harry Potter-like film but fell far short of pulling it off. Rent it first...if you must see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good but more details!!!","review":"I thought this movie was good but I had read all the books and they could have added more details to the movie to make it more interesting. It was only like 10 minutes during the movie and I started getting bored. I thought the movie would be better than that because the books are very good. If you like reading you should check out the books because they are a whole lot better than this movie. But if I was you I would find something else to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"If it's anything like the books, it'll be Fantasmagorical!!!","review":"Loved the books! Snicket has a wonderful way with words and I only hope they can transfer his witty narrator remarks to the film in some way.

But definately read the books, unless you have a fear of realtors. Remember not to take it seriously, Its supposed to be funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the books in this movie??","review":"I don't know what happened, but this movie was all over the place. It is supposed to be about the first three books, but so much was left out that it left you wondering \\"WHY DID THEY MAKE THIS MOVIE IF THEY WERE GOING TO CUT OUT EVERYTHING???\\" And, where it did keep in line with the story, the characters were doing things that other characters did and some of the characters from the book were not even in the movie, like the fat man/woman whom I so wanted to see.Another disappointing area was that it made up \\"unfortunate events\\" as if the books didn't have enough, and it totally changed everything around, like ending the movie with parts from book one.If you haven't read the books and don't plan on reading them, then by all means purchase the movie. However, the books are more entertaining and leave you wanting more. The movie just leaves you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been -- and should have been -- much, much better","review":"When the book is first-rate, you worry about the movie. Here, the film seems to cover roughly the first three (of thirteen) volumes, and I think they should have waited and tried to cover them all in one better edited film. There's no indication that there will be a sequel, but the plot doesn't end -- it simply stops. Anyone who hasn't read the book(s) is going to be mightily confused and thoroughly irritated. On the theatrical side, the kid actors are wooden and the whole thing becomes a vehicle for Jim Carey -- and it's not supposed to be his story! I'm told the script was supposed to be written by Daniel Handler -- the actual author of the actual books -- but he was fired -- to be replaced by Robert Gordon, who wrote the script for _Galaxy Quest_. I rest my case."},{"rating":"2","title":"CANT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I really enjoy leomony snikets novels!now i really want to see the movie!i think jim carry is a bad acter in this movie,but i still want to see it!do u like the story. i so do! i no that doesnt make any sence!but stil!!!also i cant wait to see chiken little coming 2005!!!i lov it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the BEST!!!!!!","review":"a series of unfortunate events is the best movie ever made in historiy!!!!!!!i love the book series!!!!!!im olny in book 7.i oredered it the box set-7-9.i orederd it [...] its slow!!!!the dvd is awsome!!!!i also recomand:the phantom of the oprea(pg-13),van helsing(pg-13),flight of the phoenix(pg-13)they are all good movies!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"....

It is a horrible display of such wonderful books. I never thought such a good book could possibly make such a sickening movie. But then again the movie isn't really much like the book at all, it ventures out on it's own, far far to much. I found this movie a complete waste of time and feel that if you want to learn about Lemony Snickets works the I suggest you read the book. It might take a little more time but it would be very much so better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly great, but worth seeing once, unless it's your vibe..","review":"Then you'll probably want to watch it over and over. I'd never even heard of the books, the title, the characters, etc., and I still could care less about any of that. Jim Carrey does a decent job, but he's done better drama, and certainly done better comedy (LIAR LIAR being his funniest in my opinion), and the production design shines, but only the super young and those of you into this kind of thing would take the time to see this more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate? You Bet!","review":"Of course, such a popular book had to be made into a \\"hit\\"movie and video game. I wasn't at all surprised at the poor quality of this movie, after seeing the commmercial. Devoted fans of the series will find themselves shocked as they see a movie wiith hardly anything in common with their favorite books. In the movie, the plot is: after recieving the distressing news that their parents have perished in a fire, the Baudelaire orphans live with Count Olaf (Jim Carrey). Unfortunately, Count Olaf tries placing them in front of a moving train, and the children move to live with their Uncle Monty. But, disguised as a lab assistant, Olaf finds them again. The same thing happens at their Aunt Josephene's. I was dissapointed because of the innacurate portrayal of the books. Also, Jim Carrey was awful. He's too dramatic to be Count Olaf. In closing: this movie has its moments, but they are few and far between."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was ahhh...not so good.","review":"Yeah I had highly anticipated seeing this movie for a long time. I would see the preview on the t.v. and get pumped because the release date got ever closer. When I finally made it to the movie though, it was absolutely terrible. First off, they made this little 2 year old kid do all of these stupid noised and make the comments that were not even funny at all, stupid. Then Jim Carrey really didn't have very much comedy in it either. It was just a really dark movie, really lame comedy, which inturn turned into a really lame movie. Let's just face it, I could have paid my 8:50 to a charity, the money would have went to a lot, lot better cause than this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloom and Doom","review":"Did this movie really need to be so grim? couldnt the children share a few smiles?

I read the books and I was so sad after seeing this moivie. The first book was rearranged, the scecond was too short, and third you left out a lot of information. So I think they wanted to make 5 bad movies than 11 good ones. (fyi there are 11 books, so far) I think the movie should be rated r for rotten.

This movie is absolutley horrible. I have read some of the reviews and agree with them about Jim Carey's absolutley atrocious portrayal of Count Olaf.

Read the books and forget this poor excuse of a movie based on some really cute but wierd books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm being generous","review":"Some people say that Jim Carrey's performance is \\"a little over the top\\". It's more like a psychopathic tantrum in the extreme. He almost single-handedly ruined the movie, although this couldn't have been that hard to do since the direction was ghastly. After all, it's ultimately the director's fault for allowing Carrey to wallow in absurdiity.The children are too contemporary in their speech and demeanors. They have no charm. The youngest child, Sunny (the biter) is right out of a Stephen King corn field - scary.Set designs in the movie are ridiculous and ugly.The music was fairly decent - so what?Overall, the movie plays as a surreal nightmare. It is poorly done from beginning to end. I have read the books, and although they are pretty odd, too, this movie could have taken the best from the books and made something watchable.Do not allow your young children to watch this bizarre, nonsensical movie. It is a hideous, disgusting, self-indulgent mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst \\"movies\\" of all time!","review":"I've never read any of the books this movie was based on. And after this horrendous \\"movie\\" I never will. This was obviously an attempt to showcase a stunted talent. Why else would the whole rest of the cast be played in \\"deadpan\\"?? The best performance was done by the infant! Carrey's attempt to play all major parts himself showcased the makeup crew -- nothing else. By the time we got half way through the thing, I was embarassed to be still in the room. I bought the DVD because it is cheaper than buying two tickets to a theater in CA. The next time it plays will be in someone else's player after our next yard sale. And I will NEVER again buy anything with Jim Carrey in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Carey, interesting adaptation","review":"I saw this movie before I read the books. The books are much funnier, and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film. Still, I liked the film and especially Baby Sunny. I thought Jim Carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions (as always) brought the character to life. I think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film, the essence of the story was captured, and is entertaining. But I do recommend reading the Series before or after watching the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good...","review":"Seller and the film are both fantastic.

Jim Carrey is an absolutely brilliant Count Olaf, even though his character wasn't humorous in the books at all. The cast is superb, and I completely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is an unfortunate event...","review":"The major problem with this movie is that it is not a well told story--it tries to tell three different stories in sequence in too short of a time. It is so compressed that most of the scenes don't work. The casting choices for the children (Emily Browning as Violet and Liam Aiken as Klaus)were also a big mistake. Neither does a very good acting job and it is difficult to really care what happens to them.Jim Carrey (as Count Olaf), Meryl Streep (as Aunt Josephine), and Billy Connolly (as Uncle Monty, the herpetologist) all do a fine job given the circumstances, but without main characters that you care about and the time needed to develop each story, it is not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Films I have ever Seen !!!!!!!!","review":"This is basically a story of 3 orphans that get treated lack crap for 2 hours with an \\"overacting\\" uncle trying to bump them off to get their money......That's it!...Period!...Nothing like watching a flick like this at Christmas to make you feel good!Booooooo!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"I never understood this movie.

Trust me. The theater where we went was filled with little kids, maybe around 10 years old. The older teens whom I took said Jim Carrie was not funny, they actually said nothing in the movie was funny. For me, at age 50, I found the movie un-involving, something you look at but don't participate in. Yes, the movie did have a peculiar LoOK. To me that's a plus. But it is not enough to carry the film. Here's an example of the films humor. Brother and sister have a baby sibling, too young to talk. But she makes noises and apparently the filmmaker talks baby talk. So baby sounds off, and across the bottom of the screen we see her translated, \\"Bite me.\\" At this, the ten year olds throughout the theater laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"The first three books were my favorite of the series. I saw the movie the day after it came out and it was not what I expected. The wedding was at the very end of the movie. The part where the Baudelire children convince Aunt Josefina electric appliances were fine was skipped. They should not have combined the first three books into one movie. There is an elf in the start of the movie. The elf is in other scenes and it is not in any books. Uncle Monty said he needed an inventor,a reader, and a biter to help him build the cage for the snake in the book. In the movie they never build the cage even though he adresses that part.

The real problem with this Harry Potter Lite project is the lack of any real intrigue in the story and the constant scenery chewing by Carey.

Thankfully the kids were more interested in playing than movie watching as my sister and I had the opportunity to pre-screen. OH, MY...this movie is NOT FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!! I've never read the books, but the movie was totally inappropriate and should have been rated PG-13. This film is full of abuse...attempted murder of three children, physical abuse, and almost on the verge of sexual abuse as Jim Carey's character tries to marry the female CHILD. Regardless of what the marriage was supposed to be intended for in no way does it ever make sense for a nasty old man to marry a little girl. Just gross. My kids will not watch this movie and I dare to say I probably won't be able to tolerate for another sitting myself. What a disappointment!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I hated this movie! How did it suck you ask? It didn't follow the series at all, They left out tons of stuff, They mixed character traits, and the acting sucked the worse!!! This is by far Jim Carrey's worst movie ever!! Don't waste your money buying it and don't waste your time watching it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up, Enablers!","review":"If you ready to make a difference in your family AND help the one who is chemically dependent, read this book. Whether you are the one who is chemically dependent or a family member who has participated in this life-style with the addict, this book tells you exactly what it is going to take to get the addict and the family back to functioning as normal as possible. The author includes Christianity as a helping tool but understands that the church is not exclusive to this healing process. Sometimes your pastor and church family doesn't understand enough about the addiction disease to help families and that's okay too as long as you seek professional help AND look to your Christian support. If you want honesty and are committed to becoming a healthy person/family again, this is the book that can make the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brunton rejects","review":"I should have known that the deal was too good to be true and you get what you pay for. When Amazon offered this compass for almost half of Brunton's price I jumped on it.

It contains loads of well known songs, like \\"Sight For Sore Eyes\\", the classic \\"Search For The Hero\\", another classic \\"Open Your Heart\\", \\"Love Rendezvous\\" and just another classic \\"Itchycoo Park\\". Besides from these classics, there R the groovy \\"Drive Time\\" ( you really drive me wild ) and \\"Sugar Town\\" ( rain in sugar town ), and some tracks that R only a little bit more slow like \\"Walk Away\\" \\"...And Finally\\". And \\"Padlock\\" is a fun little story done is a classy way about a break up.M People R the ultimate feel good band that combine dance with house and saxophones and other jazzy instruments. This music will make you dance and groove till midnight and longer.There is a version which has 5 live tracks ( \\"Moving On Up\\" live is the best thing ever ) and 5 remixes ( the Junior Vasquez Sound Factory Mix of \\"Padlock\\" is like heaven )."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh music","review":"This is a superb CD with every selection a winner. It seemed like every gay man in America had this CD about 15 years ago. It is hard for me to name a favorite since almost all are my favorite songs on the CD. Most of the songs are dance friendly, I found myself dancing around the house while listening, and I am not a young fellow anymore. The music is upbeat and the lyrics are clever. The lead female vocalist is extremely gifted. Even after 15 years, the work is still fresh and contemporary."},{"rating":"1","title":"very uneven","review":"First off, this is not really a history of conversation, as most of the narrative is focused on 18th and 19th century England, the author's specialty. Nonetheless, the book contains enough general historical background, anecdotes and insight to make it worth reading (even though I really had to struggle to get past the central chapters). Miller seems to be ambivalent about modern technology's effect on conversation, and lists several of what he calls Conversation Avoidance Devices. While an iPod certainly does fall into this category (then again, do we really want to be conversing all the time with everyone who happens to stand nearby?), the Internet does not, as chat rooms, blogs, email etc. obviously open up different ways to do conversation -- ways that the author does not seem to appreciate or enjoy as much as a personal interaction at the coffee house. But why do the two have to be mutually exclusive?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection!","review":"These two movies are quite different but both are very entertaining. A great collection! Both provide a surprising twist at the end, which you will remember long after you have seen them. Ben Affleck and Harrison Ford are two leading men who always give great performances. I say what an outstanding collection in having two great movies packaged together! If you buy any collection in 2008 make this one be one of your top three!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise Causey!","review":"This transcends both synthpop and hardcore. Causey's voice is one of the most unique and spectacular singing voices I've ever heard, that I am sure of! The music varies from pseudo-evil synth to hardcore rock, mixed with Causey's trademark wail and the silky-hot bassist's moaning. *ooohh shudder!* I recommend the CD, but I further recommend attending one of Causey's services. Only in this way can the true light of Causey's love flow through you. Praise Causey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"With a fond shudder of nostalgia, one remembers...","review":"...the nasty reptilian burn down the sinuses and back of the throat that came with snorting crystalmeth cut with strych, aspirin, baby-lax and Lord knows what else back in those evil days not as many years ago as I wish...

Successfully replicates the experience of doing bad drugs with a revival minister suffering the pre-epileptic shoogaloos of amphetameanie-psychosis after several comprehensive ECT sessions in the Solitary ward at Parchman Farm in preparation for a public encounter with the chair.

It is fun, inspiring and very very very impressive from the technical point of view.Paul Gilbert makes fun out of simple rock songs with terrifying guitar solos. The beginning of track \\"My Religion\\" shows what he came for: a sequence of arpegios with tappings that is so clean and pretty that makes you hit the \\"<<\\" button of your CD player to hear it over and over.

Bounty Hunter Asa Cain and Deputy Cemetery John set out to rescue Cain's mother and sister from the Dolven gang. They run into all kinds of trouble and interesting people. Humor and laughs are sprinkled along the way. The rappor between Asa and Cemetery is very well done. The friendship that developes between them warms the heart.

Here we get to see Abbey as he sees himself instead of the Abbey the we see through his books. The men went through a lot and put himself through a lot, and it is very amazing to watch him mature through his writing from his early twenties until the weeks before his death at the age of 62. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to know more about how Abbey experienced his own life and writing in contrast to the persona developed as the cult hero of the Monkey Wrench Gang and Desert Solitaire."},{"rating":"2","title":"He wrote too much fiction and not enough journalism","review":"I thrustfully agree with the previous critics who begrudge Abbey for his pathetic sex-obsession. And it's pretty dispiriting to watch Abbey degenerating into a grumpy old man. But there's great stuff in here, page after page.ED SAID: \\"I hate the rich and powerful, and those who support *them* while not *of* them---servile and sycophantic natures: the servants, lackeys, court jesters. They I despise more than any other.\\"ED SAID: \\"Judy---her death. Just too goddamned cruel and unjust and absurd and unnecessary to be borne. As Bobby Kennedy used to say (and how sweet *his* memory now seems), this is 'unacceptable'. (Oblivion. Annihilation. Nothingness.)\\"ED SAID: \\"Inbreeding. My Gawd, even the country-western singers are singing songs about country-western songs.

Perhaps this was not a good book to begin with, having never read any of his others. He is endlessly amused at his own wit, endlessly fascinated with his own horniness. His women are a sad parade of vaginas; world-shaking events reduced to how they will affect his own narrow, hedonistic world. The sad part is that I agree with many of his opinions on religion, the environment, business, etc. Unfortunately, his \\"look, Ma, I'm writing!\\" style of expression gets quite tedious. This is pseudo-intellectual, verbal vomit...don't waste your money like I did. (Sorry, Abbey-lovers)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book!","review":"This book has to be one of my all-time favourites.Gibbons writes with such passion and it shows on this book.The characters are amazing and so well structured.It is sad and action-packed.This book is flawless.Nothing short of stunning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Overdone, But Nonetheless Entertaining.","review":"This book is set in the wilderness of Southeast Mississippi and involves the legendary character, Earl Swagger, as he uncovers and takes down an evil force nestled amid the pines. The plot and the events in the book are preposterous -- characters are tortured or beaten beyond belief one day and then pop up in the best of health the next day. The protagonists, of course, are capable of tactical planning that would make a chess master weep. You know what I'm talking about. But I give this book four stars for the sheer creativity of Hunter. He grabs you early and doesn't turn loose of you till you finish the book. And just when you think you've got it all figured out, he fools you again. Hunter is an audacious author. Read this book just for the fun of it. Don't try to compare it to reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Pop Fiction -- Great Writing with a Great Story","review":"Wow! This was a great book in so many ways. This is the first Stephen Hunter book I've read, and I know I'm coming back for more. I was expecting more run-of-the-mill pop fiction, but instead I got some really excellent writing that kept me turning page after page. A good \\"story\\" can keep me turning pages, but this was good \\"writing\\". Excellent research, compelling story, well developed characters, multi-layered plot line, great action -- just great writing.Earl Swagger is a character I want to read more of. He's elemental, and I'm sure Hunter has more backstory on him in some of his other books. I'm looking forward to tracking those down.Definitely some squirmy topics touched on in this book: the South in the Jim Crow era, war and the morality of killing, biological warfare to name a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best revenge is revenge","review":"Pale Horse Coming may not be great literature but it's great to read. Sometimes a solid predictable book is just what I need for summer reading. Lots of action, heroic characters and evildoers who get what they deserve. There were some loose ends, not so believable gunfighters, and out-of-character behaviors but I didn't mind much. I would forgive deeper and more numerous flaws from Hunter in gratitude for this page-turner. Long live Sam & Earl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Stephen Hunter","review":"I have read every book that Stephen has written, even the old stuff after I read Point of Impact. To be perfectly honest, this book didn't even hold my attention long enough for me to finish it. The book is full of gratuitious violence, racial sterotypes and seems to go nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Some other fans are saying that this book is lacking compared to some of Hunter's other work, but I disagree. Perhaps I'm biased because this was the first book of his that I read, but it left me with an unforgettable first impression. I have since read several other Stephen Hunter books: Hot Springs, Time to Hunt, Black Light, Point of Impact and Havana. If well written action thrillers are your thing, then I highly doubt you will be disappointed by this book. As always, Hunter's tactical knowledge lends to top notch gunplay and action scenes. There are some unarmed combat scenes in this book that I will never forget. Earl Swagger is straight loc. End of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victoria got it right","review":"I'm another Stephen Hunter fan who was deeply disappointed by this one -- my guess is that Hunter wrote it on autopilot, as an exercise in self-indulgence. It's predictable, plays on a silly \\"seven against Thebes\\" allusion, and even has an uneducated Mississipi black guy say, \\"I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy.\\" If you're new to Hunter, try POINT OF IMPACT, which would be a strong candidate, for me, to be ranked the best thriller ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I love the premise of the 'Swagger' series, but honestly, have found Hunter's writing to be a bit...erratic. Some books are great while others are mediocre at best. This one is really well written and the subject matter is raw and cuts right to your bones. I would highly recommend it, and look forward to tackling Night of Thunder (another Hunter novel in the Swagger series...) and hoping its as compelling..."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY SATISFYING READ...","review":"Typical Hunter Book...A real page turner but a bit far fetched with all the beating poor old Earl takes...

I think I could have enjoyed the story and overlooked the total mess made of the second half of the book if the dialog hadn't been so jarringly archaic and stilted. An example: \\"You have killed me dead, sir.\\" \\"I have, sir, for the evil you have done.\\" Okay, I did get some good laughs from that, so two stars for the funny dialog. As for the rest....I guess I'll never get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"For the price, you hate to complain, but the constant typos are a little distracting. They're the kind of typos that slip by a spell-checker (\\"farmer\\" instead of \\"former,\\" for example, and strangely, \\"delta Rovere\\" instead of \\"della Rovere\\"). Dumas goes into an incredible amount of detail, wandering off into every by-way, taking all the time in the world and juicing up the characterizations past the point of believability at times. Still, he seems to have done an incredible amount of research, and the crimes are interesting. Just remember the book is written in the style of another age, and don't expect Ann Rule. There's enough material here (28507 locations) to keep you grazing through the stories for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh, thrilling -- and not for fundamentalists","review":"A daring look at the Hebrew invasion of Palestine from the losing side -- the characters are well-drawn and engaging (especially Barra, chosen hero of the Canaanite mother-goddess), and the image of the God of the Old Testament as the ultimate fantasy villain is surprisingly appropriate.

There are a lot of nice pictures, and also in the begining of this book it show all the groups of Europian, Italian, etc. breads with beautiful pictures. It help me a lot to know the groups of them. I almost decide to buy one for my own, but when I tried the recipe for rolls. The bread was ok, but it need to bake in preheat 425F for 15-20 mins (that what the recipe call for).

But I have been very disappointed. I have had to alter all of the recipes that I have tried drastically. I have had to add or subtract vast amounts of flour (2-3 cups), change baking times from 45 minutes to 20 minutes or make burnt bread. While I live at a high altitude it should not make the kind of differences that I have experienced. I would love this book if these inaccuracies were corrected.

At first, I didn't like it one bit. I discarded the CD as soon as possible. But then an interest in theatre and Broadway grew in me, and I decided to give this CD a listen. Although I still do not find it as a great listen, I did begin to like it more than I used to.What really threw me off was the voice stylings here. They're a bit off. Like an earlier reviewer mentioned, the Sandy was a bit Rizzo, and Rizzo was a bit Sandy. I did find it kind of neat when I found out that Barry Bostwick (Rocky Horror) was the Danny here. He faired well, but still, like the rest of the cast and company, he was a bit off.I look at this CD as the originic beginning of the Grease phenomena. But it goes low on my list of favorite Grease recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"The product was as described and arrived in a very timely manner, much sooner than advertised.

This album is where the whole Grease phenomenon began. If you're all about the movie: DON'T GET THIS ALBUM, the songs are completely different and you probably won't like it. But, if you're interested in the true Broadway essentials of this classic play, than go for it--but be forewarned, the vocalists...well... they just aren't that great. They're slippery on the high notes and have a tone like a vacuum. The instrumentalists are decent but the arrangements are \\"bare-bones,\\" a few saxes and a rythym section. This soundtrack lacks a lot of what the musical is supposed to be about: teenagers having fun--the vocalists sound like chain-smoking thirty year-olds. However, listening to the CD is a lot of fun, especially if you see yourself as a future Sandy Dumbrowski or Danny Zuko. So watch it daddy-o's; think long and hard before purchasing this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Broadway Original","review":"The original Broadway version of Grease is much different that the movie version. The chief difference is that the biggest hits from the movie, the title song, \\"You're The One That I One Want\\" & \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\", were written specifically for the movie and do not appear here. The play also had a harder edge to it, taking place in an urban environment and was more explicit. Fans of the movie will recognize songs like \\"Greased Lightnin'\\", \\"Summer Nights\\", \\"Beauty School Dropout\\", \\"Born To Hand Jive\\" and \\"We Go Together\\" but other standouts include \\"All Choked Up\\", \\"Those Magic Changes\\" & \\"Freddy My Love\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original, The One That I Want!","review":"I saw the original production of Grease and it was hysterical. It was originally intended as an affectionate parody of the 50's and was a laugh riot. Then Hollywood got a hold of it and turned it into the cotton candy, pop fluff that the world see's it as now, totally missing the point (and losing alot of the fun). The original cast led by Barry Bostwick, Adrienne Barbaue and Carol Demas, were a blast! Stick to this version if you like real parody, humorous and true to the 50's rock style."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly researched waste of time","review":"At the very least an author should see that the final product has been adequately proofread.

If you've ever wanted to know every language that Bond ever spoke, what gadget or gizmo he used in which movie, or all the aliases he's ever used, this is the book for you. \\"The Bond Files\\" is a great book with all kinds of facts, trivia, and information for each story, comic, and movie. The authors even review the opening title sequences and have a nice synopsis of each movie. They don't miss much with this book.

When you think of the six billion people on the planet and their relative opportunities, here is a privileged person who rose to the occasion to enjoy her position as one of the best educated, best clothed, best housed and best fed people on the planet. Certainly any of us reading this review is at the top of the world heap in terms of our basic needs being met, and she's more privileged than lots of us.

One might find the humble nature of this man's writings subtly profound in many aspects.

Moreover, it is so light in weight that it cannot be used on smooth floors, because the shimmy will cause the unit to move across the floors. This movement is significant enough that this product could conceivably slide up against something flammable. Finally, despite the noise, the fan is not particularly powerful and doesn't force the air effectively. I will be writing the leading consumer rating magazine to recommend that they look into this product's safety issues. Meanwhile I recommend in the STRONGEST terms that this product not be purchased.

The fan comes on fine but some type of auto temp thing inside turns it off after only about 10-13 minutes.

What led to her drinking and drug abuse? Why would someone so intelligent let herself go like that? She seemed to me to have a very low self esteem and the inablility to cope.

To repeatedly berate and emphasize that Deb Green used bad swear words when angry, yet a mere MENTION of the fact that violent hubby Farrar knocked that kid's head through a wall! Wait a minute, back up--that husband had some kind of major psych problems, too. How come Ann didn't look a little closer at that? It's like half the story is missing from this book.

It is obvious she is guilty, so the story really never heats up. So we lose the fun of trying to figure out the ending, right? The story was horrifying, so it kept me entertained, but I never really felt that I got any kind of closure as to why she did what she did. I guess the answers to lifes problems get a little diluted seen through a liter of gin.

As a huge fan of Ann Rule's her book answered so many questions. No Mike Farrar was not a total innocent, but he loved his children and only wanted the best for them. I saw Debora Green's face on the evening news every night, so completely devoid of emotion something I could not comprehend.

I decided to skip some information, hoping it would get better. It got worse. The treatment of Debbie versus Mike was a red flag that Ann had not studied her subjects very well. Either she failed to recognize Mike's role in this crime against his ex-wife and children, or she glossed over his personality flaws for some reason. (Ann has always favored good looking men.) For whatever reason, it wasn't all Debbie's fault, as it takes two to tango. I don't not recommend this book.

This was very disappointing for what I anticipated to be a premium quality blade made in the European Union. To keep things fair and in perspective, it does cut respectably for a $10 blade, but nothing overly impressive about it.

Minimal spatter and excellent heat control (on a gas stove).I have sent my electric deep fryer to Goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is wonderful!","review":"Camryn Manheim is not only a talented actress, but she's also a great writer. She has a razor-sharp wit that will have you laughing out loud but she will make you feel her pain as well. Reading this book makes you feel as though she's sitting right next to you. She opens her heart and allows you to see her as a person and not just an actress. Camryn's message applies to all of us not just the \\"big girls\\". I admire her strength and courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but I am jealous","review":"Y'know, I spent most of my life saying the same things with regard to size acceptance, and people would laugh at those ideas. People just can't get around the idea that not all fat people sit around eating cream puffs all day. Hopefully now that some celebrity is advocating size-acceptance, perhaps some of that will rub off on the ordinary folks who don't have tv shows and make millions :)I applaud Camryn Manheim for her wit, honesty and humor. It's about time people spoke up about size acceptance, so kudos to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up, eating disorders are fatal too.","review":"Camryn Manheim is a true inspiration to all actors, but particularly actors who see themselves as hampered in their field because of their looks. Not only fat people, but short people and bald people and handicapped people should take heart from Manheim's success against the most improbable odds there are in show business. If more actors stopped starving themselves, throwing up their dinners and compulsively exercising, the images we see might be filled with NORMAL people of all shapes and sizes: TRUE role models for society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!","review":"For the first time in my 27 years of life I am Ok with the fact that I am fat! I don't think I've ever said those words with a smile on my face. It was so nice to hear that someone else has been through exactly what I've been through....parents asking you why you haven't lost weight, friends suggesting that you lose weight, and knowing in my heart of hearts that God made me this way! I am truly in awe and inspired. Thank you Camryn, your inspiration and fervor for life will definitely rub off on me!!!Thanks, Stacey in Texas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting, essential read for people of every size!","review":"This book is wonderfully written, funny, heartfelt and poignant. Camryn has helped relieve the sting of self-loathing that has plagued many fat Americans for far too long. She is a living, breathing embodiment of the fact that fat people are intelligent, articulate, hardworking, talented, beautiful, sensuous beings who deserve respect - and should demand it if necessary! Anyone who has ever felt disappointed at what they've seen in the mirror would be well served to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camryn should be my best friend!!!","review":"This book is funny and promotes self-acceptance in a BIG way! I absolutely loved reading about Camryn Manheim's life, trials, tribulations and accomplishments. She's witty, sassy, fun-loving, rides a motorcycle and drives a convertible -- and should be my best friend! No matter who you are, you should love this book for the humorous moments of her everyday life. If you're one of the \\"sisters,\\" you'll love it even more. Read it - what do you have to lose?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Camryn is truly a goddess, and this book proves it! Not only do we get inside her mind and see what makes her tick, we get a great look at the New York theatre world and how they treat one of their own. This is a must read book for anyone interested in theatre as well as those of us that want to quash the rule that only the skinny ones get the great life!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but it didn't make me feel any better about my weight!","review":"Camryn Manheim is an sassy, award-winning actress and laugh-out-loud funny. This book is a personal account of her experiences of fat-ism and her journey to self-acceptance.Manheim is a natural storyteller and, being overweight myself, there was a lot here to relate to, but although I enjoyed the book, there were no groundbreaking revelations for me here ... though it does make a pretty strong case against society's obsession with being thin, this book is in no way a \\"self-help\\" book (to be fair, it doesn't claim to be) and it didn't help me to \\"make peace\\" with my fat. It did however make me laugh a lot and that's reason enough to encourage others to read it!Thank you Camryn, for speaking out for big women everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This is a thoroughly joyous read for anyone with body image issues, or for anyone who just enjoys a great story teller. You can hear her voice in every line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, wonderful, uplifting book!!!","review":"I am really astounded at the negative reviews some people (who, it appears, may have not even read the book) have written on here. This is one of the most powerful, witty, honest autobiographies I've ever read. Anybody who comes away from this amazing book with negative feelings has more problems than can be dealt with here. Camryn's story isn't about how wonderful it is to be fat (and, contrary to another reviewer, she does *not* encourage anybody else to be obese), but about how horrible other human beings can be to people who are \\"too\\" fat, or \\"too\\" thin, or \\"too\\" pimply, or \\"too\\" effeminate, or \\"too\\" masculine, or take your pick. Camryn's struggles, hopes, fears, and ultimate triumphs are universal and heartfelt. By the end of this book, I was moved to tears of joy, it was so powerful. And on top of all this, Camryn Manheim is one damn sexxxy woman. Hubba hubba."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be yourself but don't let your weight determine how","review":"Formerly fat, and now fit for over 15 years, I resent how Manheim makes fun of the 'fat' world. It's nothing to be proud of: when your weight is out of control. It's not a laughing matter. I agree with being yourself and total, complete self-acceptance; for THAT I commend her. I also commend her for standing up for what she believes in and believing in herself so much that she didn't let her weight decide her success as an actor or author. I just resent the way she refers to the FAT population. To me, fat means lazy but it also means unfocused and uncaring of a person's person. I can take or leave Manheim but I have to agree with her on one thing: Be yourself, and you can never go wrong. That's my dogma and how I live REGARDLESS OF MY SIZE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing of note","review":"Though Camryn's comments about how society treats the overweight are on target, there is little originality here, and the humour is as stale as vaudeville."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Beautiful Amazon Writes Big Beautiful Book!","review":"Words can't really express how much I love this book. I read it in two days, only putting it down to sleep, and I think it is amazing. It is one of the funniest, inspiring, touching books I have ever come across. And Camryn totally looks like a fox on the cover. I think this book is so important. As a young actor, It really inspired me to follow my dreams no matter what happens, and as a member of a fat loathing society, it made me reevaluate how i thought of myself and other. Camryn should run for president. I think she is absolutely delicious! but this book. keep it in your back pocket, and take it out for some big laughs and even bigger inspiration"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I had expected.....","review":"I'd had an initial interest in reading this book because I can relate to Camryn Manheim, but it turned out to be funnier and more inspiring than I had hoped. She has the greatest attitude. Its not often I come across someone who encourages me to want to kick the world's [split rear bodypart], but she did. Camryn didn't let the bad things in life drag her down, and that is a difficult feat.I know this is supposed to be a good read for both the skinnies and the fats, but personally I think the fat girls are gonna relate and understand where she's coming from a whole lot more. But I still give it an enthusiastic recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare book treat that goes straight to your heart!","review":"With the abundance of children's books available in today's market, there is not time for all of them.

Five children were born to her there, and she raised them with love and wisdom that daughter Katrin - who Americanized her name to \\"Kathryn\\" in early adolescence - would always remember.I won't call this classic collection of real-life stories charming, because it's got too much solid and at times downright unpleasant reality in its pages. Instead I'll call it inspiring. Money, education, and influence Mama's family didn't have; but everything that really matters they had in plenty. Good food, meticulously clean shelter, solid values, and most of all - of course - love. Recommended for all ages in the highest possible terms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good book, but hard to summarize.","review":"Mama's Bank Account is a good book, but when it comes to writting a summary, it's hard.

We had to cut the power to the player to get the F'n thing out! Still nothing visibly wrong with the DVD though.

Once I heard Gigahearts I had the insatiable urge to buy/download/get everything they've released up until now 2009. To my delight I found that it was all phenomenal!Basically tracks 2-8 are all incredible and the rest aren't anything to be under-estimate either. It's hard to pick but my favorites are probably Beatcrusher, Can You Imagine, Bang Your Head and Just the Same for You.If you're a fan of bands like Rammstein, Eisbrecher, Combichrist, Crossbreed, Celldweller or even Nine Inch Nails give this album a listen and prepare to buy/download/get everything available by Dope Stars Inc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful text book that you can actually read","review":"Paul Agostino has taken on a subject,(poetry) which causes most to roll their eyes. However, there will be few \\"I don't get it\\"s from the readers of CREATED WRITING. The poetry is fresh and energetic, and the text that surrounds it is likewise.

Haunting, to match the dark humor of the rest of the CD. This is also an albumn to be read, since its lyrics are as captivating as its music. A must-see-in-person band, because no CD could ever truly capture the intensity of her voice. You will place \\"Comin' Up From Behind\\" on repeat until your roomates beg you to stop.

There is also a section on reed making. You can get more detailed information from one of the reed making books that the Uilleann pipers society sells.

I had no idea, so that was a very nice surprise, as AIC & Soundgarden are my 2 favorite bands of the decade, as well as being my 3rd & 4th favorite bands of all time (well, if you wanna get technical, they tie, they both rule). I heard \\"Got me wrong\\" back in '94 for the \\"Clerks\\" soundtrack (I think), & I fell in love. I only give it 4 stars just cuz I loved Jar of Flies first, & this is just too short! Plus the 5th track's annoying, as previously said...it's supposed to be a joke, right? cuz I can't keep a straight face...

Pointless (and pointlessly maudlin) lyrics accompanied by piano that ranges from cloying to pretentiously spare. Ms. Spektor caterwauls like a child still amazed at her ability to modulate between two unrelated pitches, she shifts timbre and inflection regularly, presumably in the pursuit of some dramatic effect. Anti-folk? more like anti-music.Purchasing this album, even checking it out of the library, is an utter waste of time and a crime against the human spirit.

This is evident by the albums opening song, straight through to \\"Long Day Gone.\\"If you're after an album which blends together many of the forgotten talents of the early to mid 90's together, and can appreciate other styles of music other than Alice in Chains, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy and appreciate this work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Layne's Best!","review":"I heard \\"River of Deceit\\" on Pandora and liked it.

I love Layne's range. He does Facelift, Dirt, and the Self-Titled while releasing the acoustic CD's in between (SAP and Jar o' Flies). The guy was just a musical genius. This record show that. Having the super backing band also helped, with vocals from Screaming Tree's Mark Lanegan (THE single most UNDERRATED vocailist to ever emerge from Seattle) and Mike from Pearl Jam's excellent 70's style guitar is the icing on the cake.

Well, \\"disappointed\\" would be an understatement. Almost every single song is devoid of a really good hook. With the exception of \\"River Of Deceit,\\" this explains why you've probably not heard any part of this CD on the radio. Take a listen to \\"I Don't Know Anything,\\" for example.

It all seemed so much more real with 'jar of flies' and even 'sap'. Here, its contrived and banal. If you want to listen to a seattle offshoot that is half decent, go check out one of the albums by 'brad'. The bright spot on this wreck is mark lanegan. But even he can only help so much on uninspired drivel such as this. The heroin killed laynes talent long before it snuffed out his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute masterpiece","review":"This album is an ultimate representation of music as art in its pure form. Written by four good friends: McCready, Martin, Baker, and Staley just for the sake of music itself, and not for acquiring fame or commercial success, this unique record is as close to a masterpiece as it gets. It is not an easy listen, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The music has enough hooks and beautiful melodies to grab your attention on the first listen, and Layne's magnificent haunting vocals illuminates the record's multidimensional, introspective and sincere lyrics. At the same time, this record is very rough around the edges, it's not even and well polished, and requires a deeper level of understanding, which comes after listening to it multiple times. Only then every sound on the record falls into place, and allows for a much greater enjoyment of this masterpiece on different levels. It never grows old, as it constantly evolves with time, more you listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good reading","review":"This book is not as good as Robert Manry's \\"Tinkerbelle,\\" but I enjoyed it a lot.

It advertises that it can be clamped to the edge of a desk, but the clamp is not sturdy enough on its own to hold the lamp/magnifier upright.Assembly of the lamp is not difficult, I did like the magnifying glass feature, but the first time I moved the lamp, it fell out of the base/clamp onto the floor & the light bulb (not included) broke. The return policy was excellent & I used that the day after I bought the lamp. Nice concept, very cheaply executed.I do not recommend this product. See also the reviews for ALVIN Magnifier Swing-arm Lamp Black, also sold by Amazon. There are 21 reviews of that one, most of them positive, so maybe it's me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for two good songs","review":"On the whole, this album is pretty unlistenable except for the opening track and the instrumental \\"High Falls.\\" It would have been nice to see these two outstanding tracks featured somewhere else, like a compilation (\\"Dreams\\" manages a version of \\"Can't Lose\\"). Stick with the earlier and/or later work of the Allman Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"high falls is amazing","review":"The song 'High falls' is simply amazing, I had never heard it before and couldn't believe it. How could this song never make the air waves, all be it 25+ plus years after it's recording. That's all I had to say, I'm a hugh music fan and collector, yet I'd never heard this flowing rose of an instrumental song, my life just improved a notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ABB runs out of gas","review":"After releasing five consecutive classic albums in a row, the Allman Brothers Band took two years to release the Win, Lose, or Draw album. This is a very unfocused release with few memorable songs. The band was going through some turmoil at the time and it reflected in the music. They continued to go more towards a country sound with Dickey Betts' \\"Just Another Love Song\\" and \\"Louisiana Lou and Three Card Monty John.\\" The only two tracks that recall their earlier albums are their cover of Muddy Waters' \\"Can't Lose What You Never Had\\" and the Dickey Betts instrumental \\"High Falls.\\" While \\"High Falls\\" is never mentioned among their great instrumental tracks, it's an excellent track and the high point of the album. The other tracks aren't up to their usual excellent standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABB loses","review":"Allman Bothers on the fall. Louisiana Lou And Three Card Monty John , a fast one. High Falls , above standard instrumental. This album is the indicator that ABB can not come up with any classic albums like their early and mid-70s albums. However, the instrumental wizard D. Betts shows no sign of weariness on writing the High Falls. High Falls is comparable to In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, Les Brers in A Minor and Jessica. Country style turned Allman Brothers, on this album, can not cheer up. These guys are Southern Rockers, the genre constricted by the mid-70s, and this album clearly bears that mark. This album can be bought just because of its date(that is in range of 70s albums). But the question is does it worth the buck? ABB's decline signs surface as they enter the 80s, that is truely due to the fact of a constricted genre. Maybe you should get yourself an 80s effort by Molly Hatchet, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad ...!","review":"This band is one good band.

Not only are the songs on Commencement very origional; mixing goth, new wave, and Bowie-esque rock and roll; but the sound of this album is like nothing I have heard on a major label release before. I can't decide if what I am hearing is a breakthrough in modern sound production or the cheapest sounding album I have heard since the earliest DIY punk material. The guitar sounds manage to be both dry and saturated at the same time. It truly defies any explanation I can come up with. Deadsy is a band that I hope stays around for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creativity Was Never Seen So Clearly","review":"Deadsy is a great band.

He is considered a movie composer. Even a couple hundred years from now he will be considered classic, but never classical.So, I then turned to the \\"classical\\" music of the catchy, if yet sappy, Beatle in hopes of good music. I was wrong. This is garbage to.Now, I know more about classical music than anyone else. Growing up, my friends were into rock and rap, and always asked me why I loved the string nonsense. I explained that when they listened to classical they were doing it wrong. Pop music you can rock out or dance to, but classical is supposed to be background music. You are supposed to use your imagination while listening to it, like a movie in your head. Again, it is all about imagination and the story you can tell yourself, or see in your mind.But most of this genre just puts me to sleep.

McCarthey has poured his spiritual philosophy and his heart into this music. He has stepped beyond the \\"short story\\" of the classic \\"Beatles\\" to the \\"novel\\" of an hour long creation. A classical orchestra, incredible soprano, and my favorite- a British Boys Choir, make this music that will inspire all. You will hear the clear beckoning of a lone trumpet, the melancholy of an oboe, the boom of drums, and the lilting melody of violins. It is music that gets better each time you listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really want to like this, but I just can't","review":"Just some background, I am a senior music education major at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, SC. I have taken 5 theory courses and 3 music history courses. This background definitely influenced my decisions about this music. As the first track begins to play one may compare this to any pre-classical or early classical oratorio. But, as the pieces drag on (and I mean draaag) one will hear many chord shifts that just do not make sense. I literally cringe when it comes to some of the passages. This is not to say that it is all bad, there are some tonal conventions that have not been undermined. However, the fact that any have not been followed makes this work lose it's luster. This is not classical nor neoclassical, it is an attempt at classical with bad part writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul McCartney is a musical genius","review":"Ecce Cor Meum is the most beautiful piece of music I've heard. I get chills listening to it, over and over again. Sir Paul McCartney must be a beautiful person to have written so many wonderful pieces. I think this is his best. I believe Sir Paul McCartney has established his name in time: his music will be listened to and played for centuries to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I was in my teens, I couldn't get enough McCartney. With truly memorable 5-minute songs he was in his element. Having said that, it took a lot of effort to listen to the entire Ecce cor Meum. McCartney does not have the discipline or know-how that it takes to write a larger work. It is fragmented, repetitive, and unremarkable, and he is clearly out of his depth with it. Now that he's been there, done that, it's time to return to the work for which he is justly famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple but beautiful","review":"This music is so simple that any reputable conservatory composition student would be declined admission if they submitted this score as their audition piece, yet because it is Paul McCartney, I am sure the music will sell. It is beautiful, I will give him that, but a child with some basic theory training could also write something beautiful too - if they put their heart and mind to it.This would make a great movie score - it does evoke some emotion - but the musicians would be bored out of their minds playing all those whole notes.I give this album 2 stars on the shear merit that it makes great background music, but if you are into serious listening, I would pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed.

We are sending our husbands,brothers, sons, or fathers to suffer possible injury or even death. But there are those who leave hand-in-hand with them. Although they do not maneuver through enemy fire, military wives feel the heat of battle. And those who go overseas with their husbands are caught deep in the crossfire.YOUNG WIVES-OVERSEAS is about three young women who join their husbands assigned to a remote military base in Germany. The deplorable conditions, lack of friends, and moral support from the military soon chases away their initial hopes of an exciting adventure in another country. Lost in the military culture,as well as that of a foreign land, they find solace and bond together to survive their ordeal.

Williams brings his characters alive with surprising vividness, and creates a story that quickly becomes a page-turner, as each of these distinctively different girls deal with drugs, wife-swapping parties, prostitution, poverty, sudden wealth and the strains of GI life in post-Cold-War Europe. They come from such different backgrounds as working-class Kentucky, sex-for-sale New Orleans and family-values Georgia.

It was just a family of grownups who never grew up. The kids were more interesting, but none of it was like real life. The author played a trick on his readers by stringing them along and throwing in a disgusting bathroom scene in the end. If this is the best he can do - I won't be reading his books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Character driven novel about ongoing dysfunction","review":"I can not speak for anyone but myself when I say that I found this book missing something. I checked it out of the library solely on the level of seeing different generations interact. I did see that in this book, but found most of them, save maybe Arlene, amazingly dull and shallow. I wonder if the writer would have been better off to focus on a smaller group, really getting to their deepest levels.I found myself becoming infuriated by the characters inability to say how they really feel. The dysfunction continues in this family because no one is willing to say what is bothering them, from the mother, to the alcoholic daughter, to the bitter wife. There is no conclusion in this book....just stories hanging in the wind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the STORY?","review":"As others have mentioned, wonderful characterizations, the writing is good, but there is no story. I love good character development and detail to surroundings, but these elements should be integrated into some kind of story-line, and THERE ISN'T ONE! What a waste of my time (and money!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of a week","review":"591 pages and I'm still wondering what the point was. This author seemed to miss the basic premise that a novel should have some sort of climax or the characters should have some sort of revelation but nothing happens. Even the case of a missing girl goes unresolved. None of the characters is likeable so reading this book is like spending a week with people you don't like in a place you really don't want to be and then having to watch vacation photos of the whole experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Epic About Nothing","review":"Halfway through, I thought I was enjoying the book. Until I realized that I really disliked all the characters.I admire the way O'Nan took on such a large cast, and rotated the points of view, but so much was heavy-handed. Yes, it was very, very clear that O'Nan researched photography. Those details screamed \\"AUTHOR'S RESEARCH! AUTHOR'S RESEARCH!\\" And he seemed to classify each character by one or two traits, and then return to those each time he presented that character's point of view: the scared boy, the bitter wife, the smart girl with a secret, etc.I don't generally mind a character-driven book in which nothing much happens. But I expect other payoffs: humor, precise characterization, unique observations. I learned a bit about Chautauqua and Niagara Falls, but I was hoping for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"torturous, in more ways than one","review":"Do people really have lives like this? so much frustration and tension palpable within each mundane aspect of their lives? If so, I wouldn't wish you were here. Blame and resentment permeates almost every exchange and interaction. I don't know who O'Nan hangs around with but if this is in any way a reflection of that company, God help them, because they are helpless to do anything constructive for themselves while they wallow in self-pity.

However, I prefer his slim, elegant and minimalistic novels (almost novellas) to this big old book about nothing going on...just goes on and on and on and on and I am simply bored with it. I am disappointed...I think he bit off more than he could chew. The characters are lackluster, one dimensional and inspired nothing but apathy from me. Another one bites the dust....I am not finishing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends what you're looking for","review":"Look, I'm willing to concede that it's very well done for what it is... an detailed exploration of the minds of the family members, and an examination of complex family dynamics.However, this was 500 pages of pretty much the same thing, over and over. I felt like I pretty much knew each character within 5 pages of their introduction, and there's almost no character evolution.

I wanted to give this book (can I call it a novel if there is absolutely no story?) a chance, because I liked the cover, and the description on the back made it sound interesting. I kept reading on with the hope that I was going to find some sort of story. Finally, halfway through I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe I Read the Whole Thing!","review":"I basically bought this book because the story takes place in the area where I live. That ends up being the only thing of interest in the entire book. This author has managed to fill 500 pages without saying a thing. Not one of the characters had a non-depressing thought or conversation and even the weather was miserable for the most part. The only thing I enjoyed about this book was being finished with it. I can't believe I wasted all that time on reading through it. I just couldn't believe the book would end without something happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I WASN'T There!","review":"The title and back cover reviews of the book inspired me to buy it while on vacation.

The story was so painfully mundane I quit reading it, and left it behind in the hotel lobby when I came home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I Never Read This","review":"Word of advice to future readers: Skip every 3 pages.

Better yet, read pages 1 and page 517...skip everything in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book I ever read","review":"In all my 79 years, this was one of the least interesting books I've seen through to the end. I continued reading it, rather than tossing it in the recycle bin, because I was trying not to think of the death of a friend.In the story, there was no character development or depth. No one engaged me at any level for more than two sentences. The pace was slower than a snail's, and there was no plot. The only event in the book that sparked interest was left hanging. Reading the book was like reading a transcription of a security camera filming a dull family for a week.Perhaps this was the author's intention, and if so, he succeeded. I have nothing against this person; his book just did not appeal to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Unappealing","review":"It is rare that I give a book a bad review, but I feel no qualms about this one. This book is big on mundane details, short on plot. This could work, given its description of the region, but its flawed in its multiple inaccurate descriptions of the Western New York area (where I grew up) which other reviewers have commented on. Add unsympathetic characters to the mix, and you have an unappealing book built on negative emotions. This isn't my style."},{"rating":"2","title":"mixed","review":"i loved this while i was reading it. his writing is great, the dialogue perfect. he captures those unspoken dramas that define the way a family funtions. you relate to it and feel the pressure of the passing of time, so slow, especially on the rainy days. you feel that claustrophobia. my only disappointment was by the ending. i was waiting for some small change - the book jacket promises a rekindling of love - and that never happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Plot and Unlikeable Characters","review":"A friend recommended Stewart O'Nan as a writer she enjoys. I decided to start with this one. Half-way through it I gave up and returned it to the library. Not one member of this family is likeable and, if you read all of the 500+ pages, you get to spend a lot of really boring time with them. Nothing happens. O'Nan gets rave reviews from professional reviewers - his other books must be a whole lot better. Not sure if I'll try reading him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and slow...","review":"I was determined to finish the entire book, and I did...finally. The details are what got me. There was not much of a story, so the author had to fill the book with details. Loading the dishwasher, cleaning the cabinets, the damn ants in the mailbox. Who cares? Where is the story? The family was annoying: Kenneth who couldnt follow through on a single project he wanted to do, Margaret fighting for the house until she realized she could get money instead, Emily so wrapped up in the mundane details of day to day chores because she has nothing better to do. It was really hard for me to follow these people through a day, let alone an entire week. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y-A-W-N!","review":"I have a personal policy to always finish the book that I am reading. This book is making me change my views. I have been struggling for the past two weeks to get through this book. It is boring and the characters are wholly unlikeable. Lise is someone I am glad does not exist - what a shrew! In any story, there should be some kind of plot, some kind of rising action. There is nothing in this book, just days and days of mundane stuff.

I thought the telling of the story through different character narratives was brilliant and was able to keep the reader interested and guessing.

This book listens superbly because it is composed as a series of narratives, and the different readers bring the different narratives to life. Whatever you do, DO NOT READ OR LISTEN TO THE ABRIDGED VERSION as suggested by one misguided editorial review. As you will see by glancing at the other reviews, when you finish the complete version, your piercing regret will be that there is no more. This book is a stunning, perhaps unique, combination of depth and suspense. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll be enthralled as it moves from climax to climax. Do yourself a favor and read as little as possible about the plot before starting the book, so that you can fully appreciate its uncanny spell."},{"rating":"2","title":"None","review":"I first heard mention of this book when reading one of Nora Ephron's books.

It quickly became one of mine too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern classic!","review":"I listened to the Woman in White on unabridged audio CD narrated by Ian Holm who played Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Mr. Holm does terrific work bringing life to Walter, Marian, Percival, Fosco and all the wonderful characters in this book.The main comment I want to offer here, is how this wonderful work stands the test of time. The language is Dickensian era (Dickens and Collins were not just contemporaries but friends), but it's clear, contemporary, expressive and entirely understandable. Wilkie Collins created a timeless, modern classic in the Woman in White. The story is a joy with its twists and turns, and even though I cheated by reading the Wikipedia plot summary beforehand, I still couldn't wait to hear the story unfold.In sum, the audio book is wonderful - great to fill three weeks of car commuting - but the story itself and Wilkie Collins' prose is a surprising, modern delight. I offer high praise for the Woman in White and Wilkie Collins!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to savor and keep, ribbon and all","review":"I'm about two-thirds of the way into this story.

Here's to you, Dr. Sullivan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mystery with lots of atmosphere!","review":"Collins was a contemporary of Charles Dickens, and its interesting that his stories are still just as exciting as they were when first printed. This is a great mystery story that is as evocative as its title. Whoever has read this story never forgets Wilkie's crossroads. \\"the road to West End, the road to Hampstead, the road to Finchley and the road to London.\\" This is where we see his solitary woman dressed all in white from head to toe. The story is masterfully written, and Mr. Collins uses some of his characters to \\"write\\" different parts of the story. In this unique way the reader really gets to know his characters and how they think. There is a wealth of detail, and a carefully plotted story. Still as exciting today as the day it was written.

I challenge anyone to start reading and then to try to put this book down before you are through (and since it's quite long, it's not easy). Once you've read all of Agatha Cristie's books, you can see how she must have read Collins to structure her books and plots. Unlike many new detective novels, you also get the benefit of great Victorian writing. Think of it as killing two birds with one stone: reading a Jane Austen book with a gripping mystery plot!

I read at least 100 books a year and this is one of the best I've ever read. I truly could not put it down. No TV until I finished reading it.Set in 19th century England, \\"Woman in White\\" is a mystery that is not cleared up until the final pages, with a surprising twist at the end. There is no detective and no murder, only a young man who has a personal interest in solving the mystery. The final chapters are as thrilling as any modern murder mystery.Collins set the scene in old England with much attention to detail. He describes clothing, food,furnishings, manners and customs of the period very vividly and visually. The old-fashioned dialog actually moves along pretty well, since every conversation furthers the plot. It's long book but you really can't (and won't want to) skip any pages.\\"Woman in White\\" was made into a movie (Swedish) in 1949 and has since been made into several TV movies and miniseries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

An additional pro of this book is the numerous case examples given within each chapter and towards the end.

I thot I would like to have fresh herbs for cooking and 6 would be enough. My kids bought me the Mega Garden (15 pots).

The water outtake valve was too short, so I had to replace that. Since I was overhauling the thing anyway, I also added an air pump and air stone to keep the water oxygenated.I didn't use the square black plastic buckets.

It does not print regular text well, or rather, it's so insanely expensive to print, you won't want to. And extremely slow. When one ink tank goes out, by the time it goes through the process, it's drained at least 2 more. One Set of ink is right at $125. That's just plain insulting.Oh, and no where does it say it's limited to regular paper only, in other words, it won't even print an envelope and there is nothing in the print driver system to let it.

But for going to any specific book or chapter, there is no easy way to do so except for text searching. Regarding the formatting, each sentence has a title. ie, a sentence will start:1 Nephi 2:2020 (a single sentence)1 Nephi 2:2121 (a single sentence)complete with 2 or three lines of white space between each sentence.

The bad guys, Lamanites, are cursed with a dark skin and become a \\"degenerate\\" people i.e. the Native Americans.

Wheels of Fire has a nice collection of music, Crossroads is full of hot guitar runs, and this song is still played on the radio today 40 years later. Classic. Crank it up. The other live tracks, Spoonful, Traintime and Toad, give all three members of the group (Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, and Eric Clapton) a chance to show off. White Room is perhaps the most frequently played, but I think it is one of the lesser songs on the album, I prefer Sitting On Top Of The World, Politician, Born Under A Bad Sign.

Based on those reviews, I assume that some people can get this thing to work. I can't.The stove seems to pull heat away from the coals, both when trying to light it and when trying to cook with it; after I gave up trying to light coals in it, I lit the coals separately in a \\"chimney\\" and just tried to cook with it. Usually, once you get coals started, they will continue burning until they are just ash, unless you close off the oxygen. In half a dozen tries, as soon as I stop actively trying to get the coals to burn, they just go out. I don't understand why. The video shows people using it to cook a huge feast, I have not been able to grill a hot dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"son of a hibachi","review":"I bought it for my husband birthday present....works great!.

The whole project was an unforgettable experience. (I was also able to participate in the portions of the program that were taped in New York.) The photography is beautiful, particularly in Krakow and environs, and I can tell you that the care and sensitivity that went into the writing and editing is very evident in the final result. And by this I include the invaluable contributions of Mr. Perlman to the whole project as well. It was a subject dear to his heart and to many other project participants (other musicians, etc.) and this came through in the overall tone of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scum Bag GGG","review":"This Gordon guy is a scum bag. I heard in the 90's he had a falling out with Ace and Gordon stole money from fans while running Ace's fanclub.I wouldn't believe a thing this guy says netherless give him a penny for his national inquire type books--for his stories sound far fetched and just makes him look like the bitter, dishonest person he is......You can tell he's not very professional with all the terrible typos I've heard are in the book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsupported Gossip","review":"The book is written from the point of view of cast-off hangers-on. KISS & TELL is on the same journalistic level as the National Enquirer, save the horrid grammar & obtuse writing style.The 'authors' attempt to paint Mr. Frehley as the most abhorrent individual to ever walk the face of the Earth (Yet somehow the two men managed to spend quite a bit of time with the KISS guitarist.)Both men seem to have axes to grind against Frehley & it is hard to take anything in this book seriously. The humor is at it's best trite, & quite often stolen from other sources. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"Had I known how brutal this book was, I would not have bought it! With friends like these....Ace needs NO enemy's! My question is...if Ace truly was the arrogant pig you made him out to be, why did you continue to hang with him year after year????? Also I find it very hard to believe that Ace had trouble getting women while these two supposedly had women throwing themselves at them! Seriously? I am sure Ace could be difficult from time to time....he was the lead guitarist for a huge rock band! But, the way he is portrayed in this book?????? Ace rules forever in my book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"KISS & Tell is without a doubt one of the best books I ever read. I literally could not put it down. I recently heard the author, Gordon Gebert, on 93.3 The Planet with Carrie Martin. The guy is hysterical. I'm looking forward to any book he puts out. Sign me \\"a new Gebert fan.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time & money","review":"This is the work of a bitter man. Don't get me wrong: I wouldn't be surprised if all of what Gordon wrote was true. However, we see here a person (Gordon) who wants what Ace had (Superstardom, foolish though he was/is/whatever), and when he found himself used and abused, didn't have the guts to take a stand for himself. It sounded to me like he blamed Ace for his ended marriage, and not his own foolish choices. I can't believe I wasted my money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I Wasted My Time Reading This Book","review":"I bought this book out of curiosity, being a Kiss fan, and I think that this book is a pathetic attempt to cash in on being friends with a celebrity. The book is poorly written, and it is quite obvious it was slapped together quickly to start cashing in right away. I have no sympathy for either Mr. Gebert or Mr. McAdams, they are two grown men who were able to make their own choices. The stories may or may not be true, but while trying to cast Ace Frehley in a bad light, they also cast that same light on themselves. If someone supposedly treats you so bad and such an awful person, then why remain friends with them for so long? I would recommend taking this book with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book","review":"This book is a waste of paper. The writing is bad, the editing worse, and the bitterness of two (...) trying to cash in is the worst. The book is riddled with questionable 'facts,' loaded with whining, and just not very well-written. If these clowns can write books, so can (...) chimps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"A disapointing poorly written and edited book. The photos are low quality and uninteresting. Gordon had contempt for the band before hitching a ride with Ace. When he found out that it wasn't his ticket to stardom he trashes Ace and calls himself a friend. Bob seems to think he alone is the reason Ace became a star. They say they wrote this book because they got tired of having to tell the stories again. It seems to me that they just want to get paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Kiss and Tell\\" is Decidedly Cool!","review":"Kiss and Tell is a refreshingly humorous account of two rockers and their affiliation with \\"Ace\\" from the band \\"Kiss.\\" As a professional writer, classical musician and classic rock afficionado who has never seen the workings of the inner circles of the rock world, I really enjoyed the dual account told as only true rockers can. Once I started reading the book, I couldn't put it down -- or stop laughing! Where else would one find such a candid look at the inner structure of a world most of us only can wonder about?Shortly after I read the book I had the pleasure of meeting both of the authors -- cool standup dudes if you will, not to mention musicians who wrote what they know about. In MY book, that's the coolest. But don't take my word for it, definitely check it out yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't waste my money","review":"I have been told by very dear friends of Ace not to buy this trash book. Gordon is no longer Ace's friend since the early 90's when Gordon was running Ace's Fan Club and did some pretty shady things like steal some of Lydia Criss photo's that he now has in his book!!! Lydia did take him to court but of course possession is 9/10 of the Law so Gordon won but Ace is no longer is friend and neither is Lydia!!!The book is full of lies!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Friends or Foe?","review":"The one thought i had about reading this book is arethese indeed friends of Ace Frehley or enemies?As friends they sure make Ace out to be a total deadbeatperson and pig of a man. I am sure Ace had some goodpoints and positive sides to him. These so-called friendsof his only wrote about the down-side of Ace Frehley.I would of enjoyed to hear the good and the bad, notall the disgusting aspects of his life.Therefore i think the authors of this book only concentratedon the bitter bad side of Ace to make their story moreinteresting to market instead of showing an honest viewof Ace Frehley. I am sure that with the bad comes some goodin the man we know as the SpaceMan. I have faith in that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal, inside glimpse","review":"This book gave everyone an insiders view to the \\"characters\\" that make up KISS. The times and happenings of Rock & Roll stars are too often hidden from their audiences. Gordon & Bob offer the readers personal, up front stories, that make KISS members real, and human. Their strengths and weaknesses are shown to the public. When we go to see a KISS concert after reading this book, one gets the feeling that perhaps we know them a bit more intimately. Maybe some of their onstage actions become more meaningful to the viewer. Thanks guys for writing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Much truth to this?","review":"I am a loyal Kiss fan, and I find that these two are vindictive ex-friends. I'm sure some of the stuff is true, but a lot of this is just vindictive stories that does not really need to be written about just to get back at Ace because things did not work out between you guys. The story about one trip to Atlantic City where you lost your job and Ace did not pay you to go. Who's fault is that you lost your job? Ace took you as a buddy, not an employee. Its too bad this is how you sell your book, by bad mouthing members of the greatest band in the world and their lead guitarist. I wont give a nickel for Kiss and tell more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $$ for something better","review":"Dude, I thought this book was going to be cool and is it not. Don't get me started about the poor quality of the editing.Come on, even tough english ain't my first language I noticed some words mispelled, unbeliavable in two grown guys.Some of the sories were fun but these two bitter men (Gordon + Bob) give authors ot there a bad name.This book is not that shocking as some people want you to believe.I read it in like one hour LOL so go figure it is not a challenge to read those tales wich are higly suspicious .Bottom line, if you are willing to read it, maybe you should try to get it second hand.Ps: Nothing written in this book changed the image I had of Ace :) but I don't worship him either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have NO plans to read this book-- NO STARS","review":"Gordie Gebert spammed me about this book and his next few several dozen times on KISSOnline. I have since warned him about unsolicited spam and harrassment.That being said, I don't want to read about how he and Ace Frehley got drunk together and messed up each other's lives. I'm an Ace fan; he's treated me well on the one time I met him in 1987. Yes, I've heard some rather ungood stories about Ace from various sources, and I believe some of them, but I refuse to let Ace be slandered by anyone, no matter how long that person claims \\"friendship\\" with Ace.The truth is, Ace is a faulted man, but that's not why I like him. I respect his talent, his style, and his wacky sense of humor. And NO greasebag with a chip on his shoulder will change that for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, Questionable and Sad","review":"Being a long time fan of Kiss and especially Ace Frehley I was curious to read it. If all this is true and not embellished, Ace seems to have no respect for friends, family, bandmates or fans. It is hard to believe that someone could live like this and survive. Truth or not it was a good read with lots of laughs. I still enjoy Ace Frehley as a musician and I am sure there are a lot of good qualities about him that did not make the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth behind the scenes","review":"At least the authors of this book admit their sins through out the various stories narrated. They fully aknowledge the fact that were two of Ace Frehley's Party buddies. The stories told here are somewhat funny (If almost shooting one's toe and being high all day could be considered funny) but especially instructing. Except for the co author's constat statement that Ace always had a way of making him do things he didn't want to (like he had no mind of his own) the book is a lesson on what excessive fame and money can do to a person. Is a must read for fans and non fans of Kiss, and goes to show you that the Kiss reunion HAD to be for the money, for there's no other way some one like Paul And Gene can tolerate guys like Ace or Peter; and if this is what comes with fame and fortune, thank God i've neve made it with my band."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"For Inquring Minds\\"","review":"I won't lie--- its' an entertainig read, but so is the National Enquirer. Basically, a one-sided smear campaign of rock guritar god, Ace Frehley, who we all know has been through the riggers of rock stardom. Probably, there is some truth in some of their stories---However, we must remind ourselves that obviously drugs, alcohol, and money were abused by not only Ace, but the authors as well; which in my view takes heavily away their credability. Obviously, they feel cheated out of money by Ace, and writing this \\"stuff\\" probably got them a nice pay-day. No matter what happened in those times, Frehley fans should rejoice that their hero has appearantly found his soul and to realize that he is if nothing more ---\\"human\\" like the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable great product","review":"Great product.

This book doesn't skirt around issues but provides plenty of explanations for why sometimes these methods 'appear' to fail as well as useful methods for overcoming these apparent failures with right thought. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I do not consider it necessary to take into account the author's Christianity in order to appreciate the value of this book. While it is true that there is a Christian perspective to it, the methods are available to those of any faith or no religious persuasion at all. I have used this book countless times and passed it on to others, always with great effect.Most Beautiful Princess"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"A must read for anyone interested in the magic of healing. A necessity for any metaphysical library. Ponder makes a short work of the 'art' of healing. Whether you are working on self-healing or in conjunction with a doctor or holistic practioner, the information contained in the Dynamic Laws of Healing are invaluable.Case in point: Chapter 12 is called \\"Chemicalization, A Healing Process.\\" Common sense tells us that in healing 'things often get worse before they get better,' yet when we find our lives in crisis as a result of change we are quick to forget and abandon the very change we seek in exchange for comfort and familiarity. Thru persistance and acceptance we can arrive at the desired outcome.I am enjoying this book thoroughly and look forward to reading her other works as well. I know you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellanat, Timeless","review":"The Dynamic Laws of Healing is an excellant timeless book by Catherine Ponder.

She shows one how to turn on the corrective thoughts in order to change the whole pattern of your life for the better. It is explained that everybody can use these ancient healing laws and there's nothing mysterious about them. In fact, healing constantly takes place in our lives in simple ways that seem miraculous. We all have the healing power, if we only realize it. The healing laws include: The \\"No\\" law, \\"Surprise\\" law, Law of Release, the \\"Yes\\" law, Praise law, Law of love, Miracle law, Occult law, Imaging law & the Mystical law. Countless examples of healing are provided to demonstrate these laws in action. A pleasure to read and a book that substantially expands one's consciousness.

Not many other musical groups try to promote world peace the way that the Boyz do. The Boyz predicted the future with the lyric, \\"Street gangs with a little fame them h**s gonna chase ya\\".

There is always something going on and happens to be more eventful than either of the movies made from it.A sweet tale, appreciating the presentation in hardcover is all the more rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"both movies in one book","review":"This book was interesting to read because I thought it would be like \\"The Neverending Story\\" movie, but instead the book goes through both \\"The Neverending Story\\" 1 & 2. It has alot more details and you find out how far off the movies ventured from the book. The first few chapters are similar to the original movie then the rest of the book is about Bastian losing his memories and trying to get home. It is an interesting book, but some parts get rather dry. Enjoy with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"This is such a wonderful book. It tells the story of two young men from different worlds, both on the adventure of their lives. It is an amazing story, with many twists and turns. I recommend this story for both the child and the child at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words Have Yet To Be Created!!","review":"I first fond this book when I was 7 years old. I read the small paperback...at least 9 times. I was captivated. When I found the hard cover, I jumped for joy! It had been 5 years, and I still remembered the entire story! This wonderful book should be read by anyone who can read english. The Neverending story, however, is not just a child's book. I am an adult now and I still read this book when I get a chance, and it still amazes me!! This story really should have many more stars (10 would be a modest number!) Please, you owe it to yourself to read this beautiful masterpice!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish it never-ended!","review":"Having grown up loving the movie, I had to read the book as an adult. I love the movie just the way it is, but knowing when it was made (without CG, special effests, etc..) I knew lots of really cool stuff had probably been left out.The book is actually both movies (1&2) so that was cool since I have only seen the second one a couple of times. (We all know is stinks compared to the first one. Of course gotta love J.B - RIP)I wouldn't mind seeing a few of these left out parts in a new version of the movie, like the desert and lion part.I only wish this one had the Orin on the cover like in the movie, that would be sweet. Also, I thought it was cool that the book is printed in two different color inks, one for the world of Fantasia, and one for bastians' world. Neat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title, ends.","review":"Imagine my dismay when, after deciding I needed to cut down on my book buying, I purchased and then finished this \\"Neverending\\" story in two days.No really, imagine it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"The first 100 pages were good, original, and well written. Once Bastian enters Fantastica, the book goes downhill. It seems that all of the events with Bastian were drawn from a hat at random. The story doesn't develop anything for the rest of the book, and I could care less about anything in the story other than finishing it, and stopping the torture of reading this awful piece of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK EVER","review":"I read the first half of this book in under a week. I continued to read and found the same events to be occuring over and over. This book is horribly repetative and boring. The writing is atrocious. Do not read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie","review":"I love this book! I've seen the movie, and it was horrible! For one, it stops half way through, and skips key parts that make the story more interesting.The book starts when a not-so-heroic boy named Bastian runs into a book shop to escape some bullies, when he happens upon the Neverending Story. Bastian retreats to the forgotten attic of his school and begins to read. Bastian is swept into the magical world of Fantastica, which is in great danger...My favorite character is Grogroman, the Many-Colored Death of the Desert of Colors(not in the movie). Michael Ende is one of the most imaginative authors I've read(and I've read quite a bit). This is a must-read book you have to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touches your soul deeply","review":"This is one of the books everyone should read once in a life. however I strongly disagree with the 'age: 9-12' thing. Made up as a tale it's full of serious stuff, not likely understood by small children. I'd suggest reading it after 14 years. (Btw my 10 year old daughter asked for this book just yesterday, I told her to wait some years.)For those who have seen the movie I must say it was spoiled in many ways comparing to the book. (Yes, I liked the movie very well, and read the book only years after...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could, I'd rate this book one hundred stars!","review":"This is my favorite book. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book. The movie only goes through the first nine chapters of the four hundred and forty five page book. It starts with chapter one (Or A) and goes to chapter twenty six (Or Z). Going through the destruction of Fantastica (pronounced Fantistic-a, not fantasia!) to the end of Bastion's adventures (boy I hope I spelled that right!). A breath taking story about friendship and humility, and how one little fat boy can save an entire world of imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Edition","review":"Many reviewers have already given a synopsis of this fantastic story of a boy literally drawn into a book he is reading. So, I wanted to comment on this particular edition.I was hesitant to spend so much money on a book that has been in print for so long and is readily available in cheap paperback copies. However, this is a beautiful hardcover edition. Collectible quality. The dust jacket has lovely artwork. But, the best aspect is the two color text. The majority of the book is printed in green typeface. Bastion's sections are printed in red typeface. This allows for a smooth, but noticeable, transition between the two stories. I think this makes is easier on younger readers to keep track of what's going on, as well as being visually appealing. The paper feels thicker than in most books, and seems to be high quality. Bright white pages showcase the color text very well.Fans of \\"The Princess Bride\\" would enjoy the story. Book collectors will be happy to add this to their shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true classic","review":"This remains one of the best boks I have ever read. I have never read anything like it - it is simply amazing how you as a reader are actually pulled into the story and experience it at first hand - you are actually a part of the story. The magic is alive, it really changes you as you read. The book has An INCREDIBLE depth to it; if you read betwen the lines it contains some of the deepest spiritual secrets - it has truly mystical dimensions. There are very few books of this calibre. (And, by the way, forget the film!) ALso, do yourself a favour and buy the hardcover. This is printed in two colours, green for the real world and red for when you are in Fantasia. It makes a big difference!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"I missed this book as a child, but came across it in a bookstore and had to buy it. I am certainly glad I did. For those of you who only know Bastian from the movie, you are sadly robbing yourself of a fantastic adventure. You too, will get \\"pullled\\" into the story. So what are you waiting for? Go! Go find Childlike Empress a new name, Go save Fantastica! Oh, but do say hello to Falkor for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book I've ever read","review":"I can't believe the way Mr. Ende has set up thisbook. I love this book and have fuond no one except Amazon books who carry it. I've read this book two times already. I was so mezmirized by it that I want to keep reading it. Every time I read it I find something new that I missed the first time that I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for all people of all ages!","review":"The Neverending Story is the most astonishing book I have ever read. It can be enjoyed by both the child and adult on intellectual and spiritual levels. Ende gives the reader a new perspective on reality and dreams. His message to readers, written on the AURYN reads \\"Do What You Wish\\" -- commands readers to achieve self-actualization, the highest of all of man's aspirations. Read this book for a new enlightenment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Momo\\" by Michael Ende is translated as \\"The Grey Gentlemen\\"","review":"Before I discovered \\"The Neverending Story\\" as a child, I read \\"Momo\\". The English translation that I read was called \\"The Grey Gentlemen\\", and if you enjoyed \\"The Neverending Story\\" you'll probably enjoy that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful world of imagination...","review":"Michael Ende's \\"Neverending Story\\" is a childhoodclassic in Germany and is truly a great novel. After reading the HarryPotter novels and JK Rowling's imaginative world full of great ideas, I had to think of the worlds Ende creates in his novels, of his ability to bring together pieces of different mythologies and fairy tales and to create a witty book full of references, word play and ideas. This book should not have been made into a movie for it is an argument in favour of the world of reading and \\"the movies\\" that are created in your mind. It is very sad that Ende died some years ago and therefore will not be able to bring us more novels like this and I am very surprised that most of his other books are still not available in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful novel. It's like a hallucination with a plot.","review":"A young boy, Bastian Balthazar Bux, storms into a the shop of Mr. Correander, the keeper of mystical book bound in copper leather and surmonted by a serpentine emblam, and makes off with what will become the doorway to another world. In the Neverending story we see two worlds come together. The world of fantasy and the world of men. It is Bastian's quest to bring the world of fantasy and imagination back to his world, but first he must overcome his desire to blend into this dream world and fade away. With every passing wish Bastian's power in Fantasia increases but at a great cost - his memory. Only by denying his desire to overthrow the Childlike Empress, by mounting himself up as Lord of Fantasia, and by straining to keep hold of what memory he still has from his own world will Bastian reach the end of his great quest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Love that the text is in green and purple to quickly denote the difference between the real world and Fantastica. It's a great way to present that and it's just make this item, that I plan to give as a gift, all that more special."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book That Lives Up To It's Name","review":"I strongly recomend this book for recreational reading. The author does an excellent job in creating a whole new world. The characters are suprisingly deep, despite how briefly some of them appear in the story. This book truly is a \\"neverending story\\", in that the writer leaves the story open for other books in many places. Three movies have come about as a result of this work. As always, however the book is much better. Anyone who does not read this book will miss out on a great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i'm still looking for that book!","review":"When I first saw the movie \\"The Neverending Story\\" as a child, I was enthralled. And when I found the book in the library, I was ecstatic - I could have adventures like Bastian's! It was just Bastian's story in print, though - a crushing disappointment for a ten year old. I read it anyway, and realized I loved it even more than the movie. I checked it out of the library to read again every month until i had enough allowance saved to buy it, although I'm still, to this day, looking for the book Bastian found! In short, this is my favorite fairy tale of all time. When I have kids, they're hearing it. Grandkids? Them, too. And if anyone can lay their hands on the book Bastian found, please let me know...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantasy to Spawn Imagination","review":"The book is not one of the best children's books I've ever read. It's one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. The book was designed for adults, but children would find it enjoyable. Every chapter ends with, \\"But that is another story.\\" There were so many spin-offs of histories and stories which could have happened, which could have been pursued. Thankfully, they did not. We, the readers, get to complete the stories. This approach made one feel like this story *was* real, and continuing on. This feeling was furthered by the merging of reality and literature which is central to the storyline, reminding the reader that they are actually reading and watching, just as the main character is. And as the main character is drawn into the fantasy, so, maybe, we can be too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Neverending Story - I Love It!!","review":"The Neverending Story by Michael Ende is a wonderful book. The fantastic images and elaborate detail portrays real life in a very surreal manner. The book has many levels of meaning, and is a pleasure to read. The determination of Atreyu, the main character and hero, is inspiring and entertaining. Though the events are usually unrealistic, they are symbolic of the obstacles we face in our everyday lives. I recommend anyone needing a break from reality to read this book; it is a fun way to reflect on your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm reading it again!","review":"This was the first every fantasy book I read and I loved it. Much more than i did the movies. It allows the readers' imagination to build their own Fantasia ( that's what the neverending story is all about anyway)and places them in the shoes of Bastian. I didn't watch the movie until I was 14 and I only read the book three years later. I bet the original (German) version of it would be much nicer (but i can't read German). I'm reading it again, definitely. I just got myself a copy ( after searching high and low for it ) eventhough the book cost a bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone who dares to dream should read this book!","review":"This book will absolutely take you to Fantastica. If you don't begin to see the worl we live in as a different place, you didn't read very hard. Not just young kids should read it. I think adults should read it more than kids. The greatest challenge in this life is to see it for more than meets the eye. This book will help you and anyone else who reads it to dream, hope, and explore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy classic","review":"This is one of the greatest fantasy classics ever written, and Michael Ende certainly deserves at least the same recognition as Tolkien.This story has it all: Likable characters, a unique setting, lots of both action and comedy - amd it makes you think, too. For anyone who likes fantasy, this is a must-read, and for everyone else: Read it anyway!For those of you who have only seen the abysmal and absolutely horrible movie: Please read the book, so you won't go around thinking Ende's story is that bad!And for those of you who are lucky enough to never have seen the movie: Don't! It doesn't do the book justice in any way whatsoever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GOOD BOOK","review":"This story is pretty much all about what we imaginative daydreamers thrive off of. The story is about an unheroic boy named Bastian Balthazar Bux who steals and reads a book called \\"The Neverending Story,\\" getting more and more drawn into it as he reads. He soon finds that he is a character in the story and needs to enter the magical land of Fantastica in order to save the land and its Empress. If you have ever found yourself wishing that this kind of thing was real until you almost throw up, then this is definetly the book for you. It was originally written in German, but the translation is very intelligent. It is a good book. READ IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book!!!!!","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. in truth, the book really is neverending. i had seen the movie/s and i didn't really like them. but still i read the book. i will never regret it. i got confused while reading it though because that was where the movie ended. yet i was not quite half through the book yet.it went on and some of the things bastian encounters are so wonderfully imaginative i swelled up inside w/ joy. i hope they remake the movie because it is not true to the book. w/ all the new technology they could do a really good one. so if you like fantasy, this is just about as good as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Magic!","review":"This book has the capability of capturing ANYBODY'S mind. It is a work of art, and can be enjoyed from ages 12 to 112. It has tales of adventure, magic (both evil and good), friendship, love, wisedom, and the gaining of wisedome. Everything that makes a fantasy story good is in this novel, and no one should go without reading it. The only thing that I wonder is if there was ever a sequal written for this book. There are so many other stories it branches off into. But they are other stories, that shall be told another time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the greatest!","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read!

This book has to be read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite book in all the world.","review":"I first read The Neverending Story when I was 10 or 11 and have read it many times since. It is my favourite book in all the world. It is the greatest fantasy novel ever written, and it is a travesty that hollywood ever sought to turn this treasure into a movie. If you only know the story by the movie, then please read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is one of the best ever written!!!!","review":"I loved this book, to say the least. Although, I have noticed that some readers misread what was on the back of AURYN. I'm almost positive it reads \\"DO AS YOU WISH\\", not \\"DO WHAT YOU WISH\\". A simple mistake. But, the meaning is very clear. Ende takes you to Fantastica and makes you want to stay there forever. When I finished, the first thing I wanted to do was read it again, just so I could go back to that wonderful place. And I'm assuming from the other reviews that the general public agrees with me. This is a book for everyone!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is full of adventures and fun. I loved it.","review":"The Neverending Story is one of my favorite books.

The first movie was good, the second movie was ok, and well... the \\"third\\" movie... yeah, let's not even go there, because it has absolutely nothing to do with the book... Let's just pretend that movie doesn't exist. Anyways, I am happy to say that truly, this book is one of my favorite reads from my young adulthood. It is better than the first movie, and it goes far beyond the plot of the second movie. I feel this book has some valuable lessons, and is so imaginative that, even though I have not read it in quite a while, the fantastic realm of this book haunts me. I will definitely read it to my kids someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh childhood","review":"I had seen the movie when I was younger and didn't realize it was a book until recently and of course, I had to read it.

There's not a single competent singer in the whole production except a somewhat characteristic Marinella Pennicchi. The heroics of Hubert Zingerle as Richard in a great heroic aria \\"Si l'univers entier\\" are something beyond description (a totally wrong voice type with no technique), and the duetto between the shaking door-bell-like Comtesse and belling Richard is off-the-pitch shrieking.

The 'direction' of the story line is too shallow and the content is more like that of a children's book. It is clear that the author is a novice and unsure themselves where the book is taking them.

All I could find was either very dark, chrome, or just a post with no protection to the TP. When there are boys using the bathroom, you want to cover the TP.

I got one for my parents new bathroom and one for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimensions were misrepresented","review":"I specifically searched for an item at least 6\\" in diameter and was thrilled when I found this. I ordered 2. They are NOT 6\\" in diameter, they are 5-1/2, which is the size of the jumbo roll. The lid is 6\\", but that's no good. I tried my toilet roll and it got stuck and I had trouble getting it out again.

The item is not tapered near the bottom, as previously reviewed. It easily holds three rolls of toilet paper and the light translucence allows you to see when it needs to be refilled (a great feature that I searched high and low for!). Would definately recommend!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good ideas if you can take the writing","review":"It's not that this book doesn't offer some decent ideas for where to go for a weekend away. There are some. But what the book lacks is variety of type of escape and colorful, insider-info writing. Written by two moms who met on a park bench while their kids were playing in the sandbox, all of the trips tend to take on a girls-weekend-away feel, combined with soft, gushy writing about delightful places to have lunch, quaint towns, and cute places to stay. I was turned off by several places that just seemed too precious and longed for more variety in the types of places to visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Resourceful!","review":"I picked up this book not too long ago. I loved it I have already begun planning my travels. I want to start with the firt place mentioned.

The book takes us through his early childhood years and progress through all of his stages of manhood. The Author Ernest Hemingway writes a story that is very easy reading. The stories in this novel are individual, however at the same time they all tie in together at the end. The book can either be read one story at a time or in any chronological order. I believe any reader can easily understand this book, and for someone who would like to get interested in Hemingway's works reading this book would be a good starting point and will probably turn you on to some of his more famous writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome service","review":"The book was in great condition and received within 3 business days after placing the order.

I really didn't understand why they recommended book. It started ok, but nothing interesting happens. I barely finished it.

If you're looking this up voluntarily, don't buy it, for the sake of your poor sanity. Hemingway is dry, dry, dry. Of course, the titles of the stories can be pretty (I'm trying to rationalize my having to read the book at all), but after this I'm going to throw away any book that mentions the phrase 'illegal trout selling.' The stories are disjointed, characters confusing, and I didn't find Nick halfway likeable as a person. Eep..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hemingway at his very best...","review":"This, as well as Hemingway's collected short stories, was a real pleasure to read every time I decided to read and reread this work. Very few short story writers write about things that common people can easily relate to. I never liked reading as a kid, then I found myself absorbed in Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce, and Hemingway's writings - mainly thier short stories. Contemporary authors I can think of that hold a match to Hemingway are few and far between. Kurt Vonnegut, J.S. Moore, and John Irving come to mind but that is about it as far as writers I can easily follow and find myself wishing for more from them. Hemingway, though, is my favorite author from that list. \\"The Killers\\" is one I recommend from this collection to anyone willing to give Ernest a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant visit to the past","review":"I'm not a big fan of Hemingway's work, for the most part, but I have enjoyed a few pieces and the Nick Adams stories are among them. It's nice to have them all in a single collection. The earliest ones don't appeal to me all that much, in and of themselves, but as I read later stories, I was glad to have had those earlier ones as a foundation for getting to know the character. On the whole, I'm glad I spent the money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a Nick Adams inside all of us","review":"This is a wonderful set of stories that everyone can thoroughly enjoy, mainly because it deals with themes that are familiar to us all. The independent stories deal with Nick Adams during several stages through his life, during which he must come to terms with outside influences as well as his own inner demons. Many of the stories show Nick trying to understand his place in the world, showing how he copes with many of the same issues that we all must deal with. Manhood is a prominant theme throughout many of these stories, showing how Nick and many other men deal with their emotions and handle different relationships. It is apparent that this is a somewhat autobiographical account of Hemingway's life, which may help you understand the trials and tribulations that Hemingway was forced to go through. The stories themselves are very entertaining, sometimes humorous, sometimes sad, but always based in reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A major classic must","review":"A classic book that one has to read about the very definition of the unconscious.

They have good service, but the product doesn't hold up to everyday use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I own these shirt stays in the white color and I hate them.They're great when they work correctly, but they are a very bad design. The clips do not stay clipped unless you really jam the fabric up under the loop, and even then they don't always stay where you want them. I have also found that they stretch out over a relatively short period of time (but then again, they are only $5 for a set). You get what you pay for. There's nothing quite like feeling squared away only to be walking down the hall or talking to someone important and have your shirt stay pop off and fall out the leg of your trousers.I recommend either the hidden tailor or finding another brand of shirt stay that uses a real clip rather than just a rubber/metal loop design that relies entirely on friction and constant tension."},{"rating":"1","title":"One nut check too many.","review":"After 30 minutes of wearing these I got my first nut check from one in front that snapped off.

In a field modification I will change a few things on these military shirt stays and hope that I don't hurt myself. Unfortunately I don't have many options for a refund since I need them for July 8.

The quality of the stays are average, the stitching on one elastic is unraveling, but in general the stays function well.

Kaci's version of this song has been out like forever, so what do we need with another version of the same song? I don't get why they did this. To me it seems like she just decided on Tuesday to be a pop star by Saturday. I read that some producer met her in a drug store and thought she was pretty so asked her to record this song since her dad is David Cassidy. Pretty goofy thing to do if you ask me.Maybe I'll be impressed with her voice if she like takes some singing lessons and records some new stuff instead of some old pop song nobody wants to hear anymore.

Sorry to say the only redeeming factor were the moves she gained from choreographer/performance coach Frankie Anne. Frankie appears with Katie and deserves credit for allowing us to at least enjoy the visual aspects of Katie's performance. I could see young Ms. Cassidy learning how to move and perform better over time but that did not happen with her vocals. Katie worked hard under the guidance of a pro like Frankie Anne who brings out the visual pieces of Katie's puzzle and for that I give her credit. As for her singing - - - I wouldn't drop a dime or credit to buy this recording. It seems her voice requires lots more natural talent. Try as she may, the voice is just not strong enough. Kudos Frankie Anne on making the girl LOOK HOT. David she's a cute kid but not a recording artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joke?","review":"I'm not trying to be mean to Katie but is this some joke?

My first impression is that this girl can't carry a tune in a bucket.

This girl has not only a lack of talent, but a lack of flare, and hell, a lack of anything that might make people mention her name twice.

There's hope yet for America's youth!The blame, however, should not be placed on Katie.

The murder of the Catholic sister is almost irrelavant, didn't really contribute to the main story line. The character of Father Malecki also did'nt really seem to have a purpose except as an excuse for Bora to go back to the place of the murder. This book is not a page-turner; a lot of time is spent with Bora trudging back and forth from interrogations to inspections to the apartment he shared with his fellow army officer.

A combination of whodunit, and psychological exploration of conflict of loyalties - personal, professional, idealogical. P.D. James could not have penned it better.

But if you have no idea of their dark origins, this is the book to turn to. Horus Rising sets the stage of the corruption of humanity's best warriors to an epic scale. Dan Abnett becomes the master of war in the far future when he takes you on a journey through the ranks of Space Marines, in the cockpits of enormous space battle barges and the life of civilians and warriors alike. It was time the Horus Heresy was brought to light of dedicated fans of Dawn of War and beyond, and Abnett cunningly delivers. This is a series I truly recommend, whether you are Loyalist or Heretic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Warhammer 40k book yet!","review":"I had read a few Warhammer 40k books before starting in on the Horus Heresy series (the 'Eisenhorn' trilogy, 'Let the Galaxy Burn', and 'Mechanicum'). Being familiar with Dan Abnett's style, I knew that the book would be good. I found the first two chapters to be a bit confusing - probably because many of the main characters in the series are being introduced for the first time, and the plot is complex. And the entire first half of the book seemed a bit slow. But by the second half, I was fully drawn in. By the end of the book I was blown away, and I can honestly say that the story is a work of genius. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Start","review":"I admit, I was skeptical when I heard that GW was going to take on the most important and mysterious event in the entire 40K universe. Dan Abnett has created a masterpiece! Outstanding story telling, vivid (but not overwrought) battles, wonderful dialogue start this saga off on absolutely the right foot! MCNeill and Counter have enourmous footsteps to follow in.As an aside, this book also features the best cover art I have ever seen in a 40K novel! The image of the Luna Wolves in the midst of battle is almost worth the price of admission along!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Side of the Imperium","review":"This is argueably one of the best Warhammer 40k novels I've ever read. I am a huge Dan Abnett fan and longtime Imperium fan. But to see the view of the Luna Wolves prior to the Heresy is quite insightful. Additionally there are also a few other Space Marine characteristics you learn about during the novel and a lot of insight into the Primarchs, including Warmaster Horus himself.Before the taint of Chaos and any other daemonic/spiritual entities, the Luna Wolves are escorting the Warmaster on the compliance crusade. With various encounters with other chapters and their views/differences it's amazing to see how Space Marines prior to the heresy viewed each other and battle. A few key introductions of the taint of Chaos appear throughout the novel and show just how the foulness can spread like a cancer. The ending leaves you wanting but if you're a true Space Marine or Warhammer 40k fan, you'll be reading the second and third in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining book for fans of the Warhammer 40K universe","review":"The title of my review really sums up my point. If you are a fan of the Warhammer 40K universe, you will really enjoy this book. Dan Abnett is an excellent writer with a gift for developing his characters. If you are not a fan of the Warhammer 40K universe, I would not recommend the book. The story relies on the reader being familiar with Warhammer 40K.His \\"Gaunt's Ghosts\\" series is, in my opinion, his best work. This book is also good, but it falls short in developing Horus as a person the reader can care about. Perhaps this is intentional, and given his other writings, I am inclined to believe so. The focus of the story is really on the senior Captains who advise Horus, and given the larger than life existence of the Primarchs, it is a good way to approach the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't equate the cover with the content","review":"I bought this when it came out, i've read it 2x since then and gave it away to a friend who hadn't read any 40k books.

I originally thought that they were dead relics of an age which I had no part of. On a long road trip, a buddy of mine jacked this cd in. Normally I detest live shows on cds, with the exception of S&M. However, this collection totally blew my mind. Disk two, as I now know is mostly comprised of Dark Side of the Moon, left me in total awe and even haunted by the sound. How many other bands use strange voices and sound effects like Speak To Me, Breathe, Money, or Us And Them? Definitly worth purchasing and leaving in a 5 disk changer."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST live album to EVER grace the face of the PLANET!","review":"PULSE is, quite frankly, an absolute masterpeice of an album, in EVERY respect. The sound quality is IMPECCABLE, the presentation {of the case design, with the limited edition blinking light, & the stunning cover artwork by Storm Thorgerson} is unparalleled, and the concert itself {on the video} is spectacular! This is a MUST-HAVE for anyone with any taste whatsoever in music at all. All of the songs are old pre-released ones, which is one of the major criticisms that people have with this album. But, ALL of them are significantly BETTER than the original versions. Gilmour's guitarwork is unmatched - he has never been better.

Recorded during their 1994 tour to support their then new album \\"The Division Bell\\", \\"Pulse\\" is Floyd at the top of their game, even without Roger Waters. There's tons of great performances, including an amazing set consisting of every song from \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", as well as bonechilling interpretations of \\"Cmfortably Numb\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\" and many other classic Floyd tunes. \\"Pulse\\" is definitely worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!!!!","review":"Yeah It hurts to even contemplate Floyd without Waters. This album is everything Waters and Syd Barrett were always against... Corporate Rock!Very much a nostalgia trip for the yuppy types and baby boomers.

For example, Pulse doesn't include The Dogs Of War, and Another Brick In The Wall (Part II) has a sort of The Happiest Days Of Our Lives intro. It also incudes Dark Side Of The Moon in it's entirety, which is neat-o torpedo. This also has my favorite recording of Wish You Were Here. The crowd singing along makes it very powerful-ish. If you are looking for the best Floyd album, get Is There Anybody Out There? But if you don't want that, get Ummagumma. Now if that's not what you want, get Pulse. The End."},{"rating":"1","title":"This reunion thing sucks","review":"Sad to hear Pink Floyd, without the brilliant artristic leadership of Roger Waters, not to mention Syd Barrett, releasing this clunker after so many great albums.

The music itself is technically well played but the vocals are, at best, flat and at times downright pathetic. With hokey emphasis on specific words that remind me of how perhaps a fourteen year old may sing these songs. Perhaps it is just me, but the original surreal quality of Pink I always stemmed from the almost \\"matter of fact\\" way Waters sang songs like Run like hell.

Why then, won't they release this in the manner that it was intended to be heard? That this historic surround sound recording has been reduced to this is a tragedy.

I highly reccomend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Miss the old Blindside...","review":"Lets face it: Blindside just isn't what it used to be.On this new album, they once again show how they have completely changed their style, conforming to a new more popular style of hard rock, one that I find to be more annoying then enjoyable. Sure, they'll be played by all the big networks and your every day joe will know who they are, but really, they've lost thier roots. The new sound they produce just isn't as original, and more importantly, its sound is much worse. Listen to any hard rock station and you will get this sound.I guess this is goodbye to Blindside, as I knew them.I reccomend A Thought Crushed my Mind, or self-titled."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit lacking...","review":"Blindside is good, but this album dosent cut it. the melodies are weak, and the guitar work drags along though the album.

When I first reviewed this album I gave it a horrible review. But since that time I've listened to it several times and I have had a total change of mind. This album is so emotionally charged. Its beautiful work of art. The lyrics are superb, and the music for the most part is awesome. Great album worth buying. And if by chance you don't like it at first, give it a chance to grow on you, you might just change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont you see? Its Hard and Dark!","review":"This album is just as hard as any previous Blindside album. Dont let the darker tone throw you off. 'The Great Depression' is for the serious music listener! The album is completely about rhythm... slow emotionally compelled rhythm with moods of sorrow, compassion, and desperation at its best. With this music you can expect an experimental Blindside sound that reaches deep into the soul. After a month of absorbing this cd, I would like to change my rating from 4 stars to 5. I can surely say theres definitely a lot of songs that make TGD worth buying. If you like this music i recommend Finch's new album 'Say Hello To Sunshine' and A Static Lullaby's 'Faso Latido'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay..For all those \\"hardcore\\" that want loud guitars...move on","review":"Harsh statement but true. Let me put it in nicer terms: if you want noise, loud guitars, and constant screaming...this album is not for you. Don't get me wrong though---YOU GET SOME OF THAT...NO DOUBT! But at the same time, Blindside is not here to be just another hardcore band that makes noise and gets the mosh pits going. They have passion and they care to exemplify what they feel through a musical expression. Therefore, 1) Thicken the playing of Tomas on the bass and 2) Allow the AMAZING voice range of Christian to be brought out...and this band will no doubt plant a different fire within your soul. Excellent album...but not as good as \\"Silence\\". That will be hard to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Proper Tribute To The Divas Of Hip Hop Would Be....","review":"....A CD That Includes:1.

I think that the book provides a forum to easily communicate the aspects of transracial and cross-cultural adoption to a family.

There is also a very comprehensive section on the various countries that has been useful for my mother to understand where her grandchild was born.

It views sex in a holistic manner as part of an individuals whole self rather than as merely a mechanical activity to be approached like plumbing. The chapters are concise and get right to the point without making sex appear to be rocket science. The cute drawings from the original edition remain but as a previous reviewer suspected, the photos have all been redone to fit the current popular gay media image (ie: early twentysomething twinks). ...Mitch Walkers book is brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money on this \\"book\\"","review":"As pre-Algebra is to Calculus, this book is to sex and gay relationships.

Previously I thought plot drove the reader to keep going - reading this I was driven forward by the beauty of the words that Winterson uses, sometimes not understanding, or paying attention to the action, often reading several times to revel in the flavours of her prose. I looked with regret at the dwindling number of pages as I approached the end, wanting to stay longer in the drunken, passionate language of this wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut Symmetries is Winterson at the top of her form.","review":"Winterson's writing is so powerful that when I read her books,I have a pencil and a pad of yellow \\"stick-ums\\" at my side, so I canmark particularly moving or powerful passages. My copy of Gut Symmetries is now full of yellow tags.Winterson is one of the few writers I know who can repeatedly effectively convey complex thoughts and emotions in simple, witty, powerful language. Whenever I re-read the sections of Gut Symmetries I have marked, I am awed by Winterson's ability with the language.If you have enjoyed other books by Winterson, you will enjoy this one. If you have not read Winterson before, you might try reading The Passion first. The Passion has a stronger/easier to follow story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst supposedly \\"literary\\" work I've read!","review":"I was a bit suspicious of this book after reading the back, considering how familiar some of its ideas sounded. (Anyone ever hear of Tom Stoppard?) But I thought I'd give it a shot. I should have sooner shot myself in the head! This is nothing more than a lot of mixed scientific metaphors (and let's hasten to add that Winterson's apparent understanding of much of the science is spotty -- all the worse for her characters, who are supposed to be rather gifted here) in a soap opera-like love triangle (though with MORE melodrama and histronics) rendered in a sophmorically prolix prose style, part of which is to include at least one homily per paragraph. The praise Winterson has received truly bespeaks the dearth of anything truly literary in today's publishing world. Anyway, if both Jesus and Nabokov came from the dead and begged me to read anything else by Winterson, I would not only refuse but also slap both of their faces as hard as I was able."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-modern, complex, beautiful, worth the effort.","review":"An affair. Two women. A man. Love disrobed and exposed to its multiplicitous passions, pains, and controlled recklessness. \\"What kind of woman goes to bed with another woman's husband? Answer: a worm? That might explain my invertebrate state.\\" Reading Jeannette Winterson is like picking up a broken mirror, looking in it, cutting your hands, then marvelling at how beautifully red our blood can be. Gut Symmetries is a complex work. At times you may become disoriented. You may be uncertain who's speaking. It's worth staying with it until the pieces come back together. Even when disoriented you will find a character's self-reflection cutting beautiful and deep. \\"I am not afraid of feeling but I am afraid of feeling unthinkingly. I don't want to drown.

This relates to the more obvious topic of religion and spirituality. (Religion takes a knocking, but I'll forgive her that because she's trying to be honest.) I wonder about Tristen as Christ. A virgin birth, so to speak. One who learns of his special mission - to save. I'm betting Dragons involves a crucifixion. Is the grey space - prayer? I'm also thinking of the Tempest, in which Prospero must relinquish his power (Ariel) and embrace his shadow (Caliban, whom, at the close of the play, he invites into his home.) Is Tristen's shadow - Orien??? What a pregnant thought, even if the pregnant one is her twin sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series is getting worse","review":"Truthfully, Owls was a bit more interesting than Eagles, but then, it could hardly help but be. I persevered through 400 pages of Eagles because I'd loved Fortress in the Eye of Time so much. Surely Owls would be the good strong cup of coffee this series needed. It wasn't. Owls was a somewhat faster and had a little more action than Eagles. It probably would have merited a higher rating from me if it hadn't followed the yawn-fest that was Eagles. Eagles and Owls could easily have been combined into one smaller book than either is separately, and with no loss to the continuing story. So disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to CJ's SF","review":"After an auspicious beginning (\\"Fortress in the Eye of Time\\") this series has dragged; this third in the series is the worst, really unfinishable. All of the intrigue gets to be rather precious after a while, and the main characters can't really hold their own in the midst of it. If you really want a great CJ Cherryh series check out her latest sf offering, \\"Precursor,\\" which may be the finest thing she's ever written (including \\"Cyteen\\"!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excuisitely detailed and developed plot and characters","review":"I will begin by stating that while book can stand on its own, but I do not recommend reading it out of context with the rest of the series.I greatly enjoyed the development of the Tristen in this book. There is little external 'action', most of it is internal -- we see him struggling with the Other, in this case, his former self/identity. In the first book, the Other was Mauryl's enemy. In the second book, the Other was Cefwyn's political opponents. But in this book, the Other is Tristen himself.In some ways, Tristen is like Robert Jordan's Rand al'Thor, though with less internal conflict, and certainly a good deal more originality.CJ Cherryh is one of the most versatile authors out there. She writes evocative fantasy and disturbing hard-core sci-fi with equal credibility. \\"Fortress of Owls\\" is of the same high caliber I have come to expect of all her works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a little excitement","review":"There is such a thing as going into a little too much detail and this book crossed that line. One of the other readers managed to write a critical review and make it sound like a praise. I, however, do not posses that talent.I don't usually mind political intrigue or things of that nature but they need to be balanced with some actually interesting events.(There is only so much introspection I can stand before becoming bored out of my mind.) The character development was, of course, interseting (up to a point) but frankly I don't think Cherryh should have bothered writing this book. Mixed it in with the next one maybe but as it stands I am glad I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fortress of Yawns","review":"18 pages of italicized 'history' sets the tone for this boring book.

The result is a dictionary with entries that have more depth than the usual \\"quick hits\\" that other symbolism dictionaries give you. Chevalier is not afraid to give contradictory or contrasting meanings of icons. (He is not a universalist, but a relativist.) He is usually careful to identify the culture in which a particular meaning is given. I keep this in easy reach on my bookshelf, reminding myself, however, that no dictionary on this subject can possibly cover all the meanings a symbol may have. It is worth having around."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dictionary of Words","review":"I can not comprehend how this book got published without a single symbol illustration.

Liungman's Dictionary of Symbols. It has illustrations, groupings, big print and everything!

It does not work on the more common Schrader valves. It does not adequately depress the pin in the stem of the Schrader valve to allow air to flow into the tire. In addition, the on-board air pressure guage was woefully inaccurate. When I checked tires using a variety of alternative pressure guages, I found them to be significantly more inflated than the air guage on the pump had indicated.Bottom line: it's an expensive pump and it doesn't work.

Within one year, the gauge read 20 lbs too high (read 20 lbs. with no pressure) and the plastic piece that holds the handle to the pump broke at one of the hinge points. The pump was well taken care of and never abused. Topeak no longer has a contact number and won't respond to emails about buying replacement parts. These pumps are overpriced and are throw-aways when something breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Cannot Recommend this Product","review":"I bought this Topeak JoeBlow Pro Floor Bike Pump in 2009. Within a year a component needed replacing. I called Topeak. They said they would send me a new part.....as soon as it was produced. They would NOT send me a full replacement. So I actually used an old falling apart pump until Topeak produced the component, which took a few weeks. That alone is pretty poor customer service and does not say much for their product. Now...today....the part of the pump that attaches to the tire broke. Its out of warranty. This pump was expensive. It was NOT worth the money. Background on me: I'm a 60+ year old who loves biking. I've never written a review before. I hate to see people throw away their money. I'm back to my old falling apart pump. It works after 15 years. Its ugly, though...and cost me much less than Mr. Blow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality has gone downhill","review":"I had a Topeak for several years and when it finally died I bought another.

Bought in May '09, the valve broke yesterday (won't seal, plus pin fell out). Was only used on Presta valves, was used about 3 times a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well designed, does what I need","review":"After checking online reviews at Bicycling magazine, Road Bike Review, and Mountain Bike Review, I narrowed my list down to 5 pumps. I set a price limit of $75 and wanted features to make my bicycle maintenance easier, e.g., a pressure dial closer to my eyes, easy switching between presta and schrader valves, a long hose, and a hose head that feels solid and has a firm locking mechanism. The pressure relief button was a welcomed surprise. I also wanted to purchase from a known manufacturer with a good record. I have a Topeak Alien tool and I love it.So far the pump meets my needs and I would buy it again, would also recommend it to a friend. The only unknown so far is durability. For how many years will it continue to work well? I had my last floor pump for 20 years.The only improvement I would like to see is a double barrel version so each stroke has a greater volume of air. Perhaps more expensive models offer this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice pump, good customer service","review":"This pump is very well made and met my expectations, which were high given the excellent ratings this pump has received here and at other online sites.I had the opportunity to use Topeak's customer service line for what I thought was going to be a warranty claim. It turned out there's a threaded plastic nut that sits on top of the housing that holds the gauge, right where the shaft of the pump enters. That nut wasn't tight and the housing was loose, causing air to leak out when the pump was used. Tightening that nut secured the housing back in place and stopped the leakage of air.Dick, the customer service rep, was friendly, patient and knowledgeable of the product. I recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a high quality pump that supports both type of valves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive But Short Lived","review":"Worked properly on only about 60% of bike or car tires. Would not depress tire valves enough to pump air into the other 40% of tires. For those tires that it worked on it did a nice job. After about a year of infrequent use (maybe used one a month) the pump would no longer form an airtight seal on any valve stem. A cheap Bell bike pump costing 1/4 what this cost works on all tires and has lasted twice as long so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Finger Eating, Arm Workout Of A Pump","review":"I bought this pump with high hopes of it lasting forever and being easy to get up to high pressure. My first lesson learned was that the flip valve (that secures the pump on your tire) releases VERY quickly (read: the greater the pressure, the more power behind the release. I had fingernails snap back behind the quick, bruising on the fingers, etc). I quickly learned to steer clear of this, and thought I could live with the pump.Now (this is only two months after purchase), it won't get a good seal and will only easily inflate to 60 psi. The rest of the way to 120 psi is a race (who will win first - the leaking seal, or my arms, flapping wildly to try and inflate the tire). And I thought I wanted to get a workout on my bike. Perhaps I need to reassess my desires to: 1) arm work to exhaustion and sweating before getting on the bike, 2) leg work on bike. Or: I will get another pump. This is one for the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"JoeBlow Pro Pump SmartHead Fails - Again","review":"I bought this pump because the pressure gauge is mounted at the top of the air cylinder where it is easy to see while pumping, which is a very nice feature. However, within a year the so called SmartHead (takes both Presta and Schraeder valves without adjustment) failed. The locking lever pivot pin popped out and air leaked out of the pressure head near the pivot point. Re-seating the pin did not fix the problem. I contacted Topeak and they sent me a new SmartHead. It worked for a while, but this morning it failed again. The failure mechanism was exactly the same. There must be s serious design flaw in the SmatHead. I am now seeing this same failure being reported in other on-line reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"Worked very well for several months, then would not form a seal.

Will not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first","review":"I really liked this pump at first. I check my tire pressure every time I ride so this pump got used 5-6 times a week. It's a home pump only. I wasn't crazy about how top heavy it is, but that's a minor issue.I'm rating it one star because the pin in the head loosened and the only customer support I got was an offer to sell me another one. The new one is now failing in the same way so I'm guessing it's a design issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with others, doesn't last.","review":"I bought this pump over others based on the reviews here. Let me now add mine. Bought in March 2012. The pump worked fine for a few months, now will not seal on a presta valve. I will get in touch with Topeak, but I would discourage you from wasting your time with this one.Update 10/07/12: So I called Topeak and they were kind enough to send me a new head for the pump. Tried it on my presto valve with the appropriate adaptor, leaked terribly. Adjusted the head, pumped furiously, just flattened the tire. This pump is not worth 70 dollars and Topeak is not worth dealing with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating !","review":"I'd swear the foot on this pump is engineered to have the pump tip over/fall onto the pressure gauge. The head clamp lever springs closed so hard it will blister your finger. I've had this pump for two years and the gauge is off 10 psi too high at 110 psi. While it pumps up tires well, it just isn't ergo friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs under pressure...!","review":"I use this on my Cyclocross bike, mountain bike, and my kids bikes, so this thing gets used often. Too often.Pros: It's amazingly smooth in operation. So smooth that sometimes I'm worried it's not pumping... but it is, and fast. It has no trouble in the 120PSI range at all, pumping at only a slightly higher resistance. The construction is superb, mostly metal construction, with a easily readable dial. It includes a needle for sports balls and medicine balls and works well there too. The hose is unusually long, which makes usability absolutely awesome. It handles Presta and Schrader valves without issues... and it does not allow leakage upon lock and unlock, which I've never really seen before!Cons: I miss having one head for both Presta and Schrader. If you only use presta, which is the default on this unit, than life is good. but you have to swap adapters to get the Schrader going."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waste your money","review":"Did my research but it did not help in the end. Product is poorly designed and not durable. I hate a pump that falls over so easily. Also it was a chore to pull off of the valve everytime. I felt as if I was going to tear out my valve stem. It never got better. Three months in, air would just blow out the nozzle when I locked it on the stem. Feed up with poor quality topeak products, I bent pump in half and sent it to the to trash with my last Topeak Joe Blow.

Accurate guage with adjustable setting marker up close where you can easily see it, convenient hose storage, handle clip, and accessory holder. Comfortable handle and foot rests. Good size base, so it doesn't tip over easily. Fairly easy to use smarthead lock. Takes quite a few pumps to fill tire from 60-80 lbs; however, it is easy to pump. If it holds up over time, it will be worth the money. Thanks to Amazon, free shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels almost as solid as my old Silca, but with more features","review":"I've only had this pump for about a month, but I'm happy with it.

The pump itself is very well made and better than the picture. It was nothing to inflate my tires to 120psi, and the handle is very comfortable to use as well.

It's also just about the newest of the major musical instruments, dating from 1843 when Adolphe Sax built the first one.This book is basically a love affair with the Sax. It's part history, part stories, part nostalgia for the greats of the past, part just plain good writing about a thing the author clear loves. The author is a professional journalist, an amateur musician and he has combined these two interests together in this book.It's an easy and delightful read. It's kind of fun to have a book like this that is something other than how much one political party hates the other, the war, oil prices and all the other things that you see getting published today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little sax is a good thing","review":"This was a very enjoyable book to read.

Sam Rivers? These are people who developed new extended techniques for saxophone and cannot be ignored in a book as comprehensive as this one purports to be.Ornette in the list of people that (Charles) Parker moved to tenor? (I am aware that Ornette has played tenor, but come on folks, Ornette is most known for his alto playing. He probably has recorded his trumpet more than he has on tenor.)Dismisses Sun Ra as a \\"space cadet\\"?Sorry, we cannot take Mr. Segall seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sax Appeal","review":"Michael Segell's book on the story of the instrument I play, the saxophone, is a real page-turner, like a good novel that you can't put down. Unlike other tomes on the saxophone, Segell has taken more of a chatty, non-academic approach and interspersed between the fascinating study and interviews with some of the greats on the saxophone, is his own story of learning to play himself. This adds an extra dimension to the study and Segell comes across like your best friend, you really care how his playing is going and you feel by the end of the book that you know him personally.Segell's section on the trials and tribulations of Adolphe Sax, although much already known by this reviewer is nevertheless interesting and comes across like a report in a newspaper, getting to the nitty gritty of the atempted murder of Sax.I have no hesitation in recommnending this book to my fellow musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil's Horn","review":"This is the best book I've read yet, concerning the actual saxophone and its characteristics.

I needed this for work and what arrived was the MPEP - Manual of Patent Examination Procedure, which was not written by Horwitz but is a Government publication composed of 2 volumes of rules--not a forms manual with rule citations. I wrote the seller and he asked me to send him the bar code off the volume I received. I haven't done that yet, but this book is going back. My firm signed me up for an available Lexis Nexis slot, so I now have access to the multi-volume Horwitz references and can do my job. When you get something for NOTHING, it's most likely NOTHING.

Either way, it works for any song. Plus, if you are the type, take it to any sporting event and have fun with it. This appears to be very well-made and should last forever, although I don't expect the black finish to hold up forever after the beating I will put it through. Who cares? It's a cowbell! Beat the hell out of it, and get the Meinl beater to go along with it, as I expect it to last a lot longer than a regular drumstick. So far, so good.

I prefer a deeper cowbell, more of a tonk tonk tonk vs. a tink tink tink, so I will probably get a taller one and give this one to my little brother(because let's face it - a small cowbell is better than no cowbell).So...my advice is get a bigger one! 6 to 7\\" should be perfect.I'VE GOT A FEVER BABY, AND THE ONLY PRESCRIPTION IS MORE COWBELL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CHILDHOOD V.

I found that it is a must read for new fathers and some older sons to ensure that they do not make some of the same mistakes that my father, as well as others made and understand \\"sharing of emotions\\".

We really like the compactness (since we have 1 year old twins, we need all the space we can get!). The girls seem to like being able to sit closer to each other than they did in their high chairs, exchanging food, drinks, etc. We are using it as a high chair now, but I like the fact that it can be used as a booster as well. The product itself was very affordable, but I was disappointed in the shipping costs that Amazon charges.

It details not one rivetting account, but several harrowing events that possibly give the reader a better idea about who Simpson really is... at a party and on the mountain.Cliche in that it joins other climber's autobiographies on the bookshelf, but strongly needed after we kept scratching our heads in \\"Touching the Void\\" and asking: who is this guy anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly enjoyable read","review":"Although the story is not as dramatic as his \\"Touching the Void\\", the writing style is better and Joe gives us an inside on his life and his climbing.

I was therefore full of expectations when I bought \\"This Game Of Ghosts\\" and although Mr Simpson has a nice writing, I could not take his fascination about death.

Adults and older children will enjoy the detailed work necessary for coloring these Mother Goose rhymes.

Well, there are no tigers in Africa, so I guess you took it from somewhere else, mon.I don't want my kids told lies about their African heritage, there is enough truth.

The lack of character development is the most obvious. More time is spent on the city of Prague than anything else, and unfortunately this does not give much insight to the main players in the book. The few flashbacks and memories are lost among the city scape. More often than not, the reader is left in the dark as the story moves on. More than once a character will say something completely out of the 16th century context, making it very difficult to 'get into' the story. The book is very slow moving and the ending disappointing. It seems to end at the long awaited climax with an abrupt \\"everyone lives happily ever after\\" paragraph. I was hoping for more after reading the description on the inside cover. However all of the things which made the book sound interesting comprised about a line or two at most within the actual story. In general, a waste of precious reading time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of Splendor is splendid!","review":"I'd never been to Prague until I read Frances Sherwood's novel The Book of Splendor set there in 1601. Now I feel I lived there four centuries ago thanks to her vivid rendering of the city and its inhabitants both real and imaginary. Sherwood has a way of building with detail so that the reader becomes completely surrounded by the entire construct: floors, walls, ceilings, exteriors, interiors. The small literary circle I belong to chose this book and though historical fiction is usually not my cup of tea, I found it a fast-paced, lively read. One friend whose hobby is East European history and who has spent lots of time in Prague during the last ten years was impressed with its historical and geographical accuracy. I found the heroine charming and the story which cleverly includes the myth of the Golem very engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of Avram Davidson","review":"If you liked Avram Davidson, you'll probably like this, too.

The Jewish community was close knit and some of the rituals described were some that were not well known. The relationship between the heroine and the Golem were interesting and the way the Rabbi used the Golem to obtain things for his community were interesting. It reminded me of a story I heard many years ago which was an early TV play in the late 1940s, about a Golem. Frances Sherwood is a terrific writer and her prose is very beautifully relayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fantasy at its best","review":"I read about this book in a review in the Washington Post, while I was on vacation.

The characters are so real and developed and the setting so well defined that I can't wait to see what happens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"This book was disappointing, not only were there too many characters to follow, the historic picture of Prague in 1601 was not believable. The attempt by the author to bring magical realism into the story if half-hearted, and completely ridiculous. Maybe with a little more background on Jewsih Mysticism this could be integral to the book, but it just seems to be stuck in for the convenience of the story. If you are really interested in 1600's Prague, don't read this. If you are really interested in Jewish Mysticism, don't read this. If you are looking for a good historical fiction read, don't read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak, woody","review":"The problem with this film is a very weak script. Some of the scenes truly seem to be written in five minutes; in fact, most of the first half of the film seems as if it were written in one sitting, one afternoon. Nothing funny, nothing clever, nothing to give the scene anything. Talk about a film that needed a subplot or two -- not to mention a few more drafts. Or maybe a nude scene with Hayley."},{"rating":"1","title":"rent it only","review":"Lot of people seem to argue for or against this movie based on it being another Woody Allen movie. If you were to show this movie to a person without telling who the director is, I would venture that almost no one will guess the director. There's nothing about this movie to distinguish it. Ewan and Colin does ok work (Colin is definitely better) but Tom Wilkinson is totally wasted. Ewan will never be a great actor (name one outstanding performance) and Colin Farrell is way better in \\"In Bruges\\" besides that being a much better movie. For supposedly a family tragedy film, the movie lacks any real tension and feels strained in it's attempt to convey any melodrama. You may be mildly amused but don't waste your time and money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Woody, Sidney Lumet Did It Better","review":"What happens when two veteran directors make two similarly themed movies, each focusing on two brothers planning the perfect crime? Predictably, in each case, it all goes horribly wrong. However, only in Sidney Lumet's \\"Before the Devil Knows Your Dead,\\" is that a good thing. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke (along with Albert Finney and Marisa Tomei) make Lumet's botched robbery caper consistently intriguing and suspenseful. In the case of Woody Allen's \\"Cassandra's Dream,\\" the brothers-in-crime story is botched in every way imaginable -- with a disastrous script and wooden performances by Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell. The plots and the packaging are similar. But one you will remember. The other you'll want to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cassandra's Nightmare","review":"Cassandra's Dream is the worst Woody Allen movie I've ever seen. The acting appeared forced and the story was so drawn out that halfway through it, I was still wondering what the plot was. I could not relate to any of the characters and the story seemed too far-fetched to be believable. I kept telling myself there had to be some fantastic twist at the end. When it was over, I thought, huh, that was it?I admit to being biased and preferring Woody Allen's New York movies but I am not picky - I really do love nearly everything he's ever made. In fact, I own the whole collection. I am also into his music and have seen him in concert.

This movie was just plain stupid. I have no idea what he was aiming at with this movie. No complaints about the acting or technicals, it was just a poorly thought out script. I kept thinking how could two guys be so stupid. They can't. It's just some guy's idea of what two brothers would be like.Evidently Woody Allen can still get a job based on his name alone. I had a feeling through the whole film of why am I watching this crap but I kept hanging on thinking there must be something, some kind of payoff for having sat through all the boredom.There wasn't. I probably should have given it another star because the actors did a fine job with what they had to work with but I'm afraid that might encourage someone to waste and hour and a half of their life on this thing.I was really glad when the movie was over. I'll know to avoid Woody Allen in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"A great movie!

The Christmas album gives the listener a real sense of the true meaning of the holiday! The selections are very good, with familiar and no-so-familiar tunes spaced evenly. John McDermott, Anthony Kearns and Ronan Tynan are in wonderful voice, as we have come to expect. I hope they make a video of this material and tour with it (back to Chicago, of course!)

Highlights: Anthony Kearns' \\"Sweet Little Jesus Boy,\\" sung acapella to perfection; John McDermott's \\"Away In A Manger\\" - so tenderly sung, it brings a tear to the eye; \\"O Holy Night\\" by all three is the most powerful and beautiful version of that Christmas favorite that I have ever heard; the arrangements by Frank McNamara are filled with surprises that will lift these Christmas standards above the ordinary.

There is plenty of interesting stuff about the usual Seattle stuff (Ivar's, the M's and Seahawks, the grunge music scene, Microsoft, Starbucks, Amazon.com, etc.) but it's all over the place. This book needed serious editing and more focus on what exactly the author wanted to say about Seattle.

The romantic tension between Lemont and Susan is obvious, however, I find their tolerence of C-Dog more than a little interesting.

It is a journey across and through the world of hope, sadness, and redemption. This is what I felt with this score as well as in the wonderful movie. Again, David Lynch is a man who can bring so many different moods into film, and Angelo is is muscial guide. Enjoy the tour through the fields and backroads!

But back to this CD, this is right up there with anything by Ennio Morricone or John Barry. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more recognition. This is as good as the Twin Peaks stuff but shows a maturing by both composer and the director...trust me you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie and soundtrack","review":"This music is suited so well to the movie.

We found it dated, disjointed and not particularly cute. Audrey Hepburn is always beautiful -- even when covered with dirt. The locations were lovely. The DVD quality was fine. We found the multiple time shifts a bit too disjointing without adequate anchoring.

Audrey Hepburn displays her strongest acting, Albert Finney is wonderful, the writing is witty and truthful, and the Mancini music fits the movie perfectly. Donen creates a story that bears repeat viewing, cutting back and forth among the different time periods in the Wallaces' life.The most annoying thing about the video is that it is not letterboxed, so you know you're missing out on part of the picture. When will this outstanding film be given the treatment it deserves? DVD, widescreen, and hopefully commentary by Stanley Donen himself.

The 1966 fashions, the local, and the switchbacks in the time line make this a real enjoyable movie. Albert Finney is SO young and shows his early acting chops that make him the star he is today. Audrey Hepburn is her usual beautiful self, taking me back to my boyhood when I was so in love with her then and miss her radiance today. Well, and then there is the Henry Mancini score, which will go on in your mind long after the movie ends. William Daniels is also great as the efficiency expert trying to enjoy a vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you...","review":"This is one of those movies that really grows on you as it progresses. At first, I found the interactions between Mark and Joanne very stilted and superficial (the whole passport gag got so overdone it was ridiculous). But as we got to know each character better, I began to identify with characteristics in each one. By the end of the movie, even my boyfriend was watching with rapt attention. As the credits rolled, he turned to me and said, \\"That's you and me!\\"And it's true because it's a timeless story with a timeless theme. People change, and to be able to change in step with another person is a hard thing. Two for the Road is a very frustrating movie to watch because you end up identifying with one character but seeing the other character's point, thus realizing that you actually understand your spouse/significant other's point of view when you don't really want to. Bravo Mr. Donen for such an enduring film. Bravo Ms. Hepburn and Mr. Finney for showing us ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"a movie about people","review":"If one is sick of or has out grown star wars this is movie to get.

Director Stanley Donen whips up a masterful cinematic soufflé here, folding in a sophisticated script by Frederick Raphael, a generous helping of Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn, and topping it all off with a real cherry of a score by the great Henry Mancini. Donen follows the travails of a married couple over the years of their relationship, by constructing a series of non-linear flashbacks and flash-forwards (a structural device that has been utilized since by other filmmakers, but rarely as effectively). While ostensibly a \\"romantic comedy\\", Two For the Road is, at its heart, a thoughtful meditation on the nature of love and true commitment. Finney and Hepburn have great on-screen chemistry (and both were at the peak of their physical beauty-which doesn't hurt). Colorful European locales provide additional icing on the cake. This is one of those films (like The Way We Were) that some people form an emotional bond with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WINNER ALL THE WAY","review":"Winnigly directed by DONEN,TWO FOR THE ROAD is full of beautiful vignettes and anecdotes that makes most couples everyday's life.The film shows what a film can do with a simple meaningful story ,and what a director can do if he is gifted and has a way with the visuals aspect of a motion picture.The casting of HEPBURN AND FINNEY works in a splendid way and is a perfect romantic pairing.

This 1960's film tries way too hard be \\"modern\\" as it looks at the trials and tribulations of married life. It has no point of view beyond its bell-bottomed, trendy cynicism.

Only 15 minutes into the film and any attempt at humor becomes a trite waste of time. Her relationship with Finney is never well established or meaningful and leads to one boring scene after another. She must have been ashamed after this bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audrey - Spectacular as always. Finney - Argggghhh!","review":"After purchasing this I have only been able to watch it once. Audrey Hepburn is my favorite all time actor/actress and she (Joanna in this) is brilliant as always. However, Albert Finney's roll (Mark), charactor and performance is in stark contrast. The further the movie goes the more I disliked Mark and was angry that Joanna was putting up with him. Mark's charactor is over the top and unbeliveable. Five stars Audrey, minus four Albert."},{"rating":"1","title":"......... dull and depressingly dreary","review":"During my viewing, I hung in there with \`Two for the Road' for what seemed like hours. It couldn't have gone on nearly as long as it felt: the DVD jacket promises a merciful \`finita' after one hundred and eleven minutes. Waiting for it, I couldn't remember time hanging that b-o-r-i-n-g-l-y heavy since my high school sixth period Latin class. I refused to give up on it, entertaining the notion there would emerge some semblance of a plot...... like \`it simply can't go on and on and on like this without something happening sooner of later.......\\" Well, it did and it does. How the most photogenic and stunningly beautiful actress on earth (Audrey Hepburn) couldn't manage a film possessing a plot is incomprehensible.It is, however, a film of distinction. It is the first I have had that found it's way into a garbage can immediately upon its initial viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"Undoubtedly Hepburn's most accomplished performance but ironically, one of her least known films. This has been my favourite film for many years not least because of the memories it brings back of family driving holidays in France. Finney is miscast and a bit clumsy but the evocative music and sharp script lift it above such minor problems. This is Hepburn's film, however, and she should have been Oscar nominated for this rather than her other 1967 movie, Wait Unitl Dark. For someone criticised for being a limited actress, she somehow manages to express the gamut of emotions ranging from a naive young girl to an embittered wife. She is exquisite. This movie should be watched by all hopeless romantics on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Preferably with someone you love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two For the Road is a down-to-earth movie...","review":"I like this movie because you can see Audrey Hepburn as a normal every day woman.

Here, however, the match is awkward, and not helped by a fairly witless script and an overall lack of coherence. The thin plot is terribly structured, meandering here and there at a deathly pace, and ending up nowhere in particular.The combination seemed great: Donen directing Hepburn with a snazzy score by easy listening giant Henry Mancini; It was never meant to be, however. This reviewer was left sorely disappointed, wondering where the last two hours of his life had vanished to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 1967 Vogue Photo Shoot....Not a Movie","review":"The locations, the clothes, Audrey's hair - they all look fabulous.

And, god forbid I should say this, but Audrey Hepburn is just horrible in this movie.

But don't even think of buying it without reading the original \\"Kiss and Tell\\" first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"This book really wasn't necessary. I'm sure Gordon wanted to cash in more on the success of the first book(which I found enjoyable) but really didn't have any more Ace stories. So instead we get 300 pages of internet chatter, transcripts from interviews that he had done to promote the first book and 30 pages of royalty information for some of Ace's songs from Kiss. He snipes at a couple of haters, and ends the book with a big F-you to Ace. Some of the stuff is interesting, and their are a couple of new stories from guest writers. I really think this should have been put on a web site. It would make an interesting footnote to the first book, but on its own, it is not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things we don't care about...","review":"That's what this book is about... things we don't really care... and by the way... how many reviews had been written up by GG up here do you think? hehe..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tale of a loser who met a rock star","review":"The author has once again decided to subject us to tales of how his life was empty without humiliating himself in front of Ace Frehley, the successful lead guitarist of the successful band KISS. Gebert has an axe to grind and embarasses himself grinding it. The book is a collection of humilating annecdotes that are intended to make Frehley look bad, but actually make Gebert look bad by putting with all of this alleged garbage. Save some money, and get the same thing by buying the enquirer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the first book, read that one first....","review":"I love KISS & Tell. It's one of the funniest books I've ever read. If you really get into the first book, you will also enjoy reading KISS & Tell More! Gordon has a great talent to draw you into his world and entertain you. I also enjoyed his other book, Rock and Roll War Stories, and can not wait to read his next book. A very talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bits","review":"These bits are a joke. I spent 45 minutes trying to drill a hole in a stone and only managed a hole about 1/16 inch deep. I used 3 different bits to do this. They were a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Wish I had scrolled down to read the reviews before buying. These bits are weaker than any home depot special i have ever picked up. They might be able to make a dent in softened butter, but don't waste your time on anything strong enough to actually require the use of a power drill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"My almost 6-year-old found this movie extremely boring. The witch was an odd addition to a Christmas movie as was the rough treatment of a child by the police. The animation was not what you would expect from this studio and was very poorly done. Even the music fell short of what most have come to expect from animated Christmas movies. There are so many wonderful Christmas movies for children, but this one was a disappointment. I would not recommend this movie for any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL, THE HITS KEEP COMING........ OZZY IS A SHOWMAN","review":"When this album came out in 1995 I didn't expect much of it and didn't really pay to much attention to it until almost two years later when I was thrilled to discover that it was a REALLY GOOD album.ALMOST A CLASSIC amongst older Ozzy albums, but not quite. First of all, PERRY MASON is ok, but its kind of lame for an opening song. JUST WANT YOU is excellent, with the low key vocals, this works for me. GHOST BEHIND is a ballad worth listening to THUNDER UNDERGROUND is the first song that I'm iffy about, and then you get a three hole punch with SEE YOU, TOMMOROW, and DENIAL. Those three being the highlight of the album. After that the rest is just filler. That is why I can't give this one five stars. However it is VERY GOOD. Ozzy in the nineties established himself as a regular showman.5 songs out of 10 are guaranteed gems, the other 5 are your callTODAYS LESSON: Dont believe them when they tell you, you'd be better off dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music, Energy","review":"As far as I am concerned the only realy good song on this CD is the opener,\\"Perry Mason\\" That I have played a number of times. The others are typical Ozzy.Don't get me wrong though, The other songs are very well sung and are worthy of the master."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak album for Ozzy","review":"Don't believe what you read from Johnny come lately's with pathetic \\"Ozzy rocks!\\" exclamations. Of course Ozzy rocks, that's why you are reading this, instead of a review of a Bee Gee's album, which gets -2,000,000 stars in my book.It's as simple as this: Ozzy should have left us with No More Tears. This album was not necessary and is overall flat with the exception of good songs such as, Perry Mason, Thunder Underground, and My Jeckyll Doesn't Hyde, which still would have been left on the floor if proposed for No More Tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched!","review":"Oh, come on people! Aside from a couple of the reviewers, thus far, everyone has had good or great things to say about this disc. This album is horrid! This is what happens when Sharron Osborne,(Ozzy's wife/manager) gets too involved in his music. This is the most degrading piece of schlock Ozzy has ever put out. It makes \\"Bark at the Moon\\" look like a landmark epic! When I saw Ozzy on the first Ozzfest, when he was touring in support of this album, he did ONE song off of this and the rest of the night's performance was filled with Sabbath songs. That should tell you what Ozz himself thinks about this release.Do yourself a favor, either buy anything from \\"Ultimate Sin\\" and back, or go check out some Metal bands which are truly carrying the torch for this genre such as In Flames, Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, or Nevermore. Leave \\"Ozzmosis\\" in the warehouse where it belongs... to gather dust and decompose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing!","review":"Very dissapointing album by one of the godfathers of metal(Blizzard of ozz,what a memory!)The man's voice is so bad that I can't even think how it would sound live.The songs are very weak,I don't think that there is at least 1 song who rocks hard on this album.Forget this album right now and go get the best live album ever from a metal band:Dio's inferno the last in live.You'll see on there how's a real metal voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ozzy's Worst by Far","review":"I don't know what version of Ozzmosis can top Diary of a Madman or Blizzard of Oz but it certainly wasn't the copy that I picked up. As a long time Black Sabbath and Ozzy fan I was very disappointed with this album. I even rate many of the 80's Sabbath albums higher than this. Ozzy sounds very uninspired on most of the tracks and Zakk sounds like he is trying to fill a contractual obligation. Most songs plod along with an overproduced sound and the formula for all of them is similar. Even Geezer's bass and songwriting credit cannot save most tunes. Personally I believe that whomever was destined to tour in support of the album should've played guitar on this one. The sound is muddled and the songs lack the power of previous Ozzy classics. Do yourself a favor and buy any of the previous Ozzy albums and leave this one alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who do we want on the case? Zakk Wylde!","review":"Zakk wylde was on several Ozzy records. I am not sure if this is his first. Nevertheless, Perry Mason is one of my favorite Ozzy tracks and Zakk kills it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this album","review":"I really love this disk, it's solid from start to finish. I know the same old same old \\"it's not Randy , Oz sold out...Bla Bla Bla.. This album is personel and solid and Zakk kicks ass on this with awsome meaningful lyrics and great guitar and bass. It is not Diary of a Madman, It is a good solid rock n roll album. I have been an ozzy fan for 35 years and seen him live several times, I love Zakk and I loved Randy not a fan of Bark at the moon , I think it's weak and so was Jake E lee, Ultimate Sin was pretty good but in my opinion this is way better. Perry Mason is not my favorite but every track after that is Solid it plyed straight thru and will be doing so for a long time.If you really Like Ozzy and are a Fan of Sabbath you will apperciate this Disk. If you are one of the crying sell out crazy babies, it aint for you.I was really happy to hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"F\\" ING HARDCORE!!","review":"HARD, SLUDGY, DARK, and LOUD!! with some outstanding POWER BALLADS!! Just the way we like our OZZY!! A great recording and one of OZZY's BEST!! The haters are wrong about this album.Sample it for yourself. TURN UP YOUR SPEAKERS FIRST!!ENJOY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozzy, The Lighter side.","review":"This is an extreamly inquisitive albumn. He really shows a side of his on this albumn that is not found anywhere else. If you are a true Ozzy fan, which i know you are this deffinitly needs to be added into your collection. i have owned probably 90% of all his albumns i have lost a couple, but never to have bought them again. this one i know a friend who has it and i dont know when im getting it back. so i went ahead and ordered another copy because i miss it so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozzy Has Done It Again!","review":"The Ozzman has showed us the soft but yet rockin side of rock n roll. The soft vocals on see you on the other side but the rockin vocals on denial. He has shown me the light that is Ozzy. I would reccomend this CD to all the Ozzman fans out there! Trust me it is sooooo cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"The music on these songs had potential but Ozzy had to screw it up by writing poor lyrics. He is not a lyricist whatsoever. Geezer Butler was. Don't buy this rubbish. Early Ozzy albums are a must though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ozzy Album Ever!","review":"Generally speaking, if the first song on an album is the one you're looking for, it's a safe bet that the rest of the album is mostly filler. Ozzmosis is no exception.Perry Mason and See You on the Other Side are, in my opinion, the only worthwhile songs on this album. Most fans would probably add I Just Want You to the list.The point is, out of this album's ten songs, there are, at most, three good ones, and 30% is a low success rate.The good news is, Perry Mason, See You on the Other Side, and I Just Want You are all available on Essential Ozzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Ozzy Fare","review":"Although it might not have been the world-beater Ozzy and Sharon would have liked at the time of its release, this is a great Ozzy album that has aged quite well.It's supposed to be a much more 'introspective' Ozzy album, hence the change in logo, but basically with Randy Castillo and Zakk Wilde in tow, he's just made a more abstract album with balls. The riffs are unbeatable, the vocal delivery is formidable, and the production is peerless.A few of the tunes (\\"See You On The Other Side\\", \\"I Just Want You\\") use vocal multi-tracking to attain this godlike sound that even Ozzy hasn't been able to capture since it's release. Totally worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very mixed.","review":"The older albums sounded very much like the 80's, This album came out 95' and the sound is total opposite. Heavy drumms and heavy bass are allways good but the bassdrums on this album sounds very plastic. The guitars are also badley mixed. Way to screamy and to discant registered. But if you look to the songs on this cd it isn't that bad. Most of the songs are pretty dull with much heavy midtempo, unengaging choruses and phsychadelic echoing guitars. But on the other hand some songs are just sooo good! Like the bombastic album opener Perry Mason, Ultra cool I just wan't you, The calm and beatiful See you on the other side and finally Old LA Tonight. Well I can't really recomend this cd because you'll have to skip most of the songs each time you listen to it. Download the songs I recomended instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not his best, I assure you that!!!","review":"THis is not Ozzy's best album, no way, pal!!! THe sound here is flat and industrial, very strange. Below, the list of Ozzy's best studio albuns, in my opinion:1) BLIZZARD OF OZZ (the ultimate masterpiece)2) DIARY OF A MADMAN3) NO MORE TEARS (best album with Zakk Wylde)4) BARK AT THE MOON5) DOWN TO EARTH6) NO REST FOR THE WICKED7) OZZMOSIS8) THE ULTIMATE SIN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, Not Great","review":"Ozzy himself said that this was \\"a lazy album\\", and indeed it is. However, a lazy album from Ozzy Osbourne is better than the best work of lesser bands, so this album is actually pretty good. Not on par with Blizzard or No More Tears by any stretch of the imagination, but good. Perry Mason is an excellent song. Thunder Underground and See You On The Other Side are good, thundering songs. I Just Want You has some excellent lyrics. The rest of the songs are decent or filler, but overall not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"So What Else Is New?","review":"I measure success for a heavy metal musician in terms of crunch. This man was well into his 40's when he did this cd. I can't think of too many 40somethings that can rock this hard, especially after years of drinking and drugging. Probably his most personal recording, this is an excellent example of how maturity can positively affect an artist's craft. Ozzy never sounded better than on \\"Perry Mason\\", \\"I Just Want You\\", \\"Thunder Underground\\", \\"See You On The Other Side\\" and \\"Old L.A. Tonight.\\" This is a must have for any rock collector, though Black Sabbath fans may say otherwise. Hardcore metal heads will also say otherwise, but reviewing W.A.S.P., Cannibal Corpse, Metallica, Megadeth, and others is for them to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated cd","review":"I just bought the cd \\"ozzmosis\\" and i'm extremely happy with it!! Perry Mason is one of my favorite songs of all time. This album was a little bit softer then his \\"blizzard of ozz\\" days but i think it's one of his best albums!! Perry Mason rocks and so does this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"What are you guys talking about?","review":"Are we listening to the same Ozzmosis? This album is incredible! Without peer, and without a weak track. It far surpasses the mediocre Diary of a Madman (Little Dolls?please!) and still one ups the incredible Blizzard of Oz (No Bone Movies...) Every single track is absolutely the best that music has to offer, from Ozzy's most intellegent lyrics to Zakk Wylde mind-blowing guitar. Absolutely positively perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong, Brilliant & Intelligent Music.","review":"Was introduced to HHF with this album when I was in Australia. It is so good I just can not compare any of the other albums as good as this one, not even the latest 'Born'. In fact I'm so much into music that I was telling a friend I would love to be remembered with this album, cause I always introduce my friends with the new or rare stuff. I wonder why this never really hit it big which is good in a way cause when you hear it it just blows your mind from the begining to the end, \\"this is it (your soul)\\" being the most out standing.The lyrics are simple but strong and the music does not go over the top. Excellent piece of work!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs from the Rain","review":"I love the way this music has the ability to transport me to another level of relating to the world. We all seem to be looking for ways to relax and be well. This powerful CD has the music to facilitate that journey to wellness and peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spiritual essential for todays fearful world.....","review":"Since the insane terror brought upon this country last week, this country has been in a state of tension, anger, and patriotism. I have had this album for a while now, but haven't heard it for a while. I picked it up, and maybe its the times, but inspired feelings like no other time I can remember came over me listening to this album again. The entire album is a spiritual awakening, and it deserves a listen during these trying times. Just amazing songs...One after the other..So if you need a time of reflection, a spiritual pick me up, pick up this cd and feel the raw emotion, and poetry of each beautiful song. This CD is definitely a thing of beauty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I will die of boredom when i want","review":"I had to read this play as part of my International Baccalaureate English A1 HL course, World Literature section.this is the WORST play I have ever, ever read.Being a lover of English, I desperately struggled to find something good about this play, but I couldn't.

The characters are perfect and the story is written beautifully. I loved Brad in Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss and love that he did this great film. Tina Holmes was perfect as the sister and I remembered her from Edge of Seventeen. This is an all around perfect love story for anyone, gay or straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING MOVIE","review":"Wow. I mean WOW!! A copy of this movie was gifted to me, and WHAT A GIFT IT WAS. Adorable characters, and a story of Tribulation that ends in Triumph. Brad Rowe was my favorite - so beautiful, but Trevor Wright was equally wonderful and delightful - sacrificing his own life to help his sister and how very special he was with his nephew. Superb. The music is also great. Spend some time and research Shane Mack and the soundtrack. \\"Lie to Me\\" is a new all time favorite of mine. This was a class act!

SHELTER is nothing short of HOT HOT HOT!!!!!!!! At all costs - BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme Shelter","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. It's much more than a love story; its also a coming of age story that's filled with inclusive family values. The movie has some great scenes of surfing and skateboarding, as well as \\"bombing\\" the suburbs with graffiti art. In many respects, the movie combines various subcultures in a new and innovate hybridized form. Surfing, graffiti, and the gay world meet and intermingle in this novel refreshing film. The love scenes and the kissing are so tender. The emotions of the actors are so intense that I felt as though I was a participant in the movie. I was not merely a spectator, but was involved in this film completely. Seeing Zach's evolution was truly uplifting and inspiring. This is not simply a \\"gay film.\\" This is the kind of film that anyone and everyone should see. No matter what your sexual orientation, you should definitely see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best LGBT movies ever!","review":"I'm not fond of a lot of the current LGBT movies that are around these days, but Shelter was one, if not THEE best movie I have seen in a long time. It was perfect all around and no amount of gushing from me will be able to praise how good this movie is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a simple, sweet story - one of the best of this genre","review":"I've had this film for years, and I enjoy it each time I watch it.This film relies heavily on the scenery and the actors (I suppose if the director cut out all the driving/surfing/skating scenes it would be about 30 minutes long).Brad Rowe and Trevor Wright do such a great job and their on screen chemistry is just right for this, Tina Holmes is great (I really love/hated that character), and Ross Thomas' character seems to take over the scenes he's in.Probably the worst thing about the film is that it had the potential to be/do so much more as a film and for the community, but then again maybe that's part of why I like it. It's romance and coming out without all the sex, political issues, or blatant ignorance that some films get wrapped up in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Warmer","review":"This is definately a film that you will want in your collection, because it is worth watching more than once.

Excellent music too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Movie","review":"Ive gotten a couple of movies on here and this by far has got to be the best gay themed movie i have boughten.

Great movie, I definitely recommend buying it. I did :]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me such Shelter","review":"Every now and then you want a movie which makes you feel good, and which requires no profound internal analysis thereof. All that is expected of you is to involve yourself in a story which unfolds in way which is both calming and desirable. 'Shelter' is one such movie, which has as one of its best selling points, the 'normal' characters. Perhaps it is profound that the gay characters in this movie, are 'normal' in that they are love struck, confused, and yet function as every other person in society. They are not dying of Aids, nor are they subject to the frivolity of stereotypical gay casting. There is no neurosis, but rather an honest exploration of emotions. These gay men work, surf and love.Most pleasing is the peace they find within themselves, despite how other characters react to their relationship. In short, a wonderful portrait of an alternative love, coloured in a way which sensitive without being condescending or stereotypical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight or gay, you HAVE to see this film!","review":"If you're a romantic and want to see a 'real' relationship develop, (not the Hollywood version) then this movie is for you. It shows how persistence, love, encouragement and support can take you out of even the worst situation. This is a film grounded in reality and will touch your heart and leave you wanting more. More out of life. More out of love. Nobody ever made their dreams come true by staying in their comfort zone. Take a risk.

Rather than focus on healthy, deep ways to improve Christian girls' self-esteem, this book emphasizes outer beauty and leaves almost completely unaddressed inner strength.

Gee, let's just all sound like a fifth rate Stone Temple Pilots. Wouldn't you be dissapointed if your favorite restaurant reinvented itself and the food and service became no longer satisfactory? What if our utility companies reinvented themselves and \\"matured\\" and only offered you electricity and water for a few hours each day? If you enjoy the typical 90s lyrics about looking in the mirror and not seeing yourself and all of the other run-of-the-mill depressing subjects then buy this cd. Although, there are a couple songs I like here, particularly \\"Too High To Climb\\" that kind of have that good old Dokken sound. Certain bands should just stick to what they do best and not try to join the flavor of the year club."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"they are ripping off Kings X! The sound of this album has Kings X influence all over it, and that is ok. this cd doesn't sound as good and even less creative than anything in Dokkens past.Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is their best album","review":"Every song on this CD is awesome. People that are Dokken fans that don't like it are stuck in the 80's. This album is very melodic but keeps the hard rocking style that they are known for. I agree with the L.A. Weekly article, if it was released from a seattle band it would have been huge. Some of the best tracks on here are Lesser of Two Evils, The Maze, What Price and Too High to Fly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dysfunction Junction","review":"There's something really disheartening about hearing a band lose their identity so totally as what's on this. I guess this is their attempt at Seattle's version of neorealism, mixed with surrealism (this sounds like Kings X). It's like seeing Donald Trump come back from an ashram with a full beard, sandals, flashing a peace sign, and eating tofu. Lyrics about nothing, just total gibberish, some psychedelic muck about... not knowing what to say..? Another trait of the CD age is albums became War and Peace take II, so you have to endure what seems like eternity of this nonsense. Sure there's some good playing on here, but this never should have come out as a 'Dokken' release, maybe the 'Traveling Blue Fish,' with George sporting a Fu Manchu moustache and Don some serious dreads."},{"rating":"1","title":"DYSFUNCTIONAL INDEED...","review":"What apiece of ... This return from DOKKEN adds nothing to their discography. It's the same old formula of copying the others, heartless commercial pop-metal. I must give some credit to Don Dokken, he really has a great voice, but it's serving the wrong purpose: that of glam-metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dokken's worst effort, by far!","review":"I was so happy when Dokken got back together, and I rushed to buy this CD when it came out. Boy was I disappointed. If you're a Dokken junkie, you already have this album, but for those who are just looking to buy some music from the 80's band they remember, I recommend \\"the best of\\" or \\"Under Lock and Key\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should've gotten more attention!","review":"Dokken has been all but forgotten in the last 8 years, since their last studio album \\"Back for the Attack.\\" Unfortunately, they never really got the respect they deserved musically in the 80's anyway. But Dokken has proven with Dysfunctional that the can compete with the grinders and slow churners of the 90's, too. The songs all generally have the low, throbbing bluster much like most other mid-90's metal, but the songs are better and melodies are stronger than most. Jeff Pilson is the key character in making this somewhat of a Sabbatherian experience, as he plays (more like plods) bass lines much the same way as he did on Dio's 1994 release \\"Strange Highways.\\" The tunes blend so well together here, making for a tight, seamless album. Musical highlights are \\"Hole in My Head,\\" \\"Too High To Fly\\" and \\"Lesser of Two Evils.\\" I thought maybe this is the album that should have been named \\"Back for the Attack!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"DOKKEN Strikes Back!","review":"After a rather lengthy 8 year absence, DOKKEN came roaring back with DYSFUNCTIONAL. The beauty of this album is that while upating their sound to fit in with what was current, DOKKEN remained true to who they were. DYSFUNCTIONAL takes the classic DOKKEN sound and gives it that mid-90's twist. Album opener \\"Inside Looking Out\\" is a classic double-bass driven track, and \\"Hole In My Head\\" is a great song with a darker tuned-down riff, but still has that classic DOKKEN sense of melody. The album moves from the heavier material to the more laid-back with ease, and it has a cohesiveness that most albums have been lacking in the last 10 years. Highly recommended for fans of any type of Hard Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very...functional!","review":"Dokken's comeback in 1995 was more than a long overdue reunion,it also ushered in a new era for the band revealing depths and subtlety never hinted at before.George Lynch was still on top of his game,but the band's new found maturity is mirrored by Don Dokken's intelligent,introspective lyrics.An excellent heady metal album with psychedelic overtones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best '90s album!","review":"I have to say that next to 1987's great Back For the Attack, this is my second favorite Dokken album. Easily their best '90s album. I enjoyed every minute of it when I listened to it in 1995. George Lynch's guitar leads are strong and aggressive. They keep a very hard edge on a majority of the songs. Best songs are the ones in the middle. Although they've had some conflicts on member changes and how they wanted the music to sound, Dysfunctional is a perfect album title to describe their music transitions. Please get this album soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for reviewing","review":"You cannot beat this book for help reviewing for prelims or comps.

I enjoy their studio records a great deal, but to me the music is meant to be experienced in concert. The nine tracks on this CD represent the breadth of the Widespread Panic concert experience augmented once again by The Dirty Dozen Brass Band. As on the previous album featuring DDBB, A Joyful Occasion, the horns seem to deepen the groove of an already formidable rhythym machine. Guitarist George McConnell seems to be hitting his stride within the band, and this CD displays some of his best playing yet to be recorded with the Spread.

Written from a secular rather than a religious perspective, the authors chronicle the lives of victims, the cover-ups by bishops and the socio-political structures which have allowed sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clerics to continue unabated. This book is serious reading for all, but especially for many of the Catholic faithful who have placed an almost blind trust in their leaders. The shocking, painful disclosures of this book will undoubtedly challenge laity to ask questions, honest priests to speak up, and law enforcement to prosecute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"Ordered for a college course.

I only finished it because I finish 99% of the books I pick. It is just so slow moving. Every detail is chewed over by the main character until you just wish he would actually do something. Then there is a burst of violence and the book ends (thankfully). I kind of liked the female detective, she is the most interesting character, but she doesn't have much to do (like everyone else in the book). When I started the first few pages it seemed to be stream of conciousness by someone on LSD. Characters were talking to each other but you had no idea who they were or what they were doing.

Ive tried twice, once with \\"Meat Puppets II\\" and this thing. \\"Backwater\\" is a great, if perhaps nonsensical pop hit, theres a few other listenable things here, but anyone that thinks this is one of the best albums of the nineties needs to put the bong down. I hated MPII as well. Both just lack verve and replayablilty, you have no idea what the heck theyre singing about, and the music is too lackluster to make up for the weird lyrics. Now I have heard bits of their first record, and that sounds like fun, but this is not that band. Sometimes, its best that punk bands dont learn to play their instruments. The Meat Puppets are evidence of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"No plaster in my eye.","review":"Aside from a few songs that seem to be there as filler... this is the best of the later Mup's period. And, contrary to popular belief, there is more to this record than just \\"Backwater\\". Nothing wrong with that song, either... but one listen to \\"Things\\" or \\"Severed Goddess Hand\\", and the true charcter of this desperate longing album will come out and smack ya in the nose. Presuming that you want to be smacked in the nose, that is. And why wouldn't you? Because it hurts... that's why. But, the nice country groove of \\"Comin Down\\" will cradle you in it's arms and make it all better, I promise.

I see why Kurt liked this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below-average offering (2.5 stars)","review":"The Meat Puppets where one of the best bands of the 80s, but once they got signed off SST to a major label they seemed to have lost something. They didn't sell out, but a certain amount of soul present on \\"II\\" and \\"Up On the Sun\\" just wasn't there. The problem is they seemed to get swept up in the grunge explosion that happened. That isn't to say this is a terrible record. There are a few good songs, notibly their big hit \\"Backwater\\" amoung a few others. However, something just wasn't there. The lyrics weren't as funny or as emotional as before, and it leaves no lasting affect. I know there are many who disagree with me. If you like grunge such as Soundgarden and Mudhoney, you'll probably like this. If you like classic Puppets however, you'll not like this too much. Not bad by all means, just not that great either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album if for its lyrics and guitar work","review":"Definitely one of the great albums from 1994 or even the mid-90s. The Meat Puppets have a country twang mixed with metal power chords that makes this a great album to listen to. For the more country mix I love \\"A Hole in the Wall\\" and \\"Comin Down\\". More metal induced riffs are some of the first tracks on the album like \\"Violet Eyes\\". My personal tastes run from Grateful Dead to Frank Black to Norah Jones to acid jazz, etc... so if you have a wide range of tastes - like good guitar and bass work - with lyrics that are more thought provoking/interesting than pick the album up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jewel","review":"TTD's Vibrator is a stunning piece of solid music work.

Excellent performances from a great group of musicians and superb production lay the canvas for TTD to sing with his trademark intensity. Album highlights include the rocking opening song \\"Vibrator\\", the funky \\"Supermodel Sandwich\\", one of the greatest songs ever recorded \\"Holding On To You\\", the gorgeous \\"Undeniably\\", and the emotional \\"If You Go Before Me\\". This is an awesome album that needs to be heard by any serious music lover. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"PROGRESSIVE WITH A FUNK TWIST!!!","review":"This is the first time I really listen to a TTD's cd and I am amazed. My musical preferences are progressive rock, so I had doubts about TTD's filling my expectations... I was fully wrong. I think his music is \\"progressive with a funk twist\\". The themes are dense both musically and conceptually. Somehow this cd reminds me of Roger Water's \\"Amused to death\\". Congratulations to TTD and I hope we get a lot more from him (for now, my next pruchase will be NIN's \\"Fragile\\"). Peace!

It really helps with blueprints."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wet Firecracker","review":"Everything seems to point to a dynamite album, what with Phil Lesh on bass, supported by the dynamic drumming of Johnny Molo, the guitar of Warren Haynes, and lyrics by Robert Hunter. Unfortunately, There and Back Again is a pretty wet firecracker. The music seems banal, the overall sound is reminiscent of somebody trying to sound like the Allman Brothers, but without the grit and fire they had at their best. The end result is a truly unsatisfying recording that will do nothing to enhance the reputation of Phil Lesh. I find it hard to believe he would lend his name to something so musically unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great surprise!","review":"This is a very good album! Good songs, tight band, Hunter lyrics, and (shockingly) strong vocals! And a great bass player! The guitar players are terrific too. Very Allman-oriented (I guess that's AOR), with Liberty redone with a \\"Fatman in the Bathtub\\" arrangement! Very nice, touching, but not wading in nostalgia. (It is funny to have songs both looking back to Jerry and urging us to move on right next to each other). Interesting spiritual undercurrent as well.The bonus disc is a total treat! St Stephen! Terrific The Eleven! 25 minutes of Dark Star from New Years Eve. Even a new Passenger studio version.

Kinda frustrating, but well worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Purchase","review":"I bought this kitchen for my 2 year old daughter for Christmas this year. The oven door broke on the very first day she played with it. The door on the right hand side never closed properly either. One of the tea cups and one of the hooks where you can hang the phone or a kitchen utensil broke within the first month. It is made of a cheap hard plastic. Toys like this need to be ready to take a beating!! After keeping this toy for approx. 1 month I returned it to the retailer where I purchased it. I learned a lesson here....

I am looking for something more durable at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"We bought this for my 3 year old daugther who loves the Disney Princesses. What a dissapointment. The peices do not fit together properly. After one week the voices and sounds don't work.

The pieces do not connect correctly, My daughter can't open the oven door so she ends up dragging it across my floor. When I force the over open it detaches and the cabinet door just falls right off once it is opened. It is more of a pain and frustrates my child more than anything. This is defiantly not worth the money. You can buy a much cheaper one of better quality. I plan to call disney customer service and make a complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK - NOT worth the money!","review":"My daughter does enjoy this kitchen - however, it is NOT worth the money! Within a few days one of the knobs on the oven fell off as did the faucet for the sink. Also, it's made out of cheaper grade plastic and is not very durable.

First, there is no reason why there should be so many pieces that we have to put together. The base of this kitchen should really be in two or three pieces,not 20. The quality is soooo poor and shotty. I would rather spend a little more on a Pottery Barn Kids Kitchen, that will at least hold up and look nicer. Little girls will love it no matter what but it is so cheap it will fall apart in the first month or so....not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney Magical Kitchen Isn't Magical At All","review":"I thought this toy would be great for our 3 1/2 year old daughter who picked it out on a recent jaunt to Toys R Us. It sits in our apartment collecting dust. She is typically a child who is imaginative and remains engaged for lengthy periods of time when something interests her and this captured her attention for all of 10-15 minutes. Now it just takes up space. Don't know how much this review will help anyone because the toy does everything that it promises and it was quite easy to assemble. It doesn't \\"promise\\" to engage my child which is a good thing because it falls way short of doing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, Falls apart easily","review":"We got this kitchen for our daughter last Christmas. She loves to do the pretend cooking thing and she loves the Princesses so I thought this would be right up her alley. Okay, so we get all the pieces out of the box on Christmas Eve. This took us so long to put together and it's so poorly made. I was sooo disappointed but was hoping though that my daughter would still enjoy it because afterall, its the Princesses!Well, fast forward to right now. The kitchen sits untouched in her room. She gets so frustrated with it. Something always breaks or falls off. So, needless to say, we are getting a new kitchen for her this Christmas. A Step2 kitchen that will last and not be so frustrating for her.If you are looking for something to last and be used for years, do not get this kitchen. Yes, it's cute and girly (which is what caught my eye) but it's so not worth it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney should be ashamed!!!!

I had planned on either getting her the Lifestyle kitchen or one of the Little Tikes kitchens, but as soon as she saw this one hte choice was made by her. She really enjoys it and is having fun playing with it. We purchased extra food and kitchen utensils because it doesn't come with very many. My husband put it together and it didn't take that long at all.I took others advice and put the batteries in first so there was no problems there. The only thing that concerns me about it is the fact that the oven door is really hard to open. You have to hold onto the kitchen as you open the door or it will fall over. All in all with this kitchen you get what you pay for, it isn't made as well as some of the others that are more expensive. But it's cute. As long as my daughter enjoys it, even for a year or two at this price, it will be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok - but kind of cheap looking","review":"My three year old daughter loves this kitchen, but as with most Disney products I am disappointed in the durability in this item.

It was not a big hit. I did more research, and found this one. It was set up at the store and it blew my mind- and my daughter's! The faucet makes a running water noise, the burners on stove make noises controlled by turning the dials, or setting the pan, pot or tea kettle on them (it sizzles, bubbles and makes the tea kettle whistle), the oven lights up when you turn the dial and dings when it's done, and it comes with plenty of accessories including food! It is not as sturdy and durable or well made as the Step 2 and Little Tykes kitchens, but it is by far a better toy! At this price you can't beat it! My daughter loves it and it really holds her attention. I love the little details like the magic cookbook with recipies and the little clock or the hook for the spatula and spoon. It talks, but it is not annoying at all. Really cute!!! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I bought this Disney Kitchen for My 6 Year old niece and she is loving it.

My sister wasn't very thrilled about that..hahaha. Anyway While I was writing this review I asked her how much fun was her new kitchen, 1,2,3,4, or 5 and she said One Hundred Million or the biggest number in the world Auntie. Well that says it all for me! It's the day after Christmas morning and she is still playing with her toy. It's not made of the greatest durable material but I would buy it all over again since she loves it so much. The most Important thing is that the child enjoys it!

While it was a good read, it did not create any sense of sympathy or empathy for the characters and the two \\"bad guys\\" were stereotypical and had such a lack of depth that their actions seemed nonsensical.

It's obvious from the book that, before he converted, he had minimal knowledge about Judaism. Furthermore, when you read the story, you'll find that the author was very emotional.

With all the years of blood and hatred separating Jews and Christians, only a miracle can bridge such an awful gap. That miracle has happened.

This one is a little shorter than usual to accommodiate the format, but the great illustrations really support the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copiously illustrated Discworld tale","review":"This is a departure from the usual packaging of the Discworld books, a copiously and colorfully illustrated hardback that tells the tale of Cohen the Barbarian and his geriatric horde attempting to return fire to the gods (read \\"blow them up\\"). Meanwhile, the Patrician has enlisted the wizards of the Unseen University and Leonard of Quirm to try to stop them. Hilarity ensues, of course.The text is much briefer than usual, but moments remain, particularly around Leonard of Quirm, the brilliant but eccentric inventor who doesn't see the world quite the way anyone else does, and the much put-upon Rincewind, who is among the crew of the bizarre ship sent after the barbarians. Even my wife, who doesn't much like Rincewind, enjoyed his proposed motto, which can be translated from the Latin as \\"We who are about to die don't want to.\\" So it's an enjoyable if not first-rate outing, and the illustrations are delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweets to the Sweet","review":"This book is tailor made for Disc world aficionados. The beautiful illustrations (particularly to DeQuirm series) are worth the price of the book alone and a wonderful story to go with it. I would not recommend this to anyone who hasn't kept up with the series. I am still laughing from the pseudo Latin motto of the \\"brave heroes\\".If you are a big fan, then grab a spoon and dig in, this was made for you!="},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but top-notch Discworld adventure","review":"Despite being shorter, this is not a kids' Discworld book but a fully adult novella. Pratchett returns Cohen the Barbarian and his Silver Horde (see \\"Interesting Times\\" for more information) to center stage with their plan to challenge the gods of discworld. Meanwhile some of Ankh-Morpork's finest -- Leonardo of Quirm, Rincewind the 'wizzard' and the stalwart Captain Carrot -- are being sent to stop them in the Disc's second spacecraft. (Rincewind gets to choose the motto for the mission patch -- \\"we who are about to die don't want to.\\") The illustrations are gorgeous. Given the brevity of the story there aren't quite as many layers as in the standard Pratchett, but what is here is top quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Based on a Book","review":"I enjoyed reading The Last Hero as much as any of the other Discworld books. Which is to say, \\"A lot!\\" The characters are as vivacious as ever and the plot is just as twisted (pun intended) as any I've seen in this series. The only negative aspect of this book is the artwork. Not that the pictures aren't very well done: they are very entertaining. I guess I've just become set in my ways and prefer my imagination to make the imagery. I felt like the characters lost a bit of their appeal to me when I saw them as portrayed by another person, even if Paul Kidby is a talented artist. I would recommend that anyone who has enjoyed Discworld books before should read this one without paying too much attention to the artwork. After you finish the story, go back and enjoy all the fascinating pictures. It'll be like getting a second book free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kidby knows what Death looks like","review":"This book was fun, mostly for the pictures. I found the short novella that went with the pictures to be a bit on the watered down side for a Pratchett novel. It seemed like Pratchett was trying to come up with a short story line that he could fit everyone's favorite characters in without taking up too much page space.But the pictures make up for it. My favorite is the picture of Death with the kitten. It is exactly how I imagined Pratchett's Death to look like. The other pictures are just as rich in detail and depth and make this book a must look for die hard Pratchett fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Hero","review":"All the Discworld novels I have read have been good and well worth my time. The Last Hero is no exception. People who are just starting to read Discworld shouldn't start off with this particular book, though. You need to be well aquainted with the series to understand some things.The book, although short, had a great story and a lot of humor in it...seeing as how this is a Discworld book, neither one of those things is any big surprise.What sets this Discworld book apart from all the rest is the illustrations. They are very well done and really help to add to the story.Another great book in the Discworld series."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Pratchett","review":"The Last Hero brings back several Discworld characters, notably Cohen the Barbarian and his gang on a last adventure, Leonard of Quirm and that persistent survivor Rincewind the inept magician, not to mention The Librarian. The story is not as long and complicated as the usual Pratchett book since most of the characters have appeared in previous books and are not as deeply developed here. The story is strongly bolstered by many wonderful, often-times intricate illustrations by Paul Kidby. Discworld followers will find it worth reading.This is in a large (9-1/4\\" x 11\\") glossy coffee table format which makes it a little less easy to curl up with but it's beautifully presented.It's a beautiful book and enjoyable"},{"rating":"2","title":"More then expected","review":"I was expecting one of the excellent satirical/fantasy Discworld books by Terry Pratchett- the last one I was missing. \\"The Last Hero\\" is certainly that. I was not aware it was a beautifully illustrated edition of the book- you would have to see it to believe it. I was very pleased, and of course, it arrived on time and in perfect condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but entertaining and fantastic illustrations","review":"This story is not as long as most discworld novels and it is not his best story, but it is in the typical Pratchett style. I enjoyed it (3 stars). The fantastic illustrations are worth a 4th star. You should have it in your Pratchett collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"Exactly what you'd expect from Pratchett and the Silver Horde. The added dimension this time is Paul Kidby's art which is magnificent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less is not more.","review":"Bare in mind that most folks reviewing this book are die-hard Pratchett fanatics, the types who will pay a lot of money for a 167 page coffee-table book. If you witlessly love anything Discworldian then you do not need reviews; you will adore this book. If you like, rather than worship, the excellent writing that Terry Pratchett is capable of then you will be seriously disappointed with The Last Hero. This is the sort of substandard (compared to the usually high standards of Discworld novels) work that inspires conspiracy theories. Perhaps the pod-people have taken over Pratchett's body and are trying to pass as him. Or an obsessive fan has written a Discworld book and palmed it off as the real thing. Terry Pratchett is indeed one of the best satirists currently in print; it is a shame that he now seems to be writing fake versions of his oun style."},{"rating":"1","title":"mondo dorko","review":"my boss (a candlemaking, jeff foxworthy listenin' to dweeb extreme) lent me his copy of this book to read. He said, in his creepy falsetto cyber geek voice \\"oh! terry pratchett does good parody, read this if ya' wanna have a lark!\\" I basically had to read it, cause when I gave it back to him after a week, you know, I had to know what was in it cause he's the type of insecure dork that will ask you all sorts of questions to try and make you feel bad for not sitting around all day and reading his brand of dorky fantasy. anyways, I felt robbed of the 45 minutes I spent reading this garbage. Yeah, okay, parody of modern world dressed up in dungeons and dragons. Who cares?? even the artwork is piss poor.

I was unsure if it would be worth it at first, because it is a more expensive book for a shorter story, but the artwork makes it totally worth it. And the story is standard Pratchett quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent spell-binding time travel!","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised. This is one of the view books that toughed my emotions. It contained humour, suspense, bravado and titillating romance. The characters Alanna and Kiervan had sparks flying. I couldn't put the book down. Thanks Ms. LaFoy for the wonderful read. I look forward to other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of adventure, sexual tension","review":"After traveling back into time, the heroine finds herself in the middle of the Irish conflict. She and the hero race pell mell over the countryside, escaping all sorts of foes.I found the heroine's reaction to everything believable. She travels back in time, but she doesn't curl up in shock. Instead, she bounces back. The hero is a rogue, but so much more than that.Both the characters have depths and backgrounds that are revealed slowly. The secondary characters are a mixed bag. One bad spot was Kiervan's would-be fiancee. Aaargh! Why did he have to struggle so over the decision about whether to marry her?I gave this book at B+ at All About Romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab a hold of this one with both hands!!!","review":"What a wonderful story. Ms. Lafoy has done a masterful job spinning the threads for this tale. The characters of Alanna and Kiervan are artfully formed and compliment each other perfectly...who said like temperments can't attract? The story has many levels, and Ms. Lafoy keeps drawing each level in, until a whole story unfolds. The sexual tension between the hero and heroine spark and ignite (though I might have liked to have seen a little more ignition). Out of the whole story, my only criticism is how easily everyone accepts time travel, as if it was an everyday occurance. I know early 19th century people were superstisious and might have believed in witches, but they seemed to be a little too complacent about this kind of miracle. Don't miss reading this treat!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Happened One Night","review":"I'm tired of the petulant, sulky, angry heroine that is always focused on herself and won't deal with reality. I found myself completely bored with the heroine with in about 10 pages. It was as if the author had cut and paste the same dialog over and over again. It got old very quickly. There was no depth of character, no interest in the new environment or the other people in her world. She was too busy ranting and raving. How interesting is this? Please...I can't bring myself to finish this book. Give me character development like Elizabeth Thornton any day of the week! I'm a big fan of time travel...but I'd never buy a book by this author again. Period. I wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undoubtedly the best overview of \\"Darwin's Islands\\".","review":"I am a biologist that has been working in the Galapagos as a Naturalist leading tours there for the last 6 years. Michael Jackson's book is the \\"Bible\\" for the beginning naturalist and certainly more than adequate for the casual \\"ecotourist\\". Jackson covers all major aspects of the history, geology, ecology, and biology of the islands. In the \\"biology\\" section, he gives a clear, concise, but thorough group-by-group treatment of all major taxa including plants, reptiles, land and sea birds, mammals, and a brief section covering marine life. While there are other guidebooks available, none come close to the accuracy, clarity of presentation, and logical format of this book. Of particular usefulness are the many photos, tables, and graphs which provide a visual representation of many of the topics discussed and a synthesis of large amounts of data."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one book needed when travelling to the galapagos","review":"I just recently returned from the Galapagos Islands, and the book that guided me throughout my journey was this book by M.H. Jackson. Very easy to find the animal you are looking, and also helps to discover more creatures to look for. Helped explain things further from what the guides had said. Also helped me in answering many people's questions about different creatures. A Great book! A must for all travelers to the galapagos in search of unique wildlife."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guide's bible on the Galapagos","review":"Every naturalist guide in the Galapagos has this book.

The photos of Elvis both on and off the ice are spectacular. I especially enjoyed the photos of his off-ice interests such as martial arts, jetskiing and dirt-bike riding. The text gives fans an understanding of Elvis' philosophy and is inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and inspiring for most readers","review":"If you like this skater, you will like this attractive coffee table book. An oversized book, its large, beautiful photographs are its best feature. The text is not sparkling, but it is interesting, especially when describing the creative process.I must respectfully disagree with a previous reviewer's assessment that the author's intent is to display his masculinity. Rather it is a visual description of a successful but unusual skater's work.Those who do not care for Stojko's work will not care for his book. Any Elvis Stojko fan will love it. Anyone who watched him at the Nagano Olympics will find it inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's SOOO macho!","review":"This book gets a 3 for unintentional humorous content.

Instead of doing the usual \\"biography\\" which there are already many, he spoke to you rather then about himself. He is well-spoken and I learned a lot about his feelings towards different competitions and situations that the skating world has put him through. Many of his morals and values were shown and this taught me a lot about my own life. The pictures are absolutely beautiful. I loved the fact that there were pictures on every page. Unlike most other skaters' books that only have ten or twelve photos in the middle, sometimes only in black and white. Once again Elvis knew what his fans wanted. My wish is that Elvis will write another book, this time on his experience in Nagano. So his fans could understand what he was feeling during his heroic skate and during his two weeks there. Elvis has never dissapointed and that stands for this book. Thanks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ELVIS SHOWS HIS TRUE COLOURS!!!!!","review":"Not only does this book have wonderful photos, it also gives us insight into the life and mind of Elvis Stojko.

Judging by the title of that featurette, I think it might show auditions for the voices of the characters in the series. And keep your eyes peeled for other neat stuff on the DVDs.So besides the fact that this series is fascinating, albeit somewhat extreme in more than one way possible, this 2-disc set is definitely something they should have done in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen Titans Rules!!!!!!!","review":"This show is so awesome!!!!! It is so funny, it always makes me laugh. It is way better than a lot of shows you see on T.V, it has a way better plot than most shows. If you're looking for a great show, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap laughs","review":"teen titans is ( in my opinion ) one of the better super hero shows , way better than justice league types , ol wonder womans a bit long in the tooth compared to raven ,"},{"rating":"1","title":"The stupid theme song....","review":"As bad as the animation and voice acting are, the worst aspect of this series is the theme song. It is so stupid, it sounds like it was performed by rejects from the Britney Spears Fan Club. The Teen Titans comic was annoying enough, but this series was a total travesity. I think Cartoon Network cancelled it, because it got too annoying even for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far The Best...","review":"Out of all my childhood memories, none stand out more than when i would come home after school and watch Teen Titans for hours. This show has everything kids (and adults) want in series. Besides the awesome action sequences (and the fact that it's hilarious), it also teaches people about understanding one another and being a part of a team. This season in particular is good, definitely not as intense or epic as some of the later ones, but if you want to capture this show in it's essence this is the season to buy. Another thing, i don't believe you necessarily have to watch the seasons in order because most episodes in a season do not link to one another, and any story points you don't know will probably be explained anyway. Overall, I believe this show is perfect for anyone aged 8-17, or anyone who is a fan of Super Heros and DC comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you're in trouble, you know who to call... Teen Titans!","review":"My 4 1/2 year old son can't get enough of Teen Titans! This is his favorite DVD and he can watch it over and over again. The story lines are actually pretty good- I've caught myself watching it while while folding laundry or listening to it from another room. The animation is great. Oh, and you can't beat the theme song! I may try to find it as a ringback tone for my phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Read!

It's funny, cool, and just plain awesome. I have seen a lot of the first season's episodes and all of them were excellent. I highly reccomend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"International Accounting","review":"This book, written as a text for accounting/business students, provides an excellent overview of accounting standards around the world. Rather than providing a detailed listing of accounting standards for each country (best left for reference texts and online, easily updatable sources) the authors focus on the key features of accounting standards, disclosures and harmonization efforts worldwide.This book provides an excellent, basic primer in international accounting. It is easily read by anyone with a basic understanding of business and finance and/or accounting. The authors provide numerous examples of international financial reporting, taken from actual financial statements and annual reports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful but over priced","review":"A useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing Accounting Standards and approaches between countries. However, it is not worth the price. It is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students. It is more suitable for general second year accounting students. Plus, as I am working with a multinational European bank in Japan, the book is, rapidly becoming, out of date. There is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Cure\\" worse than the disease","review":"The authors last told us how the value code had been cracked by companies like eToys, idealab!, and Compaq. Specifically, how these new economy companies had figured out how to create enduring shareholder value by satisfying their customers, employees, suppliers. This was obviously written before their value code hypothesis was invalidated by the market.Oops.Now, they're offering similar medicine for the health care sector.I've read the book, and my advice for all is to be certain and receive a second opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband from Hell","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Lisa Gardner. I enjoyed reading it, and hope this is a good example of her work. It's easy to get into from the beginning, unlike some books that I have read and holds you to the end. It has several twists along the way that are unexpected. Worth the time it takes to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Husband","review":"Lisa Gardner is a new author for me so imagine my surprise when I had to stay up into the wee hours to finish this book. You have to read this book for the pure suspense and psychology behind \\"The Perfect Husband\\". If you like an investigative mystery, this will become your new favorite author. I have read her two other novels in the past week and find them equally well written. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the perfect husband","review":"A bodice-ripper masquerading as a police procedural. Have enjoyed many others by Gardner, this one's just annoying. Idiot damsel in distress, overemotional prose, cartoon characters. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not perfect","review":"The first half of the book kept me reading and then it went all downhill. All the police, local, state or FBI, are incable of doing their job. I sure wouldn't entrust them with guarding someone I loved. The \\"hero\\" just isn't.The killer seems to be everywhere and does things that would require several helpers and a bit of magic all while going 56 hours without sleep.The worst part of the book was the death of Marion. She was just begining to cope with her deamons and there was good book in her future story.There are so many good reads out there don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE TIME","review":"Time is precious. I love reading and the time spent is a delicious investment. Reading, or rather, trying to read this book made me angry. I personally wanted to drop kick the heroine but I could not care less. In fact that was the problem for the H and H. I just did not care. I did not care if her ex found her and I did not care about JT. His sister sounded too sick and they all spoke in quotes. This story was lame and did not flow. The sound bites were repeated ad nausem and at page 300 I dropped it into the trash. That was the best part. If you are looking for a fantastic read, a bit of romance and real suspense, The kind of story where you are pulled in and forget where you are then read Karen Rose. She knows how to write and you will feel like you are a part of her story. No regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling Read","review":"Incredible book. Grabbed me from the first chapter and I couldn't put it down. I will be looking for more Lisa Gardner books to read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Lots of cheesy parts, but a good storyline. The last chapter redeemed this book to a 2 star... I will not finish this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read","review":"A friend at work, my husband, and myself have all read and thoroughly enjoyed The Perfect Husband. We spent quite some time between us deciding that it should be made into a movie and trying to decide who we would cast in the parts of Jim and J.T. Some of the leading contenders are George Clooney, Alec Baldwin, Chuck Norris, and after seeing As Good As It Gets, possibly Greg Kinnear. Does anyone else have any role possibilities?"},{"rating":"2","title":"not so perfect","review":"I have read alot of Lisa Gardner books and have liked them tremendously. This book had it moments although I found alot of flaws in the story. The concept if very interesting and most of the time moves at a rapid pace. Other times you just want to flip thru the pages to get to the more interesting and exciting parts. It's like a see saw ride. On the whole it was a good book, not a great book. If you have extra time read it, but if you have more interesting books read this last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"I really enjoyed the imperfect characters in this book. The hero and heroine engaged me. The villain is as evil and creepy as you can get. The only downside to the book was JT's sister, Marion. I just thought an FBI agent would have acted a little less impulsively. Still, that was a small part of the book. All in all, it was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Husband","review":"This book that I read was a real good book. I'm not into reading books, but this book I defidently recommend. I give it 4 stars. The book was about this woman who wanted to get married. She meets Jim Beckett, they fell in love and got married. she thought he was everything she wanted him to be, or so she thought. As the years go on she finds out that he is not so perfect after all. She finds out that he is really a cold blooded killer that murdered a dozen woman. She puts him behind bars, but he escapes from prison and tries everything to find her. The only person that can save her is an ex-marine. When Jim escapes that's when the terror begins."},{"rating":"1","title":"I swear I tried!!!","review":"I tried to get through this book. I swear I did. I was told it would get better. It didn't. I had to skip two or three chapters because I was so bored and tired of reading about these unmotivated characters. It just didn't seem real to me. It seemed forced and uncreative. The \\"love story\\" was unrealistic in my opinion. Nothing about this book appealed to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time","review":"This was this was my first book on my kindle so I was really lookind forward to it. Sadly, it was cliche in so many ways and the ending left so many unresolved issues. I would like to say more but do not want to reveal anything in case someone decides to read it anyway. All I can say is I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read Hide and liked it, but this one is her first novel.","review":"The author has improved greatly since this, her first novel: The Perfect Husband.

As for the book I read the first few paqes and the thought of a husband who was a Cop killed young girls and was the destroying his life & his marriage made me heart sick,,,,so I will not read the book. Ellen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous violence/phony romance novel","review":"When I started reading this book, I thought the writing was almost poetic for a crime story, but it quickly deteriorated into a crime-filled romance novel where \\"true love\\" happens in a few weeks under highly unlikely conditions.True, it is suspenseful and hard to put down, even when you have a good idea about what is going to happen and the ending of the psychopath is fairly satisfying, but it was so disgusting, unbelievable, and full of hatred towards women and men that I will never pick up another one of her books.For example, one of the key characters, a young woman hardened by years of sexual and physical abuse by her father, hates both him and her mother mercilessly. She hates her mother for being hardened by living with her abusive husband and there is never once any compassion for or awareness of this mother's pain.It is hard to believe that such a lovely young woman as this author appears in her jacket photo can be filled with such sickening images."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as impressive as The Other Daughter","review":"My first Lisa Gardner novel was The Other Daughter. I absolutely loved it and couldn't wait to read another. I was a bit disappointed in The Perfect Husband. I didn't find it to be that suspenseful. THe first half of the book focused on Tess and JT and there was little excitement. The ending was okay, but again, not that suspenseful. There were many details that were not expanded on to satisfy the reader. I am not giving up on Gardner, however. I am currently reading The Third Victim, and can't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a very good book. Lots of action. Exciting storyline. Believable characters. Of course the husband is anything but perfect. There is some sadness in the book too. You'll think about this when you reflect on the book later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I have really enjoyed Lisa Gardner's later books. Unfortunately this one is nothing like those. The characters are hard to like, and it reeks of a harlequin novel with a lot of sex mixed in. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable fast paced read with interesting characeters","review":"Another solid Lisa Gardner book. Not a 5* but definitely worth the read. It is enjoyable with ups and downs and mystery and drama... an good mix for a summer beach read or mellow weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 Stars","review":"This book was so full of suspense that I had a hard time putting it down. This was my first Lisa Gardner book and I already have THE OTHER DAUGHTER lined up to read next.I noticed one editing error - J.T. called her Tess (on page 131) before he was even told what her real name was. It's those kind of little errors that drive me nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish!","review":"I might stay away from my Kindle for a while because even samples are not indicative of the trash they can lead to.

It keeps you going, you just can't put in down, even when you know you have to. The thought of going to sleep is scary! She's the best writer I've found since Tami Hoag.

I can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I keep reading her trash??","review":"I bought this book on sale at Wal-Mart looking for a cheap summer thriller, and I can't finish it. I read about a book a week, and this is one of those books that puts you off reading for months. You can't finish it, and you can't just start another because you are totally bummed about reading now! Her characters are lame, the story runs the same darn scenario over and over. I am on page 120 or so and the same thing is happening as was on page 10...\\"train me\\" \\"I can't, I'm too mysterious and have daddy issues and can't open up\\" \\"but train me I need you\\" \\"I will but I will be weird and argue with my sister all the time because I have daddy issues\\" \\"but train me\\" \\"I will but I have daddy issues and my kid died\\" \\"but train me I need you and won't talk about it and will take 300 pages before I give a clue to what this book is about\\" \\"I have daddy issues and this book is lame\\". STOP WRITING LISA!!!!! This book got 1 star because I couldn't give it a zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa Gardner gives me nightmares!","review":"Bloody disturbing book! I had nightmares about opening my closet, about evil policemen, about opening my door to strangers... had them for WEEKS after reading this book. Lisa Gardner has the gift of paralyzing you with fear, shocking you to your core, and then making you feel all warm and fuzzy when the victim finds a big tough guy to take care of her. Tess is a completely helpless character who doesn't let that stop her from fighting like a spitting cat, and you just can't help feeling for her. J.T. is a gruff but lovable prickly teddy bear who doesn't want to let Tess in, but can't resist her either. Jim Beckett is entirely detestable. It's impossible to have any feeling other than loathing for this character. This is a page-turner that will keep you awake at night, but you won't want to put it down to face the nightmares that might lurk behind that closet door. The characters are incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps you on your toes","review":"This is the best book i have read in years. I have read it twice. Many of my \\"book worm\\" friends have read this and i have never talked to anyone that did'nt love it. Make sure that you have plenty of time on your hands because you won't be able to put it down. They don't write them this good any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to \\"The Other Daughter\\"","review":"I, too, read \\"The Other Daughter\\" first, and couldn't wait to get this one. I was very, very disappointed. If I had read this one first, I wouldn't look for anything by this author again. Among many other flaws (in my opinion), the heroine was woosey, even though she's purported to be strong and tough, and the kid is obnoxious and unbelievable. Since this was Lisa's first book, let's hope that the trend is upward in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"Boring characters, who are not credible in the way they think or act. Superficial treatment of forensics, in contrast to Jeffery Deaver's superb novel \\"The Bone Collector\\". Also irritatingly repetitive in the characters' thought sequences. Give this a miss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one, read \\"The Other Daughter\\" instead.","review":"After reading Lisa Gardner's novel \\"The Other Daughter\\" (which I found very interesting), I was anxious to read \\"The Perfect Husband\\". Unfortunately I found this first novel to be weak, with a disappointing and very unbelievable plot. The second novel is a strech too, to be quite honest, but nothing like this first one. We are honestly expected to believe that this serial killer, while constantly on the move, changing his appearance, makeup, clothes, is able to murder someone and then drag another dead body to the top of a building in a short span of time. Additionally, I found the addition of JT's sister rather odd and didn't add to the plot. Read the second book and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unbelievable","review":"I usually look for books with a preponderance of 4 or more stars. I can't believe that anyone could give this book anything above a 3 star review. Unfortunately, I'm beginning to think that people who don't like a book, don't bother to voice their opinion. I know that I am in that category, but then again I don't like to write any reviews.I just wish there was a way to give a star rating without having to write a review.P.S. Glad I only downloaded this to my Kindle from my public library and didn't waste money on a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have a Freud in me Herman","review":"I got this book, because I had enjoyed Gardner's \\"D. D. Warren\\" series. But here, far, far, far too much time taken discussing the psychological damage done to this brother and sister by an abusive father. Long, long, long before the author is satisfied, you find yourself screaming at the book - \\"I GET IT!!! Now can we move on???\\" I skipped over several such L-O-N-G sections of 5-10 pages, and in the end, gave up before finishing. I had intended to get the whole series, but now, I think I'll pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Started out slow but picked up...","review":"I almost wasn't going to finish this book... a quarter of the way through and I just was not into it at all.

The storyline is just as redundant. It just keeps tripping over itself without really going anywhere. The characters were difficult to believe, as well. The only reason I gave it two stars was because some scenes kept me reading and I was able to finish. However, I doubt I'll try another Lisa Gardner book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner...","review":"Could not put down this book. It stretches the imagination, even with suspension of disbelief, but not so much that you doubt the book while powering through it (likely in one sitting) I had to roll my eyes at the relationship with the \\"jaded ex-marine\\" that seemed a little romance-novel cliche to belong in a genuinely interesting action filled book... but also felt enough for the characters that I shrieked out when one of the novel's characters died.Definately recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but still good","review":"The Perfect Boyfriend?l'Amourby Sophie SimonsIf you enjoyed \\"The Perfect Husband\\" by Lisa Gardner, check out the above novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author. It is very poorly written and I am not that fussy. The story involving JT and is sister doesn't add anything to the book and the whole relationship between brother and sister is kind of freaky - one minute they act like they're in love with each other and the next acting like 12 year old bullies.

This one I will not finish. It is not in the same caliber with her other books. Umfortunately, I do not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Implausible","review":"It is admirable that a woman who has been abused her entire life would seek to rebuild her strength and power. But this book's main character, Tess--orTheresa, or Angela--gives herself too quickly to a man who is just as domineering in his own way as the ex-husband on whom she seeks vengeance. It's an absurd and implausible notion. In addition, the subplot of lifelong tension between siblings comes from out of the blue. It appears that the sister is summoned for some important reason by her brother's manservant--who then abruptly departs the story--for the sole purpose of yelling at her brother. The back story unfolds, but it's too late to make the plot gel. I rushed through this book hoping it would better; I continued rushing through just to be able to move on to my next book as soon as I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a struggle","review":"This is in my Top 5 Worst Books Ever. And that is no easy feat.I could barely make myself finish it with the repetitive dialogue, awful, unbelievable, badly written characters and the plot that just went nowhere. The only person of even the slightest hint of interest was the villain and even he was poorly written. I also can't believe there is supposedly a series based on the ridiculous character Quincy. I truly hope her other works are far superior because if they are not then the publishers should be ashamed of themselves.

As a beginning Hungarian student, I've been consulting this grammar from day one and have gotten quick answers to the questions raised by Teach Yourself Hungarian, which generally eschews the grammar approach. (I'll admit I have studied a number of foreign languages, but a person serious about Hungarian will need to learn some grammar early in the process or risk learning nothing at all.)Torkenczy's book is clearly organized and concise. In fact, it is at times a bit too concise, leaving the reader with the impression that the writer has not explained the more subtle grammatical points of the Hungarian language. Nevertheless, for a BEGINNER (not the expert), the book is most practical. The EXPERT (not the beginner) would be better served by Hungarian: An Essential Grammar (Routledge Grammars) by Carol Rounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on Hungarian grammar","review":"Everything is included in this book, from conjugations to participles this book is marvelous. Some things may take awhile to understand and the book could use a couple more examples. Other than that this book is a must have for anyone learning Hungarian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on hungarian grammar","review":"This is an eccelent book on Hungarian grammar. I highly reccomend this for all of you learning Hungarian, it is a must have. The only bad part of this is that some things are not very well explaned. This is most prelevelent on the noun cases sections, where it just gives a very rough translation of what the cases mean, which could lead to people using them wrongly. The verbs on the other hand are very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it !","review":"I originally purchased this for my 70 yr old mother as a gift.

I LOVED World Mix and was all excited about Boheme, but I can't stand it. I think it's godawful. I tried twice to listen to it and I just can't. The vocals are shrill, annoying and way too much. I prefer the subtle sampling of World Mix, not the full-on crooning of apparently entire folk songs on Boheme. Boheme seems a little cheesy to me (too close to eastern european folk music), and lacks the mysterious funk of World Mix. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this thinking it would be along the line s of Delerium and Enigma. It's okay on the whole, but the ethnic singing is far too over the top. One track sounds like Nat King Cole gone wrong and others sound like any old pigmy off the street has been hired to sing to a good backing track. As a result it sounds like Paul Simon's African work, after 20 pints.Track 2 is the best, but it's a shame the ethnic vocal parts are timed to badly.Get Karma by Delerium - it's 5 times better, but note it's not as heavily Africa/Ethnic based."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOULFUL PEACE","review":"I WAS LUCKY TO COME UPON THIS MUSIC IN JUNE WHILE VACATIONING IN KIHEI ON THE ISLAND OF MAUI.

Unfortunately, many of the songs have been edited out and replaced with subsitute music, no doubt due to an unwillingness to pay high royalties. Anyone who's seen the reruns in syndication will instantly spot the changes in the DVD version. The new music ruins the enjoyment of many episodes.

Dion's \\"Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore\\" is one of the best performances I have ever heard. Celine does every verse differently as the song builds from subdued to an emotional high. The second great vocal performance on this CD is the last half-minute of \\"Les Derniers Seront les Premiers\\" where she does some background warbling that just blows you away.Most of the other songs are merely very good, rather than great, and three or four of the up-tempo songs are not so good.

Joey Pants was always one of those actors you love to hate - after reading this I can see where he got his inspiration - his nutsy Mommy (I have to admit I get a little uneasy reading about a guy in his 50's who still refers to his mother as Mommy). From this I have great admiration for Joey now - it is amazing what he overcame - the very things that would have caused most people to give up and accept their existance - inspired him to seek a better life.

It's creative and to the point. The way he describes things carries the book.The story itself is an interesting one, but it's more about his dysfunctional parents and their marriage than about the author. His mother is quite a trip. He had a rough time growing up but goofy as some of them were, his extended Italian family was a strong source of support and I think that's why he didn't drown in his parents' craziness.This story is not about the mafia, although some people in it apparently have some bad connections. It's about a boy growing up in a close-knit, somewhat goofy family in 1960s New Jersey. And there's a lot of great insight into the family members and their peculiarities that makes it well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring autobiography EVER.","review":"I'm part-way through chapter 2 and I'M DONE.

This is also a LOT of grip tape, I could redo everything I've done at least a dozen times. It's more enough to cover an entire household step.Pre-cut panels of grip tape are easily twice the cost for a single firearm; this stuff is enough to do over a dozen guns and the amount of prep time is trivial.

But it was gone after one wash and a healthy amount of fabric softener.One drawback - the blanket is made from two layers that are connected only at the edge (kind of like a big ravioli without any filling). So on a king size two layers slide against each other. Edges hanging from the bed balloon a little and it doesn't look good.

His ideas, carefully planned and supported by research, make perfect sense in a world full of stress and neglect for what is truly important. I am convinced that by following Dr. Wirth's advice, my husband and I will be closer than ever during our pregnancy and our child will be born as a reflection of that shared love.

Wirth is telling us that if our babies are born prematurely, suffer from health problems or emotional problems later in life, or even just have colic--that we simply didn't love them enough while they were in the womb. Or that our husbands didn't love us enough or that we weren't strong enough spiritually. He tells a story of a young man who suffered from colic as a baby, became increasingly reckless as a youth, and eventually died in an accident in his 20s. Wirth traces this all back to a father who was not supportive of his wife and his baby during pregnancy, end of story.

These versions of Dylan's songs are sort of light-weight covers rather than the kind of interesting re-interpretations he's done in the past. Rod Stewart could have made this album.

If Ferry really wanted to cover the work of the best songwriter of thje last 30-40 years, just imagine what he could have done with Leonard Cohen's work. Ferry singing \\"I'm Your Man\\"? What brilliance that would have been. Ferry does manage to bring some beauty to \\"Make You Feel My Love.\\" And what he does with that song makes you again wonder what good the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is without Ferry or Roxy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coloring with Bob.........","review":"We all know that Bob Dylan is one of the world's best songwriters; he has given us breathtakingly, beautiful melodies. Bob doesn't need anyone to improve on his works of Art.....and no one is trying to do that here. Whereas Bob foxtrots inside the lines and colors in dark neutral shadows, Bryan colors outside the box in electric pinks and blues all while doing the jitterbug......Taking a fabulous song and making your own rendition of it, is greatly inspiring and the dream of any musician. You can tell by this CD that Bryan truly enjoyed himself and was honourably creative and sensitive with the wealth of song before him......Bryan's voice is soothing and chilling just as his rhythm and blues make us stand up and dance. There are a few songs which sound like he was channeling Elvis and a few more, Warren Zevon....Perhaps he did get help from the other side.. it certainly sounds heavenly.....Thanks, Bryan.....you're incredibly delightful......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Dylan Fans","review":"I love Dylan. I received this CD as a gift from a friend who thought I would like another take on some of Dylan's work. It was hard to imagine someone being having the nerve to be \\"Dylanesque\\" but thought I'd give the CD a chance. There are a few pieces that are nice listening--but since when was Dylan nice listening? There are other pieces that are absolutely horrible--like nails on a blackboard. I can't turn them off fast enough. If you love Dylan don't get this CD. As for my \\"Dylanesque\\" I'm giving it to the person who gave it to me. He doesn't like Dylan and should just love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ferry cheapens the classics","review":"Bryan Ferry's Dylanesque is NOT for true Dylan fans.

This book is totally different. After reading 200 pages I gave up because there was no real information in it.

Couldn't be happier with it. It's beautifully shot, the narration is great and slightly quirky. It seems like a little piece of the 50's, and very authentic. However, DO NOT BUY the companion DVD: \\"THE FROZEN NORTH.\\" It's much the same video from Alone in the Wilderness, with much of the exact same narration, but the narration is entirely unintelligible. It's Dick Proenneke's own narration, I believe, but save yourself the disappointment--his microphone, and his delivery make him sound almost retarded--and most of it is literally unintelligible. It was a colossal disappointment, and I love the first film. To say the second DVD is a rip-off is an understatement: Bob Swerer Productions should be ashamed to sell it.

This is the reason I bought this for him. I knew he would be awed at the simplistic building skills of this simple man living a simple life. He was amazed, as were Mom & I. He LOVES it!! This is by far one of the greatest gifts I have ever gotten him.Having lived in Alaska myself for 2 years, I can tell you that its a hard life, especially during the winter with bitter cold temperatures and darkness.

A lot!I really enjoy Chemistry, Act Naturally, She's Got My Number, Who's Stopping You, and El Matador. The rest of the songs are up there too.

You have to keep in mind, that regardless of whether or not this is a favorite Semisonic album, it is still an excellent album.

This c.d is like a story book and takes you through an adventure so sweet and sound. Beauty is heard through such songs as \\"Act Naturally\\", \\"She's Got My Number\\", \\"Who's stopping You\\", \\"One True Love\\". To be honest, you won't find a song which you won't need someone else to turn off for you. It takes courage to stop the c.d and I feel this is a c.d for everyone, no matter what music you listen to. Semisonic is by far the most under-rated group and this c.d proves it.

Get a Grip is the most obvious offender, which is a real shame -- it's a great, fast, catchy tune, perfect for radio play and cranking loud on your stereo -- but then you hear the lyrics and just cringe. Who's going to sing along to *that*? Cyndi Lauper's song She Bop I could deal with, but not this. The lyrics to the song Bed are almost as bad. What happened to this band that they felt they needed to sink to this sophomoric level?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM","review":"This is probably the worst album I have ever listened to. It's happy-clappy, cheerful, bland, trite and dull. None of the songs are any good, but they still stick in your head, leaving you playing bad music in your head again and again and again. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was my introduction to Semisonic","review":"I had no clue these were the guys who did \\"Closing Time\\"....not that I am particularly found of that song. I hadn't heard anything else by them either. So maybe I was at an advantage coming to this album with no expectations.It came up as a recommendation on Amazon and I gave it a listen.This has quickly become a CD that I can pop in, hit play, and let it go the whole way through.Every track has something I like.So, maybe now I will explore the rest of their albums and see just what the other reviewers liked in the previous releases and didn't find here.If you're like me and have little or no previous experience with Semisonic, ignore the reviews that wax nostalgic and listen for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Design","review":"Semisonic's 4th cd continues their tradition of solidly crafted pop songs.

I loved Feeling Strangely Fine and The Great Divide sounds like a promising purchase in lieu of any *new* releases, but this album sucks overall. It's missing that essential edginess that their earlier albums had, and without that element all that's left is quiet ballads.That said, I gave this album an extra star because it does have three really good songs: the title track Chemistry, Sunshine and Chocolate, and El Matador. The last of the three is a good example of how the rest of the album sounds, but it is the best of the slow and quiet tracks that this album is populated with.My recommendation is to buy the three songs I listed online if you can, or another option is to buy a used copy of the CD, rip the three songs, and sell it back for the next guy to do the same with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this set","review":"Don't buy this set.

Smash Mouth is my favorite band in the world.... but this one hit rock bottom. They re-used almost all the songs from their other CDS (Astro Lounge and Fush Yu Mang)... if you own these CDs you already have probably 80% of the songs on this CD. And if you don't own the above two.. still don't buy this. The songs sound worse and the players are nowhere near as talented as they are now. Unless you want it as memorabelia... it is useless to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...EXCEPT SORRY","review":"Okay, a great CD. I have all 4 other Smash Mouth CD's. Sorry is a horrible, sick, twisted, stupid, dumb, lousy, just plain BAD, song. They shouldn't have done that. But it is still a good CD which is worth your money.

I would have loved to read more detail on some of Luther's earlier recordings. I have the LUTHER albums from 1976 and 1977 plus the Bionic Boogie albums. The book left out his 1979 Bionic Boogie album TIGER TIGER where he sings lead on two songs. He also was in a studio group titled SOIREE where he sings \\"You Keep Me Hanging On\\" and \\"You Are The Sunshine Of My Life.\\" The Charme, Mascara, and New York City Band albums are great as well. They show a side of Luther not to many fans have heard. Also in 1987 his song \\"There's Only You\\" was included on the movie soundtrack MADE IN HEAVEN. This seems like a personal song for Luther as you feel his emotion singing the haunting arrangement. I wonder if it was written after his tragic accident involving his friend Larry Salvemini. Overall the book is excellent and is the first written about the life of one of the greatest vocalist of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for Luther fans","review":"I luv Luther from the top since he been out. I adore him as a man as my world. I bless God that Luther is doing alright now and maybe he'll drop out a memoir after this one. Luther had a lotta stories to tell to the world, how he lost his father at a young age from diabetes, how he grew up from the church, when did he started singing, how he collaborate from a variety of artists (i.e. Donny Hathaway, Roberta Flack, Patti Austin, Quincy Jones, etc.), when did he became a solo artist from the top in the early '80s, etc.I recommend this if they want to hear more from the man or else never knew him at first. This would tear you out. Something I look forward reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Read This Book for Nothing......","review":"I ordered this book because I loved Luther Vandross deeply and I miss him and I'm still in shock over his passing. I received this book and read it cover to cover in two days. I was somewhat disappointed in this book in that it depicted Luther as being a moody spoiled brat--so to speak who wanted things his way or no way, and if you didn't do thngs his way he would lash out. While I didn't know Luther personally I don't believe that he was that way. This book quoted a lot of things that BET's \\"Journeys in Black\\" broadcasted. I was very disappointed by this book and I found it a total waste of time to read. If you want to know about Luther refer to Bet's \\"Journeys in Black\\" on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, NOTHING MORE","review":"I'm not a huge Luther fan, but I like his music. I read a few chapters and after a while I didn't read every word, I pretty much skimmed each chapter. I knew he had written and sang lots of jingles, but I didn't know he wrote a few songs for The Wiz. A few didn't make the cut, but one made it in toward the end of the movie. I can't remember the name of the song, but the words are can you feel a brand new day?. It's the scene at the sweatshop and the evil queen dies. He worked for Davie Bowie, Bette Midler and a few others. There is nothing juicy about this book. Luther has always been a pro and very serious about music, and we know this without reading the book. Don't buy it and waste your money like I did. Oh, the photos are nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luther's Life Beautifully Portrayed","review":"Craig Seymour has written a thoroughly moving story of Luther Vandross. Although I have enjoyed Luther's music for several years, I had no idea of his numerous personal problems and disappointments, many of which he is still struggling to overcome. My prayers are with him for a speedy recovery. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Craig Seymour has included not only Luther's story, but also rich histories of many famous R&B performers that Luther met during his rise to fame. This book is very readable and very entertaining. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, This Rocks","review":"REFRESHING. I dig the production on it - the rawness. Nikki's songwriting is solid and reminds us all of his inner punk that he has always been.Tracii's guitar work is more intuitive, and straight ahead. Sounds great LOUD.This release grew on me like weed. The first few listens, I didn't know what to think really. Then it started making sense as a solid, trashy, sentimental, sweaty, abrasive catharsis of much needed ROCK.This is great because it's not contrived. It's not a 80s rehash.

What are you comparing this to, Britney Spears or N'Sync? This album is not even average. I am a HUGE Traci and Nikki fan, but this cd does not deserve anything near 4 stars. Nikki rants and raves about how he did not want an 80's singer and wanted someone fresh, this guy, London is not fresh, he is annoying.

However, I feel so bad for anyone that spent full price on this crap! TERRIBLE!!!! Tracii says over and over again, they chose some no name singer to give them credibility, well this guy sucks!

Drumsticks are a rather personal choice, so I'm sure these sticks are not for everyone, but I found the weight and balance to be excellent for the way I play. I also liked the way the stick is tapered in a bit where you hold it. This makes it a little easier to hold on to and seems to result in a bit less slipping. Personally I'd like the tapered part to be slightly further back, but that's a very minor issue. Overall, if you play a type of music where you hit fairly hard (such as rock, prog-rock, or fusion), it's worth giving a pair of these sticks a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly developed and conceived","review":"While this is a paperback romance novel, and I picked it up at a Free Store (a place where everything is free) with few expectations, once I finished it I felt it had not been worth my time. The characters are very poorly developed and there is little motivation given for their actions. While I enjoyed the New Orleans backdrop, the too perfect heroine who is being stalked by an extremely handsome man got tiresome very very quickly, as did her all too understanding boyfriend who happened to be a psychologist, so he could explain all the actions of the stalker in overly simplistic terms.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious Writing","review":"I remain fascinated by the Borgia family despite the atrocious writing.

This album has at least five rock masterpieces on it and the rest is real good. I've been playing this album frequently now for over 10 years and it sounds as great today as when it first came out.Walk This World With Me, Island, Throwing Fire At The Sun, and Sugar rank among the best rock music ever produced. A unique strong voice which shows emotional intensity as very few ever have. Some of her songs (like Island) transport you to a safe, soft, dream landscape- and then - the guitars and voice rev up with an intensity that comes raging at you out of nowhere, throws you against the wall, and slaps you in the face. Yea, it gets your attention allright. What an experience! Unfortunately none of her other albums use this technique much if at all. This is the one Heather Nova Album everyone should own.

Concentrating on melody and mood, it starts out with \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" which, in my opinion, would have made a better single than \\"My Happiness.\\" Personally, I prefer the more rocking numbers (\\"Like a Dog\\"), but the more I listen, the more I'm drawn to the slower tunes. This CD is an excellent follow-up to their Australian success story, \\"Internationalist\\" which showed them maturing as a band. The overwhelming theme on \\"Odyssey\\" is love and loss, though it's presented in such a way that it doesn't come off sappy in the least. Fans of Creed should give this a listen and see how it's really done! Australia has a lot to offer musically, and I can honestly say that \\"Odyssey\\" presses all the right buttons. Come to America, lads! We'd love to have you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest link","review":"This album is very overated and pales in comparison to thier previous efforts, Internationalist and Double Alergic. The song writing just isn't ambitious enough. \\"The metre\\" and \\"Up and down and back again\\" are the only songs that really grabbed me. The rest of it is just non-threatening formulaic pub rock. Powderfinger could reach the heights of Radiohead if they wanted to.

Unfortunately it is so poorly written, I found it impossible -- the grammar is terrible, there are spelling mistakes galore....an editor's dream (or nightmare).The author writes like an amateur writer of children's books. I found myself laughing harder at the poor attempts at storytelling than I did the stories themselves. What passages I could actually get through were either uneventful, obviously embellished, or flat out impossible. Dates, locations and situations did not always make sense in the context of the stories.

It's also misleading to say the least, I thought some of the bands listed in the index were in the book and when I received the book and looked for stories on my fav band, I was set back for a major let down. Why do you even have that listed on Ebay..its 1 big fat lie!! OH and 5$ for your autograph, who are you kidding? I want my money back but I know thats not possible, so in the trash it goes!

You cant advertise a route if it is in the rip database by just creating a loopback interface on router R1!Then further on OSPF why would he configure authentication on a loopback interface which is printed out on the CD under configuration examples?

The author must have only a very superficial knowledge of the Columbia system, Indians of the Northwest and the geography and geology of the area. The characters don't make make much sense beyond the obvious stereotypes, and his understanding of the wild salmon issues is deeply flawed. His understanding of the Hanford reservation is ludicrous. This is the most disappointing book I have read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This book was a complete waste of effort. After trying to start it 3 times, I finally made it through the book. Really, I'm telling you, it is a waste of time. The characters are one not believable at all.

And why would she continue to be in love with him when he is killing himself in a terrorist attack?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing (SPOILER ALERT!)...","review":"I really expected to like this book. I like John Hockenberry's work on NPR, and the subject matter is near and dear to my heart. But the novel just doesn't work very well. I think the author tries to weave 3 or 4 ideas too many into the plot, and the story and characters suffer as a result. The characters end of being cartoony, their motivations end up being very sketchy and unconvincing, and by the end I just didn't really care what happened. And as another reviewer points out, Mr Hockenberry glosses over an aftermath of immense contamination and suffering.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that his writing style and descriptions of scenery are good. Alas, that's not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste yout money!","review":"A third grader would have done better research. The geography, history, politics, and understanding of the Northwest was so bad I thought at first it was written to be a farce. As I read further I realized this guy was serious. Unfortunately a good plot was populated with shallow characters who are caricatures of what New Yorkers must think of Indians, survivalists, farmers, and government workers. All are insulted. If the author had even bothered to get a map it would have helped considerably. He had locations in the wrong states, government agency responsibilities so screwed up it is laughable. He twisted history so badly it even contradicts itself in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Easterner View of the Northwest","review":"Don't buy A River Out Of Eden. Thankfully, I borrowed the book so I am not guilty of supporting Hockenberry's poorly researched Easterner view of us backwards NorthWesterners. The geography is wrong, the history of the Columbia / Snake River dams is inaccurate, the hierarchy of Northwest Power System and Salmon Recovery Program is totally incorrect and the plot muddled. It is clear that Hockenberry is making a political statement, but even at that he could have taken time to research his subject matter and included a plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I enjoyed the overlay of a fiction story on top of an interesting history of the river and its people."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRITE TRITE TRITE","review":"I've gotta say that I was really looking forward to reading this book as a close friend of mine is really great friends with the author. I was horrified to find that this book I'd really looked forward to was just awful! Swearing, drinking, \\"almost got some\\" priests??? Sheesh. The main character is prickly to the point that you wish it was her, not her uncle, on her last legs. Yes, there were some touching moments in it toward the end if you could dredge that far through it... But I also slow down and check out car accidents while driving by... I do realize that this is the authors first novel, but could someone have at least had the courtesy to explain to her what run on sentences are, and more importantly how to avoid them?? If you don't believe me, just check out the back cover -- it's just one HUGE run on.

There is ZERO depth of character development, not to mention plot. This book jumps around more than a child on a trampoline. Toward the end it seemed like the author (if you can call her that) got tired and decided to just throw things together haphazardly and wash her hands of it. And speaking of the author, what's with that ridiculously immature bio on her website? Is she 12-years-old? No serious writer would ever pen such an ignorant phony bio.

It is absolutely terrible. What's worse is that the potential for something more is here, but inept writing, a lack of even fundamental grammar skills, and a poor grasp of storytelling destroyed all of that. It's as if a grown up had an idea for a story, then let a not-very-bright high school freshman write it. How could such a miserable work find its way to print?

Unfortunately, Gia, Tony and all the others are mere cardboard cut-outs in search of a plot. Outrageous situations are no substitute for genuine character development, a fact the author seems to have forgotten. There is no discernible story line either, resulting in an ending that is a trite deus ex machina.

For what, we don't know, nor do we ever learn.

It doesn't even have a lot of camp value. There is some, though: The breeders only take virgins and somehow in the midst of the metropolis (New York), all the female actors, from the teen dancer/ingenue to the 30-something doctor to the 60+ bag lady are all virgins.But ultimately there's not much =there= there.

It fails at every level. You'd expect that an alien having sex (breeding) with beautiful school-girls would at least make this a sexy film, & yet it's not even that, aside from the obligatory group-girl scene in a shower there's very little flesh here to oggle at. And as a sci-fi/horror film it's not scary at all - I can't even work out which genre the producers were aiming it because it fails at all levels. The acting is even worse than the 1980s version - but at least that one had a titlation factor in its favour.There's heaps of plot faults and leaps of illogic.Filmed entirely on the Isle of Man (U.K.) but made to look like someplace, U.S.A. - probably because the producers wanted to pretend that such a terrible film had to have been made in another country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horr-i-bile","review":"This movie rates up there with drinking sour milk!They should offer a full refund for this at any video rental store, I could return it a week late and still ask for my money back and be serious.It's another scifi bomb loosly glued together with a less than porno plot, with the main them being some meathead they grabbed off of welfare, inserted in a laytex slag, and called it an 'alien'.If you're up for a bad time, grab your sour milk, some jalapenos, and watch this video!

In the end, they do battle with Ron Pearlman, who's bad for one reason or another. Maybe he's pissed he didn't get paid enough, or maybe he didn't pay the filmakers enough to not be in this film. Either way, he's pissed, and out to destroy the world. The camerawork looks like a guy holding the camera with one hand, and lifting weights with the other.

It lacks a plot, and the directing isn't artistic enough to compensate for the fact that they really didn't have anything to fill this movie with.

The real surprise for me was Jennifer McKinlay's To Catch A Latte. I had never heard of this author before but I am going to read whatever she writes from now on. The book was laugh-out-loud funny and the author's witty dialogue was perfect for her great characters. After the book was over I kept thinking about Fisher and Annie.

Sure, Botstein manages to write a book filled with great words, most of which are unknown the majority of the population in this country, but he fails to aknowledge one, huge problem in his idea. His idea is based more off of physical maturity than mental maturity. I think it's absurd to assume that students are maturing mentally at a faster pace, or even an equal pace to those 30 years ago. The fact of the matter, students generally don't have to mature that fast because of their lives at home, and those who do often turn to drugs or violence. That's just the way I feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The High Water Mark","review":"July, 1863... Mac and Will Brannon, along with thousands of Confederate and Union soldiers, are converging on the small town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, as General Robert E. Lee, in a bold move, hopes to obtain a decisive victory over the Union forces in their own territory.Soon, the two Brannon brothers find themselves in the midst of the bloodiest battle ever fought on American soil. While Mac rides through the Pennsylvania countryside with Jeb Stuart's cavalry, Will heads into the battle alongside his friend and sergeant from Culpepper, Darcy Bennett......GETTYSBURG is fraught with tension and dramatic battle scenes, written with James Reasoner's usual attention to accuracy and detail. My two brothers-in-law, who are Civil War buffs and Battle of Gettysburg fanatics, visiting there whenever they get the chance, LOVED this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walton's Christmas: Together Again","review":"It was not the CD we expected.

The Urantia book is as perfect as human hands could make it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard not to love","review":"I saw the features in summer 2005 supporting King of Leon and this was the first time i had heard them. Normally you dont expect much from a support band, but the Features got everyone in the room up on their feet with their catchy tunes, brilliant lyrics and great stage presence. This is their debut album (though they have loads of other great songs from their back catalogue) and every song on it could be a single in its own right. I listen to this album over and over because it never gets boring. I love the track \\"Idea of growing old\\" (i put it on a compilation cd to play in my local pub and even the old men love it!!!) it just makes you smile, the lyrics are so heartfelt and the tune is the type that gets stuck in your head for days. I also really like Kari-Ann which conjurs up an image of a dusty american town in the 70s which is odd as im from Croydon in the 1990s, just goes to show how lost in the Features music you can get!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"..//..","review":"This is my least favourite Meat Puppets album (\\"Golden Lies\\" is not included). It sounds very uninspired, no standout songs or musical moments, just a bunch of songs that pretty much sound the same. Curt Kirkwood is a great guitar player but here are no good riffs or solos. Also the bass lines and drums are mediocre as well as the lyrics and vocals. \\"Forbidden Places\\" and \\"Too high to die\\" are better choices in my opinion, if you're interested in their 90's period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst album","review":"Definatly a subpar offering from one of the 80s best bands. The first three tracks are really the only competant songs on this record, which is quite a shame. Oh well, any band that has as many great records as the Puppets do are bound to have a few bad ones. This isn't terrible, it's just boring and emotionless, which as two things their SST output can certainly not be accused of. I haven't listened to this one since I first got it. The last actual Meat Puppets album (\\"Golden Lies\\" is more of a Curt Kirkwood solo album). At least the cover is cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks!!!","review":"This album stinks. This is by far their worst album. I'm a huge fan and have seen the band live five times. I listened to this album over and over again, truly trying to give it a chance... to no avail. Sorry.

Rules","review":"This album is outstanding. Do not listen to the negative reviews on this site. This album is one of a kind. Some very twisted lyrics with excellent melodies. If you are a fan of the 90's alternative era you will absolutely love this album. This is by far my favorite album from the Puppets. You will question the lyrics again and again and say that's Mr. Curt Kirkwood he's a pure genius. \\"Impaled by a candy sword\\" On Poison Arrow. \\"To see it in an apple light\\" On Predator. I say to myself what the heck is an apple light. No songwriter like Curt. I mean who can think of that stuff.

I had been using Dex L-10 Hoodia, and it was working pretty well, but I thought this might be even better since it is a pressed caplet and not a capsule so it would be absorbed easier. I was wrong. The caplet don't even smell too strongly of Hoodia, so that was my first sign that this was a bogus product (if you've ever used hoodia as a liquid or capsule, you know it has quite an odor). It is like they barely contain any. I even upped the dosage and it did not work. This product is really bad. I will either stick with Dex L-10 or look for something new. I did use Desert Burn one too, and that worked well, but it was very expensive. Hoodia does work provided you can find a product that contains it. Stay away from this one. It is a rip off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children's Story For Adults","review":"This work by the world's funniest actor/comedian and the doyen of slide guitar gives both participants the opportunity to display their considerable talents. Robin Williams spins the ultimate cowboy fireside tale of the old west with his quick witted delivery consisting of scripted and ad lib humour, while Ry Cooder intersperses this spellbinding tale with his deft insertion of music that is so \\"old west\\" it adds a really delightful depth to William's narration. Ry also gives dedicated collectors of his music four instances of his prowess as a slide guitarist for their collections.Kids and adults alike will love this tale of cowboys and the wild west.James H BARNES"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I used to listen to this when I was back in first or maybe second grade.

The artwork is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Background music way too loud","review":"After reading the Amazon reviews and seeing that this recording won a Grammy, I was expecting much better.

I don't \\"get\\" them, so maybe that's why I don't get this album. It's not that terrible, but there's very little to motivate me to play it more than once or twice. It's wallpaper music, and nothing more.If your primary motivation for buying this CD is that you're a Mary Timony fan like me, I strongly suspect you'll be as disappointed with it as I was. The only hint that Mary's even on the album are hints of spacey guitar and keyboard riffs that are unmistakably hers and frustratingly buried background vocals on one track. I suppose I should have done my homework before buying the disk, but with Mary's unique voice, I assumed it would be prominently featured if not as leads, then significant backups. Nope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce's Lost Masterpiece","review":"Salt, Sun and Time is a wonderful cd that the average Bruce Cockburn fan may be tempted to overlook. It is a soft and beautiful acoustic offering - mostly Bruce and his guitar. There are 3 instrumental songs and 6 other tracks with gentle music and exquisite lyrics. This is the flip side of the \\"If I Had A Rocket Launcher\\" and \\"Call It Democracy\\" Bruce. Most Bruce fans wouldn't think of this as one of their favorites, but I think it would manage to make its way into my favorite half dozen Bruce cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salt, Sun and Time","review":"If you're into commercial or main stream music, this is probably not the album for you. Cockburn's genious at guitar and musical expression comes through clear and powerful. The pieces also express his love of nature and selfless, uncomplicated living. There is no business or ratings agenda here, just pure creativity. A timeless album that will remain one of my favourites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his Best","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Bruce Cocburn. I have 10+ of his Albums/CDs. But I have to admit that this is one of only 2 recordings of his which I do not listen to regularly. The lyrics are good as almost all of his are, but this album never grabbed hold of me.

Extreme safety issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch Failure","review":"My M53 also experienced a switch failure to the \\"on\\" position after having it in use for approx. 2 1/2 yrs. When operating as advertised, the pump activates frequently due to it having limited float height travel. The variable float model BN53 seems to have much improved longevity (less switch failures) due to the different switch type based on reviews that I've recently read. Moving up to the M98 based on reviews, maybe the on/off switch will work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap switches","review":"i have owned several Zoeller pumps. They all have the same problem: cheap switches that fail in a couple of years. Im going to purchase a different model/brand that does not have a mechanical switch.

I had to get out of my car this morning to close my garage door behind me because I'd backed in, and the length from my drivers seat to the back of the car is apparently stretching the range too far.

After having listend to this cd for over a year and catching him on tour last year I have to sayit's not that good. the stand out song is your missing, The rising, and into the fire. The rest ahhh. This record makes me think of Human touch. It sounds good the first couple of times you play it but you get bored with it quickly. The writing is just not that good.

I was very emotionally affected by the beauty of the music and the profound understanding of emptiness that comes from losing a loved one. Paradise is possibly the most haunting song that I have ever heard. Worlds Apart is truly stunning musically and lyrically.

He should've just written about it from his own perspective. Another thing is that he doesn't make much use of the E Street Band. Clarence Clemons is barely heard from, and counting Bruce, they've got three really good guitar players.

From the haunting memento of his experience in Brisbane Psychiatric Hospital, the album gives a blueprint of the easy, poignant style Bruce is famous for."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's voice","review":"Bruce Springsteen listens to how the person in the street reacts -- to pain, to love, and to loss. Here, he offers a look at several of the universal human reactions to 9-11. As before, he preaches endurance but also hope. That's not to say that the music doesn't also stand up well on its own, even with repeated hearings called for by the words. This is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"as great as ever","review":"bruce and the e-street band are back and doing it better than ever. this album is packed full with songs that will inevitably become classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIT THE \\"REPEAT\\" BUTTON ON THE CD PLAYER!","review":"This album has a bittersweet healing effect. I recommend it not only for Springsteen fans, but also those trying to deal with the shock and grief of September 11, 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT ALBUM!","review":"I am not a die hard Bruce fan but I do occasionally buy his cds. I happened to buy this one and the first time I played it I was amazedat how beautiful it was! So far I think it is the best album I have bought this year. The band plays beautiful, great lyrics that tell beautiful stories of inspiration and hope. Great harmonics by Bruce. Most of the songs are inspired by 9/11 but even if they weren't I'd still love this cd all the more. The only complaint I have is the art work & album cover is boring. But the music is overall what counts and it is beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is MC Scat Cat?","review":"Unlike Paula Abdul's \\"Forever Your Girl\\", almost none of the musicians featured on \\"The Rising\\" are animated. If you are looking for an album where a cartoon cat duets with a major artist, this is not the record for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"exploiting terrorism","review":"Bruce has now and again written a song that is not entirely without substance, not not very often. It is just too hard to get past the sound of his alleged voice, and the sound of that souped up bar band from New Jersey. Apparently Bruce fans don;t care much, they are sucked in by something that I can not see, much the same way that hordes of the dim are drawn to N'sync and other talentless droids. This record waves the flag in an insidiously clever way. Anyone who writes songs exploiting the 9/11 disaster should be strung up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capitalizing on people's emotions","review":"I LIKED Springsteen, until this album came out. The idea of putting out an album ENTIRELY about 9/11 seemed awfully cheap, but I listened to it anyway. Weather you like \\"the boss\\" or not, this album, in my opinion, cheapens the lives of everyone that died that day. Make an album with one song about the national tragedy, you're compationate and you show the world how the day deeply affected you. Make an album where every song is about it, and the meaning seems less sincere with every track. And if it's a tribute album, why didn't all of the proceeds go to charities instead of in the Boss' pockets? Sorry, Boss, but you've forever lost this fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Paula Abdul Forever Your Girl is better than The Rising","review":"First off, the beats. Springsteen's drummer isn't very good, and his choreography seems to be way off. Paula Abdul is a much better choreographer than Springsteen. Second, MC Scat Kat does a great duet with Paula Abdul on her album, but his contributions seem to be buried by the bombast of the E Street Band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boss or Loss (as in loss of hard-earned cash)","review":"Does anyone really think Bruce can sing? Man, he has one of the worst voices of anyone in the history of music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Miracle Did Not Happen","review":"Sorry Springsteen Fans. The miracle just did not happen for me on this one. The CD is too dark, too moody, too post 9-11. Even though that's an important date in our history, one we should never forget,the CD just brought me down and left me down. Every song sounded the same. The same beat the same lyrics. Too much fluff! The backgound vocals and music overshadowed Bruce's otherwise great voice. Burce should have stayed longer in the studio on this one. I don't know if BS is going to give the proceeds of this one to 9-11 causes or not, if he is then this CD might be worth buying, if not then don't bother he's only trying to make money on the situation. I had though about going to his concert, but based on this CD have decided to save my money and see Mellencamp instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, rockabilly?","review":"This album is a waste of money. With its soppy sentimental country and western like ballads it seems a far cry from the Bruce that I expected. This style is assuredly not rock and roll--even cranking up the volume did not make it more palatable. It sounds like a cross between Neil Diamond and the Oak Ridge Boys. I want a refund!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce's best work since the 70s","review":"I was really looking forward to a new album and was hoping it was not the commercial pop of \\"The River\\" or the screeching, yelling and shouting (instead of singing) on \\"Born in the USA\\". The first time I saw Springsteen was in 1971 at C.W. Post College on Long Island, New York. He was the opening act for Leon Russell, on Christmas eve. He was hypnotic, who was this artist? That magic was followed with \\"Greetings from Asbury Park\\", \\"The Wild, Innocent.... \\"and \\"Thunderoad\\". Bruce's voice is at its finest, the E Street Band is tight and has never sounded better. This album is well worth your money and the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Triumph Of The Human Spirit","review":"Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band have returned with a remarkable album, \\"The Rising\\". Spirited by the horrific events of 9/11, the Boss and his bandmates deliver a musically uplifting and spiritual take on events that shaped our futures forever. Springsteen's music on \\"The Rising\\" never wavers from it's ultimate message that by digging deeply within the soul one can manage to find the courage and the wisdom to move in a positive direction and stare down those who intend to bring our society to it's knees. From the opening track \\"Lonesome Day\\", and concluding with the opus, \\"My City In Ruins\\", Springsteen and the E Street Band score a five star masterpiece, perhaps their finest musical achievement ever recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"RISE UP!","review":"This is truly an exceptional album. What other artist of our timee could address Sept. 11th the way that he has? Just listen to \\"You're Missing.\\" That pretty much sums it up for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This is as good as it gets. I am mildy amused at some of the reviews longing for another \\"Born To Run\\" or \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\", etc. The essence of life is change. Times change, people change. Neither the world nor The Boss are the same as they were 25 years ago. Bruce is now writing and singing more from the perspective of the 50 year old man that he is. The sound is basically the same with a few wrinkles thrown in (by the way, it so nice to have the E Street Band back!). The voice is the same. The songs are great. The emotion runs deep. \\"Into The Fire\\" actually got me a bit misty-eyed recalling 9/11/01 and the heroes who sacrificed - and that is not easy to do. Don't expect a rock and roll classic like \\"Thunder Road\\" on this disc. Do expect to be thoroughly impressed!! Beats the heck out NSYNC and Britney :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Catharsis","review":"Almost a year post 9/11, I needed this music. The Rising, in Bruce's poetic voice, helps me to process the horror, shock, and utter sense of loss I feel in our \\"never-will-be the same\\" world.I love the way he merges different voices(the departed heroes, the loved ones left behind, and even the suicide bombers.) As I listen, I cry once again, but these are tears that bring a catharsis. Thanks,Bruce for the tone of hope, recovery, and rising above. This the essence of the American spirit: we can be at our best in the worst of situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boss","review":"This is one of the best CDs in a long, long time, maybe ever. Every cut is superb. The passion and feeling of the Boss about 9/11 comes through in a way that is so telling. Everyone should have this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"In this era of buying albums for a single song, or at best two, what a joy it was to put in this disc, turn it up and really enjoy every track! Not often do I find music by anybody that really works, at every level, on every song.. but Springsteen comes very close with this album. I've always admired Springsteen during the E-Street days, and not so much without them.. this brings it all back together, and has quickly jumped into my top 20 of all time, and may move up further with future listenings and lyrical review.. great album.. a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Work","review":"First off, to the \\"music fan\\" who thought the album was dark and whiney, and apparently has based their opinion on Bruce on the \\"Live in New York City\\" DVD---have you ever heard of the \\"Nebraska\\" album? Sure, this album has darkness about it, but Bruce's music always has, just like it has light moment, such as \\"Mary's Place\\".This album is fantastic. If any artist could talk about the post 9/11 world and do it justice and give it dignity, it's Bruce Springsteen. \\"The Rising\\" is a touching tribute to the firefighters and \\"You're Missing\\" is just absolutely haunting.The album should be picked up by all, but for those who remember Bruce for \\"Glory Days\\" and \\"Born In The U.S.A\\" only, and not noticing the body of work that exists, you might be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reborn!","review":"There they are, Bruce and his old E Street Buddies - sounding strong and vital. The sound is a little different than on the old cd's - but doing the same over and over again would be no fun. The songs are for the most part heart-wrenching, yet hopeful and defiant. It's like a secular mass in a way, the repeated choruses like on The Rising and Into The Fire conjure faith and hope, fist-pumping resistance to death and madness. There's also Mary's Place, a nice party song in the vain of the classic Sherry Darling. As someone having seen Bruce and owning every CD I am very impressed by this rebirth of Bruce and his E-Streeters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not a big fan, but....","review":"I have always been a \\"luke warm\\" Springsteen fan and have not bought anything by Bruce since Born In The USA. This is his best effort in a long time. He stands on the style of his old stuff while at the same time moves into new musical realms. A great example is the 7th track \\"Worlds Apart\\". The songs are gritty and passionate. For die hard fans, the returning fans and the new generation of fans, there is something for everyone on this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not normally a Springsteen Fan","review":"I haven't owned a Springsteen album since \\"Born in the USA,\\" which it seemed that everyone listened to in the '80's. So I'm not exactly a big fan. But I like real music, as opposed to the vanilla teeny-pop, rap-metal, and cookie-cutter-country that gets pumped out of studios like so many McNuggets these days. Springsteen has reassembled the E Street band for this album and together they really make music. It's a great full sound with complex harmonies and multiple layers. My main complaint is that the songs tend to sound somewhat the same after a while, especially the lyrics. All in all, however, this is one of the best albums of the year and worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs of loss and redemption","review":"The press keeps touting this as the saving grace for America and Bruce's answer to 9/11. While there certainly is reference to that event it is much more than that. This is a seminal performance by a recently dormant artist. There are 4 or 5 songs on this disc that are among Bruce's finest. Songs like \\"You're Missing\\", \\"My city of Ruins\\" and \\"The Rising\\" are sad and redemptive at the same time. \\"Lonesome Day\\" is a great song. While you can read Sept. 11th into almost any of these songs, You can also relate it to any tragic or defining moment in a life. This is a 50 year old man talking about mortality and vitality. This is Bruce's version of Dylan's Time out of Mind. Don't expect a repeat performance of any old E-Street album. Bruce is not going to make those albums again. He's changed and grown. We should all grow with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Brillant","review":"As a fan since '73 when he played the Agora in Cleveland, this is his most moving album ever - deep non-trite lyrics that will appeal to the true Bruce fan, not the Johnny Come Lately's of post '84. Great sound, Clear as can be, with wonderfully complex contributions from the band - Nils and Stevie in particular - Clearly the best album made in the 21st Century - no one else is even close. I rate it 5 stars, but infinity stars is more like it. Bruce's voice is the best it's been since Born to Run. This is American Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Is Back!","review":"The cloud of 9/11 hangs over Bruce Springsteen's new album, \\"The Rising,\\" but who better to address that horrible day than Springsteen, who can write anthem rock like no one else on the face of the earth? Songs like the opening \\"Lonesome Day,\\" \\"Empty Sky,\\" and the already well-known \\"My City Of Ruins\\" will make Bruce fans proud. The man still has a great set of pipes that can scare ships off the Jersey shore, and the welcome return of Springsteen's E Street Band co-horts, including wife Patti Scialfa, Steve Van Zandt, Nils Lofgren, Clarence Clemons, and Max Weinberg, helps lift the material to the same glorious heights of \\"Born In The USA\\" & \\"Born To Run.\\"With \\"The Rising,\\" America's working-class hero of rock has returned in a big, big way. It's truly wonderful to have Bruce back in business. He's needed. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BOSS IS BACK!!","review":"After being a Bruce Fan since I was a teenager, and that was many moons ago, I was thrilled to see he hooked back up with the E Street Band and CRAFTED this fantastic, what I consider, a tribute to 9/11 CD. When I listen to the songs, I can put myself in the tradegy, yet, become INSPIRED by the heart and soul of Bruce's words. The last time I felt like this, was when Born In The USA was released. I have heard much criticizm on this CD, and honestly, the people who are being critical of it, do not know WHO Bruce Springsteen is and What He's All About! Although I now live in New Hampshire, I was born and raised in New Jersey!! A TRUE SPRINGSTEEN FAN!! KEEP US ROCKING, BRUCE!! THE BOSS IS BACK!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"This album is as good as anything Springsteen has done in his remarkable career. The sound is fresh, the lyrics are superb, and the band (as always) is simply brilliant. I know already that this is an album I will be listening to for the rest of my days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce is back","review":"After a too-long break from recording a studio album with the E-Street Band, Bruce is back in a big way. Springsteen draws on his greatest strengths as a lyricist and puts together a great series of rock anthems, most focusing on life as it was affected by the attacks of September 11th (be prepared to get choked up with \\"You're Missing\\").The sound of the E-Streeters is unmistakable, vintage Springsteen. Some of the tunes (e.g. Mary's Place) could have jumped right out of the Thunder Road era.Here's hoping that the Boss is back for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of a Jovi [copy]","review":"Ever get the feeling this guy is trying to completely [copy] Bon Jovi? Cuz I do. The way Springsteen tries to play up his Jersey roots reeks of emulation of what Jovi was doing fifteen years ago, in the '80s. Also, this guy's singing style is exactly like Jovi's, as is his pub-rock sound. Little advice, Bruce: Leave the making of true Jersey hard rock to Metal Masters like Jovi.On a fair note, though, this guy has a John Cougar Mellencamp aura in his music that does resonate. He writes good tunes for the workin' man, and that's something to be admired!! Still, it's best to stick with more sincere rock that works: Jovi, Matchbox 20, and Sugar Ray.See ya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"god help us","review":"How can anyone call this music. The men has no talent.Very boring music, if you call this music.He couls not give his tickets away outside of N.J"},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR Disappointment","review":"As someone who watches and listens to the AMAZING \\"Live from NYC\\" DVD, I am SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED by this CD.This is NOT Rock and Roll.It's whiney and dark ballads.This is definitely NOT what I expected from Bruce and company."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I EXPECTED MORE FROM SOME ONE WITH PROXIMITY TO THIS ACT OF HEINOUS HOSTILITY. THESE TERRORRISTS AND THEIR FRIENDS MURDERED REAL PEOPLE. OUR PEOPLE. THIS MUSICAL DISIDERRATA HAS NOTHING REVEALING OR IMPORTANT ABOUT IT. IN AN ATTEMPT TO BE NON-JUDGEMENTAL THE BOSS BOWDLERIZES AN AUTHENTIC AND TRAGIC AMERICAN EXPERIENCE."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"I was disappointed in the album overall. Bruce claims to have written the album rather quickly and I have to say that it shows. Many of the songs repeat, repeat, repeat chords and lyrics in a monotonous droning that I can only describe as filler. I found most, but not all, of the songs and lyrics uninspiring despite the subject matter. This would have made a better acoustic album and, in fact, what there is of piano and sax that are trademark E-street seem to blend into the background and lack the prominence and power that I have come to expect.There are two noteable exceptions that stand out on the album, either for the lyrics and emotion [Further On] or the classic style and power that Bruce is revered for [The Rising]. The album is worth a listen, but won't make it into my stack of favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce, Where are You?","review":"There comes a time when all artists must admit they no longer have the capacity to reach their audience and fans. Bruce, it seems to me with this album, has taken an irreversible step in that direction. Overall, the album lacks that inimitable Springsteen grit and covers the listener with glitz, which is not really Bruce. This has to be his poorest effort yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good songs overshadowed by themes","review":".Oh it is sooo good to hear Springsteen back, singing songs he cares about. When all the artifices of clever chords melt away, popular music has to boil down to sincerity, and this CD has tons of it. The melodies and arrangements are more interesting than I've heard from him in a LONG time - - if he weren't such an established artist you might refer to this as a \\"breakout\\" album. It's that distinctive.The PROBLEM (and I'm saying this as a New Yorker) is the Sep 11 thing. It doesn't need to be so strong in a record. It's not that I'm offended, or that it's because I lost friends - - it's just that the theme is SO unrelenting. It needs a break. Imagine a CD of oh you broke my heart and several variations. You'd get bored of that.Mr Boss, I want to send you hugs, but there's a lot more than Sep 11 going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTERPIECE","review":"This album floored me -- I didn't think Bruce and the E's had it in them anymore -- hell, I didn't think rock and roll had it in her anymore. This is classic Bruce and IMHO right up there with his best (BTR, DOTEOT, The River).Poignant . . . hopeful . . . beautiful . . . even fun. (This stuff should be AWESOME live.) \\"Empty Sky\\" resonates with me the most right now, and I think it will be playing in the back of my head every time I look at our skyline (\\"I woke up this morning to an empty sky.\\")I've got to give this album some time to sink in -- and I have a strong feeling it will only get better with time. If you like Bruce, get this ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOMTHING TO SMILE ABOUT","review":"after all the sadness of 9/11, this collection will set you back on a happy note. Bruce seems to capture the feelings of that American tragedy in his haunting songs perfectly. Even if you are not a die hard Springsteen fan, try this one. Let the healing begin."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you criticise","review":"As a Brit I have lived with terrorism for 30 years (thank you to all those who gave the IRA money all those years). So I come at The Rising with a more objective and less emotionally involved view than I'm sure many Americans do. But this is a magnificent set of songs that stand on their own regardless of their obvious context and if there is no other artistic tribute to 9/11 (sorry Brit way round) then this will do for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Bruce","review":"A very nice blend of what Bruce Springsteen does naturally. Typical Springsteen band music which rocks, such as Lonesome Day and the Rising. Sprinsteen's quieter side is presented wonderfully with The Nothing Man and Paradise. The Boss adds international flair with World's Apart with its mix of wonderful Middle Eastern/Pakistani introduction. Overall, a top notch album. I'm from NJ but not a big Bruce fan overall, but something made me buy this album and I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't Stop Listening","review":"Amidst the chaos and sadness that has permeated our country since September 11, 2001, it is good to finally have a songsmith put into words what so many of us have been feeling. How do you express rage, patriotism, anger, loss, and hope all at the same time? If you listen to Bruce and the E-Street Band you realize that you are not alone in this. Bruce has had the ability to put into song the feelings of everyday people without sounding like a cliche' or trivializing what we are feeling or experiencing. We have grown up in the age of Bruce and we know that he will come through for us, showing us that our flaws and faith, as well as our tragedies and triumphs all have meaning. If you buy one album this year, get this one and listen. Over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I am not a real Springsteen fan, my husband is, but I really like this album.

I am a huge fan of the \\"older stuff\\", Darkeness on the Edge of Town, Wild, Innocent & E Street Shuffle, The River; you get the idea. This is up there with the best of them.After purchasing the CD, I dropped it in my magazine in my car and it hasn't left yet. It is on all of the time and my 6 year old daughter knows the words to several tunes and is wondering when I will be seeing him again (I can only hope!)Keep it up Bruce, I love ya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hands-down classic","review":"It's sad to me that some people can't recognize a true 5-star record when they hear it. You should take note the tag lines and e-mail addresses of the people who rated this CD 1 or 2 stars, because they cannot be trusted. There's a reason Rolling Stone made this their first 5-star album of the 2002. There's also a reason some people are hired to write reviews for Rolling Stone and others are relagated to Amazon.com consumer reviews. It has to do with one's ability to listen to something without preconceived notions about what it should sound like. Any review that unfavorably compares Bruce's latest CD to his early work is missing the mark entirely. This is a remarkable album, not only for the quality of the songs but for what it says to those of us who are truly able to listen. Well done, Boss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Once again, Bruce puts his finger on it, lyrically and musically, and delivers a moving classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concert in Denver September 25, 2003","review":"Didn't listen to CD yet. But next best thing was Bruce in person in Denver. He was amazing. And the man has guts! He said his feelings about the need to impeach President Bush and Cheney. And he said all government officials need to be held accountable. Darn straight! And he asked to pray that our soldiers returned safely. You should have heard the cheers. He spoke eloquently and sang from the heart. His songs show his passionate feelings regarding life. There was also a song about those United Farm Workers--the ones who do the work those of us legal aliens won't do--all the back bending labor in the farm fields. Totally timely and awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I just don't get the fascination with the boss. This has got to be the most over produced cd I've heard in ages; it's so heavy, the music is constantly attempting to breath but there's no open airwaves. Having said this, Bruce remains the best live act I've seen. Try Nebraska instead or another artist altogether. I'm confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five years later","review":"When I bought this CD, I had to wrestle with my sense that the sorrow of 9/11 ought not to be commercialized. But then I listened to the songs. I am not a Springsteen fan, but I wanted to thank him for this record. This is a decent and appropriate response to the grief and tragedy of 9/11. And I found a new appreciation for Springsteen as an artist in these songs.I attended a Springsteen concert at Giant Stadium, not far from my home, after this CD was issued. On 9/11, people parked on the highway outside the stadium and watched the smoke from lower Manhattan as it drifted northward across the skyline. But as Bruce sang these songs, the mindless mass of indifferent concert-goers tossed beach balls and drank beer.I tell the story because it points to something essential about this CD - that Springsteen here has achieved something fine with his art that most of his fans cannot appreciate. It is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revelant","review":"The songs in this album have more depth than most \\"rock\\" songs, but then, Mr. Springsteen usually does have depth in his songs. The title song is powerful, and the rest are quite relevant to our time.

It was great to see that Springsteenis writting in accordance with his age and with the figurethat he represents in US. \\"Worlds Apart\\" is a song thatdemonstrates the responsibility with which Springsteentakes his music. I was worried about seeing just anotherone side coin...This album is full of love and hope music with some sadand tragic lyrics.My favorite songs are \\"You're missing\\", \\"Nothing man\\",\\"Waitin' on a sunny day\\", \\"Lonesome day\\".But my really kick me-rock me top songs are \\"My city of ruins\\"and \\"Further on (up the road)\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hopegiving Song For The Victims' Families In The USA!!","review":"When I heared the song the first time I knew that it was a song for giving hope to the families of the victims!I think that it is important for the melody that it isn't sad.The song stands for a new beginning for the USA.I find it good that he sings from the perspective of a fireman who died because the whole world knows that there were a lot of murdered firemen.I think that the song will be (or is) very succesful in the USA and maybe in Germany, too.We'll see. I hope so!!\\"The Rising\\" is a very wonderful song!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of 2002!","review":"Bruce is back, finally! I haven't been fully satisfied with a Springsteen album since Born in the USA, until now. Every song here has something to say. The 9/11 theme is handled with grace and dignity that only Springsteen could provide. The E-Streeters sound better than ever.

The music sounds forced, stale; like a poem without a theme or a rhyme; like a sunset on a clear night. Nothing fresh here, only confused notes and words. This one misses the boat (in my opinion, and after all, these reviews are only opinions).If you can relate to this CD, good for you. If you can connect to the music, good for you. But I know what's good and this isn't good at all.Bruce can do better; he's done oh so much way better!If you want real Springsteen; real hard, raw, innocent, righteous stuff, you gotta try the 'Tracks' 4-disc compilation.

That said, \\"The Rising\\" is a thoughtful rock anthem that brings Bruce back to his glory days. \\"Mary's Place\\" is also decent. Unfortunately, this album smells like a desperate attempt to exploit all the 911 victims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre effort followed by tired live performance","review":"Sadly, as a once loyal suppoter of the boss, I acknowledge that he simply doesn't have it anymore. The E street band has also grown either old or tired or both. I use to see BS at many of the small venues in New Jersey in his heyday. Great shows to be sure. In 2005, the last two shows at Shea stadium were a total disappointment. After starting two hours late, he gave the most lackluster performance to date. Clarence stood there like a rock and barely played. The rest of the band sounded week and loose. Almost as if they really didn't care. The boss was moving around a lot but vocally off key and strained to hit any of the tough notes. What a disappointment. If you're a BS fan, I know you hear it. If your not a fan, don't bother. His day is done. Buy the old records and rejoice in what was once a truly unique talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Hype, Limited Payoff","review":"The sheer mediocrity of this album is astounding. First, Springsteen has completely lost the ability to sing. Gone are the fullness and vibrancy that once marked Springsteen's vocals. We are left instead with a sort of talk-singing that is compounded by a grating nasal affectation. Second, the music simply does not deliver. The album has a noodling, mid-tempo sameness that is only occasionally lifted (Further On, The Rising). The E Street Band might as well be the session players from Human Touch and Lucky Town. Third, while the album packs some degree of lyrical force, the media hype that has surrounded the lyrical content, which Springsteen seems to be feeding, borders on the exploitative. As a fan, I had held out hope . . . but I am sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my New York City.","review":"First off, I must say I am a Springsteen fan. I have all of Bruce's albums/CD's except one. I also live in New York City. So I was enthusiastic when I learned of the inspiration behind Mr. Springsteen's new album. I have to say that after listening to it twice, I'm very dissapointed. Maybe this is Bruce's tribute to NYC and the recent tragic events, but it cetainly wouldn't be my tribute to NYC. I found this album stagnant, noisy, heavy, and (within each track), repetitious. Only tracks 7 and 8, which are lighter, seem to avoid the heavy repetition. Several years ago, Billy Joel, another performer who I greatly admire, released \\"The Nylon Curtain\\". Like \\"The Rising\\", it was heavy and depressing. Billy Joel's next album, after he met Kristy Brinkly, was, in my opinion, his best. I can only hope that Bruce Springsteen can follow in these shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"After hearing all the hype and media push I was expecting a ton more from this album. Being a Bruce fan from the early days, I was hoping for a return to the bigger, \\"movie-like\\" songs of the past. This album has Bruce again in \\"simple\\" mode...simple nursery-rhyme type melodies, a few boring standard chords. It all sounds so obvious. Why can't Bruce say the same message with some more interesting chord changes or a little musical flare? I'm sure the band could handle it. In some cases less is really less, Bruce. Don't believe the media...listen to your friends copy before buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever","review":"Being a fan from the 70's I know I am not going to be on anyone's good list after this, but here goes. This is the worst music put out by Bruce. I think the anticipation of a new E Street cd made people think it is better than it is. It is contrived, polished and sounds as though Bruce was having writer's block. He repeats himself too much and seems to think he is writing the music of the millenium. In future years, I believe people will look back and wonder what all the hype was about, just as they did with Milli Vanilli. I refused to see Bruce on tour due to not wanting to hear the worst drivel he has ever foisted on the public. To me, this is an offering to the almighty dollar, not to the American public as he proclaims. Bruce, Get back to your roots and leave the pr work to someone more suited to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no classics here","review":"I assume its pretty hard to write a whole album about an event such as 9/11. Im sure Bruce Springsteen's heart was in it, but the music is mediocre. No anthems, no raw sound his fans are used to, and the lyrics are pretty cliche. Sounds over produced. None of the instruments are really aloud to shine through. Some people will like it. After all, they are great musicians. I am a musician and am very open minded about all kinds of music; but I couldnt really find anything that grabbed me in this album. Its definately not the Boss we have heard in the past. And I don't think the Boss on this album comes close.One track stood out to me, \\"paradise\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING ALBUM BUT...","review":"AMAZING ALBUM THAT REALLY ROCKS, BUT WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN BRUCE SPRINGSTEENS \\"MARYS PLACE\\" AND SAM COOKES \\"MEET ME AT MARYS PLACE\\" WHICH IS ON HIS GREATEST HITS ALBUM (AND THE NEW \\"PORTRAIT OF A LEGEND\\" ALBUM). BOTH SONGS HAVE EXTREMELY SIMILIAR CORUSES. DID BRUCE USE THIS SONG AS A BASIS FOR HIS?? ANY ANSWERS WOULD BE APPRECIATED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic moanings of a once mighty writer","review":"My wife and I were riding in the car, bored to tears by this album, and started changing the words. If you've listened to the rising, you know which tune the altered words fit into (Empty Sky). Springsteen is trying hard to sound profound on some tracks (Empty Sky), and trying hard to recapture the lost party days of youth on others (Mary's Place). Some tracks, such as Worlds Apart, sound ridiculous -- the multi-cultural thing doesn't work -- Bruce isn't Sting or Paul Simon, and it shows. There have been many raves about the album, but if anyone else's name was on the cover, I doubt it would get more than two stars and a ho-hum. Save your money and buy some of his older stuff, The Rising is lukewarm in places and sounds forced in others."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his greater (and newer) cds.","review":"Even though I like all those old 80s songs that he made (like \\"Born in the USA\\") I think this album has even better songs. I like how he dedicated a whole album (this one) to the people of 9/11. It was a terrible thing that happened to the USA and it was very kind of him to dedicate an album to the victim's families and the victims themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boss is back!","review":"I never thought that I'd own a Bruce Springsteen album, but after watching his CBS concert special in February 2003, I just had to go out and buy this fantastic record. I was amazed by such songs as \\"Into the Fire,\\" \\"Lonesome Day,\\" \\"Countin' on a Miracle,\\" \\"You're Missing,\\" \\"The Rising,\\" \\"Mary's Place\\" and \\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day.\\" After purchasing the album, I instantly fell in love with it. I must also say that I was captivated by The E Street Band. What a group of musicians!Bruce sings and writes with such passion and it shows brilliantly on \\"The Rising,\\" which should have been named album of the year at the recent Grammy Awards. It deserved it.Do not hesitate to buy this album. I know that I'll be buying more of Bruce's records if they're even half as good as \\"The Rising.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Continued Excellence","review":"This is a GREAT record. Not good, GREAT. But after 30 years, what else would one expect from Bruce? A singular talent that shines through on this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so classy !","review":"I am not an expert on perfumes but my love for them has enabled me to distinguish between great and not so great fragrances. Dune falls in the latter category. It is NOT meant for day wear or for young/younger women. I'd call it more like an evening fragrance for more mature women. The top notes are strong enough to give someone a headache ! All of Dior's fragrances are on the musky/heavy on the senses side , so if you are someone who likes light , breezy scents - stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martial artist","review":"An excellent account on the total discipline it would take to overcome an be a modern day Samuari . Excellent writing I read this book in 1974 as a young student in the arts. Have listed all nine novels to be read by my advance students! The author often refers back to the Samuari's training when he encounters adverse situations. As a Master Instructor that is the message we traditional Martial Art Instructors strived to get across to student, training and more training. Marc novels all tell a story an excellent story with great plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strong album, but I prefer PNYC","review":"First, this is a phenomenal album, it creates an amazing atmosphere that feels both new and familiar. However, I gotta say that I prefer the live album PNYC(the dvd is even better.) Aside from the wonder of seeing the band and orchestra deliver an amazingly on-point performance, the interplay between the musicians (as opposed to the loops on the album) makes the songs really come alive. Anyway, Dummy is a great album nonetheless, and if you are coming at Portishead from an electronic, hip-hop or dance angle, then you will probably prefer this to PNYC. But if you're more into jazz, rock or classical than I advise to check out PNYC first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Range","review":"This is almost the perfect album. I bought this recently having listened to it years ago and it was like finding an old classical watch or something. It moved me. The hits are great of course- 'Sour Times' and 'Glory Box'. Songs like this just want you to run out and open a lounge with a blue light or something! Then there is the absolute gem in \\"It's a Fire' with that wonderful bass running through as her voice weaves between the notes. This album is a beautiful moment in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO GOOD","review":"I purchased this album a week ago and it is truly great. Every song is a winner. Very similar to Massive Attack but very distiguished. It sound way ahead of my our time (at least mine). This is trip hop at it's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome till present day!","review":"I've heard so many of these songs prior to even looking at the song list on this CD. Yet, songs I've loved from 6 years ago, I'm still blown away by today....my current favorite is 'Roads'...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never has darkness sounded so sweet.","review":"Talk about defining music for the masses. Portishead delivers a record with music that is so powerful, it sends chills up your spine. The musical soundings of Portishead almost feel like a violent kiss... divine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dummy","review":"I enjoy listening 2 this cd immensely. Truely a gem 4 fans of this music(triphop) one of the best. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Staple On The Trip Hop Circuit","review":"As oxymoronic as this may sound, the album is creepy yet so beautiful. Beth Gibbons has unique and enticing vocal inflections which matches the creepy atmospheric music very well. The beats are so chilling to the bone that it could make Havoc from Mobb Deep blush. Although Beth's energy may not vary from track to track she still does a fantastic job in complementing the dark atmosphere from beginning to end. My favorite song on this record would have to be \\"It Could Be Sweet\\" which has this jazzy lounge type of vibe with a punchy bassline. I also dig the drums on \\"Glory Box\\" which utilizes a vintage Isaac Hayes sample to great effect. This is an excellent entry point to anyone who wants to get into Portishead."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to form","review":"Imagine drinking fire underwater-that is the impression I get, and with the mixture that Portishead delivers on their debute album, it is amazing. Mixing elements of trip-hop, rock, pop, & everything in between make this sometimes darkening, moody, but always thought provoking album one of my favorites in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody and enthralling","review":"One of the best albums I own. It's one of those few albums where you can listen to the whole CD without skipping any track. I always thought trip-hop was kind of cold, wispy, and mechanical, but Portishead dismisses that theory. These songs are full of sadness, frustration, slyness, burning sexuality... I could go on and on with that list. The songs feel like the soundtrack to the dreams and nightmares a lonely soul has late at night, or possibly the songs an insomniac plays to stay awake. Stand-outs are the dancy \\"Strangers,\\" where Beth's vocals flip-flop seamlessly from whisper to wail, \\"It's A Fire,\\" \\"Roads,\\" and \\"Glory Box.\\" Skip the album if you don't like to visit your dark side too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantically tripping melodrama","review":"When I first heard Portishead, I was drawn in by Beth's soulful wailing and the difference this band's music had. There is none to compare in this genre. It's the absolute stuff to listen to on a silent rainy and gloomy nite."},{"rating":"2","title":"underwater music","review":"it drags you in and under, romances you, seduces and rapes. You swim and thrash and grasp for air, but the beat and the melody and the terrible rhythms have you in their grasp.The music is cold and hot and sweet and sour all at once. It takes well known instruments and rhythms from the past and twists them to its own use, mixes them with strangeness and comes up with total originality. Out of a possible five stars, I give it six."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possesed and Distressed...","review":"Trippy and highly bizarre, only extremely open-mided listeners should apply here. This music will test both your patience and senses. The music is a shoe-in for \\"B\\" movie soundtrack stardom. Portishead is more music of the posssessed than the \\"Trip-Hop\\" hype associated with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"like an LP record in more ways than one","review":"The deliberate scratches on some of the tracks are not the only similarities to old LP records. yes, like vinyl Dummy wears very thin with repeated playings. What can be fascinating over three tracks pretty soon becomes formulaic. Just like the Ramones or Status Quo in that respect. It's remarkable how some acts can stretch a good idea out over a whole album or even a whole career."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first trip hop ceedee","review":"This is my first ceedee in the trip-hop genre. It wuz recommended to me by a friend who likes this kind of stuff. At first it wuz a little scary to listen to. But wen it got to track #2, it wuz so haunting. \\"nobody loves meee...its truu\\"Haha that stayed in my mind for a long time so i kept on listening to the ceedee. The vocal is great and the songs sound mysterious. I like to listen to it when i'm doing art and also when it rains. haha i dont knoe why. I know i grew to like this ceedee tho :D. Its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be a \\"Dummy\\", buy this.","review":"I confess to this being one of my desert island discs. I confess that Bono turned me on to this CD as well. ( well not personally ) I was reading Rolling Stone a few years back and Bono was quoted to say that \\"Dummy\\" was his favorite album of the year. I looked into it, and boy, was I ever glad I did! Portishead took the trip-hop stuff from the U.K. and gave it more heart, and more feeling. Songs like Sour Times and Glory Box are so painfully sweet that they become glorious. Every track on this disc also gives \\"Dummy\\" one of the most complete examples of unity within a singe CD. The disc just simply flows, and very beautifully, I might add. Fans of great female voices and CD's like Massive Attack's \\"Blue Lines\\", Everything But the Girl's \\"Walking Wounded\\", and the first Hooverphonic disc, should already have this in their CD collection, everyone should."},{"rating":"2","title":"liked it","review":"My favourite songs on this are 'Strangers' and 'Roads' and that other weird one with all the weird noises , I can't remember all the names, i just know what they sound like! I love the deep, scratchy bass, that heavy feeling, I LOVE that... Dummy is definitely better than the live album."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Sure: A desert-island Cd","review":"\\"Dummy\\" Is one of those Albums that you this reviewer would definitely choose if stranded on a desert island with only 10 or so Cd's to pick from. Of course nobody ever mentions if you have a CD Player..or water for that matter. Anyway, This CD is emotional, depressing, Jazzy, sexy, smart, hip and mellow. One listen, and I guarantee it'll transcend your mindset into a 40's-ish Jazz club, with a modern, sample induced bleep-blurp twist. Not bad, for an MTV Buzz-Clip artist from 1994. True, there is the all-to familiar \\"Nobody loves Me\\" song...but Sour Times is hardly the CD's best track. Check out the Sadness and sexy overtones of Roads, or the Bass-heavy Pedestal. These grooves fester in your subconscious. I've probably heard this Album more times than any other, and I never tire of giving it a listen, for I always find something to appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bow & Arrow Target Hit!","review":"My favorite thing about this album was that \\"Glory Box\\" was played at the end of \\"When the Cat's Away.\\" It's a French film from 1996. That says a lot about how great this album is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic?","review":"When I first listened to Portishead, I was totally enticed by the sound, Beth Gibbons' vocal, the arrangement, it sounds much creepier than Massive Attack. So, that was called 'Trip-Hop', the term was not even invented at that time I suppose, it wasn't until Tricky got famous, correct me if I am wrong. All have been said by the rest of reviewers, I dont want to make this a long review. Just slip this into your CD player and you will find yourself cannot live without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No pretense. Just...","review":"I agree with less pretentious critics of this album, if you are looking for a more musically complex sound try Massive Attack, Morcheeba, or The Mars Volta.But I don't put it in the player for complexity. To me it strips away the foreplay of the \\"trip-hop\\" label, and reduces the moment to something simple and carnal. Beth Gibbons voice in \\"Glory Box\\" drips sex like a jilted, loved-starved Venus."},{"rating":"2","title":"STATIC. CREEPS UP YOU, SLOWLY.","review":"Before purchasing \\"Portishead: Dummy\\" a few months ago I never knew or heard the band and had no idea what \\"trip hop\\" was. \\"What the heck is 'trip hop'\\" I thought before reading its defination as a mixture of hip-hop, soul, R&B and alternative. At the first listen it did not really strike me that much, being a fan of guitar driven, melodic alternative music. Then after listening to Dummy some more, Beth Gibbons' beautiful voice, the samplings and intruments began to creep up on me. Soon I would find myself singing some of the tracks when I'm traveling or on my own and when I get home I would be craving to pop Portishead into my CD player. Beth Gibbons is one of the best female vocalist I've heard in my collection of female artiste so far. This is definately worth the purchase. My favorite songs are \\"Mysterion\\", \\"Sour Times\\", \\"Strangers\\", \\"It Could Be Sweet\\", \\"Wandering Stars\\" and my #1 fave \\"Roads\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dummy","review":"Dummy being Portishead's 1994 release and their debut album and showcases some of the best of the trip hop sound. Songs that particularly stand out on this amazing release are \\"Sour Times\\", \\"Numb\\" and \\"Glory Box\\". The booklet has many fine photographs and a list for each track of whom plays what. The booklet has no lyrics which is a shame. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a trip!","review":"This album carries this deep vague element where you don't know and you don't bother yourself to know,you just sit there,listen and feel the music's cross over,it has this modern gothic sense,at times it's sensual and at times it's disturbing,and that's the secret of this album,in a way it portrays women's emotions through the beats and lyrics. It's more of the subconscious mind kicking in than the conscious mind. It's a slick album that awakens the senses,you don't skip the tracks,you simply let it play,you don't know which one or what kind or where from,like i said,you just listen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"grooooooove time","review":"What a fantastic album. Just what the Dr. ordered to chill with. And the song It's A Fire is one of the most moving and sublime songs I've had the pleasure to listen to. Major kudos (or is that \\"props\\" nowadays?) to all involved!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Masterpiece","review":"This is one of those cds that you buy because you like one song but once you hear the rest of the cd you are totally hooked and can't get enough of it. I must have had this cd in my cd player for about 3 months straight now and I'm still not tired of it even though I play it over and over. It's haunting, relaxing tunes are refreshing from today's repetitive music styles of techno and rap and carbon copy boy bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"No matter what genre of music floats your boat, this album will become one of your favorites. It is a masterpiece. I don't know how they did it. Geoff and Beth went into the studio, slit their wrists, and bled into a microphone. There is so much emotion here. It almost seems like a violent, beautiful battle between Beth's incredible (so good it's scary) voice and Geoff's monumental trip-hop beats. \\"Roads\\" is a song that will affect me for the rest of my life. When you play this song, it will make the whole room reverberate. It's a natural high. Be careful, though. I discovered this track when I discovered depression. And of course \\"Glory Box,\\" a work of genius. This is an essential album. Every track is a standout. I think I will go turn out the lights, sink into my waterbed, and let Dummy overwhelm me. \\"I got nobody on my side, and surely that ain't right. Surely that ain't right.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky moody mix that's not all noise...","review":"Portishead manages to sucessfully blend together dark, moody music with the soultry vocals of Beth Gibbons. The foundation for many of the musical tracks come from old 60's films that are blended together with modern synthesizer and keyboard sounds. These musical tracks are accentuated by Beth Gibbons's vocals which play off the unique sound created by Geoff Barrow, the resident mixer. I'm sure any person ready for a new sound that isn't immersed in oddness will be pleased with This Portishead CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"ingenius, brilliant....ahead of their time.","review":"This album came out in 1994? This band came out with some material that was ahead of their time. With all the electronic music out now, this album sounds pretty \\"fresh\\". I had a friend a while ago recommend this group, but I didn't listen back then...and now I can't figure out why I didn't pick up this album years ago. Every song is great...the beats are PHAT!!!!! Pickup this album....it DEFINITELY WILL NOT DISSAPOINT."},{"rating":"2","title":"mellow driver now","review":"this album is excellent. the music is smooth, the vocals are awsome, and the sound all together is very mellow. i listen to it when i'm in rush hour traffic, to fight the road rage off. if you like trip hop with amazing female vocals, go for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album, ever","review":"This is, simply put, the best album in the world. I am convinced, now, having searched diligently for many years for a better album.It starts off sounding wierd. Then it grows on you a bit -- maybe you find yourself humming along or hearing part of a song in your head. Then, suddenly, you are addicted, and can't live without the CD.What makes it so good is that every single song on the album is worth listening to. No, is a MUST listen-to. There aren't just a few songs that are good.Then there is Beth Gibbons. She is emotional, but so far from cheesy. Despondant, but not the roll-your-eyes-ridiculous despondant. She is REAL. Her voice comes from her heart.And then there is the rest of the music. Brilliant is an understatement. This is the stranded-on-a-desert-island CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack for a sad life","review":"The one drawback to this album might be that listening to it for too long can cause a 'sympathetic depression'. I, however, find the saddness of this album to be almost theraputic and indisputably beautiful.Of all the albums Portishead has put out this is by far the best, and although I can't wait until they turn out another studio album, I think its impossible for them to top this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an essential","review":"There is nothing on this album that mope-rock groups like The Cure didn't do a heck of a lot better. Though the music is intentionally dark and disturbing, lead singer Beth Gibbons caterwauling renders most songs uninteresting at best and unlistenable at worst. \\"Sour Times,\\" the hit single, is an apt description of how listeners will feel after playing this disc. This album does not belong on Amazon's otherwise fine list of Alternative Essentials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetition, Repetition, Repetition","review":"This album is a bore(does the title refer to the purchaser? I think so!). I'm sorry to see people praising an unimpressive effort like this one...why not demand some musical complexity?

The media doesn't matter, the music does!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is awesome.......if you're suicidal!!!","review":"I can't stop laughing at the reviews that condemn this album, because they're so darn precise to me. As I recall, one reviewer wrote, and I quote:\\"After giving this album a few listens, I'm gonna sale this piece of junk\\". Had me laughing to tears for about 10 minutes. You've hit the spot, boy! However, I also laugh at all the reviewers who praise this album, for I feel pity for them. Just a bunch of trend followers who can't tell the difference between good music and, um, trends.Of course there are a couple of good songs, literally speaking, referring to \\"Roads\\" and \\"Glory Box\\", the reasons why this album got 2 stars instead of one. But as a music fan with an open mind, I've heard much better than this, such as Soulstice's \\"Illusion\\" just to name a solid example. As an advice to all you people reading this, don't be a dummy: download this before buying, like I did. Then you decide. Good Luck..."},{"rating":"1","title":"--- not the best in the genre ---","review":"Portishead might be better if Beth's vocals weren't so irritating.

Guess I jumped the gun or my subwoofer wasn't tuned properly or something--sorry!Original review:The singer is lame and every song sounds like it was made with a drum kit that is mixed way (as in too much) out front. In a few words -- boring and dated. There just isn't that much really good pop out there so people have to make a fuss about what they know, I guess. Skip this CD and try something like 'When it Falls' from Zero 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential electronic album.","review":"What can be said that already hasn't been said? I don't think there's much. This must have REALLY seemed ground-breaking at the time: Backbeats that sometimes recall hip-hop elements and some real soaring, soulful vocals from Beth Gibbons. There's not a single bad song on here, and it's most famous for the awesome \\"Sour Times,\\" which sounds at times like a James Bond theme with certain elements. Then there's \\"Numb\\" which is probably my favorite song on the album, real soulful vocals there. You get more blues-rockin' moments like on the record's closer \\"Glory Box.\\" There's occasional samples which rule and sound neat like everything else. If you haven't heard \\"Dummy\\" yet you are in for a real treat. Pretty much everyone who owns it can tell you that it's well worth the hype. It is beautiful and proves electronic music CAN BE full of emotion. Even today, it doesn't sound dated at all. I like the follow-up album too, but advise this as your start."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album of all time","review":"This is my favorite album ever.

And it took me 6 years to discover it! It's not perfect, in fact in a lot of ways it's flawed. But what does flawed mean? A lot of songs on this CD take directions I would not go (being a musician myself), both in melody and in music, but they did. It's art - like I've never heard before. Beth is not the best singer I've ever heard, but there's an honesty about her. It's a dark, haunting, and yet beautiful CD that should not be overlooked. As soon as I heard Roads, I bought it. I didn't even look at the price tag. You can't put a price on expression like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have","review":"This is essential Portishead. This is what started the whole thing for me. The sounds are amazing -- sometimes sweet and melodic, sometimes gutteral and disorienting. I think most bands today try to layer some pretty female voice over mediocre moody/techno music in an effort to copy Portishead, but it always sounds amateurish. I just loved this CD. \\"Glory Box\\" has to be one of the most fantastic songs ever made.

I still can't decide which one is better, the original self-titled album, or Dummy. Both blend AMAZING vocals with a strong beat and gorgeous melody.

It's not mistake that this CD is called \\"Dummy\\" as it is vacuous and hollow. Only the truly prententious and shallow could listen to this overly melodramatic prattle. The lead singer's voice sounds like she's gargling listerine. Perhaps Portishead is purposely playing to the \\"deep\\" set's supposed senstivity and this CD is just a mockery of that genre; or maybe Portishead is trying to contend for the muzak title of the universe.

Beth Gibbons continues to record, but Portishead created such complex and lush soundscapes that their limited catalog is simultaneously disappointing and sacrosanct.The beats and mix of instrumentation, the biting torch song lyrics and the haunting electronic synth bed are still sonically on the cutting edge of what artists are creating 10-12 years later.This album is full of languid trip hop beats that contrast well with Beth's tortured vocals.A must own for serious rock fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE INNOVATION","review":"This is the only album that exists to me in this musical class. It stands out in this \\"trip hop\\" invasion. To me it is the only band that is worthy of shedding this moronic term, \\"Trip Hop\\" FORGET Poe. FORGET Tricky. Maybe even FORGET Morcheeba. This is the one, true innovation, backed by one, true voice and that is of Beth Gibbons. I can say that no other voice has ever touched me the way hers has. I have also never seen a type of \\"underground\\" music that fits into all forms of eclectic taste. I have met all types of intellectuals, children, punks, abusers, lovers, husbands, wives that hold Portishead very dear to their heart. \\"Dummy\\" is a great album to introduce you to Portishead and give you a proper feel for this musical style. You will find yourself craving more. BUT only crave for Portishead in this musical genre.

I read \\"Tokyo Vanilla\\" straight through on a long business flight and was very sorry to see it end (although I did find the ending a bit of a letdown). It is the story of a Japanese college student who gradually realizes his sexual orientation and falls in unrequited love with a handsome Japanese heartbreaker. The plot takes many twists and turns, some of which I found a bit implausible, but overall I enjoyed the ride. According to the cover notes, Thomas Boggs is \\"an American Japanese writer who has spent most of his life in Japan's capital.\\" I cannot speak to the accuracy of Mr. Boggs' description of Tokyo's gay world, but I have definitely placed it on my list of future vacation destinations.

It is not, and he himself recommends (in the book's equally lucid preface) that it be read in conjunction with -- _not_ as a replacement for -- a more conventional translation.Like Mitchell's _Tao Te Ching_, this work is an interpretive rendering -- or, as its subtitle indicates, a \\"modern reading.\\" And a very good one it is; Rabbi Shapiro is one of today's most responsible and insightful liberal-Jewish commentators on traditional Jewish texts.But _do not_ mistake this work for a \\"translation.\\" If you're looking for one, try Rabbi Jacob Neusner's _Torah From Our Sages_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better understanding of Pirkei Avot","review":"This book is helping me take a deeper look into the wisdom of the Pirkei Avot.

This book shows how kids can get hurt by their parents. Lena experience this when her father hurts her deeply.Both of their mother left them. Lena mother died of breast cancer, and Marie mother walk out on her leaving Marie with her father.These are just some of problems these girls face in the book. This is a good book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, full of emotions and real-life drama, read it!","review":"This book is a great book. Ms. Woodson made a great decisions in choosing the main character the age of the readers. It helps us teens understand the story and relate to it. This book has many morals, and do's/don't's. I recommend it to anyone who likes emotional stories. Again, filled with deep eomtions and you can fell the pain and/or happiness of the characters.

This is a great book about race relations and children who loose a parent but the subject of sexual abuse does not provide an answer for children who might be experiencing the same abuse as Lena. The book is rated at a fourth grade level however I am not sure that an average fourth grader would understand the problem of sexual abuse. A good understanding of the whole social issue of sexual abuse must be explained to a child before reading this book. I would hate to see a child who is experiencing sexual abuse read this and come up with the solution of running away from their problems. This could be a good starting point for discussion on possible solutions for Lena's problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"to short","review":"not as bad as some books, but bad all the same.

It's a little more melencholy than her previous releases, both in sound and tone. You've heard \\"Sunny Came Home\\", and the rest of the disc follows in that same mood. This is a classic rainy day disc - the only tune out of place is \\"Nothin On Me\\", which was originally on the \\"Tin Cup\\" soundtrack and is much more upbeat than any of the other songs. And you'll love the swipe at Courtney Love on New Thing Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shawn sings the truth","review":"If you like artists who can truly express them selves without an ad campaign, then Shawn Colvin is for you. If you don't like her, then you probably don't like any music of this kind, after all, she is at heart a folk artist. She won the Grammy for this album, but she won the folk Grammy for her first effort (Steady On). Personally, I think the album takes you in some new directions without straying too far from home. The only reason I wouldn't give it a 10 is because Fat City was even better. Still, in the tradition of all great singer/songwriters, each song tells a story beyond the pop themes of \\"ooh, that girl is cute\\" or \\"look at me, I'm cool\\". There is real substance to them, and you will feel a little of what it's like to be the artist when you hear them. If you're looking for workout music, or something to blast as you speed down the highway, look somewhwere else. If you want good, clear, honest music, then buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's get serious...","review":"Just as Dusty Springfield and Joni Mitchell defined her eras, Shawn Colvin defines hers. Unquestionably the finest singer songwriter of the 90s, I look forward to her continuing as a force in the new millenium. Her studio work, live performances, and now her forays into soundtracks position her as the queen of her genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Song","review":"I don't own this CD, but one song introduced me to Shawn Colvin and her ability to sing. My English teacher played this song during a lesson on symbolism, and I got ADDICTED! Sunny Came Home is a great song and I reccomend this CD to anyone that wants to hear the song that makes me think of how cool my teacher is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A match was lit!","review":"Colvin's first track, \\"Sunny Came Home,\\" is pure brilliance in its complexity and symbolism, but I just noticed something upon listening to this song just moments ago: at the very end of the song, you can hear a real match being lit, and being blown out, completely relevant to the lyrics. It's very subtle, but it adds to the song's significance.Artists like Colvin are great in that new things and new meanings can be found within their songs upon repeated listenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was greatly saddened by this album.","review":"Shawn Colvin had always been one of my favorite artists, in no small part because of her clarity; she was one of the few singer-songwriters who was able to make extensive use of metaphor and symbolism without descending into self-indulgence and turbidity.Unfortunately, that's not true of this album. There are probably only two good songs on this album -- \\"Sunny\\" and \\"Jimmy\\". The rest of this album is painful to listen to; it sounds like a bad parody of Suzanne Vega. The lyrics grate, the melodies are uninspiring, and even Shawn's perfectly quirky voice is in poor form.If you want an introduction to Shawn Colvin, start with her earlier album Fat City -- it's superior in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd is totally boring","review":"I think that the only reason it was popular is because it got a lot of media-hype after she won the grammy for \\"Sunny Came Home\\", which by the way is the only remotely good song on this album. the rest, well, let's just say that when i first put it on, my dog ran away. :c)anyway, if all you want it \\"Sunny Came Home\\", better tape it off the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK-- But I Don't Get It!","review":"Pretty good... but I just don't get \\"Sunny Came Home...\\" What is the song supposed to be about?I prefer my songs more straight-forward, like \\"Burning Down the House\\" by Talking Heads, and \\"I Just Called To Say I Love You\\" by Stevie Wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"A checklist of cliches","review":"\\"I close my eyesI'm hypnotizedI'm walking on a wire? . . . into the fire?!?\\"Possibly the most trite song ever recorded . . .

Playable to the point of exhaustion. In my opinion the best Colvin album, but all of them are worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best yet","review":"With each album, Shawn Colvin moves more into the pop realm and away from the folk music which launched her career. Not that that's a bad thing: Colvin's albums tend to suffer from overproduction, a fault which would ruin almost any folk album, whereas on pop albums it is easily forgivable. Colvin is one of the best songwriters of the 90s and her skills shine on \\"Sunny Came Home,\\" and \\"The Facts About Jimmy.\\" \\"Sunny,\\" with its catchy melody and symbolic lyrics, deserves to be a hit. Another highlight is \\"Wichita Skyline,\\" on which gorgeous synth chords glimmer like a sunset. A Few Small Repairs does lag in a few spots. Colvin's voice doesn't have the grit to pull off the gravelly vocal she attempts on \\"I Want it Back,\\" and \\"84,000 Different Delusions\\" simpers along to a rather weak melody. Overall, however, this is a well-crafted album by a mature, thoughtful artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Spiritual CD","review":"The song \\"Sonny Came Home\\" is a wonderful song that realy involves the listener.Many other songs are touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Listening Experience","review":"This CD is wonderful. \\"Trouble\\" is, by far, the best song on the disc - it's sexy and haunting. \\"If I Were Brave\\" is a close second in loveliness. Shawn has an angel's voice and a poet's heart. If you like folky women singer types, this is right up your alley. I think that this CD and \\"Cover Girl\\" are her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colvin's Worst Album Still OK by Everyone Else's Standards","review":"What are you guys talking about? \\"Sunny Came Home\\" is not a great song, no matter how many times it gets played on the radio. Interestingly, the better songs on this CD are the ones without a co-writer (John Leventhal). Did Leventhal purposely make this album worse in production that it already was? I'm glad Shawn Colvin won a Grammy, because I thought she deserved one for \\"Steady On\\", but not for this CD. It's weak compositionally and performance-wise. (Perhaps the cigarette in her hand on the back cover has something to do with it?) Then again, I'm judging Colvin by the high standard that she set for herself early on. It's just too bad she hasn't been able to meet that standard again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating idea...","review":"Robert Hanson, a researcher who heads up a team monitoring a space probe, gets strange data and even a video of an extra-terrestrial ship which stuns the team. But, his company wants it kept quiet. Why?This near-future novel gets more and more involved as Hansen is drummed out of work and suspects a conspiracy. He's right, but he has no idea HOW high the conspiracy goes. Ed Lerner, a research engineer, has woven a Crichton-like story with intelligence and science that keeps you reading chapter after chapter..IF you like this kind of stuff.Lerner certainly know HIS stuff..the tech is spot-on and readers may quibble with some things, but generally it's a good bedtime/airplane/vacation read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty miserable product","review":"The reader has been pretty fun for my child, though it's been finicky from the beginning. The binding of the books bend and becomes difficult to seat in the reader properly, the pages of the books tear easily and the mechanism that determines when a book is present and the device is open often doesn't know when a book is in place and the device open.Aside from the mechanics of the product, the stories are often cheezy, over-simplified and poorly read. The overall effect is often to suck the life out of interesting stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice debut","review":"There is no question that this is a first album, especially for Cockburn, as none of the anger and seriousness that would show up in his later (and more recent) work was here yet. That said, these songs are light and breezy, gentle folk songs that make for pleasant listening on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Bruce was off to a good start, but he got a lot better very quickly..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You pay your money and you take your chance","review":"For completists only. Bruce's unremarkable debut gives little hint of the wonders to come. If you have the rest, then by all means you will enjoy hearing where it all began.

I am a big Josh Lewin fan, and was disappointed when he left telecasting the Tigers with Kirk Gibson to join the Texas Rangers. I grabbed the book as soon as I saw his name as the author, and I thought I was going to read about Josh's baseball experiences and the making of trades during baseball's winter meetings. Instead, the book is about minor league teams auditioning audio tapes of prospective announcers looking for a minor league job at baseball's winter meetings in Nashville. Some information is also provided regarding team mascots. Had I looked at the book's contents before I bought it, I would have put it back on the shelf.

I figured since the band was unheard of aside from that one song that the album would be a one good track kind of thing. Was I wrong! Stamp, for all of its pubescent charm (what 18 year old boy wouldn't like a song with a hook like \\"we eat my box while I work\\")Stamp is not even the best song on this record.

The gauge is easy to read, had to put the rubber foot pad in the sun to heat it up so it slipped on the base easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems well built, but has function issues","review":"This pump was a letdown. That is a shame because it appears to be quite solid and well built. The air gauge high on the pump made it nice to read. The only problem I encountered, and it was a deal breaker, was the head would not consistently make a good seal on either Presta or Schrader valves. I am convinced that they have not really developed a head that is capable of fitting both types of valves and I don't care for the delicate nature of the dual head models. I returned this pump because it simply was not usable with this head. I intend to purchase a quality pump exclusively made for Presta valves - probably a Lezyne or Silca. I will use my old one for the rare times I need to fill a Schrader valve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same as before...","review":"Though the quality is not as great as the previous script books, Volume 3 of Season 2 does have some of the best scripts of the season!The book is slightly smaller than the previous 4, yet holds as many scripts.

It is definitely not for history lovers who want to be introduced to King Philips War and the times around it. Rather, it is for readers who already know all the facts they want to know and who want to read a detailed discussion of the relationship between English colonists and the local Native Americans.The main theme of the book is interesting, and the author does have a fresh point of view. But she hammers her point so hard she has managed to drive the life out of the book.The decision to discard a linear time scale in the book was very distracting, especially for this reviewer who was not that well versed in the actual time course of events.On a positive note, the decision to include direct quotes from writers of the period with intact spelling was a great one, these tidbits into the past are what ultimately make the book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanciful, repetitive, lacking substance, needs editing","review":"The difficulties that I had with the book (repetitiousness, tediousness and a predilection for fanciful metaphors, speculation and conclusions) could be attributed to a promising young authoress in need of an rigorous editor. Or so I thought. But Mr. Wood in his Review of the book in the NY Rev of Books who saw these same defects suggests that these difficulties may represent a trend. He even puts a label on it. \\"Post modern history\\". I hope not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One New Englander's opinion...","review":"Having lived my whole life in Massachusetts between Nashoba, Groton and Chelmsford, I was quite dissapointed with the book's lack of details about actual events of the war.Lepore generates some excellent insights into early Colonial society in NE and its attitudes towards Native Americans, but the lack of any timeline for the events of the war makes the book very difficult to follow. The book is really more of an essay about perceptions of war rather than what actually took place.The reader receives bits of information about important conflicts only sparingly. The majority of the book contains detailed perceptions and quotes about the war from significant people of the time. I was left craving for more details about the actual events of the war that never materialized.A positive aspect of the book is that it is very thought provoking overall and really makes the reader question the perceptions of war from many historical accounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"And this mess won a Bancroft?","review":"The Bancroft is the history profession's Pulitzer, so I was looking forward to being edified. What I got instead was an impenetrable tome consisting mainly of fashionable deconstructionist babble about how war is defined among different cultures. I read and read and never found a coherent narrative about what this war was supposed to be about or what it had to do with American identity.Perhaps this \\"language of academe\\" impressed the Bancroft committee, itself made up of pedants, but to the common reader, whom the academy putatively serves, this thing is worthless. I have the feeling that these guys began reading, and when their eyes started to glaze over they said, \\"My kind of history!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Name of War","review":"If this was the first book I ever read, it probably would be the last! The book is awfull and difficult to understand. It has very little to say about the way of indian life and the wars caused by settelers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Bother","review":"Lepore provides nothing new. Instead, this biased account of King Philip's War offers a guilt-ridden, white leftist's view of the conflict. In a nutshell: the battles and massacres would have never occurred had the White-Man remained in Europe. Written by a clip-haired liberal, the author does not weigh all the factors contributing to the Native Americans' defeat. Instead she focuses on ad hominem examples, and the marginalization of natives as inferior charity cases. This book is void of insight, balance or compassion. Lepore portrays the Indians as Noble Savages and helpless victims of white greed. Bottom line: Read Leach's seminal work, Flintlock and Tomahawk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Left-Wing Polemic","review":"If it wins a Bancroft Prize, you know it's bad (Remember how \\"Arming America\\" was exposed as a complete fraud?).One gets the sense that Lepore took one too many women's studies classes as an undergrad. Read Daniel Mandell's history of King Phillip's War for a real history of the conflict or Philbrick's \\"Mayflower.\\" If you want to learn about the war, and not all the \\"feelings\\" that may or may not surround it, then avoid Lepore at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Name of War","review":"Lepore argues that the brutality practiced by both sides during King Philip's War led the colonists and Native Americans to define themselves as culturally distinct from each other. After the war, the English colonists defined themselves as being neither cruel colonizers (like the Spanish) or savages (like the Native Americans) leading to an identity that was the basis of being American rather than English. The Algonquians in New England, who in the 17th century, defined themselves against the English colonists and their Iroquois neighbors, began to change from a tribal identity to a pan-Native American identity. These new identities influenced the relationship between the English colonizers/Americans and the Native Americans into the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"More about Colonial identity than the war","review":"The Colonial identity was the main part of this book. While the war was the backdrop as it created the thesis that the war helped to strengthen differences between Indians and Colonials, much of the book talks more about how the colonists viewed the Indians. Increase Mather's effort to help the Christian Indians is mentioned in great detail, something that I have never read before. Overall I'd say it was a fun read for anyone interested in colonial American history.My only problem with the book has already been stated by others, the book talks little about the events of the war and more about perceptions during, before and after the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative views and filled with gore","review":"I recently read this book for a Colonial American History class and unfortunately had to write a paper on it. I would never have read it otherwise. Lepore's thesis argued that the language and words of war are used to create the identity of a group of people.It is possible for an historian to analyze and interpret primary documents and form an arguement without exposing an apparent bias against a group or groups of people. Lepore failed in this aspect. As her arguement unfolded, the negative views against the Puritans were clearly present from her remarks concerning the Mathers to the stripping of the Puritan's cultural background.While this book is not necessarily about King Philip's War, it is filled with gore. So if you would like a literary treatment of bloody massacres or if revisionist history is your preference, read this book. If not, find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting discussion on war \\"spin\\"","review":"As has been stated by prior reviewers, this book makes some valid observations on the language of war, but the lack of a chronological account and the repetitive speculations as to the motives of the NEers, make an otherwise well written book and its gifted author bypass an oppotunity to bring this War to a new generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-Scholarly Treatment","review":"I started this book, thinking that it would give me a background in understanding this important episode in English/Indian history. However, I got so disgusted by the author's seeming attribution of every possible event in this period to one particular individual (Sassamon) that I quit reading it. Example: On pg. 33f, Eliot wrote of three Natick Indians who got drunk. The author implies (with no evidence) that one of them was Sassamon (\\"If he committed these shameful ... then Sassamon would have sorely disappointed Eliot\\").

I especially like many of the witty lyrics and some of the satire and sarcasm they contain (i.e., Song for Whoever). They seemingly play on some of the ironies and oddities that life and love have in store for us all over a lifetime. Certainly, if the lyrics are any indication, this is band that didn't take themselves too seriously and likely had great fun penning and performing these gems. As with any complete collection of songs, I prefer some of the songs over others, some of my favorites being Song for Whoever, 36d, Let Love Speak up Itself, Bell Bottomed Tear, One Last Love Song, and Prettiest Eyes (even with the onset of those crows feet).

Fascinating characters, developed with rare empathy. Complex plot, well-executed. Wrapping up the loose ends (the search for Ariane)was a slow-down & a let-down, but a small price to pay for a narrative I found nearly impossible to put down, even while Tiger Woods was on my TV screen performing his form of magic.I will pursue the Kay Farrow series with the expectation of continued enjoyment.

She did seem androgenous, as did everyone in that book. There was no need to keep repeating about her color blindness--which the author made sure we were aware of on at least every page. It became clear who the killer was about one third into the book, and then it just dragged on and on--all these boring little sequences about Kay's akido class and her mentor. It was poorly written and read like a diary. Also, the author's perception of San Francisco seems way off--walking from the Hall of Justice to Pacific Heights is a long long way, all uphill, not something you do in ten minutes. He makes it sound like everything in SF is ten minutes apart by foot. And what woman prowls the streets of rough areas at night, alone, and with an expensive camera around her neck?

He was so busy explaining how marginalized people are really great, that he forgot to include much of a plot. Other annoyances: The bad characters are obviously bad from their first appearances; The lead character, Kay, is living too well in SF for what she earns and somehow turns into an ace detective overnight.To be fair, my favorite suspense/thriller authors are folks like James Ellroy, Ian Banks, Nelson Demille and Walter Mosley, where nearly everyone is bad to some degree,you are never quite sure what will happen next and bad things happen to main characters. The author matches these guys in atmospherics. The San Francisco backdrop was probably my favorite part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, entertaining and different!","review":"This is a fast read that keeps you going on and on to see what's next.

It certainly was entertaining and different in taking the reader to the underworld sex scene in San Francisco, without being judgemental! I found the book's characters well described and believable, regardless of what other reviewers say, and I thought at times that this book had been written by a woman by the way the intimacy and feelings were described for Kay when she was with her Sasha.

More entertaining and satisfying, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable writing","review":"I picked up this book knowing nothing about the story, or Redbook's web site or anything, but the writing style and flow really intrigued me. It's a nice casual style, like getting an email from an old friend. There's some laugh out loud funny bits, and some brutal truths.But like one other review said, it veered off into the unbelievable once in a while. I believed everything with Eddie, but once he was gone, it felt like the book lost track, it wasn't sure where to go.That said, I'll pick up the sequel. The first half of the book is still great for the enjoyment it gave me.

And I also think \\"There We Are\\" is James' autobiographical song about him and Carly getting stories from a particular television programme.\\"Another Gray Morning\\" is a depressing song from what I've read.But the rest of them are quite good. \\"If I keep My Heart Out Of Sight\\" is such a nice song which I think is about himself being cheered and overcoming sadness. \\"Traffic Jam\\" has got such a smashing tune to it with gospel music in the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in every respect","review":"The music is classic James Taylor, which means it's good stuff you like him, so I won't try to sell you on the music.The SACD multichannel mix is fabulous. Taylor's voice is almost exclusively in the center speaker, so a good center speaker is necessary to fully enjoy this. The surrounds are a solid but subtle improvement over stereo. On a few occasions they catch your attention, which I always like in moderation, but mostly they just provide a nice ambience. Carly Simon's bit at the end of Terra Nova is an exception, where she does three parts and they come from different locations. Great mix. Overall this is just great. I wish all of my SACDs were this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, benchmark quality SACD surround disc.","review":"I completely mirror Skytag's review. Great sound quality with an excellent mix by Nathaniel Kunkel (a talented family, to be sure!). I personally prefer predominantly ambience oriented mixes like this as opposed to a lot of discrete instrument presentation in the surround channels. I want to be listening to the band, not be IN the band. But, to each there own. Also, the often unfortunate use of the Aphex Aurel Exciter during the recording of this album does not seem to have degraded the natural quality of James' voice. This is not a hybrid SACD. A solid 5+."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Used To Think I Was Cool, Running Around On Fossil Fuel","review":"Good Lord, what was James Taylor eating for breakfast in 1977? 'JT' is his best album by a such a wide margin it's difficult to fathom. Yes, he'd already created some fine songs over the years, but never before with this sort of consistency. Or this sort of versatility: in addition to the usual ballads and bright pop (and that supremely fine cover of \\"Handyman\\"), he creates a tough, sardonic rock'n'roll in \\"Honey Don't Leave L.A.\\" and \\"I Was Only Telling A Lie\\" as well as one of the great C&W epics of the decade in \\"Bartender's Blues.\\" What a wonderful singer Taylor is, and what gorgeous melodies he writes, what wry, understated lyrics. 'JT' is not exactly the first record I associate with that great music year of 1977 -- the seminal punk acts come to mind first -- but 'JT' is nonetheless a kind of masterpiece, a perfect moment in which a songwriter made it all look easy. After this, it never looked easy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's some additional info","review":"Song info: ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE - BLACKBIRD - BLESS THE BEASTS AND CHILDREN - CANDLE ON THE WATER - CHILD OF MINE - CIRCLE OF LIFE - COLORS OF THE WIND - COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS INSTEAD OF SHEEP - EBONY AND IVORY - EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL - FLOWER THAT SHATTERED THE STONE, THE - FRIENDS - FROM A DISTANCE - GET TOGETHER - GOD BLESS THE U.S.A. - GONNA BUILD A MOUNTAIN - HE AIN'T HEAVY...HE'S MY BROTHER - I AM YOUR CHILD - I BELIEVE - IF I RULED THE WORLD - IF WE ONLY HAVE LOVE - IMAGINE - IMPOSSIBLE DREAM (THE QUEST), THE - IN HARMONY - IT'S IMPOSSIBLE (SOMOS NOVIOS) - LOST IN THE STARS - LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE - LOVE IN ANY LANGUAGE - MAKE YOUR OWN KIND OF MUSIC - ONE SONG - ORDINARY MIRACLES - RAINBOW CONNECTION, THE - TEARS IN HEAVEN - TURN!

I've been to 4 Barry White concerts, and one of the most memorable events in my life was when I met my idol in 1982. That was a dream come true for me. I'm half-way through this book, but couldn't wait to post a review. Every Barry White fan has to read this book. It is really amazing; where Barry White grew up, what he experienced, and how he came to be what he is today.

This story of his life is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medical AND Historical Incompetence Combined","review":"This book has achieved 'classical' status among a certain segment of the population that views history through an ideological lens without the need to process factual information. Unfortunately, this work is lightly regarded by professional historians who take competence seriously. The author has no competence in either the history of medicine and therapeutics, or clinical gynecologic pathology. The work relies primarily on secondary sources, is full of anachronisms, and is useful mainly as a good example of what medical and social history should NOT be. Thoughtful readers might like to read the devastating review of this book in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine. Don't waste your money on this one. Start with Shorter's A History of Women's Bodies or Irvine Loudon's classic Death in Childbirth, if you want to find out what women's lives were like, from a legitimate medical point of view, a century and a half ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"T.

Why do people want to waste their time reading this crap? If you are looking for the truth, why on earth would you read a book that does nothing, but try to tear down and demean someone or something. This is obvious garbage. If you want to know about something, go to the actual source, don't go to someone who has a vendetta or whose only point is to tear down something.

If you set the slicer down flush with your cutting board you'll notice the problem immediately. The wire doesn't actually touch the cutting board, but floats above it just a little because the roller has a greater height. So basically when you go down vertically on your cheese block, at the end you'll have to kind of finesse it through to make an entire cut. This is a big problem with softer cheeses because the downward pressure you apply creates a bubble of sorts towards the bottom which gets caught up in the roller.

What a bummer. The handle on this slicer is too short. It is so awkward to hold it. And to adjust thickness of a slice, you need to unscrew not 1, but 2 screws (one on each side instead of one is the middle) and make sure they are both even, otherwise your slice is going to be crooked. Blah.

Think of it like your standard cheese slicers purchased locally, but on steroids lol.There is a nice hefty weight to the handle which is a solid cast metal. The roller also appears to be a nice heavy duty aluminum. The wire appears to be just the right side, and the extra wire it comes with is always nice as well.I deducted a star simply because this is a very beefy slicer, and I would like to see them tone down the size/weight a little while maintaining the great quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already broken","review":"My son was trying to adjust this tool after we had owned it for about a week. The roller wouldn't tighten properly. He used a little more force and it broke. Before it broke, the size of the roller was an issue. The block of cheese being sliced would chill the roller. Moisture would condense on it. Thin slices would stick to the roller and get wrapped around it.

Specifically, the only cheese I use is a very hard cheddar, and the abnormally heavy wire in this slice seems to tear its way through more than cut. Much more force is required than other cutters with thinner wires, and the edges of the cheese slices are ragged. Chunks tend to tear free and gum things up as well.I'm sure for lighter cheeses this slicer would be ideal, but for a heavy cheddar it isn't the best bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this slicer!","review":"This cheese slicer is awesome.

They just take up so much space in the mix at and choke out every last grain of decency from even the better songs (the only decent songs are \\"Your Wildest Dreams\\" and \\"The Other Side of Life\\").Honestly though, I'm most upset with the complete sidelining of Ray Thomas on this album and the follow-up. It's tragic how Ray (and Graeme) were all but pushed out of the band in favor of Hayward and Lodge. Poor guys.Bottom line: Hideous eighties plastic trash. One of the worst sell-out type albums in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly The Other Side Of Life","review":"This is the worst Moody Blues album ever. Not much good came out of 1986, and the Moody Blues proved it with processed music and slick production. The best songs are the Hayward hits, including \\"Your Wildest Dream\\" and \\"The Other Side Of Life.\\" The best Lodge song is \\"It May Be A Fire.\\" The best Hayward/Lodge song is \\"Running Out Of Love,\\" and the other best song would have to be the Edge/Moraz song \\"The Spirit.\\" The rest of the album is largely forgettable, and I would not recommend this recording, even to Moody Blues fans. All the other 1980's albums by the Moody Blues are at least 3-1/2 stars, but this '86 outing ranks the lowest at two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull album from a bunch of has beens","review":"Even in their lat 1960s heyday, The Moody Blues were not exactly the most energentic band in the world. By 1986, this bunch of aging hippies had pretty much exhausted thier supply of interesting songs. I bought this album for \\"Your Wildest Dreams,\\" which is a pleasent enough single. But most of the rest of the album sounds like recycled ELO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing!","review":"This album is simply stunning. The album is Killwhitneydead's heaviest album, and the most well composed. All the songs sound very distinguished and all have their own moments. This album is really good, not not flawless, that's why I gave it a 4 out of 5. There are some parts where the audio clips are a little too long, and prevent the overall flow of the album or \\"music\\". I still think that this album is worth listening, and worth buying. This band has worked on so much stuff, and this album came out to be the very best. I do agree that this band will release better music in the future as their music is constantly getting better within every release. Definitely check out the other albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality for the price.","review":"I got this item on sale with free shipping, so I only paid about $120. This bookshelf is great quality and looks good in my living room. It doesn't look cheap like some of the other bookshelves I've seen in this price range. The only flaw is that the directions have no writing, so if you're good with pictures and arrows you should be okay, but if you rely on written directions it can be a bit confusing to follow. Fortunately I got it right on the first try and it went together quickly and easily once I figured out what I was doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ernest at his best","review":"Jim Varney was one of the few masters of modern slapstick comedy and this is one of the best of the Ernest series. From the wild carpet shampooer, to the electrified and magnetized Ernest, to the pen that explodes in his mouth at Jury Duty - this one is good for laughs over and over again. Highly recommended, safe for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ernest fan who thinks this one is OK.","review":"Not Ernest's best work, but good enough. I saw Slam Dunk Ernest several years ago and remember it being good, it was a bit dissapointing this time around.

There is another copy of this out there for 30 something bucks that is. However this copy even though it states 3D and Blu-ray it is not. It is a blu-ray that you watch through red-blue paper glasses. If you want to comment that I should have read the description or whatever , don't bother. I will read them more closly in the future because this one movie had to be misleading.

I was truly amazed at the quality of 3D, never thought I would live long enough to see this on a TV. Several people have watched it and I love watching them dodge the pickax..fun. Now I need to find more 3D BD movies. I am going to see Avatar and hope it comes out in 3D BD. If I was just giving a rating on the 3D quality it would have gotten 5 stars, but as a movie in general just a 3, so I split the difference and give it a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Bloody Valentine 3D","review":"The thing about this movie was, I enjoyed it even better the second time around, even though I knew how it would all play out.

They really did a good job making you believe in and feel for these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"good 3d in a decent remake.","review":"I have both versions of this film: the original 1981 version on blu ray. Which is a fine low budget slasher flick. And this one (2008) which is very much the same only it's in 3d. The 3d looks great on this one. This was first put out on green red glasses format and then re-released in the newer 3d format. The first one is not good 3d for obvious reasons. The second one using the new 3d shutter glasses is very good 3d. The movie is a typical slasher with a mad axman running around. But it has some good actors in it, the first had unknowns and that was still good for it's genre. THis one was shot in 3d so it's very effective for sure. If you don't like these type of movies then you will hate this one. If you do you should find enjoyment in this typical slasher flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!

I bought it, got it out to my car and opened it, and couldn't believe how poorly this movie was packaged. It looked like Edward Scissorhands and Freddy Krueger played frisbee with it. I don't know maybe they had a five year old child in charge of packaging. The disc is double sided and the 3-D glasses are sitting on top of the 3-D side of the movie.

The same movie in theatres used proper 3D tech. With blu-ray 3D spec out, i can't believe they'd do this to their customers. If at least they clearly stated so on the box. Instead it's made to look like all other blu-ray 3D titles.When watching this movie in 3D with attached red/blue glasses, entire movie looks like all colors were faded and only green and grey left. This will give you a headache and leave you feel cheated.3D effects itself were a lot better in theatres. With fake red/blu glasses you do not get nowhere near the same 3d effect.If this was a proper 3D blu-ray, i'd rate the movie itself at 6.0 or better for fun usage of 3d effects.Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only thing ok is the 3D","review":"The movie itself has too much special effects and not enough story to keep interested, ends up being boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLU RAY DISC WON'T PLAY","review":"Hi, just tried to watch this movie on my Blu Ray player.

This is NOT the 3-D version you saw in the theater. The disc has a re-done old style green and red 3-D treatment. It comes with Green/Red 3-d glasses. Compared to the True 3-d version seen in theaters, this looks like absolute crap. I could not watch it for more than 3 minutes without getting a headache, and the 3-d effects do not work nearly as well. The ONLY good thing about this release is that they give you the 2-d version on the flipside of the disc. No where on the product does it say you are getting a stripped down 3-d version. FAIL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gimmick that works!","review":"This is a great port from the theatre version, I guess. Obviously, it won't match the huge screen feel you get from an actual projection theatre (although I didn't see the movie at the theatre) but I can tell. The 3-D actually works, it comes with 4 glasses to share with friends, the better and bigger screen you got, the better and more impressive the feature works. That aside, the movie itself wasn't bad. It was more than just a hack-n-slash film as it tries valiantly to build characters and a storyline, albeit absurd, with a straight face. The performances were great, with the exception of the lead, Jensen Eckles. All in all, great movie, worth the purchase if you are a fan of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. They don't make movies like this these days.

Well, I was pleasantly shocked to find the new version very entertaining! Is it a deep story w/ wry, socio-political commentary? Nah, but it sure is a blast to watch! As remakes go, this one is excellent. All of the ingredients are present, including violence, splatter, nudity, and a mysterious killer. I watched MBV in 2D, and still enjoyed every second! It was nice to see Tom Atkins (THE FOG, HALLOWEEN 3, MANIAC COP, NIGHT OF THE CREEPS) up and around! He adds a certain maturity to the proceedings.

This is Bush League.My Bloody Valentine is an extremely formulaic horror flick, geared for young teenagers and drunken, easily-amused gorehounds. However, the youthful crowd soon gets alienated by the insertion of full frontal nudity. And when the CGI-bloodbath gets splashed sloppily upon the screen, you might be ready to chop off some heads of your own.Throw in the bad acting, stagnant storyline, and ridiculous plot twists, and you have an easily-passable glossy-cute little horror show....and yes, I stayed in a Holiday Express last night"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait to Own!","review":"This was a cool movie. It had one purpose - to show the story of a serial killer miner...in 3-D. And it did this and nothing else, to its credit. The story did not attempt to become an elaborate story of anything other than a visually engaging slasher experience in 3-D. Had it tried to offer meaningful character development, or introduce plot threads that did more than confuse the audience as to who the actual killer is...I probably would have hated the movie. But it did not none of this. It had one mission, and executed very well.The message - one's ability to enjoy a movie is directly dependent on one's expectations entering the movie. If you expect a richly detailed story with palpable characters, look elsewhere. If you expect a slasher film in the glory styles of the 80's with the benefits of modern special effects thrown in, then happy times are here to come.

I had the pleasure of seeing this with my ex-girlfriend, whom I haven't seen in eight months. (We're still friends.) We both thought this remake was pretty good. I loved all the gory deaths and thought all the deaths with the pickaxe were very creative! The remake is pretty different than the original. Ten years after a Valentine's Day Massacre, Tom Hanniger returns to Harmony to sell the coal mine. Soon after, the murders start again. Another part I loved was when the smokin' hot naked girl was running around and trying to get away from the coal miner. I didn't get to see it in 3D, but that was okay.

The movie was also strained and stretched. Unlike the original, this move revolved too much around the killing as opposed to a story with a motivated serial killer. Had the producers redid the original, but only modernized it with cell phones and such, this one would've been better. The original is a classic. As usual , in most modern slasher flicks, the producers substitute blood and guts for a good story. This is one I wish I had rented before I bought, but is not a wasted purchase.

The producer turns it up way too loud in the mix and it overpowers everything, presumably to make it danceable, but who knows? And of course the stupid rapping! Horrendous. Tell you what, lose the Fugees, keep the singer and bring in some REAL musicians like the ones that played on the original Roberta Flack version.

Of course no one made the attempt of calling her racist, because that's the way this country's media has been controlled lately.Musically, the album is not that bad. I'm going off what I heard on the radio a few years back. But there are tons of albums out there that aren't \\"bad.\\" It's what you say in your music, what you do with it, the message you try to convey that makes the album.

So I still give it to Wyclef for keeping it real."},{"rating":"2","title":"This classic \\"scores\\", but its got a few weak spots.","review":"Yo the Fugees have (or should I say had) some serious talent and a great mix of rappers, and most of these tracks really are classics, but quite a few are unnecessary and I have a few ideas on what kinds of tracks they should have done more on. First off, Cowboys is unnecessary and I seriously think that hip hop and the west dont mix, as shown by Will Smith's pitiful movie. But getting back on track, this cd is hot, with a great mix of soulful Lauryn Hill r and b (Killing Me Softly), songs that mix rap and r and b (Ready or Not and Fugeela), and dark but great pieces like the title track. Also check out the offbeat How Many Mics, the well sampled Zealots, Manifest and the remixes. Peace out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fugees are welcome in the desolate landscape of modern rap!","review":"Modern rap has taken some disappointing turns since the deaths of 2Pac and Biggy Smalls. The Fugees bring back the politically conscious lyrics and excellent beats from the late-80's-early-90's.

There is absolutely NOTHING in Hip Hop today that even comes close to the essence of this album, lol, except Lauryn's MISEDUCATION and Wyclef's CARNIVAL.

'killing me softly' by roberta flack and 'no woman, no cry' by bob marley'... they did a great job on both but normally if a artist does a remake it would only be one on the album...'ready or not' IS one of my favourite songs in hip-hop history... they wrecked this song.... too bad that mario winans dude did a bad job on his remake..... pras was flawless on this song... lauren hill sounded like a angel, and wyclef keeps it crunk as usual...this album is hot to def and you need to buy it soon nobody should have this LP if you are a true hip hop fan..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best rap album of 1997","review":"Before this album came out, I had already heard of the Fugees.

So i went out and bought the Fugees cd cuz i heard their stuff from the past, and thought they were fresh, so i bought it. I dont know what the hell took me so long to go buy this record. This is possibly one of my top 10 albums of all time. I think that the old school beats, the lyrics, the flow of the group is crazy fly. I think that all hip hop fans should go cop this album right now, if you dont already have it. This is no doubt a classic album, one of the best of all time.

I have not heard \\"Baypath Rd.\\" which was the collection they released BEFORE this one, but I understand it was very good - If it ever is re-released, I will definitely snap it up. I sincerely hope this CD remains a word-of-mouth favorite of an increasing number of happy listeners for a very very long time - it surely deserves to be.

Students today will not only be bored, but also confused.The book attempts to teach a concept first, before the student has experienced what is being taught. As a comparison, this would be like teaching a baby how to write the letters of the alphabet BEFORE teaching the baby to speak, with the child experiencing sound and trying to emulate the sounds heard.Please do yourself a favor and rise above this old type of teaching, which produced dry, mechanical music knowledge.

The GSI has now released a statement agreeing that it is a forgery...A word to the wise: Approach \\"great scientific discoveries\\" that are published in the popular press before peer review is completed with great caution, be it ossuary inscriptions or cold fusion. For the authors to rush to publish a book before the IAA had completed their work was very unscholarly. I am afraid that they have permanently damaged their reputations.Addendum: The ossuary owner, Oded Golan, has been arrested by the Israeli authorities on charges of fraud and forgery. According to the news reports he had a number of other artifacts \\"in various stages of production\\" in his shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homework wasn't done.","review":"The problems with Witherington's explanation of the central point of this book are so numerous, the Catholic Answers website devoted a whole article to it called \\"Bad Aramaic Made Easy.\\" Witherington claims that there is an Aramaic word for cousin, much to the amazement of Aramaic scholars, and he makes this baseless assertion without ever telling us of the Aramaic word he has in mind!The only redeeming quality of this book is that the co-author, Shanks, undercuts Witherington's claims. The authors should have consulted experts and each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Joke!!!","review":"Uh..hello..The box is a fake. Shanks and Witherington are too quick to overlook important FACTS in a desperate attempt to show the existence of truth behind the mythology they blindly follow. I am so glad that I didn't pay for this book. I don't want to be responsible for enabling their fairy tale chasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"UPDATE on the Ossuary Authenticity","review":"Since the book was written, and after many of the reviews were written, the ossuary has been found, indeed, to have been a genuine ossuary with forged writing. It is no longer supposed the final resting place of the bones of St. James the Just, brother of Jesus.Of course, one may still profitably read the story of the ossuary, and review some of the debate over its authenticity, as presented in the book; it forms a recent history about science of the antiquities, and about human foibles.The second half of the book, an introduction to James, is entirely unrelated to the ossuary. It forms a good overall introduction, easier to take in than several of the other, scholarly tomes -- some of which are even more challenging regarding the quest for the truth story of James."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roy at his digital best!","review":"Roy fans know these films. They have been available for years on tape. If you like Roy, you will love the films.What makes this and the other Roan Group release special is the care that went into the restoration and DVD transfer. There are loads of bad transfers of films with a limited audience being issued, but this is NOT one of them. These discs are beautiful! In addition, the menus are coded with a musical note to indicate that a song starts at that point.Can it GET any better than that?!? It sure can! The bonus items on Volume One are very, very cool.I hope there is more of this catalog to come, but I have tried every way possible to contact the Roan Group. It looks like they are out of business. I suggest you get these two DVDs while you still can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful","review":"This album is absolutely beautiful. Kramer is in his age of mastery.

One of the receivers when I put the battery in it started to burn and almost exploded the battery. The reception is full of static all throughout the house. I contacted the company and this is where I gave at least 1 star - they sent Fed Ex to pick it up to replace it, unfortuently I was giving birth when they came so I am in the process of contacting them to do this. But I am very worried about the product and will be buying a different brand anyway. I do not want to take any chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT","review":"Let me say that again- I HATE IT!!!!!! Last night, I just moved from right to left in front of the receiver and I made it make static noises. It picks ME up as static. NOw, I'm NOT talking about being in the nursery- I'm talking about the RECEIVER! In addition, the receiver we have downstairs in the living room, after I turn it on, it's staticky too. So I have to actually SHAKE the thing to make it stop picking up whatever interference it's picking up. Nice. Not to mention the receivers fall over all the time b/c they're so light weight, the weight of their cord alone tips them over. Argh. I'm going to buy another one this week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safe Glow not the choice if you live in the city","review":"I got this monitor as a christmas gift as our 3 month old is now ready to move from the bassinet in our room to her own crib. The room is only right down the hall, but its hard to hear her crying over the fan my husband and I need to sleep. We set the monitor up in her room and made sure it was the only thing plugged into the outlet. We also removed any phones from her room or anything else we thought might interfere. Nothing worked...the receiver in our room is ALL static and very nerving. We tried the different channel and changed hers as well, but no luck. We turned off our computers and cell phones, but nothing..just STATIC. I dont know if there is just too much interference as we live in downtown Chicago surrounded by many apartments and condo buildings, but regardless...this monitor just didnt work for us. I think it just depends on where you live. Maybe I need a 900MHz one, we'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"This product is horrible. When we first plugged it in it worked ok. Within hours we were getting horrible static. We tried all different places in our house to plug it in and it didn't get any better. We finally found two places where the static isn't THAT bad and we now leave the monitors there, plugged in and turned on ALL the time! One night, when the baby was fussing and my husband was trying to get some sleep, I turned of the monitor in the babies room and we found out that the recievers will then pick up a country radio station! Maybe that's the cause of the static. Horrible product. Do not waste your money unless you like to be disappointed or if you like to return products to the stores!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't stand the buzz - too much static.","review":"Go for a 900MHz or 2.4GHz model - the 49MHz models pick up too much interference from your house power. I really hate static... everything else about this monitor is just fine, but I bet you will be happier in the long run spending $10 more on a higher MHz model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Monitor!","review":"We received this monitor as a shower gift, and it has worked great! We haven't had any of the static problems and use both cordless phones and wireless internet. The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because the battery feature on the receivers is awful... not only does it take 9-volt batteries, which only last a week or two, but you have to use a screwdriver to change them! Definitely not worth the effort - if you are looking for a receiver to keep clipped to your belt, don't purchase this monitor. Other than that, it is crystal clear and gets very loud if you need to hear it over the laundry, dishwasher, tv, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"We received this monitor as a gift.

It started out with a little static in the beginning and I just thought that was \\"normal\\". It just became worse. Our daughter is now 15 mths and it finally gave out about 2 months ago.

We got the Fisher Price Sounds n Lights as a gift and exchanged it for this one because we thought the night light (glow) feature on this one was a nice touch. It was, except that the light kept flashing on and off. Maybe it was a defective switch. Maybe it's the poor design - the on/off switch is on the bottom of the unit, so if you don't have this thing sitting just right, it'll turn the glo light on and off. After a few frustrating attempts at getting it set right, we figured it just wasn't worth the trouble. It's back at the store now and the Fisher Price unit is back home.As far as reception goes, it was ok. The Fisher Price seems a tad clearer - but that might just be me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"This monitor does not work. I haven't been able to hear anything through it except static. I haven't been able to make the static stop and it is impossible to hear my baby cry through the static.

I suggest finding another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Static in every room on every channel","review":"We received three different moniters at our baby shower and decided on this one. We did not set it up until the baby was born, otherwise, we would have known how horrible this product was. You cannot hear the baby over the static. It is so loud, it is nearly impossible to get to sleep at night. If my husband wouldn't have thrown out the box to this product, it would be returned back to the store ASAP.

WEll I have to say after only using the monitor for (4) months, all we now hear is static, and NOT a baby crying.

I tried to call Safety 1st to ask them about and was asked to jump through hoops in order to get a replacement for this cheap monitor. You will be asked to fax your receipt along with your information. They verify it and then ask you to mail certain parts from the unit. Finally they will send you a check or voucher to replace it. NOT worth my time. I've already told them that I am going to buy another monitor, but it will NOT be a Safety 1st product."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT monitor","review":"I got the Fisher Price Oceans Aquarium Monitor at my baby shower. I didn't set it up until two weeks after my son was born when I decided to put him in his crib. I can't believe that I asked for this monitor. The light show was really neat but the monitor SUCKED. I have no idea how long my son screamed before I heard him. I returned that monitor and bought the Safe Glow and I LOVE it. I woke up last night to his stirring. It is clear as day and you can carry the receiver down stairs, outside and up the block and still hear him in his room. It also has a night light that is just perfect. It has an automatic timer to cut itself off. Oh, and it has a compartment to wrap the cord up so there are not cords everywhere. GREAT BUY!!Advice to all ... Learn from my mistake test monitors before you want to use them and buy the Safe Glow Monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static Confussion","review":"This monitor worked great for 6 months and then the static started.

We have tried changing the channel, rearranging the receivers and monitor, even tried making bunny ears for the receiver out of foil! Nothing but static."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY FISHER PRICE!","review":"This has to be absolutely the worst baby monitor ever. It is extremely suseptable to electrostatic interference. The only sound it puts out is a constant high-pitched whine with intermitted levels of static. The more items you have plugged in (TV, lamp, coffee maker) the worse the noise gets.The noise to baby sounds ratio is terrible so we have to have turn up the whine and static even higher to hear him. This noise permiates the entire house.We had no idea this was wrong until we heard (or didn't hear) our friend's Fisher Price moniter. It was dead silent unless their son made noise. I can't wait to get our Fisher Price moniter so I can throw this one in the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can hear the neighbors baby great!","review":"We could hear our babies music playing from our bedroom with our own ears, however using the monitor all we could hear was the neighbor's baby crying.We tried to change the channel (there are 2 to choose from), but it didn't work. Also the base sits on the on/off button so it kept turning itself off. We're exchanging it this weekend for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing But Static","review":"We registered this monitor because it was 2.4 ghz and I thought it would be better than a 900 mhz monitor.

I am stuck with a monitor that doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Monitor","review":"We live in a 2000sq ft. house and we have no problem with this monitor. It has very clear reception throughout the whole house. We highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Static","review":"This monitor had static from the minute we plugged it in. It actually works better using just the batteries, which we went through like crazy. I wouldn't recommend this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to much Static!!","review":"This was one of the worst monitors i have ever dealt with. The static was so loud no matter what we tried that i was afraid i wouldnt be able to hear my baby. It wouldnt even pick up the baby mobile music over the static. We tried Fisher Price- Sounds and Lights, and it was just as bad. If you want a good, clear monitor, even 1500 ft away, go with the 2.4 Ghz Digital Monitor by Summer Infant products. Worked clear and gave a good distance that it was still very clear in. Only comes with one reciever, but batteries are rechargable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work in my tiny apartment.","review":"My husband suggests maybe our apt is too small and that is why there is all this feedback with the monitor.But that is bologna, I think these are just poor quality. I would like to hear my son while he is just fussing and not in all out tantrum mode. But there is so much static and hiss that these monitors are completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of background noise.","review":"We had no idea which monitor to register for & picked this one b/c it had two receivers and was reasonably priced. It always has static and background noise (including our neigbors! but I'm told a lot of monitors do that), so the red light is always on. My son is still sleeping in our room so we hardley use it, but for my own piece of mind, we'll probably buy another monitor when he goes into his room. One that doesn't have so much background noise and static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another monitor","review":"This wasn't the monitor we registered for, but the one we wanted wasn't in stock. We thought this might be of similar quality but we were sorely mistaken. All we usually get is static. Second, it has a loud buzz sound it makes when it isn't picking up static. It does have a night light effect that lasts for a few minutes when you turn it on or just touch the button. It also picks up sound good, you just have to listen over the static or look at the red light indicator to tell if the baby is stirring. We are looking for another monitor because that annoying buzz keeps me up at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest waste of money!!!","review":"This monitor was the biggest waste of money!!! I thought it would be great to have a monitor with a night light and a receiver in each room, and it would have been had the stupid thing actually worked. Within 3 weeks of my babies being born the light went out, you can't hear out of the receiver unless it's up full blast, and if the volume is up all the way you hear very loud static. I couldn't take it back because I didn't have the box or the reciept any more so all I would be able to do is get the same monitor again. So now I use my 4 year old monitor, and it's much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"very clear","review":"this is great. the sound is very clear. We can even hear our baby breathing. Having 2 monitors is great. You can leave one in the bedroom and one in the living room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another baby monitor","review":"Don't bother buying this monitor. It had horrible static everywhere in the house. I tried different outlets, dedicating an outlet to the base, and I still received a lot of static. It's also extremely sensitive to other noise. I could have the baby's bedroom door closed and hear my oldest son in his room. With all the noise it picks up, it's hard to enjoy some quiet time without the baby.Don't bother with this monitor... there are others out on the market for the same price that are much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL MONITOR","review":"I got this monitor as a shower gift - not the one I asked for, but I figured it was close enough. The night light broke within the first month or so, and there is so much static - I assume from picking up other signals in the neighborhood - we have to keep it loud enough that the neighbors can probably hear!! I give up - I'm buying another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made Product","review":"Looking at all of the reviews, they are either 1 star or 5 stars. This indicates the quality control of this product is non-existent.All three parts of this monitor had defects and flaws from the moment it was plugged in. One receiver was extremely staticy, the other wouldn't even work without being tapped first, and the base station had quirks with the light. The light is supposed to stay on for 15 minutes and it didn't even stay on for 15 seconds. When activated again, the light flashed like a strobe light.This product is clearly poorly made and is NOT worth the money. More importantly, it is not likely to be reliable at doing its job...monitoring a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money!!!!!","review":"I bought this monitor for my second child. We had another one from our first child that we were still using by fisher price, and THAT one had been through three other sets of children before my own and still works great which is hardly the case with the safety first. It is not the first product I have purchased, but I am starting to think it will be my last. One of the two reciever's AC plug in broke when I was plugging it in, and the reception no matter how close or far from ANYTHING is full of static and bizarre noises. The second reciever's connection is so sensitive that if you blow on it, it will go off and then you must turn it and wiggle it until you can regain there connection. For a well known brand and for a monitor that has not even turned one years old yet (my son will be one in january), this is definitely the biggest waste in money yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST on the market!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Do NOT buy this one, you can't hear ANYTHING but static with it. My suggustion, go with the Fisher Price (Lights and Sounds). We bought the Safe Glow monitor when we had our second baby (so the two monitors would look different and you could tell who was crying), and we hear nothing but static from it. Maybe I'm spoiled from the clarity of the Fisher Price one we already had, but I have adjusted this one so many times and it makes no difference.....it's useless. Sorry to sound so harsh, I just don't want you to be as dissappointed as we have been with ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"NOT RECOMMENDED - The monitor itself seems to be good, however one the receivers quit working after about 4 days. I returned the defective system and exchanged it for the same model and the new one had the exact same problem as the original one I returned. After experiencing the problems I have had with the replacement, I will be returning this one and go back to a Fisher Price monitor that will hopefully work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I received this monitor set as a gift. One of the receivers didn't even work straight from the package. When I called customer support, they were so uncooperative and told me that since I didn't have the receipt, there were nothing they can do. That was the least of the problems we experienced with this monitor. The static it picks up is unbelievable! It would pick up the noise of our dryer so loudly that we always questions whether we hear the baby. Also, the whole set stopped working one night after a few weeks, so now we have to look for a new monitor set pronto!"},{"rating":"2","title":"middle of the road","review":"These listeners work well for the price. I use one from the basement when my little man is sleeping on the second floor of the house, so distance is pretty good. Compared to our old set (that died from being dropped to much) the sound is not nearly as clear, and you get a pretty good amount of static, but that doesn't stop you from hearing the kids.If you want to hear their breathing, this isn't the listener for you. In our house, we're only worried when the kid actually wakes up and starts to fuss, so these listeners work well.We bought some quality 950ma rechargeable batteries for ours. If you are using the listener without a plug-in nearby, it will eat through batteries rather quickly. The rechargeable batteries are a real money saver.If the price were higher, I probably would only give these a 3. But they are pretty low cost, so they earn a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful baby monitor!!!","review":"This baby monitor works great. We use a video monitor also, but we got this monitor so we could carry the receivers with us when away from our video monitor. The reception is great...no static and it picks up every little sound imaginable! We put the monitor in the living room and it picked up the soft ticking of the clock in the kitchen...crystal clear! The receivers work great and at a far distance. Definately a great buy and with this monitor, you can rest assured that you will hear your baby when she needs you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work when you have a wireless network","review":"We were not able to use this since it uses the same frequency as wireless networks. So, if you have ANY wireless network at home, you will not be able to use this monitor, you will get continuous static with no reception."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works for us...","review":"I bought this monitor for my two year old son when we moved into a two story house from an apartment. I liked the fact that it had two recievers(one on each floor), and my son liked the night light. The monitor is very sensitive. I can hear my son breathing, which is important to me because he has athsma. However, it does sometimes pick up static, especially if you have a cell phone near by. Despite it's occasional mishaps, I still feel it's a good monitor, and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"STATIC! DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE PLANNING 2 USE OTHER APPLIANCES","review":"This was the first monitor we have purchased as it got decent reviews from consumers. Well, may be if you don't have a cell phone, a wireless phone, at TV, etc. this product will work for you. It's great when everything is turned off. However, if you turn any of the appliances on ... well, you're in for lots of static! We had this this monitor for over 3 months as we only used it at night (we live in an apt. and don't really need it on during the day as we can hear the baby w/out the monitor). We are now shopping for a new one as we're starting to use the monitor during the day / evening and can't even watch TV as the static is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it!!!!","review":"Based on all the reviews and the looks of this monitor I thought it would be the best choice. Like many of the other reviewers, even the ones with high ratings, there is just way too much static and interference. We have tried different outlets in different rooms, using batteries only, nothing helps. We are going to exchange it and try a different brand. You need to read all the reviews, not just the ones with low rates, because the others mention the static also! I wish I would have taken my own advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT's alright","review":"This montior does work well. I can hear my son breathing, and dogs barking and all of that very clearly. It works outside, upstairs and down. The problem is that I am spending a small fortune in batteries. When you plug it in it gets all fuzzy and has this terrible buzzing sound. I have tried both monitors and all the plugs in the house. So I have to replace the battery every day to use it through the whole night and that gets pretty expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked in one house, but not the other...","review":"When we were in our old house, it worked fabulously. I liked the night light to softly light up the room to see without turning on the main light. The receivers worked really well. The one thing I disliked was the way they ate up batteries. Gobbled 9 volts very quickly - less than 12 hours...But, it works very badly in this new house. We have to buy something else because all I get is static and it's very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This monitor doesn't work for us...","review":"Maybe it is our wireless network and phones, but we never got anything but static from this monitor. We could not get this one to work for us at all. And the night light feature wouldn't stay on, it just flashed incessantly unless it was sitting just right.We passed it on to my in-laws to use in their house for when they watch our son, and it does seem to work in their house. This is the only reason I gave it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"very noisy","review":"Lights on the monitor are very useful as I generally turn down the volume and lights trigger me when my son wakes up. Otherwise the receiver has lot of continuous noise. If I hadn't bought it online, I would have probably returned it by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"They say it's great....but","review":"I bought this item because the reviews were great and the price was right. Two months later and it doesn't work. I have replaced the bateries many times. At first it worked great. Now when it's on, there's either no volumn or all you hear is static. I do not recommmend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this monitor. We bought our first one for our son a little before he turned a year. It worked great! We loved it. Then about 1 year down the road one of the receivers stopped working. We loved having both receivers so we decided just to use the old one when we travel (since the one receiver did still work) and buy a new one for the house. It was awful. I honestly thought we had gotten a defective model. Took it back and got another one and got the same results. Horrible static! We couldn't hardly hear the cd player we run in his room with lullaby music and it was sitting pretty close to that where we had always had the old one. I don't know if they did something new to it to \\"improve it\\" but they went the wrong direction. I would highly recommend you NOT buy this product. We are in the same house, it is in the same room and we are getting much much different results. The older model was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static City","review":"IF you are looking to hear static this is the monitor for you!!! Otherwise, don't waste your money.

Here you are buying these monitors for the safety of your child and you can not hear them over the loud buzzing noise. They worked fine for about 6 months and one day I turned it on after putting my daughter down for a nap and all we got was a loud noise. We played around with the channels, moved the monitors, tried batteries and nothing worked. My first set was Sony and those only lasted under a year also. I am on to the next set and hope for success."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH STATIC!!","review":"This monitor looked like such a great buy! Boy were we wrong! We returned it for the SONY 27 channel monitor. (also wrote a review on it!)We registered for this monitor mainly because of the dual receivers (we live in a two story home) It also had a night light and it was a good price...not cheap but not too expensive! For how little this monitor worked it should be priced at $9.99! There was soooo much static! The night light didn't work half the time. You would have to push the button a few times for it to light up! I gave this monitor one star for its nightlight that automatically turned off after about 15 minutes (good idea if they can get it to work!)Do some shoppin around before you buy this product...or better yet just go out and buy the Sony!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD Static","review":"We recieved this at our baby shower after we had registered for it. We Tried it out and the static on it was so loud you couldn't hear the baby if you tried. In addition, the loud static drove us mad. We took it back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"I dont have a large house and it is very noisy and it interfers with the next door neighbors phone we can hear all conversations. We did like the light on the receiver but now we are having baby #2 and have to go out and buy a new one poor reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disappointment","review":"I bought this product after reading the reviews here, and I was VERY disappointed. We use a fan in our baby's room, and our last monitor had no problem transmitting all sounds! We dropped out last monitor one time too many, and bought this one. With the fan on, you can hear NOTHING coming out of the monitor except occasional loud bursts of static. Without the fan on, it works OK, but that doesn't really help us. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste, get something else if you can!!!","review":"Okay, so it does work, sometimes. You have to have a battery and have it plugged in for it to work at all. This is of course after the first set completely decided not to work. You can't take this around the house because as I said, you have to have it plugged in to work. Also, the batteries need replacing about every 2 weeks (9 volt). Not only that, but you have to bang it a few times for anything to come through it at all. I gave it 1 star as it does work, eventually. I HIGHLY recommend getting something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL YOU HEAR IS STATIC","review":"Do not buy, this monitor gives you nothing but static, I could not hear my child at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Noisy","review":"After reading all the positive reviews on this monitor I registered for it and received it as a shower gift. I just recently started using it and all I can hear is noise from all over the house. If I am in the living room and my daughter is sleeping in her room I can hear the TV in the living room through the monitor. Plus it has a lot of static. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Known AC cord problem","review":"Our first Safety 1st monitor failed in a matter of days. We called the company, and they thought right away that it was a problem with the adapter cord (read: a known problem). We decided to return it to the store and get another one that wasn't faulty. It worked great--for about two months. The connection is loose, the unit does not charge properly, and the company knows all about it. Don't take the brand name literally, people, because you can't hear your baby crying. This product needs to be recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible monitor, poor distance, tons of static","review":"I literally could not take the monitor 10 feet away from the base without getting tons of nasty static making it impossible to hear anything.I isolated the cause to the base station. It does not put out a powerful enough signal. I have an older Playskool base station that operates on the same channel. The receivers from this set pick it up FINE. However they will NOT work at all with the base station that comes with the set.Someone poorly designed this set. Use only if you have no electronic devices in your house and live in the middle of nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with light \\"flickering\\"","review":"I was pleased with the monitor's reception and clarity but once the auto shut-off feature turned off the light, any attempt to reactivate the light just results in rapid flickering. I have to unplug the unit and replug the unit to start another 15-minute cycle. I've had the unit for about 2 years (however this problem started shortly after purchasing the item) and I've noticed they do have a more updated model. Perhaps they've fixed this flaw.Another problem I've run into is now that my son is older he is unhappy with only a 15-minute night light. He's 2 and shares a room with his older sister (4) and they both wish the light stayed on through the night.I'm now looking at buying yet another monitor (ugh....after 5 children you'd think I'd have found a monitor that I'm happy with!) this time I'm looking for one with an all-night light or at least one I can turn off when I go to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can be dangerous to some...","review":"This monitor is definitely cheap for a reason. I will say that for the 1st 3 months it worked...ok. Then when I went to use the light it flashed like 12 times per second or so, upsetting my baby and making it very frustrating. What is worse is that this type of light flashing is dangerous to epileptic children and adults. It can cause seizures in those who are photo-sensitive. Now, 8 mos later, neither receiver even works. I called the company and was put on hold for 1/2 hr. I held on while I worked because I felt it was important to make them aware of this. And these reviews helped me out so much when we were deciding what to register for, I wanted to help others decide. Spend a bit more if you can, it is worth it to hear your baby clearly. You will get ALOT of use out of it so play it safe. I'm off to read reviews as we need to buy another one. They won't refund us til we send the old one's pieces. Wish me luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS","review":"I hate this monitor....I hear the static better then my baby....Some time I have the sound up all the way and I still hear my baby cries from down the hall not from the Monitor. Please do not buy this...not worth the money....you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star is too much for this monitor!","review":"I was given this as a shower gift. From the moment I tried using this all I got was feedback. Even on the lowest setting the static is extremelly loud!!!! It has never worked even talking directly into the unit you cannot hear anything. Good luck shopping, I live by the product reviews so I hope this helps you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception","review":"We tried this one out since all the reviews I read were so good but unfortunately, we were not pleased with it. When you plug it into the wall it seems to have a lot of static and it doesn't seem to matter where in the house you try it. Don't waste your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING BUT STATIC!","review":"My wife and I purchased this Safety 1st monitor with dual receivers today. Once home, we put in fresth 9volt batteries and also plug the monitors into the wall with the AC plug. All the lights light up and all we hear is static. Pure junk. I am taking it back to the store after dinner. Disgust!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"WE got this as a shower gift and could never use it because it had static everywhere in our house. Everywhere. It's worth the money to get a higher priced one that you will actually use. We bought a Sony and it gets no static. The Safety first people told me it was because of our satellite dish and we'd never be able to use any monitor. WRONG. It was theirs that didn't worik."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange whining noise","review":"Sometimes the monitor works just fine. However, it often produces this high-pitched whining sound that is annoying and at times wakes our soundly sleeping baby. It always works for its intended purpose though, which saved this product from a one star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Sony 900mhz instead!","review":"I had a Fisher Price monitor that worked well for the first year, but after that it steadily got worse until we had to throw it out after a year and a half. So, after reading the positive reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I was very disappointed--it had lots of static and interferance. I could pick up my neighbor's son across the street better than I could my own son down the hall no matter what channel I tried. And if the receiver was in the bathroom I could not pick my son up at all. I never had this problem with the Fisher Price monitor. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just threw mine out","review":"After reading the great reviews on this product, I registered for it for my baby shower. Unfortunatly the box was destroyed or I would have returned it long ago. It works about 2% of the time. The static is overwhelming, usually three lights are lit by the static alone. Every now and then it works okay, so I give it another chance. I just got out of the shower to here my 4 month old screaming her head off and the monitor didn't pick up a peep. I've tried all of the suggestions to remedy the problem, but this monitor just doesn't work. I have an older safety first monitor that works on the same frequency and have had fewer problems with reception, but it still has static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for Apartments, lots of static","review":"I bought this and set it up days before our daugther was born. I am glad I did because we instantly picked up the neighbor's baby who lives in the townhouse 3 doors down from us- imagine the confusion! Even changing stations didn't help- we still picked up the sounds from their monitor AND even more static! I followed all the directions to avoid other interferrances but none helped. When you turn up the volumne, even if the monitor and hand units are in separate rooms, they will make a horrible sound as though they are still \\"too close\\", so you have to turn down the volumne thus making it nearly impossible to hear the sounds of your baby- especially over all the static!I read lots of reviews on all the monitors and thought this one would be the best for our money but this one is going back to the store ASAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Monitor","review":"Our monitor worked for only three weeks! Unfortunately we threw the box and receipt out so we couldn't return it. The first week we used it we were picking up random people on telephones and their conversations. Then we got it to work better (a bit clearer) for a week or two, and then after that it was very staticky until it finally just burnt out. The only positive feature was the glow light that turned off after 10 minutes or so on the main receiver that we kept in the baby's room. Otherwise - stay clear of this product unless you want a neat night light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better monitors out there","review":"We registerd for this monitor, and I wish I would have picked another- maybe the video monitor? I have to say that this does pick up every little noise which is a good thing. We can even hear our neighbors in their house next door in it. However- I dont know if we had a faulty item, but our nite light burned out about 2 weeks after having it!!!!!! And per the instruction booklet, the bulb is not replaceable. This was a big disappointment! And when I walk past the receiver in our bed room, there is an interference. As far as the light bar to indicate the noise level. If you have a humidifier or air purifier in your nursery like us, this feature doesn't help. Because of the constant noise, the bar is always lit. (not a fault of the manufacturer)"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it, love it, love it","review":"I loveee this monitor, it works perfectly in our home and there is no static. We can hear every little thing that is going on in baby's nursery and the little night light is perfect for those late night check in's that go on :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tip to reduce interference/static","review":"The reception of this monitor is excellent - we can hear the baby smack her lips as she starts to wake up - and having 2 receivers is VERY convenient.This monitor and others were sometimes given low marks due to problems with static. We found that older portable phones can cause static when in use and that using certain outlets produced static. So if you experience static, try different outlets and check the channel options on your portable phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This monitor overall works great. We can hear every little russel that he makes. However, it sometimes gets a bit staticy when next to other electrical items (alarm clock, lamp etc.) but if you just reposition it or move it alittle it stops. We often do yard work when our son is napping and it has a little belt clip that works great and it gets good reception in the yard!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage!","review":"This monitor has alot of static and you pick- up other monitors in the neighborhood! It has only 2 channels( not much privacy!) i wish i had bought one of the 900 mgh monitors instead! In fact i am looking for new monitors now to replace these ones! Please, don't waste your money here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us!","review":"The first night we used this monitor we noticed a high pitched buzz and some static. What really annoyed me, though, was the way our baby's chatter or cries were so distorted. The sound quality was really poor. I recommend the Graco Soundsleep monitor. We were using it for the past year and a half, and only bought a new one because one of the receivers is starting to go out. Oh well...I will continue to use it with only one, because the quality is MUCH better. I returned this one to the store today."},{"rating":"1","title":"was good but not n-e more","review":"i had got these monitors when i first had my son in 2003 they were great, it is definitely true that you can here even a pin drop...but when my loving son's father lost the main monitor i urged him to buy them again...now the second pair of monitors we bought in february this year were working great until the static came in and now i don't even know where the monitors are because i just didn't care much for them.....the static was really loud and annoying...but i guess my son old enough and loud enough but he's a little sneaky so i'll probably get him another pair and if they don't work i'll return them for another kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"night light was nice","review":"i got this monitor for a shower present i thought it would be great with two receivers and a night light. the only thing that was nice was the night light. i live in a mobile home if you know mobile homes the furnace is loud anyway but it didn't bother us coming thru the monitor. but one night i went to bed and turned it on and all i got was static the furnace wasn't running and we hadn't even moved the monitors at all so i wouldn't recommend this to anyone i am in the process of discussing this with safety 1st because like everyone else it waited until the package was gone. i think they should take them off the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"works well-then terrible!","review":"I registered for this monitor. It worked well for a couple of months (just long enough so I threw out the packaging and can not send it back), but now the volume control does not work and it is either at top volume or completely off when you try to adjust the level. It is, as I have read other people say, extremely staticy now, but it may just be due to the volume control problem. The wire that connects to the receiver is also not secure and wiggles. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"I recieved this monitor set as a baby shower gift, and was thrilled as it was one less thing for me to purchase.It worked well for the first 4 months than, as I have read on the other reviews, the static started! Also the hole where you plug the adapter from the wall to the unit has issues. It has to be wiggled in just right to make the connection, which is scary because there have been times where the wire connection is loose and I lose sound during the night. Causing major panic when I cannot hear my son. But ironically due to the loud constant static, I know when to giggle the cord to get the connection again. Long story short- I'm buying a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out good, but then.............","review":"I loved this monitor when we first got it. The idea of having the night light is wonderful and it was a nice soft glow. Then one day, the static started..it seemed there was something wrong with the volume switch, it had to be set \\"just right\\" to get away from the static. Now, I come home and the one monitor is just screaming with static and is just about to die. I am currently looking for something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very pleased!!","review":"Our Sony monitor died and we had to purchase a new one. I was really happy with the Sony monitor, but decided to try another brand. Big mistake! There is so much static with this monitor that it drives me crazy. We get woken up in the middle of the night with loud static! It is convenient that their are two receivers, however the static does not justify the convenience. I'm taking mine back and getting the Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound quality, buy the glog ligth dont work","review":"My wife and me bought this monitor 6 months ago. Now our baby has 2 weeks born, and the monitor works wreat in our house, but uno of the receptors always have the third LED on, the other receptor is fine. And the nightlight on the transmiter only works for one week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"We were disappointed to find that this monitor did not work at all in our house. It was so static-y that my boyfriend couldn't even hear me over the noise and he was just down the hall. I'm very glad we tried it out before our son gets here. However, I'm not looking forward to having to keep trying out different monitors till we find one that will actually work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Awful. Waste of Money.","review":"If you have anything wireless in your home (wi-fi, telephone, robot, tv remote) then save your cash and run, don't walk, away from this lemon of a monitor. It may look nice, but its functionality is around zero. If you like listening to white noise at high volume 24/7 just to be able to hear your baby, then this is the product for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say- HATE IT!!!","review":"this thing has so much static it's not even funny. I have heard my neighbors phone conversations. Took it back and got a much better and cheaper one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static","review":"This monitor worked fine for quite a while. Then our neighbors had a baby (we live in single family detached homes, so it isn't like we share a wall or are even that close...) and we started picking up their signal and getting a ton of static. We switched channels and still got the static, but it was tolerable since baby was a year old and I just wanted it to know when she woke up. Now we got a new TV and all we get is static. Seriously, if you have electronics or neighbors, get a better model."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure crap","review":"My husband and I have this baby monitor and we think that it is pure crap. Our son's room is right next to ours in our tiny apartment... and the only way we can hear him is if we turn it all the way up. But when you turn it all the way up the monitor just screems... we finally just ended up using our cordless phones as monitors. Lame! i wouldn't recomend this monitor to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"had to return","review":"basically, this monitor is static city. it doesn't have to do with just the volume level as another reviewer stated, it just is a piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works great...At first.","review":"I registered for this monitor, and received it as a gift. We loved it at first. But we started having problems with them this past summer,just after my son turned 1. We couldn't use them outside because they got nothing but static and high pitched squealling (and we don't have a satellite like someone else mentioned). Now one of the receivers barely works. The on/off switch, which also controls the sound, doesn't work properly and makes it so we can't even hear our son, no matter how high you turn up the volume. There is some kind of short in the switch and no matter how many times I open it up I can't find it. Now I'm going to have to go out and buy new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unreliable!!!!!!","review":"We registered for this monitor and received it for our baby shower and have had nothing but problems with it. It is very sensitive, we can even hear the clock ticking in our daughter's room but for no reason it will buzz loudly with static and moving the receiver makes no diference. This is not a good thing in the middle of the night. If I get within a couple of inches of it, the buzzing will stop, but as soon as I move away, it starts again. It is driving me crazy. Also, within the first few weeks of use, the main unit started blinking and would not shut off, so we called the manufacturer and they sent us a new one, but the new one still blinks for no apparent reason and is hard to shut off. I would not recommend this monitor to anyone and am planning on buying a new one in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"I recieved these monitors as a shower gift, and I am not very happy with them. Although the reception is quite good, they go through batteries like crazy, and the ac adapters kept breaking. I had to replace them 3 times. In my opinion, I think there are better monitors out there for that kind of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Monitor i've found!","review":"I got this monitor as a baby shower gift and I couldn't be more happy with it. No matter where i am in the house, or outside, i can hear my baby girl crystal clear. I also love the built in night light, so when i go in to check on her i don't have to turn on the lights. This product is great, and i'm so glad i didn't have to spend a ton of money for the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Static","review":"While the reviews for this monitor seemed mostly positive, the monitor was all static (on both channels) even with the receiver in the same room. We returned it an bought the Sony - a much better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Monitor","review":"I love this baby monitor. My son is now 13 months old, and we have Never had a problem with the monitor. You can hear as much or as little as you like, if we turn up the receiver all the way you can hear him breathing, and the monitor in his room is a good 5 feet from his crib.We live in a townhouse and neighbors on both sides also have babies. We've NEVER had interference from their monitors, or heard their babies thru ours. We have a fisher price and another brand monitor at the grandparents house, and they just don't compare to this.Love this monitor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!","review":"Please do yourself a favor and buy a different brand. I can't hear anything, my son has to be screaming his lungs out in order to get some sound from the thing (appart from static). I live in a small apartment so that\`s not the problem. The only good thing about it is the night light. I've been told that Sony Babycall works much better. I'll get that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much feedback!","review":"I do not recommend this monitor. The static/feedback is way too loud. And if you're using it to monitor your baby over night it will eat batteries. You have to plug it in all the time. I'm currently looking for a rechargable unit. I will say that the night light is great. The soft glow will not wake your baby up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and short lived","review":"Do not buy this monitor if you are looking for something to last. Our first receiver stopped working after a month of use. We have had this for 6 months now and the connection comes loose all the time to to receiver so it just turns off. ALthough it has a battery compartment, it does not work on the battery alone. It is just static. Spend a little more and buy better quality than this brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing monitor... especially at this price!!!","review":"We've had this monitor for close to two years. In that time we've never had issues with static or anything else. You could hear a pin drop in my daughter's room. It has a great range for an inexpensive monitor. We've used it while working outside on many occasions and it was as clear as always. I love the night light feature and the display lights come in very handy at times. I highly recommend this monitor. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"I checked reviews for monitors on every website I could find. This one seemed to have high ratings everywhere I looked, so it's what we got. We have a 2 story, so it seemed necessary to have two receivers. After 1 month, one of them stopped working. We did figure out that we could put a tiny nail in beside the volume dial and turn it up almost all the way, and it would sometimes work.Now, our baby is 5 months old and the other one is doing the very same thing. We are going to have to buy a new one because it goes out too much. I'll wake up in the middle of the night, and it's not working at all. We are extremely disappointed in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal Clear!!","review":"I love these monitors. Upon reading great reviews for baby monitors we chose to get this one. We have a basement and an upstairs so we wanted the 2 receiver deal. We have never had a problem with static over either of the channels and it's amazing how much you can hear over them. Turning them up all the way is a bit much, but we can hear our son breathing over the monitor.
