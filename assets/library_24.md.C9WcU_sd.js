It seems to be well made and fairly sturdy. It came with a little rubber strip for the dust collecting edge. The piece of rubber seemed like it would just get in the way, so I didn't use it. If I was using the dustpan on a nice wood floor I would have kept it attached. I didn't give it five stars because the sheet metal is a little thinner than the smaller Unisan Dustpan I purchased at the same time.

The extra large size can be a detriment at times, because you can't get it into the smaller places, but that's a minor issue. All in all, I'm quite pleased with it.

There is so much to feed on on so many levels. I was so astounded by the wolf's understanding of his relationship with evil. He refuses to personify it and yet has realized that his ongoing companionship is not friendship. I think the story raises questions about humnan complicity in evil and the human tendency towards idolatry (knowledge, science, consuming). By the end of the book, one has to wonder where the center of the evil that is being described lies: in the devil, in the wolf, or in the Brothers Grimm? Schmitz ablilities to make the reader see situations from the view point of the wolf is truly amazing. It's a good tale and will keep the reader thinking about those big questions about good and bad and knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twice Told Tails","review":"Many postmodern deconstructions of legends and fairy tales are rather self-consciously academic and self-referential and are clever in a \\"hey, look at this fancy stuff\\" sort of way.

Strongly recommended for adults and mature teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fur-raising tale","review":"This is another book review by the boonie dogs, Wolfie and Kansas. \\"Darkest Desire\\", allegedly by Anthony Schmitz, presents a wolf's-eye-and-snout view of the Brothers Grimm. We suspect that this book was ghostwritten by a fellow canine. Much of the book is too insightful and too clever to have been written by a typical human author.The passages about the tastiness of human puppies are somewhat offensive. A canine is more likely to protect a human child from human predators than to eat the child himself. However, \\"Schmitz\\" does make it clear that the child-eating wolf is no more typical of canines than Hannibal Lecter is of humans. In a nice twist on an idea used decades ago by Clifford Simak in \\"City\\", Schmitz makes use of the canine ability to perceive and interact with phenomena beyond human perception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a rank novice maybe","review":"This video is far too basic to be of any assistance to anyone with more than a real basic knowledge of horses and hoof care.

But you have to know its limitation or should I say, its targeted birds. Only small song birds can eat from it. It takes only black sunflower seeds although I use a premium blend and the birds just love it. It allows only ONE bird at a time to feed from it. And because of this, don't expect a lot of bird traffic. But it's very well made, its plastic is very hard/strong/thick. Much more sturdy than Duncraft's Cling-a-Wing globe feeder. I need to limit bird traffic & seed dropping as chipmunks (and soon squirrels) are attracted big time so this low-traffic small feeder suits my specific application well, but if you desire something else, this feeder may disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite work","review":"I bought this feeder thinking it would deter the house sparrow and house finches. While it does keep house sparrows away, the house finches still manage to feed from it.

The classic epic about one man's triumphant journey through the Arabian Penninsula during World War I is not just a story, but a cultural and historic landmark in filmaking. The movie, loosely based on T.E.

The astounding cinematography along with Mauice Jarre's stirring score captures the mystery and the exotic lure of Arabia. O'Toole's performance is masterful--this is the film that made him a star.

The film is superb and I would suggest viewing on a projection TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawrence of Arabia (single disc)--Fantastic DVD transfer","review":"My review is limited to the quality of the DVD transfer of the single disc version of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\". There are other editions of this film (special editions, etc.) but the single disc is a real bargain. The remastering of this film as presented in the single disc version is simply fantastic. Viewed on my 46-inch LCD high definition TV (via a Toshiba HD DVD player), the picture and sound are stunning! The picture is sharp and clear and the colors are rich and accurate. If your main interest is the film itself (and you can do without all of the extra features found on other DVD editions of this movie)---then the single disc version is a real bargain for this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandy wafare and camel stsatesmanship","review":"A timeless classic by David Lean, acted to perfection by perhaps the most underrated actor of the century - Peter O'Toole - and backed up by the electrifying performance of Omar Sharif in his debut \\"big\\" role. It is the history of how our present day allies - Saudi Arabia - came into existance, and provides insight into the origins of their religious disregard for human rights. It also shows the depth of character of Lawrence's strength of character as he single-handedly (well, almost) shapes the future of the entire Middle East - whether the British Empire goes along with it or not. This is as essential to your movie experience as Orson Welles' Citizen Kane - if not more so. It certainly is more visual in its widescreen color, and violence among the dunes. Get it, watch it, and remember it for the rest of your life!!![[ASIN:B00006ADD5 Lawrence of Arabia (Single Disc Edition) -"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another review","review":"Peter O Toole.

Background noisesare easily distinguished well not overpowering the vocal tracks.The image is superb and it shows a studio dedicated to getting it right. Just enough grainand the colors really pop out. I have seen various versions of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" on DVD, TV, and VHSand the blu-ray release outdoes them all easily. I say ref. quality.Easily my best blu-ray purchase thus far this year and certainly one of the bestmovies ever was given the due it deserves.

I had seen the movie several times in the theater, and knew its bright colors would be beautiful on my TV screen.To my horror, I saw that Columbia had seen fit to alter a masterpiece. Yes, the film came complete with those horrific black bars at the top and bottom of my screen, which obscured about half of the picture. I've seen those bars on the \\"artsy\\" videos on TV, and I sometimes enjoy them. But this is a classic work of art! You don't try to make it \\"hip\\" and \\"relevant\\" with modern touches.

I have a 55\\" Panasonic plasma and a rather expensive sound system but I was not expecting what this movie delivers in the BD format. The colors and resolution are breathtaking. There is a desert scene where Lean filmed from a great distance behind a rocky outcrop and it almost looks 3 dimensional. Simply phenomenal. The dialog is razor sharp and the Maurice Jarre score is magnificent. Fortunatey David Lean's films are making it to BD and we are all the luckier for it. My favorite Lean film is one that was critics hated - Ryan's Daughter.

I just saw the currently refurbished version at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and it was a stunning experience. Brought me back to the days of Milk Duds and drive-ins. But, not to be overlooked: Peter O'Toole is unforgettable here, and the rest of the cast (Omar Sharif, Alec Guiness, etc.) is fantastic. O'Toole delivers one of the greatest acting performances (in a 4 plus hour movie, no less) that I've ever seen. The script--well, they don't write'em like this anymore. It's worth getting this movie for all these other aspects, though don't miss it if it comes to a theater near you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Classic Movie","review":"One of the best \\"classic\\" movies - the restored version really hits the mark for bringing out all the finer details of scenery and audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality was great. would have liked more specials","review":"I loved the quality of the blu-ray.

It portrays people psychology and the dirty politics. It showed how Lawrence changed from a peace-loving to a blood-thirsty person. It revealed how some people lied and betrayed anybody just to get what they wanted.The action scenes are not as intense and realistic as today movies but this is not a big deal.I've watched it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificant performances in a wonderous land...","review":"First released in 1962, and restored some 27 years later, this slightly longer version of the movie is a must see on the big screen - if only for the epic vision of the director, David Lean. A youthful Peter O'Toole takes the central role of T.E. Lawrence, a man who managed to unite several Arab tribes in defiance of the attacking Ottoman Turks in the First World War. This is no simple biopic, however. Lawrence of Arabia is a massive picture in every sense of the word, with Lean utilising the vast expanses of the desert in a way no other director had, or indeed has, since. If you haven't seen it before, there is no excuse. If you have, there's still no excuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single-disc edition: Excellent movie, bad encoding...","review":"Amazon's rating engine is stupid, stupid, stupid. I've added this rating for the single-disc edition of Lawrence of Arabia, but the review appears for all versions of the movie. So let me clarify: my single star has nothing to do with the quality of Lawrence of Arabia; it's one of my favorite movies. I purchased the single disc edition and found that my DVD player couldn't decode the content from chapter 52 on. This is because the content had to be so heavily compressed to fit on a single DVD that ... it just didn't work. I know it's an additional $20 for the dual-disc version of this film, but, since the single-disc edition doesn't work in the first place, if you're going to buy Lawrence of Arabia, you'll find the additional money worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic yes, Great movie... well no.","review":"I can not understand all the gushing over this movie. After seeing Bridge On The River Kwai, I was expecting this to be more in that vain. Gallant British troops overcoming great odds, led by a brave commander named Lawrence. What I got was a 4 hour bore fest of how a somewhat unstable man rose to the rank of Colonel. Give me Gunga Din or Zulu over this any day. On the plus side, Columbia / TriStar has done a great job on releasing this DVD. The print is in excellent condition, and the extras are many. But, like I mentioned, this isn't a movie to have many repeat viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry people, I guess I'm just too dumb to get it.","review":"I have been viewing this film every few years since it first came out. I figured my initial boredom with the interminal sand scenes was my due to my youth and inexperience; but I can now honestly say: I don't like this movie. It just dra-a-a-ags. And I have quite a tolerance for slowly-paced movies. I like Peter O'Toole and really like Omar Sharif. So there you go. I honestly don't understand what the big \\"thang\\" is about this movie.I heard that this movie took forever to film and that Peter O'Toole went through all kinds of identity problems while filming it.

What follows is a 4 hour during view on the life of this man. You shall lover the dessert and you will love the wonderful music of Maurice Jarré.

I assumed it was, more or less, a truthful account of a man's life. Nothing could be farther from the truth. It is a beautiful movie, but it has very little to do with T. E. Lawrence. The screen writers had their own political agendas and basically invented most of the scenes in the movie. I mean they made major errors and omissions in the film, didn't even get the geography correct. From a historical point of view, piece of junk. Check out this link from the T.

Half way through my attention was beginning to wain and I watched the second half the following night and my enthusiasm was rekindled. It's a movie that has you thinking about it for a day or two after seeing it. I found myself trying to analyse the main character and asking myself whether I actually enjoyed the movie or not.

This was the first time I had watched this film and I enjoyed it a lot. Lawrence is a very interesting character and I believe that this type of epic film did him justice. The cast was magnificent. Peter O'Toole was T.E. Lawrence and there was no question that he took the role very seriously. The film was photographed beautifully. The desert landscapes are unlike any others I've ever seen. This DVD gives you some great extras including a wonderful \\"Making Of\\" documentary that covers all the aspects of the production up to the opening. What I found most interesting is the short interview with Steven Spielberg about the film. This is obviously one of Spielberg's favorite films and it's really cool to see him gush over something he loves so much.

As the author of \\"A Man For All Seasons\\", his name is familiar to actors and directors but less well-known to film people.Anyone who can come up with wonderful pithy dialogue like the famous match scene, or the following exchanges deserves major credit:General Allenby: I'm promoting you Major.T.E. Lawrence: I don't think that's a very good idea.orJackson Bentley: Never saw a man killed with a sword before.T.E.

Men like Gordan, Wingate & Clive who you don't really know where to place them. But none the less they are very valuable men to have around in a tight place. This film takes the story of Lawrence as he goes from a raw junior Officer to Desert Legend. While it could of been very easy to make it one of those Ripping Good storys about one of the lads winning the war by themself in Arabia. The story resists this impluse and so makes itself a legend in itself. I can not praise this film too highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawrence of Arabia DVD","review":"Shipped safe and sound.

E. Lawrence was in this movie a pawn of the British used to get Arabterrorists to attack the Turkish troops. No one can say that the Turks were nice, just they were civilization in the Islamic sense.But oil was a new motive and the middle east was an important part of the future that the British Empire needed.Saying that the fellow Lawrence was used and ultimately abusedby the process may well be a simplification.My opinion is that he may have been abused by this movie( after the fact).

This movie is so grand and magnificant, and the DVD makes it all the more better. A widescreen version of the film remastered for picture quality, almost makes you want to cry when you find out it was made in 1962. Its that good. The sound is also great for all you people with surround, and a behind the scenes one hour documentery make this not only a great movie, but a great DVD.

Big spaceships thunder across the screen (and your speakers) whilst being attacked by lots of smaller ones. In the meantime an attack force boards one of the biggies and lots of shooting occurs whilst the battle rages outside. It's great stuff and gets your adrenalin going. But it's a real shame the film didn't hold my interest afterwards. The goodies are forced to go back in time to track down the baddies who also went back in time. Some quite exciting set pieces (with big explosions) keep the excitement going but then melodrama and some pretty poor acting start to take their toll. I know this isn't a mega-budget film but you don't need big bucks to keep the pace going. The film slowly starts to run out of steam. What a shame.

I know per many forums that the Pearl has issues w/stereo, but should be overcome by headsets such as these b/c of their 2.5mm tips with 3 or more circles on the end. The box made them look cheap as well as I have seen a box of normal Sennheisers that cost more than these so immediately it got me thinking the quality was going to be that good.

If one wishes to gain an understanding of Sartre, the journey should start here. All the primary concerns of Sartrean existentialism are laid out in clear and insightful language - freedom, responsibility, bad faith and other issues are discussed. To this effect the translation does justice to the intent and thrust of Sartre.In particular, Existentialism and Human Emotions is highly recomended for those wishing to begin Being and Nothingness, and those who want a deeper understanding of existential literature.This book has been an invaluable part of my library, often read, referenced and revered."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is simply outdated...","review":"I thought this book, since it was published in 1999, would have some current information.

I have enjoyed the 6 CD capacity, but most of all I was impressed by the improvement in sound quality. It has a warm, full, almost analog sound, but before long it began skipping and having frequent dropouts. No matter how much I clean the lens, the inside of the unit, or my discs, it skips far too often, and I'm again shopping for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value!","review":"I purchased the model preceding this one, a DX-C370 about a year and a half ago on sale for an [unbelievably low price]. Since it is the only player I've owned I'm not in a position to make comparisons, but I've listened to enough music over the years to be able to appreciate the excellence of this Onkyo CD carousel in action. Coupled with a modestly priced Onkyo receiver and my thirty year old JBL speakers, this CD player gives me hours of listening pleasure. I know you can pay a lot more for stereo equipment, but I doubt you could improve on this player's performance. Onkyo makes fine products at every price point. If you're in the market for a modestly priced CD player you need look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book.","review":"This book explains in fine detail how \\"Christian\\" C/churches destroy people. It explains how they take away their joy, breakdown their spirits, steal their finances, hate God, and even take away their wills to live. It happened to me with a Church and, in hindsight and with the aid of this book, I see how insidiously it was done.The authors of this book are careful not to single out any one denomination.If you have a loved one or a friend that is letting a church destroy him/her, buy this book for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healing","review":"I highly recommend this book.

The author seemed to give his opinion of what is spiritual abuse without scripture to back it. It seemed to me to be much more cultural than scriptural. He seems to look at the Bible thru his culture rather than looking at changing the culture through the Bible. Too much psychology for me ( and I hold a counseling/psychology degree). The book is no longer on my shelves. I was looking for a purely scriptural approach and did not find it in this book. But if you want psychology with a lot of opinion then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Recommend","review":"This book was a Godsend for me. It validated me when I thought I was going crazy. There is such a thing as spiritual abuse and as I kept reading, I recognized all the behavior. I could not believe how accurate the authors were on everything. I thought that I was going to give up on churches because of it and we were out of a church for a long time. Our bad experience scarred my whole family but there are authentic churches and Christians out there and this book will help you to recognize which churches and Christians are healthy and those that are not. I am so grateful to the authors for writing this book. I could just imagine the backlash they must have received for letting the truth be known. After reading this I felt relieved is how I will describe it and very uplifted. This book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Subtle Power of Spiritual Abuse","review":"This book opens your eyes to the \\"soft & manipulative\\" abuse that is placed upon unaware individuals who are easily intimidated by others of authority within the church structure. It enforces the knowledge that ultimate authority is from Christ and not any human being on this planet. It also encourages you to voice your opinions of things which are taught or required of you from \\"authoritive\\" figures which do not align with Scripture. A good read and more than that, very enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will help the abused to heal....","review":"I purchased this book after having left an abusive church. I cannot state how much it helped me. At first the anger and rage became so strong that I would have to stop reading for several days, but these emotions had me bound and I had to start dealing with the blurry lines of what I had endured and the emotions were raw. My husband is reading it now and I hope to have our (grown) children read it also. We all suffered greatly in a spiritually abusive church for many years but it did not start out this way, it became more abusive and cult-like as the years progressed. I suggest to anyone that has gone through this type of situation to purchase this book and began the healing process.... I am still healing but this was my spring-board to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Find Grace with God, not coercive, authoritarian pharisees.","review":"This book is a psychological analysis of the coercive, authoritarian pastors who tell us we are not good enough, and who derive pleasure from it. The Chicago Reviewer(s?) call this book an attack on the church, but it quotes scripture and explains how \\"Spiritual Abuse\\" happens. The authors are careful to tell us that anyone can make mistakes and go too far, even pastors. When this behavior is consistent and makes people feel unloved and depressed over and over again, it becomes abuse. The occasional mistake is NOT abuse. This book helps us move out from other people who grant us feelings and esteem, and allows us to get those from within ourselves and from the Grace of God. I recommend it to all Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant diversion","review":"Libertad in one of her iconic roles as a sacrificing mother.

The lamp housing looked to be quite old/used. My guess is that this is a lamp that was stuck in a used housing.

While some of it seems a bit repetitious, it is very well researched and presents a fascinating view of human evolution. This book isn't for everyone, but everyone should understand what it's about. My personal view is that the author's downplay the role of genetics a bit too much. More likely, imho, genetics and cultural transmission had to work in tandem. But even with that minor criticism, this book presents a strong case for examining the role of emotional signaling and the importance of it for the development of our young. The family leave provisions in the US are pitiful compared to other industrialized countries. The first year is such a critical time in the development of a child that it should not be left to strangers at a day care center.

There's a discussion of language (soft-core to hard-core), interviews with the genre's leading authors and editors and a nifty plotting device that'll have you writing stories in no time.

If you're trying to teach your kids Spanish, you might as well teach them to pronounce things correctly! Why TEACH a bad accent deliberately?

In the Baroque Cycle we find the ancestors of no less than NINE characters of that modern day tale of cryptography. But the Baroque trilogy covers much more ground. The fictional characters are used to take the reader through the lives of very real historical characters. The topics that Stephenson deals with in detail are the history of banking, medicine, international finance, cryptography, espionage, mathematics and computing. Not a light read by any stretch of the imagination, it is still enjoyable.On a personal note, I gained great insight into the turbulent period when William of Orange chased the Jacobites out of Ireland. I had always wondered why my ancestors departed Ireland for Penn's Colony in 1689 until Stephenson documented William's march across Ireland in that same year.

It may be OK for some reference items, but does not get the job done for a 'Step by Step' book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sampler at Best","review":"The author seems confused as to whether he's writing a guide or a reference, and at best he winds up with what I would call a sampler.The other unfortunate thing is that the author beats the \\"Hello World\\" example to death. (He is still using \\"Hello World\\" on page 436 of 476 pages.) This leads to Bill's rule of computer publishing: Never ever under any circumstances let an author use \\"Hello World\\" past the second chapter of a book.Some portions of the book assume you've never seen computer code before while others assume you already know ASP. There are chapters on program language fundamentals, application configuration, security, ADO, web services, and every now and then a chapter on ASP.Net.Insofar as this book is a sampler you will not come away with an indepth understanding of ASP.Net. That is, unless you feel that you can fully understand the subtilties of a programming language by reviewing \\"Hello World\\" examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing attempt to explain a great technology.","review":"I'm extremely disappointed in this book from Microsoft Press. While it does offer some great reference material for configuring the different config files, it fails in so many other area's that I wondered why Microsoft published it at all.The author fails to clearly explain the .net technology and writes a book that is filled with confusing examples, poor .net programming techniques and lots of references to other sources of information. Topics in this book are very dissorganizied. Many chapters are written in such a way that by it's end I had forgotten what the chapter was supposed to be about. Extremely important information is briefly mentioned, then brushed aside to keep the book moving to it's conclusion. Explainations into .net coding techniques are outside the scope of this book, but they shouldn't have been.I can't recommend this book to anyone.

I guess I had set my hopes too high. I am already 300 pages into the book and I have only encountered one really useful example (in my opininon).This book does contain some very useful information, but it should not have been called a \\"Step-By-Step\\" book.Just a side note: C# is mentioned occasionally but this book is mainly discusses VB.net."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the first step?","review":"This is not a step by step book; it was designed as reference type of book. I'm not rating the contents of this book. I'm rating the disappointment this book will cause the readers. If I buy a book with a \\"step by step\\" clearly indicated on its title, I'm expecting to be walked through a project explaining the different features of ASP.net. Instead the author has used a style that is totally alien to the phrase \\"step by step\\".

The cover makes it appear like this CD is the soundtrack for the movie Domolition Man. But, it only contains the one song from the movie. The rest of the songs are live versions of Sting/Police classics. There is a real Demolition Man soundtrack CD available.Although this is an EP, it is almost the length of a normal ablum at 36 minutes. It is a fun, lively CD. The live recordings come from a concert in Italy, with a stripped down band, of drums, keyboards and guitar.(Sting usually tours with a much bigger band). This smaller band is able to really break lose. The live versions of the songs are stretched out between 5 to 7 minutes and are played with a lot of energy. Last song is an interesting version of the Beatle's A Day in the Life.This one of the last times Sting performed as a real rocker. In the Police, he was new wave raggae man. His first solo material was more jazz oriented. After this CD, he became a smarmy pop singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American Dream--Italian Style","review":"Il Testimone Dello Sposo offers a three-way sampling of an Italian town at the turn-of-the-century. This fable-like tale shows not only the story of a woman coming into her own, but also the customs and expectations of the time period and the impact of the \\"American Dream\\" on other societies. Although at times the film seemed a little too idealistic and unrealistic at moments, it manages to take a variety of themes and bring them to closure with an enjoyable and thought-provoking. My favorite scenes are when the \\"best man\\" shows slides of America and, later, when he tells the \\"bride\\" how his fortune was made.

But there's no comparing the sad \\"Double Obsession\\" with the masterful \\"Misery.\\" There are no characters here, only caricatures -- everyone is either psycho or insists on hanging out with psychos, but we have no idea why. Even \\"Misery\\"'s truly psychotic Annie Wilkes was more believable. (And more sympathetic.) The soundtrack, by turns, steals suspense and turns suspense into goofiness. And Heather's \\"psycho laugh\\" is from Hitchcock by way of Bugs Bunny. If this weren't a feature-length film with professional sets and actors, I'd think it came from a high-school film class.I really hate writing this, 'cause I know Beth Fisher (Sherry).

Uncomfortable to say the least -- plus if you were to rub your cheek on one it would really scratch you -- the quills are big.I contacted customer service and asked to please return them and they said no. They told me to buy my own covers for them to keep the feathers from poking through -- REALLY?? For this much money you get a pillow whose feathers are so big they poke through, ticking so thin it allows them to poke through, and a company too cheap to put its own covers on them -- even the cheap ones at Bed Bath and Beyond come in their own removable down proof covers.

Mary Madison's ultimate divine redemption mirrors that of Mary Magdalene of old, and as she has been the inspiration for many women throughout the church age, the modern-day counterpart in the character of Mary Madison is no different. Her story evokes a rollercoaster ride of painful and exhilarating emotions, yet the divine love of Christ shining through is no work of fiction. Many readers will resonate with the stories of Mary and Emma, either from personal experience or knowing someone who has been to hell and back as they have. DIVINE shows how the road to redemption isn't easy, but the work of Christ is complete and powerful, and free for all who will accept it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devine","review":"This book helped me understand the victim's way of thinking in an abusive situation.

What should have been serious came across as laughable [\\"she would take three times the crack she's ever taken before\\", really?], and the tragic abuse suffered by the protagonist read as if the author researched the subject by watching a Law and Order SVU marathon.I had never read Kingsbury before, and I will not be reading her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much","review":"First off, I did finish the book.

Even so, when I found it at a used record store, I bought it to remind myself of Kertesz's performances I hadn't heard since they were released on LP in the mid-Sixties. Memory didn't do them justice. This is a dynamic, brilliantly alive Fifth, making this early symphony sound twice as good as it probably is. The LSO plays with panache and conviction. Decca's bright, vibrant sound is a bit screechy at high volume, but I am sure that the current remasterings are better.What a shame that Kertesz died so young.

There are several things wrong with this model. First, there is no pour spout and the very pronounced lip around the edge of the cup means that I am almost always spilling milk down the side while I try to pour it into a coffee cup. Second, the seal around the plunger and the top of the cup is not as good as our last one and foam oozes out while I froth the milk. Finally, this is opaque whereas our previous one was pyrex. I can no longer see in the microwave when the milk was just about to boil. Milk too cool won't foam and boiled milk is not good either. I am surprised to find myself annoyed enough with this to consider tossing it and buying another."},{"rating":"2","title":"For best froth - use cold skim milk","review":"The directions call for you to heat the milk first. I have found that frothing the milk cold works best, THEN heat for 30 secs in the micro. Also, the higher the fat content of the milk the harder it is to froth. Fastest results come from using COLD skim milk, then heat. Don't like skim in your coffee? Create the froth with skim and then use cream to enrich the coffee.Would recommend this simple basic frother to anyone. Have had mine for 5 years. Very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work as advertised","review":"I do not know why anyone would give this a rave review. In lieu of an espresso machine if you want a frother buy one of those battery powered aerolatte things. this does not froth milk at all and trust me, I followed the instructions. It does spill all over the counter. You can get more froth by blowing bubbles through a straw. Save your money.

But I prefer it the other way around.If you have a few Neuhaus truffles in the house, have those too ... hmmmm delicious!To heat the milk you can of course also put the cup in the microwave but since I don't want such a unromantic thing in my house I can't and won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five years and still like new.","review":"I bought this about five years ago and use it at least 5-6 times a week.

I was quite looking forward due to reviews of her newer books. Sadly, this book, in my opinion, is sore lacking in entertainment value. The main problems were, 1)-not enough quality interactions between the hero/heroine, and WAY to many scenes were they begin to like each other, but, of course, a \\"misunderstanding\\" occurs to quickly pull them apart again. 2)-the annoying Basil-he should have been taken out of the book early on. 3)-the introduction of so many side characters as to make the story very hard to follow.All, in all, sadly, I'd say skip this book.2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks chemistry","review":"Not at all like the others of her books available in Kincle format which I read first. This book fails on a number of fronts. The Earl of Hartleigh is like a paper cut out of the handsome hero, the only male character of any depth is his cousin Basil. Isabella is in theory my favourite heroine type - an older, more sensible female- but she fails to come alive for me. The romance does not work. I felt no connection. The book has glimmers of the wit that is in others the author has written but fails to deliver. The lack of steamy sex scenes is not a problem here given the lack of chemistry between the lovers. A penny dreadful - Please do not take this as a epresentative sample of Ms Chase's work, you will miss out on some wonderful stories if you do. If this is your first Chase book to consider buying please move on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart stopping","review":"I have always enjoyed picking up a new Casca book, and not knowing where Barry was going to take me. Casca has a flash of megalomania in this book, and wishes to make another immortal, one that will share eternity with him on this earth.

Another fine story that deals with the pains of his curse."},{"rating":"2","title":"The secret of good health","review":"This is an amazing book written by a Professor of Psychiatry and practising psychiatrist who thinks outside the box. Yes, a pill or medical procedure relieves pain but this good doctor wants to understand the source of a patient's pain. In treating emotional disorders he might try acupuncture, EMDR (eye movement therapy), or nutritional supplements and personally if I was out of control I would prefer taking fish oil to having someone tamper with my brain. The author relates many personal experiences and his encounters with patients are always compassionate. Ultimately he tells us that the secret to health is stress management, exercise and improved nutrition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foundation blocks of wellness","review":"This book gives both an excellent scientific basis (the author is an MD and a neuroscientist) for how emotions work and an excellent roadmap for how to gain emotional wellness through the physical self (attention to certain dietary aspects, exercise, and Eastern practices, along with the author's special technique of EMDR.) This book is easy to read and understand, with excellent practical advice. It is refreshing to get advice from a Western doctor that is not just about pill-pushing! The ideas and goals in the book are attainable by everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I had great expectations for this book but it turned out to be yet another anecdote-filled, vague rambling account of medical musings.Dr.Schreiber spends over 20 pages describing EMDR as a powerful healing procedure without ever explaining exactly how it is done, besides some superficial generalities. Then, in the \\"do it yourself\\" addendum he suggests one should look up a competent psychoterapist to do it. Hmm.Overall the book follows the sadly-popular trend of presenting a lot of cases and little substance.If you expect to actually find there a method to cure \\"Depression, Anxiety and Stress Without Drugs and Without Talk Therapy\\" then save your money and go look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for therapists and clients","review":"This book gives good information on several therapeutic methods that work. The author includes clear explanations as well as case examples. He begins with a good description of current brain science, so the methods he then describes in subsequent chapters relate to the science of the brain. He includes some very simple methods such as exercise, as well as current therapy methods such as EMDR.

The battery on the remote was easy to put in but I had to use pliers to adjust the coils so it'd work. One last thing the vibrations are not discreet at all, if you planned on using this in public I suggest you shouldn't.

On the negative, I don't really understand why they skimp out on the DVD side of things- I mean my $200 pioneer handles the range of DVD's much better. Of greatest concern for me though has been voice re-production. Voices are generally much softer than the other types of sounds, and while bose has a setting to try to rectify this problem, it doesn't do a very good job. Consequently, it can be difficult to hear words when watching tv and DVD's. Also, just a small note, to get the surround sound effect you have to turn the machine up pretty loud (so if you don't care too much for neighbours that won't be a problem).

I've had this thing for a couple years now, about 9 months in it stopped giving me sound. So I went back and replaced it. They didn't even ask what the problem was, they gave no arguement because they had had so many returns and replacements. Then over the past few months the DVD player has been making a pretty loud noise whenever I use it, I have to turn the volume up pretty high just to not hear it. And now the player has stopped working completely. I have a DVD in there that I can't get out (which for the record is part of a Sopranos season, they dont sell the discs seperatly and their seasons are expensive which is pretty annoying to replace).

The system sounds great but its just not surround sound. You can't feel the bass like other home theaters systems.

After spending all that money I expected something better from Bose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not surround sound.","review":"This thing is worthless.With the price tag it carries and the name Bose behind it, It should work flawlessly. Nevertheless, that's not the case. It will suddenly freeze up (during both mid-play and start up) and an error message appears on the LCD screen every other time It's used.

I recommend that you purchase it from a Bose store as they have a 90 day return policy and while I was in the store, I mentioned other reviewers' problems with the DVD (i.e. the drawer sticking, error messages and other glitches ) and the salesman said that Bose would send an update disk to reprogram the main unit which is probably some type of computer and that your satisfaction was pretty much guaranteed. The system is easier to set up than those multispeaker surround systems as there is no guesswork involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, Bad Reliability","review":"The 321 was the first Bose system I have ever bought. I had heard all the raves about the speaker technology and sound and was not disappointed at all. Unfortunately, the main unit which housed the dvd/cd kept locking up and would not allow me to eject the disc. Occassionally, it would not allow me to change functions at all. I returned my first one and the problem recurred on the second as well. Subsequently, I read a customer review which also relayed the same problem. Not sure if this is bad luck or a manufacturing defect.

For example, you could create your own animal (legs of a pig, body of a bird, head of an elephant) and then with the flip of a page, the whole thing changed again. The book, Making Faces, does that with a face. It starts out with a lady, then a man, another woman, and by the end of the book it's to scary people with pointed tonges, tattoos, and safety-pin earings. The book is very creative and the artwork is excellent, however, I would not recomend it for kids. Making part-man, part-female faces and part-conservative, part-almost satanic features into one face belongs in the adult section, not the kids. It was almost too discusting and disturbing for me.

Do not, however, expect anything advanced or comprehensive: this is not the C# analog of Stroustrup's meaty tome on C++. It is though probably the best book currently available on the subject. The author does a particularly good job on Delegates (C#'s version of function pointers) and Custom Attributes (user-defined metadata that can be attached to various programmatic elements at compile-time). The section focusing on garbage collection algorithms was interesting, but not very useful, and I feel he could have done a better job with the exposition. I could have also done without the elementary introduction to OO, but I realize this will be beneficial for many readers.

I noticed there wasn't any engraving in the DVD. It was just a blank DVD. Amazon gracefully replaced it for another one but this one also ended up being blank, no engraving on the DVD and wouldn't play. I order Close up on Congas Vol. 1 by the same company and series and this one played. Which conviced me that this title wasn't being made properly in the factory. Is there anyone who did buy this DVD that was playable? I would be carious if any one else had the same problem. I tried emailing to the company and producer but never received any reply. So be careful with this title. I would recommend the \\"Close up with Congas Vol 1' DVD.

The orchestra sound is ravishingly beautiful helped along by the extrordiary musicianship of the CSO.

I LOVED this book when I was young, and indeed I still do! I never mind reading it to my 3 year old daughter. We quote the line \\"Your stew is stewing well, but doesn't it have a funny smell?\\" to each other as an inside joke.The Bear Scouts leave on a camping adventure, but at the last minute Papa Bear insists on going to \\"help out\\". His son and the other scouts always use their Bear Scout Guide, and always have success.

My 3 y.o. likes this story very much, and asks for it frequently.Like with many other Berenstain Bears books, I like that it teaches the importance of reading to learn stuff, but I find the dad's kluziness a bit annoying as I believe it undermines the respect for parents, cause it's not that it shows that parents can make mistakes too, but that they're totally incapable of doing something right.However, it's a funny story, the adventure has a nice pace to it, and my kid enjoys reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Teach Respect Instead","review":"I agree that dad bashing can only be detrimental to a child's view of his parents.

I'm not sure why the last guy says it works from 40-50 feet but mine was only able to work within 10 feet. I also had to point my presenter directly at the USB device to work.

This book is a long poetic essay about writing styles in the electronic age (I think). It's rather experimental in format and probably couldn't have been published by someone without a famous name. Open it to the table of contents, and you find a page half in pale orange and half in neon green, with white double-grid lines across the page, sort of in a plaid pattern. The table of contents itself is only in one typeface (2 sizes) a remarkable phenomenon in this book. As for the content of the writing, it touches on topics such as virtual reality, teleconferencing, the split of Serbo-Croatian, writing systems of the world, new styles of writing, and synesthesia. If you like reading long-winded philosophical essays written as graphic arts experiments, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little content","review":"I regret buying this dvd, it may be a good 'intro to an intro' to a middle school student.

The bristles are very thin, and unevenly cut. A few of them even fell out during shipping. The handle is crooked and it falls out as soon as you pick it up. It is because the small handle is not fixed (glued or nailed) into the shank, most likely to save even more on production costs. Nevertheless, it is proudly written with huge letters on the shank (Amazon is careful to show us only the other side): MADE IN CHINA.

I bought 5 of her disks at no small expense and none of them have been mastered with care and attention to quality. They all suffer from clipping and distortions during the fortes. This one might be the worst, especially the last minute of the last song--terrible for a jazz disk. It is an insult to people who pay money for these disks to intentionally put out inferior disks, especially when they cost 20-40 dollars a pop.If you are concerned about sound quality, I would advise against purchasing this disk.

It is full of colloquialisms like bica for black coffe and the like, you use in Lisbon but not everywhere in the country, let alone other Portuguese speaking countries. Pronunciation is not always the best standard. Donde is something careful speakers do not say, they say De onde (this means from where or where from in a question). At the other end of the scale you have very careful speech, like that of the President of Portugal, too advanced for a beginners course. This is neither a good beginners course nor a suitable advanced one. I would not use it with my students (I teach evening classes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!","review":"When I first got it, I was so excited!! My boyfriend loved it, and I thought it would be really great - but then we started finding the problems. First of all, the pouch in the panties is way too low for clitoral stimulation, so I put the vibrator into a different pair of panties instead. Second, the vibration was WAY too loud. Luckily we went out to a pretty crowded restaurant that night, but anywhere else, someone would definately be able to hear it!...We didn't use it for a few weeks, and then when we got it out again, the stupid thing wouldnt work! We changed the batteries in both pieces, but it STILL doesn't work. We only got one use out of it....And it didn't come with a warenty. I would not buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discreet??","review":"Well. The insert is large, big enough for two AAA batteries and some to spare. It's also loud. As in, I could be standing accross the room and easily hear it. Also? The pocket placement on the panty is.. well whose anatomy is directed like that? Overall very disappointed. I suppose used traditionally the cordless aspect will come in handy, but for it's intended purpose this purchase was a waste. Even the loud hustle and bustle of Vegas can't drown out the sound, you can't possibly sit because of the size, but you wouldn't want to anyway because the location of the vibe is such that the whole panty is pointless anyway. Needless to say, 5 minutes into our \\"fun sexy\\" vacation this useless appliance was tossed back into the suitcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Product!","review":"I bought this product at a love stuff store for my anniversary thinking it would be a great way to spice up the evening. I paid $90 for it. It is the worst thing I have ever bought! First of all, the \\"one size fits most\\" is only accurate if you are a small person. Second, the placement of the vibrator is very inaccurate, think further back from where you would want it. The vibrator is very big and uncomfortable and not shaped very well for where it should be placed. The remote only has an on and off switch, no multiple speeds. Bottom line is I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing...","review":"It says they are stretch lace and one size fits all.

It even turns out better than Nicktoons: Battle for Volcano Island! Although the gameplay and the puns are considerably entertaining, I have to give this game 3 stars, because Jenny doesn't have a major role in the storyline, compared to SpongeBob and Danny Phantom (even compare this console version to the DS version). Even Stimpy, Rocko, and GIR have roles only served in gameplay, too.

I was quite moved and I recommend this to anyone who cares about the lives of women and especially the suffering of African women and girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complicated issue is treated simplistically.","review":"As an African I found Alice Walkers ficticious Africa bizarre. I don't think she's really spent much time here. Female genital mutilation is a very complicated issue; the reasons for such differ from place to place. My country is very open about this practice and has a very good campaign to educate people against it. In nearby Sierra Leone however women do it to each other as an initiation rite to join certain women's secret societies. In this case(as in Tashi's)it is wholly voluntary. Her thesis seems to be the same as in \\"The Color Purple\\"(which I enjoyed very much)that women are oppressed by men who conspire to keep them from masturbating. This to me is very funny.

From reading this book I learned about something I believe every woman should. It is apalling to me that I have reached this age and have never been made aware of this hideous tradition. I commend Alice Walker for writing about this controversial issue and so doing her part to stop this institution. Everyone needs to read this book, but especially women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get real.","review":"This novel presents a great deal of false and misleading information about the origins, motivations, and practice of female genital mutilation AKA female circumcision.I suggest that anyone interested in anything beyond a quick cheap frisson of eroticism and horror to conduct some research into the many objective sources on the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and Confusing","review":"Most people will likely call this a great piece of literature, but it wasn't that great for me.

It was just too deep for me. Not to take anything away from the author, but I did not like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it","review":"Clearly, Walker is impassioned about this political issue, but a novel might not have been the best way to draw attention to it. Maybe an essay? I've always felt that the essay is Walker's true form but that after inserting cliched dialogue and onion-skin thin characters, she thinks it's a novel. Clearly her fans like this type of writing, judging by the testimonials (\\"I read it until I cried...\\" \\"It will change your life\\")in full display on this site. Unfortunately, those looking for a rigorous reading experience or even a finely wrought story need to look elsewhere. Walker's writing style can best be described as an elementary school primer, and her insights into African culture are bland.I'm appalled that an American (no matter how oppressed) presumes to speak for Africans and puts their cultural practices in the framework of 20th century American culture. Read the response of the reviewer from Senegal to hear what an African thinks about this representation."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching and vivid writing","review":"Himes' classic and vivid writing brought to life for me turn-of-the-century African-american society.

Its too bad, cuz he's a good guitarist for this genre, despite a track on Disc 1 that has a lead intro that ends on a note bent way out of tune. The songwriting on this compilation is hit or miss between the two discs. The tracks in the middle of Disc 1 are horrible, as in if Peter Griffin were dashing through an 80's montage on Family Guy.Anyways, on my quest to find the uncharted or under-appreciated bands of the nwobhm era, or check out what happened to bands after whomever joined whomever-more-famous, I shouldn't have paid so much.

He returns to the war only for a short time because of a deep wound. When he returns he finds men are deserting, The americans and english are stronger then ever, and is the last of his seven freinds on the front. This book tells about the horrors and shock of war.

It shows their perception of the world having been exposed to war and how there lives are changed as a consequence of the war. The author Erich Maria Remarque Gives a brutal description of the war what it is like to be in the war and the person you become .I was assigned to reed this book and I liked it a lot. I especially enjoyed for once being in the other side of the story since it is told by a German perspective. This is one of those books that you pickup and cant put down.. This is definitely the best war novel that I have read in my entire life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I could see it all happening.","review":"Remarque's use of simple language and the honest delivery of his words made the book come alive. I could see it all happening, the events of decades past, vividly in my mind. It felt like Paul was speaking to me, telling me a painful story effectively without the use of over-dramatized termonology or gory details. The book told me what I needed to know. War destroys lives. No matter what the long term goal or the projected outcome of the blood bath, war can only be seen in a negative light. But,this novel doesn't put World War I in the spotlight and point out all of its negative aspects. Remarque just told it like it was and won me over in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Quiet on the Western Front, trans.Brian Murdoch","review":"The recent translation of the original German language novel, All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Remarque, offers a more realistic description of life for these young German students who volunteered to enlist in the First World War. Brian Murdoch offers a new translation of the original German edition and his translation is compelling, especially having restored those descriptions which were in the 1930s thought to be too offensive for the general public. Give it a read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-changing novel","review":"Remarque's novel on the atrocities of war was, for me, a life-changing novel. Regardless of one's opinion on war (both generally, and specific conflicts), I would argue this is a must-read.

Therefore, the death was not big deal for them at that time. They could not do anything that they wanted to do. They could not have things that we have.

Click on the book and go to page 3 and at the top in the first three lines is an example of what I am talking about. Also there are tons of grammatical errors. Commas are missing. Misspellings are rampant. It looks like a first edition translation from German gone wrong. I haven't looked at any other copies printed by other printing companies but I think it is safe to say that a classic like this has been edited better by other printing companies.Right now I am in Chapter 3 and I don't know whether to keep reading or buy a different copy because these errors are ruining it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but horrible edition","review":"This a very important work, perhaps a little dated in it's language but a classic nonetheless.

I thought it was difficult to get into and that it wasn't very appealing. I may think this because I am not a big fan of war books. However, Remarque used stories from the time when he was in war and turned them into a fiction novel. I think that the movie portrays better what his novel is about. The movie from the nineteen 30's was very well put together. Overall I thought that the book was bland, boring and not a very interesting read.

It covers all of the horrors and fruitlessness of war in an appealing and amazing fashion. The story is about German soldier Paul Baumer, who is caught up in the patriotic zeal of his classmates and signs up for WWI. Through the novel he shares his tale of humanity lost, lives forever shattered, and a longing for an impossible thing, to return home. This book was in fact based on Remarque's experiences as a soldier in that war. Even translated, the language is colorful and adds greatly to the experience.

I found all the stories to be repetitive thematically. While it was better than say Crane's THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE, it was not conveyed as intensly. Remarque uses simple words to try and convey powerful intense emotions, which was only somewhat effective. I did like reading something from the point of the losing Germans, but I found it still dull. Possibly someone who was in World War II or in live combat situations would appreciate more the great losses suffered by the protagonist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never read this book","review":"This book was so bad, I would never consider reading it again. The book was slow and boring, and the reading level is fairly low. Paul was a boring character and there was not much characterization.

It also shows the bitter honesty of those who fought the war and the heroes who remembered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Portrayal","review":"I think one of the strongest aspects of this story is how it illustrates the psychological deconstruction of human beings. Not only does it unearth the horrors hidden from society, it really conveys the reality for these men -- all they know is war, just as Paul states on one occasion.It is an incredible human drama and the most powerful war story of all time. Everyone should be required to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Quiet on the Western Front","review":"All Quiet on the Western Front was an amazing book with many levels of symbolism and incredible descriptive writing. It has a plot that shows a dramatic change in all the main characters as they fight to understand what they are fighting for. It is a must-read, especially for people graduating from high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor printing","review":"The literature speaks for itself; the text is classic. The printing itself, however, is very poor. Paragraphs are sporadically positioned and oddly broken up, making it difficult to read at times. Baaarely worth the discounted price. Upgrade if you want a better quality copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiddler","review":"All quiet on the western front was a very exciting book. It really gets the reader closer to world war one. It shows you the real hardships of war that a young soldier has to deal with, like fallen comrades pulling the trigger on another person. The book is very informational about the small details of war. It is a great book for high school seniors to read, especially if they are planning on joining the military. It shows them some of the hardships that they might face as a soldier. This book will help to prepare any soldier that is about to face combat. It will show them some of the harsh realities that they might face on the battle field. I recommend this book to any high school senior that is planning on joining the military."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition is abridged!","review":"This edition (Pacemaker Classics paperback) is abridged and that is not indicated anywhere!

I chose to read All Quiet On the Western Front by Erich Remarque, in my senior English class. I think everbody should read this book, just becuase it is a story of an average soilder and how they live. People watch televsion and think war is that way, but when you get on the front line it is totally different, soilders face different missions and problems everday. They are brave, not afraid to die, and they try to defend there country. I think Erich Remarque did a great job on getting the real story about war. Every senior English class should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorn and a rose","review":"I'll admit it... I'm not that smart. I probably would not have read this book on my own. I can get bored easily. So I read All Quiet because I was assigned to in school. It's a complete surprise to me (and to those who know me) that this book is now on my list of favorites.I see this book fulfilling a purpose much like Saving Private Ryan. War is not a glorious thing. War is ugly. War is grisly and gory and effects everyone involved, fighting or at home, deeply. I found this novel to be a clear wake up call as to the true evils of war, which my generation has never experienced and does not really know.Buried in this realism, however, is a literary gem. Remarque's writing presents this starkness in such poetry that I found myself wanting to read out loud, just to feel the cadences of the words. The novel is beautiful at the same time as it is ugly. That is true mastery of the written language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note - This is the 90 page abridged version. Not full novel","review":"Buyer beware.

I really enjoyed it and you would too."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Quiet on the Western Front","review":"All quiet on the Western Front depicted war very well. It portrayed the images of war in great detail. The book grabs you and makes you want to read more. At times it can be very depressing, but it was and still is the reality of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was Great!!!","review":"I recently read this book and found it detailed, funny, and very entertaining. Though a book of this sort tends to be huge and boring, Remarques' \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" was fact-filled and yet entertaing. It made lite of the horrors of war, but was detailed in its descriptions. I would recomend it to any reader looking for a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I was assigned to read this for history, and I can honestly saw fort my 9th grade honors education this was not necessary and was very confusing. I did enjoy reading it on the kindle,though, because I can tap for the definitions of words I did not understand. This book was the worst book was filled with violence and even gross details I did not wish to know. DO NOT READ IF NOT AN ADULT WHO APPRECIATES WAR OR ASSIGNED TO BY A TEACHER. This a horrible book from my perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to Quiet on the Western Front","review":"All Quiet on the Western front is about a German boy named Paul Baumer. Paul Baumer and his friends are enlisted in the german Army in World War 1. They are enthusiastic about becoming soldiers but after the first bombardment in the trenches they snap. The war lasts for years but Paul still asks himself the same question: why are all my friends getting shot around me but I am still alive? All Quiet on the Western Front describes the physical and psychological drain a war has on a person. This book is not for people who do not like the horrors of war"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful stuff!","review":"This book packs a punch! It is a story that transcends eras. Read this book, and then watch the movie (which is quite true to the book). This is a great war novel, perhaps even the best. It provides invaluable insight into the mind and soul of a soldier, and the conflicts that rage in his mind during The Great War, now known as World War I. This book is excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece That Reveals the Soldier's Life","review":"I first picked up this book and was intrigued that it was written about Germans in WWI. Since I had little knowledge of this army in a war I knew little of, I immediately read it, finishing in a few days. Having just finished CATCH-22 (which I suggest if you are in for humor with information), this book was rather a downer. All the same, I give it an equal five stars. This book shows the German soldier's feelings, fears, and lifestyle during the Great War. I admit that the prose is not exactly the most poetic, but being that it is a translation, I give it some slack. Really great book, highly recommeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Quiet on the Western Front","review":"All Quiet on the Western Front is a remarcable story of war. Remraque displaye's war very well through this book. It is without doubt one of the best war books ever written. It is exciting and shows the mental hardships of war. If you are interested in war books or more specificaly World War 1 then you will love All Quiet on the Western Front."},{"rating":"1","title":"fatally misleading","review":"I bought this book because I had to actually read \\"All is Quiet on the Western Front\\"; this book, it turns out, is only a collection of essays about the book. Do not buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Quiet on the Western Front","review":"First being introduced to this novel for a school project, I found All Quiet on the Western Front to be a truly powerful book. I have read many books about war before, but never one like Erich Maria Remarque's. The horrors of WWI are told straight forward through a young German soldier's eyes. He is faced with terrible living condiitions and struggles with the cruelty of war. So if you are looking for a true war novel, All Quiet on the Western Front will give you a new point of view on life during WWI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice suprise!","review":"When I first encountered this book I was in high school, the teacher tended to pick the most boring material but this book caught me. Its been several years since then but when I saw this book again on a book store shelf I couldn't help myself. Since I bought this I have had 3 roommates in college dormitorys and two of them borrowed and then purchased this book.The book develops the characters in a very basic way but the rest gets added as you go along. It provides the reader with an insight into a war that seems to be forgotten these days and one can't help but feel for the main character. The ending though brings a fitting ending, one that seems to make the book truely whole if given the chance. I would recommend this book to anyone considering it, it was not what I exspected but better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine WWI book","review":"This view in the trenches of WW I was memorable for me, having little knowledge of WW I when I read this book. I was expecting more about what led to WW I, but was happy to read the account of the young German soldier who was not involved or terribly informed about the politics. After reading this, I read \\"Storm of Steel\\" by Ernst Junger. Remarque spends more time illustrating the ugliness and the horror, which I think is endemic in any war. His gift of description is strong, and is worth reading, but not if you want to know about the grand picture. This is about the nitty gritty daily experiences of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every would-be statesman","review":"This is certainly one of the best novels I've ever read. I thought it was a story about humanity and the lack of humaneness, how battle strips a person of every human quality and turns him into nothing but a piece of machinery in the mechanics of war. Remarque's stark descriptions of battle were frightenly devoid of euphemism. After reading this book, I'm afraid the romance of war has been spoiled for me - and I feel sure that was the author's intention. A must read for every would-be statesman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can we ban all wars please?","review":"If this book didn't cause politicians and other war-mongering world leaders to look for less violent approaches to problem-solving, they probably didn't read it. Maybe this was written about a war that happened ages ago, the same thing still happens today: young people go to arms unknowing of the realities of the battlefield. When one thinks of it, the citizens who fight the wars don't have any reason to fight the \\"enemies\\" who are also individual citizens somewhere else. It should be the case that politicians get together and duke it out if they have problems to solve and not to get everyone else involved. There would be fewer problems that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"True War","review":"This is one of the all time greatest anti-war books. Erich Maria Remarque uses the cruelty of war to show its true horror. I really enjoyed how the story is not about so high ranking official but of a normal foot solder. It allows one to see war for how it is for the masses and not for the leader of a country. It does get a little repetitive in some places but its pros greatly out weigh it cons. This book should be read by every one at least once, so they can see war as it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning","review":"this remains the best book i have ever read. as depressing as it is, it completely takes away any glory that is affiliated with war. while many people looka t war the way they look at a football game, \\"hope my team wins\\", this gives you a totally different perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Quiet on the Western Front","review":"This novel is an excellent story of a young man's forced growth into adulthood. Paul Baumer, the narrator, is a 20 year-old German soldier in World War I that enlisted right after high school. He sees his comrades fall from shrapnel, gas, bombs, and bullets, one by one. He is made to see the atrocities of war: the amputations, the loneliness, the fear, the anticipation, and the slow deaths. Paul often wonders of his own fate, and trys to remain clear-headed to save his life on the front.I chose this book from a list of about 20 titles, with only a faint knowledge of the story line. It was a gripping story, from the first chapter to the last, and held my attention right up to the end. I was able to identify with the narrator as he tried to maintain his sanity in a world of chaos, and how he tried to not forget his youth despite the forced maturity that comes with, in his case, being a soldier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow boring book","review":"This book was not very good.

I read this book last year, and I still am in awe with the power it had. I reccomend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man Destroyed by the Sorrow of War","review":"I will be a sophomore this year in high school. Last year I read this book in English class and it completely reconstructed my perspective of war. This book thoroughly describes how Paul Baumer and his comrades were destroyed not only physically, but emotionally too. They did not have to die throught the shells that were snaring them, but only a phsycological death. Great book full of suspense, romance, and tragedy. I'm glad my teacher selected it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book everyone should read","review":"All Quiet on The Western Front is a great classic that goes deep into the soul of life and death.

It's supposed to be something to be avoided, otherwise it wouldn't be a successful method of solving problems. In the case of World War One, I agree with most of the things said in this book, but you can't generalise to all wars. The whole point of a war is to secure the common welfare, and preserve the needs of the many. put plainly, some things are worth fighting for. In this book Remarque shows his ignorance by seeming not to realise this. I will agree that most wars have not been for the good of the people, but you can't make a blanket statement, manipulating millions of individuals with the pacifistic propaganda presented in this book.

At one point, the little boy actually threatens to return the dog to the loathsome pet shop!The plot's focus on ostracism, and the implicit theme of conformity, are bad.

He digs and digs and digs up things he shouldn't. The boy is mad and tells the dog he's taking him back to the pound.

I no longer had the one we read when he was a child, so we went on Amazon and to our delight we discovered it was still offered for sale. When it arrived, my son's eyes lit up with joy and with the wonderful memories this book brought back. Here's hoping his twins will love this book as much as their daddy did as a child.

Luckily I read it in advance. It is a product of its generation. The book starts with a sad dog at the pound that a young boy rescues - ok, good so far. The dog can't dig very well and the little boy helps him to learn so he won't be made fun of by the other dogs - still ok. Then the dog learns to dig - yeah! BUT he digs too much and the little boy gets very mad, says he's a terrible dog that has made him mad instead of glad and that he is going to return him to the pound because he is a bad dog. Things end with the dog learning to control his digging so he doesn't end up taken back to the pound. The boy shows no love or sympathy for the dog and threatens to get rid of him the minute he does anything wrong.

If you were a teen in the 80's you'll be brought back to the scene full blast! Also this movie comes at an affordable price. Which I wish all Blu Ray catalog titles would learn from.

I couldn't have cared less what happened to the 'hero.' And you can keep all the null-A mumbo jumbo.Maybe this novel was written on a bet to prove that people will read anything?

Afterwards I reapply this and I am good for another week.It does not absorb into hair quickly so it remains greasy for a long time after application.

I have to say though that this recording is in my opinion quite wide of the mark. \\"Roundabout\\" has a couple of fine moments on it, but overall it's a very poor outing. It may in fact be his worst recording since \\"True Believers\\". After 40 years and dozens of recordings we can't expect them all to be jems. This one I believe falls far short of what most people would expect from Keaggy. I think it's important to be honest with reviews even of our most cherished musicians. I would hate to think that some poor person or tennager without much money had spent it on this badly made CD when they could have spent it on one of Keaggy's best. Also, a first time listener may never give any of his better music a chance if they hear this CD first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get This Book, If You Can!","review":"This book is the one of the best books that I ever read, and best by Brenda Joyce.

Together these two find a deep love that is filled with passion that borders on obsession. The love between this two was jumping off the pages. This book was so great, that I counldn't put is down.

Those reviewers who found Gordon & Livingstone's writing to be difficult to read may consider a course in \\"Hooked on Phonics\\". This is not a novel.

While with Grayest of Blue Skies I was left in awe, this album was merely enjoyable. There's nothing wrong with the songs, I'll admit there are many high points. Scott sings better then he ever has, and Sean is playing awesome bass lines through most of the songs, but besides that there is little to warrant placing it above (pun intended) their other efforts. Lyrically F11 takes a step down, as only a few very bright spots exist around the middle of the album. Overall musically they are the same as always, and that's fine.I did indeed enjoy listening to the album, it's a great rock album, but after two very growth-induced albums, I truly expected more from F11.

You will not find any songs on this CD with the heavy raw emotion of dramatic feeling that their last CD was filled with. Instead, you will find a healthy dose of the same kind of plain, trendy music that is filling the radio airways everyday.

I like peppy, upbeat music, but also require some knowledge of more than just a few chords and some idiot screaming like he's on fire. This cd has some mellow stuff, for sure, but all is awesome.Among my favorites are 'Good Times', 'Complicated Questions', 'Therapy' and 'Stay In Shadow'...not to say the rest in not good, but these set the flavor for the entire cd.The singers voice sounds great and the music is driving and catchy...must-have if you're a F11 fan and a good cd to try if you've never heard them.

Sounding like a mix of Papa Roach (minus the angst) and Hoobastank (minus the songwriting ability) the CD falls woefully short in the creativity department. The fourth track on the disk, Good Times, borders on annoying. So much so in fact, that I find myself dreading it. Musically this disk is so bland it is hard to imagine that they ever got signed in the first place. There are a couple of interesting tracks (Absent Elements, a chunky melodic mid-tempo tune, and Conversations, a drum-driven ode to what appears to be a strained relationship) that warrant the disk two stars. Other than that Finger Eleven is average at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELL OUTS, COMPLETE SELL OUTS","review":"This is sad hard to belive but sad you take a band wave some money in there face then wave a little more and you change there style and control the songs they write.This is called a sell-out.

I won this book and paid little attention to it for a long time. When I finally browsed through it, I was shocked to find that the breed information given about \\"my\\" breed (Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs) is almost 100% incorrect. The breed history is inaccurate, the breed standards are misstated and the personality traits are totally wrong. It seems like Mr. Dibra didn't even do cursory research on the breed before writing a summary about it. I'm not as familiar with many other breeds, but did find some glaring inaccuracies about others as well. Please research breeds through nationally accredited breed websites. If you want to research a breed or breeds, don't trust this book as an accurate source of information.

It's not a full movie--it's 4 Thomas episodes with a story in between. The movie opens with an engine driver \\"Perkins\\" entering the Knapford Engine Drivers Common Room. Sir Topham Hatt calls and informs Perkins that he will be coming to inspect the station. Perkins begins cleaning the messy station in preparation for the inspection. This is the running story in between episodes (these mostly center around Perkins cleaning TOO quickly and making a bigger mess in his rush).Episodes:Thomas' Tall FriendPercy's New FriendsToby and BashBig BelleThese are all upbeat and cheerful episodes, so they are enjoyable to watch.

While some of the basic advice is worthy (stock a 2 week food supply and plenty of water, keep cash on hand), most of the advice is given from a paranoid survivalist point of view with an amazing lack of good common sense. The advice for alien invasions is particularly entertaining. For those who still believe that the key to survival is to go native, a much more informative read is the Boy Scout Fieldbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought provoking but lacking any practical applicability","review":"While the book was thought provoking at times it quickly became very predictable in its senario approach. Forwarned is forarmed and preparedness is a good message, however, this book is virtually devoid of any useful how-to information.

Granted producer Aaron Spelling died between 10th & 11th seasons and Brenda Hampton didn't have a lot of \\"meat\\" to work with since a lot of the cast members were missing or came in late. But at the end of 10th season, the last words of the season, spoken by Sandy, said to Simon about her baby \\"Simon, we need to talk.\\" And...they didn't elaborate on that statement, which left a lot of room for speculation that was never relieved. Then in season 11, we were left with a lot of cliff-hangers, such as Simon and his new girlfriend, Ruthie and T-Bone, Lucy and her pregnancy, Lucy and Kevin moving, etc. The season was a bit corny and childish at times. I rate it a 2 out of 10. However, I'm going to purchase it not because I love the season, but just to complete my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"7th Heaven: The Final Season","review":"I was totally disappointed in the way they ended the season.

In the end the book left me incredibly empty--even if we have an innate moral sense it has been selected for so weakly that it becomes generally useless when humanity needs it the most. Wilson unforunately couches too much of his argument in the culture wars of the early 1990s and constructs too many obvious straw men to make his argument useful in a broader sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating insights to human's sense of morality and society","review":"Wilson provides a facinating overview of our inate moral standards throughout history with the focus being on the differences and similiarities of current cultures.

The jog dial is great, with tremendous capacity, and so much easier than trying to remember \\"location numbers\\" for everyone. The intercom feature has saved us from having to yell for someone elsewhere in the house. My only regret is that I didn't buy a 3rd cordless handset while they were still available. By the time I realized I wanted one, Sony had discontinued them for some reason. We've also had no problems with the equipment even though one of the handsets was dropped outside on the concrete. In reading the other reviews, I see that someone had quite a few problems with theirs, but fortunately, that's not been our experience. Now if only I could find that extra handset, and at a reasonable price....."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice idea, but better not...","review":"I just took this phone back to the store. I had two portable hand sets. After 1 week, the first refused to connect to the base. Exchanged it for a new one, however the replacement was useless: with the one originally registered but exchanged phone missing, the base refused to register the second phone. Sony help-desk said I should have 'unregistered' the first phone. Note however (1) the manual is explicit about the fact you can not unregister phones (2) how do I unregister a phone that doesn't want to communicate with the base in the first place? Sony adviced me that only solution was to take everything back to the store. So in effect, one part goes bad, the whole system needs to be replaced. Talk about poor design... Human factors on this thing are rather poor as well, e.g., there's no squeezing this one between your chin and shoulder without running the risk of pushing (disconnect) buttons. I was more than happy to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cordless I've ever had","review":"The sound quality is fine in my apt. but if I walk 10 feet away the connection breaks up. I bought a powerful cordless to be able to at least walk to my mailbox and remain on the phone but this phone doesn't allow for that. It's a pain to program--you can't set the time on the base, and although I've set it several times from the handset, the time STILL says 12:00--it's as bad as a VCR. Accessing my speed dial numbers is a four part process (its faster for me to just dial the number). The sound quality on the answering machine outgoing message is unacceptable. I've recorded several times and it still sounds like I recorded it from a depth of 4000 feet. I've had three Sony phones (only because I continually have to return them to the manufacturer and they send a new one) because after about 6 months the key pads stop working. Sony should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, flexible, great reception","review":"I've had this phone for three years now, and it works great.

That should have been a sign. In the few years I've had it it's only intermittently worked as advertised. Within in the last year caller id info will NEVER show up on any of the handsets and will only be displayed 1/50 times so if you like to know who is calling you, you'll simply be stuck with **RINGING**.I don't think they still make this phone.

No complaints. However it fails abysmally at simply being a telephone. Since telephones are all about hearing what someone is saying, it is very dissapointing to hear its poor audio quality. This problem is most prominent with respect to the speaker in the base unit. One uses this speaker when reviewing incoming messages and when using the speakerphone function. In these two uses, my phone's audio quality is so bad that it is irritating to use it. Many messages are difficult to hear and this is despite selecting the high sampling rate option for incoming messages.To make matters worse Sony is playing by the rule book when it comes to me trying to return the phone.I have no idea if I simply got a bad unit or if this is a bad design.

Officer Lituma and Lieutenant Silvia of the Guardia Civil investigate the crime to answer the title question while discovering the reality of the segregation of social classes and the wall it puts up creating forbidden love.

The album presents a satisfying mixture of the classics such as Bach's \\"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\\" and pop classics such as Leroy Anderson's \\"A Christmas Festival\\", and, of course, no such collection would be complete without Anderson's \\"Sleighride\\". The album jump-started me into the season and, to tell the truth, I have listened to its timeless sounds several times since the passing of the season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to say","review":"I had high hopes for this book. Do only were the reviews glowing but the first few pages, which I read using \\"look inside this book\\", were beautiful. In fact so is the rest of the book. Sylvan is a gifted writer, and her style is the reason for the two stars I did give this book. Unfornately, the wonderfully written words fail to express anything of substance. Sylvan says over and over that Wicca is about daily practice and not monthly festivals, and that is essentially it. On how to incorporate Wicca into your daily life Sylvan basicly says to love all and live in balance. As if this was new advice. The book is also pitifully short - it would probably only take up 50 pages of regular sized paper.Besides the writing itself, this book does have one saving grace. The book of moonlight. If you thought Sylvan's prose was good, wait til you see her poetry. Though she only gives us a few tidbits to work with, they are treasures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step Inside Your Circle!","review":"I love, love, love this book!It is not about spellcasting, tools, rituals, correspondence charts, etc. - though it does have a lovely \\"devotionals\\" section at the back. Rather, it is about your spiritual connectedness with your chosen path and making it an integral part of your daily life instead of something you bring out at sabbats and esbats.It is written in such a refreshing, approachable way you feel like you're having a cozy chat with Dianne Sylvan. And if you're like me, and feel like I do, then you might find that this book helps you find your way to a \\"magickal life, one filled with spirit and in contact with Divinity.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book By Far","review":"I bought this book, actually, at a local bookstore...and it is by far the BEST explanation of Wicca and the meaning of being a Wiccan out there. For years, I have searched for a book like this; Wicca is something I have always had a very strong pull towards, even when I had no idea what it was called. About 10 years ago I would periodically try to dwelve into the meaning behind Wicca; but a big brick wall was all these silly \\"how-to's\\" out there that were aimed at teenagers, nothing at all about understanding the spirituality behind it - the TRUE basis of Wicca.It is still one of my favorite books to read, and I highly recommend anyone who wants to get beyond the sophomoric tomes out there to purchase this book. This should be one of the very first books you read if you're interested in learning more about Wicca."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Every Wiccan","review":"What I like the most about this book and it's purpose is that it covers an aspect of the Craft that isn't often discussed...Daily Practice. This author has taken the discipline of magickal daily practice, and gave it meaning that everyone can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great record...","review":"The first tune that grabbed me on this CD was 'Little People'... it's got a real catchy head that lingers. The more I listened, the more I dug the whole CD. The performances are first rate (in some cases, inspired) and it's very well recorded. A very good band and a great soloist.Other reviewers mention Kenny G. but I can't imagine why. Berkley is much more old school. This is some classic Jazz. The real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"So great you just cannot give it up","review":"I still carry my 7 month old baby in it. It is easy to attach and to clean. My baby seems very confortable in it and prefers it to the stoller.TIP: I often attach teethers in one of the unused button holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely an A+ Carrier!","review":"This is a wonderful carrier! I have lower back problems so I needed something that was going to offer ME just as much support as the baby. I love the Baby Bjorn! And so does our daughter. She will be 6 weeks soon. She usually falls asleep when I put her in the carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"One caution","review":"I love the Baby Bjorn, so don't want to duplicate all previous gushing. My one concern is that babies can tend to get overheated if you are outside in warm weather. They are held against your warm body, and surrounded by the thick carrier. I tried it once in warm weather and my baby heated rapidly to a point of being red and sweaty. My recommendation is--BUY IT, but keep this in mind when it's warm outside. You might want to go with a stroller at those times--it's not worth heat stroke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution - May hurt baby's spine","review":"I was considering buying one of these for our 1st baby, but the lactation consultant told that new research is finding that prolonged time spent in this carrier may actually damage babies spines because it is not a natural position for a young baby. She recommended using a sling instead because it puts baby in a more natural position. I carried my baby in his sling until he was over a year. He loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Aweful - Hard to Use","review":"Don't understand what the hipe is all about. We got one thinking it was the best thing since sliced bread - due to all the positive reviews - and was very disappointed. It was extremely hard to get our baby in and out of it. Her legs kept getting stuck. It took two people to use. Getting a child in and out alone was next to impossible. Also seemed like it was squishing the baby. Poor thing couldn't move arms or legs while inside. As an infant, her head was pinned to your chest. We immediately returned this overpriced item for a sling - which was great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great quality but a little too tight....=(","review":"I bought this carrier when my baby was already 4-5 months. I thought that it would give me some help on doing stuff while my daughter is in it. Unfortunately I found that it was pressing her too tightly towards me, and it didn't make her very comfortable. I figured that maybe she is already too old for it.As far as I can judge, I read the instructions and made it as wide as I could. Can't say anything, it was easy to get her in and out, but I still couldn't use it. I maybe used it 3 times after all.Overall , not an item I could live without for the price it cost me....=("},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the new model -comfort and convinience all in one","review":"My husband and I are students with two young children - ages 2 (27 months) and 3 months, so first of all, purchasing this item was a big step when we live on a tiny budget! We LOVE it!!! We bought the brand new one (not the one pictured above- it's the new 2003 model) It has the attatchements that slide in on the sides, making it a sinch to put on. It also has the plastic snaps to hold up baby's head and the teathers to tighten or loosen the part that holds baby's head. Anyhow, it is wonderful! the new 2003 model is so easy to put on, and even my 6'4\\" 260lb hubby LOVES it, and thinks it is really comfy. It also makes my life easy with my two little ones - my toddler is in the stoller, and the baby is in the baby bjorn - and i don't get tired of it no matter how long or far we end up walking. WORTH THE MONEY, in my opinion!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best baby purchase we made","review":"When I was pregnant with my son, we were on a very tight budget, but had heard so much about this, we knew we had to have it. He was premature, so we had to wait awhile to use it, but it was awesome when we were finally able to do so. I firmly believe this was the best baby purchase we ever made. I never took the carseat out of the car, it was so much easier to hand carry him or put him in the Bjorn - I hated leaving him in some plastic contraption when he had could have his Mommy hold him. I don't think I even took his stroller out of the box until he was 6 months old and pushing 25 lbs, which my back just can't handle. He sat in his baby bjorn on several international flights, on train rides, on the subway, on beaches, in museums, etc, and it was absolutely amazing how easy it all was. This is not something I'd have any infant without - I currently use it for 9 month old twins I nanny for. It's fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE!!","review":"This is a definite must have! My three month old loves to be snuggled in this carrier. It is especially helpful when we go shopping and go to church. He falls asleep every time he goes in it! It is definitely worth the extra money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Bjorn carrier not great for everyone","review":"Hi, I received this carrier for my new born because the others did not get as great of reviews. Well This carrier is not great for everyone. It never was comfortable for my back and now that my son is 4 months and about 16 pounds there was no way I could carry him around any more in it. It was way to hard on my back. I was wearing it properly and everyhting. My husband also found it very uncomfortable. I tried the Snugli (red and navy) and it is great, it also can go on your back, wich I feel is a great advantage. So my advice. TRY IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT(with a baby in it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use but upper back gets tired!","review":"We started using the Baby Bjorn for walks when our son was 2 weeks old. The wide soft straps are great but since there's no waist/hip strap to take the weight off your back, your upper back does get tired. The carrier is simple enough that one person alone can get the baby safely into it. Our son loved it from the beginning. We used it to calm his colicky spells, and it always worked. We have a Snugli Easy Comfort Plus which is more comfortable for wearing longer periods (has a hip strap) but is much harder to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST have for new parents!","review":"Used the Bjorn CONSTANTLY with my son from age 6 weeks to 6 months.

Far as I know, she liked it. Got a thank you and avoided the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely best baby carrier","review":"This is a great baby carrier. Our daughter loves it. The baby grows faster than your muscles can develop. Unless your baby falls asleep on her own in her crib right from the start, this is a must have. Our arms were about to fall off from carrying her all the time but with this carrier, it made it much easier. She loved it and we loved it. It does take some getting used to putting it on quickly. But once you get the hang of it, it is a snap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful.","review":"I found the Baby Bjorn carrier to be very useful, especially when I needed to walk the dog with the baby along. Also, my son seems to get the most fussy around dinner time, and placing him the carrier allowed me to eat dinner with my family, even if it meant standing up rather than sitting down (it is difficult to sit with the carrier on as the child's legs are then forced to bend backwards).I also had some concerns about the plastic disc closures at the base of the carrier. When my son was in the carrier for an extended period of time, he would have impressions in the clothing around his diaper area as though these closures were pressing into him. It might be better if the carrier were designed with these covered with padding of some sort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"This is the most comfortable carrier I have ever tried (I've tried 2 other brands). It has literally become part of my outfit. I can carry my daughter for hours without any back strain and she loves it - she's never fussy when she's in it. I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"strains your back- slings are better and cheaper","review":"I bought this carrier due to the rave reviews I both read online and heard from friends. I was disappointed. I loved it for the first 6 weeks. Once my son hit 12-15 lbs, it strained my (and my husband's) back too much. I also didn't like how my baby's legs flopped around. My best friend is a chiropractor and she was concerned that my baby's spine was not meant to be holding up his upper body weight at that age. I agree. Little babies are meant to be cradled.I switched to a Maya Wrap sling when another friend showed me hers. It's cheaper (...), easier to put on and adjust, more portable and more ergonomically correct for the baby. My son is now 9 months, weighs 22lbs and I can carry him in the sling for 2-3 hours before my shoulder gets sore. Then I switch to the other shoulder and keep going! Save your money and buy a sling!If you are going to buy a frontpack, I agree that this one is the best. I just think that slings are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Like some Carrier's","review":"I Like the Carriers that give the head support.

I used one for all 3 of my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Carrier however only used till 5 months old!","review":"This was a great carrier from about 6 weeks to 5 months old, then my boy weighed 19 lbs at 5 months old and he was too heavy for it, I had to buy another one with the metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Bjorn is worth the money!!!","review":"I first bought a sling (which my daughter HATED) and I had another less expensive, complicated front pack, which the baby liked, but killed my back. I work in a Dr office and the baby comes with me to work, so I often have to \\"wear\\" my baby. The Baby Bjorn is soooo comfy for both me and my now 6 month old baby. It is so worth the extra money. Don't waste you time and money on other carriers. Your baby and your back will thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-rounded look at a classic","review":"The Bedford edition of this classic novel contains more than the typical Charles Dickens tale. In addition to the text are five excellent essays on this novel. Often Great Expectations is taught in a mundane and archaic manner.

I don't have such a bent and therefore found it rather hard going in places. The cases are interesting, but not nearly enough are about spies, which is why I bought it. Quite a lot of legal detail, with its specialised reasoning, makes it hard for the general, casual reader like me, though a barrister friend's eyes lit up at the sight of it, and the author's name. It would make a good gift for the lawyer in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound... Great Price ....

What worked for me were fit, comfort, suppleness, and of course looks.

I wasn't expecting it to be perfect and it's not. It won't play all MP3 files. I seem to have the most trouble with VBR encoded files but I've also seen some CBR files that won't play. Some of the controls on the player don't always work as advrtised. For example skipping folders works sometimes but not always. It seems like they rushed this one to market a little soon. But if you do a little testing with the unit up front and you're careful with how you encode your files, it's ok for the price I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This book not only helped me understand the importance adoption, it also helped me get past my own grieving of infertility loss through understanding the pain of others.A must read for all adoptive parents or those considering adoption. I also recommend it for the grandparents too so that the parents have the moral support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"As a prospective adoptive parent, I liked this book. I thought it brought up some very important issues to think through and be aware of. Most things I've thought through before, but some were new. I did find myself skeptical at some of it, though. I have two biological children with many of the traits she attributes to \\"adoption loss\\", which are not about adoption but rather their personality traits or just kids being kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Angst Oriented","review":"As an adopted person and a full-time stepmom, I found this book to focus way too much on the negative and on angst. I certainly had my share of issues as a teen, but I really don't think they are all traced back to my adoption and the six months I spent in a home prior to being placed in a family. Also, even though I am in contact with my biological family, my adoptive parents are my parents. That is how all involved think of the situation. In naming a book about adoption, I would never think to use the term adoptive parents. In fact, I had never considered the term before recently doing research for an assigned class topic in grad school. There is a sever lack of positive and empowering books about adoption, particularly for teens, and this book does not fulfill that need either, much to my disappointment. When my daughter begins questioning what the situation is with her Mom and discussing whether I will adopt her, I really want one for her to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I am a foster parent and an adoptive parent I also know some adult adoptees. This book gives the most depressing and morose view of adoption that there is. Sure, there is loss amongst adoptees. Sure, there is a longing to know your history. But, as a parent of any child being open, honest and doing your best to help your child through tough spots, whatever they are, is the critical element. What is not important is reading a book by an ultra conservative, adoptee who has no other educational or reasearch back round OTHER than her circumstance.Buy the Weaver's Craft, written by professionals and adoptive parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written and very negative","review":"I have read a lot of books on adoption lately and this one is right up there with the worse. It is poorly written and really offers little insight. It seems the author has a chip on her shoulder about adoption and uses her adoption as an excuse. reading this actually made me quite angry. It's unfortunate that people who are educating themselves on adoption may be influenced by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read for adoptive parents and anyone trying to help them","review":"I'm a therapist and a waiting adoptive parent. I found this book very useful for my work with patients (adoptive parents and adopted kids) and my own process. My only criticism is that the author's religious beliefs sometimes seem to pop up. They are not woven into the work and seem awkward and forced and are not really helpful for folks who don't share her spiritual beliefs leaving some of the advice hollow. This is not to say tht this is not a nescessary read for all adoptive parents and professionals working with adoptive families regardless of religious or spiritual beliefs. The info in the book is invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book shows adoptees as victims!","review":"As an adult adoptee and now mother of an adopted son, this book made me mad! This book talks about grief, grief, and more grief. Adoption should be talked about openly and honestly and seen as an incredibly positive thing for everyone. Sure questions about identity will arise but adoptive parents must emphasize that the child is just as much a part of the family as any other child. This book makes an adoptee feel like he or she is the bad seed or that the parents are struggling with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, As Far As It Goes","review":"Eldridge's book was fine as far as it went. As a prospective adoptive parent, I sure would have liked to have more balance in the book. Not all of my adopted friends experienced the extremes Eldgridge points to here. This book is a good starting place for those interested in adopting a baby, but not for anyone looking to adopt an older child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential Adoptive Parent","review":"I agree with some of the earlier writers. I read this book in preparation for adoptive parenting. It scared me to death! I appreciate the comments of an earlier reviewer who is also adopted.

I appreciate the honesty, but it is one woman's story. I am going to stick to the parenting books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for international adoption","review":"This book has a catchy title but no substance. While the chapter titles are good topics to contemplate the content of the chapters is lacking.The author considers any adoption other than a completely open adoption to be unacceptable. Of course, this isn't relevant to international adoptions or situations where parents would like to share information with their children but do not have any.Almost every chapter starts with a definition of a word; a rather sophomoric tactic to fill up pages.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. There are much better books out there. This author seems to have come up with a title first then tried to find stuff to fulfill it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Adoption Book I've Read","review":"I am flabbergasted that there are this many positive reviews. This book was awful; I couldn't even finish it. The author is overly dramatic and takes maternal psychoanalysis to an extreme. Let me save you some time with this tidbit. She has a conversation with the adopted son - who is now 7 years old - and asks him how painful his surrender was. He was THREE days old but tells her it WAS painful and he felt alone and unloved.

However I tried to read through it to get any bit of nuggets of information. When I got to a part that instructed me to draw a picture of my child and then draw a big hole in the middle of the child and explain to her that that is the emptiness she feels inside I wanted to burn it. I didn't only because it was a library book. Don't even bother reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As an adoptive mother, I was excited to read this book. But my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. Why? Because:The most enlightening parts of the book came when the author was quoting other authors.I felt like the information was so dated.

Everyone has had issues in their life that can cause emotional problems, adopted or not, but you can't just focus on the \\"hole in the middle of you.\\" If you do that, you are destined to feel sad and depressed.

If you interested in healing emotional wounds from adoption, try Deborah Gray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one, there are better books out there!","review":"I read this book (and many others) in the early stages of adopting our son. This book took every ounce of joy from the process. So many negative comments and connotations. This is the last book I would recommend to someone going through an adoption. The author clearly has issues pertaining to her adoption and is trying to push them off on those who became parents via adoption. Rather than inflict the negativity of this book upon yourself, choose a different book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neo-Traditionalist Diatribe","review":"Under the false pretnse of laid out in the title, Sherrie Eldridge lays out what is essentially an endorsement of Traditional family values and discpline, but perversley advocates for it from the child's perspective. Things include \\"My country of origin outlaws abortion because the holy father says its wrong\\", \\"Mommy, Daddy, if I missbehave use the bamboo rod\\", and \\"If I'm caught writing with my left hand, please hit it with a ruler\\".

First of all the Author didn't explain her relationship with her parents. All we really knew was that they passed away and it was rocky during her teenage years. As an adoptive parent, I understand children feeling loss and misunderstood, but give us parents a break once in awhile. Most adoptive parents are wonderful, we seek help for the children when needed and change our whole life around to please the children in the family. Why do many Adult adoptees grow up unconnected with their adoptive parents? I just can't understand this and never will. I suppose children could stay with their birth parents and suffer through the drug addiction and alcoholism, let alone homelessness ect. But instead they get homes filled with love and parents who put them first.I doubt, I will buy any other books from this Author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary book","review":"I would NOT recommend this book to anyone considering adoption and the recommendations that Ms. Eldridge gives for adoptive children could be very psychologically harmful to children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with a Grain of Salt","review":"I couldn't finish reading this book because I felt like I was being brain washed. Yes, I am adopted. Yes, I understand that some people have difficulties raising adopted children and dealing with all the issues that come with adoption; but this book was so negative/dramatized/and over thought that I had to stop reading.This is my problem. I don't like people telling me or hypothesizing how I feel; that I suffer from abandoment issues, identity probelms and struggle with trusting or emotionally attaching myself to others. I don't like it that adoptees have these tags on them and are made to feel different.I wanted to tell the author to shut up. I love my life. I love my parents. I wouldn't and couldn't have chose anything better.So maybe you need this book, maybe you like this book but it is definitely not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adopt a Mom","review":"I felt the book was a great set up to screw up your adopted child. I also felt that the author has deeply embedded issues that she needs to deal with. I do agree that their is a grieving process though. I also agree that infants do sense more then we give them credit for. I felt the book was very defeating for adoptive parents. I want what is best for my child and I felt that this book would not be for us or for my child. I am sorry her parents are dead. They did the best that they could in raising the author. No upbringing is ideal but it may be better then being brought up in an abusive home (like I was). Maybe she should thank the people who do adopt because their is alot of \\"anti-adoptism\\" out there. My child would have been in an emotionally neglectful household and be brushed aside had she stayed with the birth mom. Adoption is a special event and not an event that is suppose to scar someone for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book dwells on negative","review":"This book dwells too much on negativity. It also seems to blame adoption for everything that can go wrong in an adoptee's life. I have adopted and maternal children, all of which go thru the same teenage issues of any other teenager. The adopted children do not dwell on any adoptive \\"loss\\" so to speak. We have focused on all of the positive things in life from the beginning, and they are all happy, healthy, and well adjusted.

As painful as it may be to try to understand some of the more difficult aspects of the family of adoption, not attending to them is to choose not to fully understand ourselves and our children. Eldridge gives excellent examples and specifically explains things that parents can do to foster growth and self-awareness for their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pratical, insightful and informative","review":"I have used this book with our Adoption Support Group and for me personally. I am an adult, adopted as a baby. This book is excellent for anyone touched by adoption. It gives the adopted child's perspecitve on being adopted. There are the known and unknown issues adopted children face and this Book is excellent to dig into those areas and to help bring healing. Also excellent for the adopted parent to understand their adopted child. This Book also offers very practical advice to reach your adopted child's heart and help them become all they can be. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone that has been touched by adoption. It is excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Connecting to the Heart of the Adoption World","review":"Twenty Things\\" is an outstanding book! As an older child adoptee, I can directly relate to most of what is in the book. Especially, experiencing the pain of loss, rejection, and as a result dealing with anger. The research is amazingly expansive and draws from the best of adoption literature and related resources. Sherrie Eldridge not only writes from the perspective of an adoptee, but also with the heart of a mother and grandmother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew","review":"If you have not adopted kids before, this book might scare you and keep you from it. It is written from such a negative point of view. If you can take out the negativity and keep the other stuff, it'd be okay. The author definitely lets her pain show through her book and it gets in the way of the point she tries to make. She just takes it a little too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viewpoint is clouded by authors emotions","review":"The author here seems to have a very one side view of being an adoptee. I'm fairly certain that if prospective parents read this first, many would run screaming from the adoption experience. I have no doubt that the author experienced the emotions she's describing, but it really does give a very negative view of adoption. I stopped reading half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't impressed","review":"I hated this book! Yes, there are issues with adoption, but this book reads like negative catharsis and basically encourages adoptive parents to teach their adoptive children to define themselves interms of their adoption and the 'adoption loss'. I'm sorry the author's family wasn't open about her adoption, but for those of us who are open with our children, i don't think this book is helpful; and could even be harmful if the author's advice is taken. The adoption and a child's feeling about it are as individual as the child. We should facilitate the child's natural curiousity and be supportive, but this book wallows in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This book seems more like a cathartic memoir of a woman's painful adoption experience rather than an unbiased helpful guide. As another reviewer wrote - who are her sources? Are they unbiased or did she seek out those with equally painful experiences? It doesn't seem to be a balanced or objective study. I couldn't even get through a third of this book - the melodrama put me off. I've read many other superior books dealing with adoption, loss, grief and attachment disorders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Insight","review":"I thought this book provided good insight into what adopted children may be thinking and feeling. Some of the other reviewers have criticized this book for portraying only the negative side of adoption. I don't think that's what Ms. Eldridge does. I think she gives honest insight as to what kids might be feeling, gives adoptive parents suggestions on how to speak with their children to see if their issue is adoption-related, then follows it with suggestions for how to deal with the issue if there is one. Will all adopted children feel the way she describes? Probably not... some kids are more sensitive, others are more resilient. But some will... and this book gives help to the parents of those children. Reading this book isn't for the faint of heart, but I believe it can provide helpful insight to adoptive parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"How To\\" must have!","review":"I've read numerous books on adoption and none explain attachment as well as this book does. Not only does the author explain what the child might be feeling, but also gives specific examples of what you, as a parent, can do to help. So many books out there hint at attachment disorders but offer no practical \\"how to\\" for dealing with it. This book does!This book is not promoted as a \\"How to\\" for dealing with attachment issues, but for me it was incredibly beneficial for that purpose. I highly recommend it for the thought provoking dialogue and honest approach to a difficult subject!"},{"rating":"2","title":"See What the Kids Think","review":"Before, during, or after you adopt read this book! It could prepare, protect, or propell your relationship with your adopted child. In my work as a speaker on family issues, I have adoptive parents ask for resources. This is one book I can highly recommend.The Birth to Five Book: Confident Childrearing Right from the Start"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have a story too","review":"am an orphan and i was adopted around November. For Christmas got me a kindle because i love to read. It was the best MOST EXENSVE thing i have ever had in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super negative and depressing book","review":"1. It is never write for 1 person to assume based on their own personal experience that ALL people feel the same exact way. That is what this author tries to do. Every adoptee is different, each one has a different and unique experience, as biological children each have a different experience with childhood too!2. While adoptees certainly face unique challenges, this book over-exaggerates and paints a \\"hopeless\\" picture that adoptees are \\"broken\\". How pessimistic and insulting.3. This author needs major therapy to move past all her bitterness and pain and should once again not claim to be the voice for millions of all adoptees around the world because of her own issues.Prospective adoptive parents do NOT read this book, it will scare you away from adoption!! (And unjustly so!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, Redundant, Read","review":"I found this book to be very redundant and depressing. If I were to summarize this book, I would say that it basically emphasized how all adopted kids experience suffering, loss, are inclined to have issues. The author recommends for parents to acknowledge this suffering by trying to identify with the child and saying things like, \\"You must be sad that you weren't born in mommy's tummy.\\" I could not identify with a lot of the advise provided in this book.I anticipated that this book would address multiple issues surrounding adoption. Instead, I got more of the same thing. Every chapter, more suffering and sadness. Although I have read up to page 120, I don't think I can muster up the effort to read the few chapters that are left.If you like to feel sad this is a must read! This book may make you want to run away from adoption."},{"rating":"1","title":"For all the reasons not to adopt ....","review":"If you want be discouraged and feel bad about your decision to love a child not born of your body then read this book!This woman definitely had a chip in her shoulder and carried a grudge for all mommy and daddy didn't do for her. NO ONE I have talked to adoptive parent or adoptee agreed with anything she wrote especially with regards to the \\"primal abandonment\\" theory.Only read it if you HAVE too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and negative, I could not finish it.","review":"After talking with other adoptive parents about this book, I found that many agreed that this book is overly negative and a little dramatic. I could not bring myself to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided","review":"I felt that this book was one sided. It felt negative and talked down to the reader. I do not believe that ALL adopted children are as depressed as this book my want you to believe. I know adopted people and have talked to them and they had a different and more positive experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak picture of adoption","review":"As a prospective adoptive parent, I had hoped to find a unique perspective given from that of the adopted child. Instead I found a book filled with apparent regret and loss on the part of the adoptee. If you are looking for a positive light in which to view adoption, I would choose another source. If I hadn't been as well informed about adoption and seen the benefits and wonderful relationships that can come from adoptive experiences, I would be very wary of entering the adoption triad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"As an adoptee, I can attest that this book was nothing less than rubbish. Yes, adoptees have issues to deal with that others do not, but the author greatly exaggerates and distorts these problems, and gives contrary and condescending advice. As she consistently attributes every problem she has to being adopted, it is apparent that she has her own issues to overcome before giving advice to others. Further, this book reads like a poorly developed high school term paper, whose sources come from a newsletter authored by Ms. Eldridge herself and very few meaningful experts. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twenty things the author wishes her adoptive parents had known","review":"I bought this book with great anticipation and found myself more disappointed with every page. The author appears to describe her personal issues, which she seems to have categorized as having all been caused by adoption, and presents them as a universal truth about all adoptees everywhere. Many of the issues she describes are very important and deserve attention (e.g., toxic shame, guilt, fear of abandonment) but they are not specific or unique to adopted people. Her broad and sweeping statements are not backed up by any research or anything other than her own unique experience and her quotes from people she has met. Her strong statements about infants who grieve for the loss of the birth mother are highly speculative but presented as truth. The book leaves no room for any experiences other than the author's. As an adoptive mother I found it unhelpful and unsubstantiated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew","review":"I would not recomended this book to anyone who is thinking of adoption. I think the women who wrote the book has a lot of issues in her life that she needs to work out. I do believe that a child that is adopted has grief but to say you should tell that child everyday that you are sorry that their birth parents could not take care of them is crazy. I think it would be better for the child if you helped them to feel safe,secured and loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother To Adopt??","review":"As a mother of four adopted children, I found this book to be very disturbing. It came across as one woman's way of venting her anger and frustration of being adopted. She felt she was deceived and had never forgiven her parents, both adoptive and natural. (She says she was never really told she was adopted, she just found out)I know many adults that were adopted as children and not one of them has ever expressed any feelings of having a \\"primal wound\\".Like I said above, the author seemed very angry. She has her opinion that her \\"adopted status\\" was the cause of all her probems. I tend to disagree, look inside woman! Not all problems are someone else's fault!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"I have to go against the majority of reviews for this book and say that I disliked this book. In ch 1 or 2 they mention \\"intrauterine rejection syndrome\\".... give me a break! I can understand addressing adoption loss, but I feel the book goes too far and gets lost in psycho-babble. I thought that a great deal of the advice was given from the point of view of a person who was bitter over their own closed adoption. Give me some real practical advice, not some mumbo jumbo about an infant being traumatized a day after birth because they don't hear their mother's voice....."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is projecting","review":"Most of the issues that the author describes are the same as for any biological child. For example, The parents are trying to live through the child, and put their own goals onto him/her. (Who doesn't know biological families like this??) The child is a perfectionist and tries to please everyone, becoming unhealthily obsessed with being \\"good.\\" (Again, we all know children like this, whether adopted or not; the high schools are full of them). The author takes her experience (adoption in the 1940s) and assumes that things are the same today. Very few adoptive parents today would lie to their children, pretending that they had given birth to them. This is 2006! This book MIGHT be good for people in middle age who were adopted as infants-- assuming that they are still interested in deconstructing their childhoods."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome book!","review":"Due to abuse I was adopted when I was a kid. No one told my adoptive parents about the issues that adpoptive kids have, so my parents were quite confused about the many mixed feelings I carried inside. This book is an awesome book in that it addresses and validates many feelings that adoptees have. It also gives a lot of insight to the adoptees loved ones who may not even realize what all goes on in the heart of an adoptee. I would recommend this book for therapists as well, a lot of therapists don't seem to get the connection of adoption and low self-esteem, depression and other simmilar issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Guidance and Hope for Parents of Adopted Children","review":"From the first chapter of this book I was stunned at the insight Sherrie gave me into the hearts and minds of our four adopted children. As she described the hurts, the fears and the behaviors related to adoption wounds, it was as though she had been peeking into the life and struggles of our family. Many of the things she described in her book, we have seen played out in the lives of our children. Sherrie has given us sound guidance and hope that we can help our children come to terms with their adoption wounds. Thank you Sherrie for having the courage to speak the truth, both good and bad, about adoption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok information, But not an essential buy","review":"While this book does touch on some items that might be of interest to some, I as an adult adoptee found that some of what was said to be true for all kids,not just adopted ones. I think the book would have been better if Ms. Eldridge would have picked and written about only 10 things and then included helpful advice or information from the remaining items. I believe it also bordered on the edge of being a social platform. I would not recommend this book if it is the only one you are going to read. IF you are trying to get an over all insight and don't mind having to wade through some additional child behavior theory to get it, then this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew","review":"As an adopted person, it was a real relief to get hold of this book and realise that I am not alone. My only dissapointment was not getting hold of it sooner, when I was growing up. Well written with honesty, a slight victim mentality at first, but allows the adopted person to understand that it was not their fault and they have a right to their feelings whatever they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"I am an adoptee and have been reunited with my birthmom for almost 3 years now. I go to meetings called Adoption Healing, and have read sooo many books from the Adoption Healing library. I bought this book, because the title just caught my eye. There are a ton of things that I had always wished I could tell my adoptive parents, but for some reason or another, I just couldn't. Sherrie's book was wonderful! It was written in plain english. I felt as if I were sitting there listening to a good friend talk to me, and it was all so true. After reading this, I gave it to the Adoption Healing Library. It has helped, not only adoptees, but adoptive parents also. A few of them from my meeting had read this, and they said it gave them a new perspective on their adopted children and why they wanted to search for their birthparents. I definately suggest reading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for adoptive parents","review":"This is the best adoption book I've ever read. It enables adoptive parents to understand their adoptive child(ren)'s losses at a much deeper level. I wish somebody had told me about this book years ago - it would have significantly altered my parenting strategies with my two adopted children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT make this your first or only adoption read","review":"Frankly, after reading this book I nearly pulled the plug on our adoption process. It certainly gave me food for thought, but her notions of the Primal Wound left me reeling, and she put such a negative spin on adoption that I wondered why on earth anyone would want to do it. Fortunately our adoption agency offers some terrific pre-adoption workshops and I have regained a much more optomistic outlook about the whole process. I wish the author had acknowledged in a meaningful way that adoption is treated much differently today than it was when she was a child. We'd all be foolish not to think that our children will not have some emotional and/or developmental issues related to their adoption, but I felt this book took an extreme and damaging approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, and Discouraging","review":"My husband and I are in the middle of the adoption process, and this book was so dark and depressing that I could not get through it. It makes adoption out to be a terrifying, wounding experience that the adoptee will never get over. In addition, it made me as a prospective adoptive mother feel horrible and guilty for wanting to adopt a baby. Books like this will keep people from adopting and will prevent birth mothers from forming adoption plans.In fairness, it does highlight some important issues surrounding adoption, but it does so in such a dark way that it left me feeling helpless and unsure of what I am doing. I cannot recommend this book to anyone who is considering adoption. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT seem to apply to teen adoptions","review":"As the father of 3 open adoption teens and a 4th adoption about to be finalized, I find this book could possibly be discouraging to new adoptive families. Perhaps some of the issues the author deals with apply more to younger children, but none of my sons after reading through this book with me have much good to say about it. The part about birthdays in particular do not seem to ring true with the older children and it appears that the author still has serious issues of her own at the adult stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodramatic with potential to be damaging","review":"This is the first adoption book I've read as we begin to discuss adopting a child, and it was awful. I kept thinking that the kinds of things she recommends saying to a child could really start giving the child a victim complex! So many behaviors she describes are normal childish misbehavior that are easily corrected without convincing the child that he's got an incurable wound (special needs) from being adopted.I asked my husband to read it so I could see if maybe I was wrong about it. He was adopted from an orphanage in Vietnam at 18 months of age, so I thought he'd have a different perspective. \\"Melodramatic,\\" he said. He said that he felt very few of the things the book described, and only occasionally. He stopped reading it in the middle, because he said it felt like she was trying to convince him that he HAD to feel those things, and it was starting to make him feel really down.I'd avoid this toxic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twenty Things Adopted KIds Wish...","review":"This book was terrific! We are getting ready to adopt a sibling group from the foster care system & it gave us a lot to think about from someone who really knows what they're talking about! I ready it through and am now reading it to my husband as we take trips in the car. Very insightful & full of information we feel will help us understand the hearts & minds of our children! If you are considering older child adoption, I would greatly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke.","review":"There isn't enough scientific evidence in the universe to substantiate the claim that babies in the womb feel their mother's emotions and gain their identity from it, like this author claims. Nor can I see evidence that newborn babies grieve for their mother. I CANNOT swallow this premise the entire book relies on. As a mother of adopted and non-adopted children, I can tell you that my newborn bio children didn't know me any more than my newborn adopted child did. It seems so convenient that adoption gives this author the source of her problems. If she weren't adopted, I wonder what she would attribute her problems to, because she would no doubt have them no matter who raised her.I'm so upset that this garbage is a required read from our adoption agency. There are so many more helpful books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be \\"The Over-Therapization of America\\".","review":"As an adoptive parent, I read this book hoping for insight into parenting my adopted son. I've since consulted with well adjusted adopted grown-ups who laugh at the suggestion of \\"uncovering one's grief\\". To quote my adopted friend, \\"It sounds like the author has taken one to many therapy sessions.\\" The authors \\"problems\\" are the natural path that even biological children sometimes take, regardless of how well they are brought up. Sherrie, you need to understand that your parents (not the people that donated the biological material to make you) loved you as thier own, period. God gave you a free will and a soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practice Advice Lost in the Psycho-Babble","review":"This book grabbed my attention immediately because of the \\"twenty things\\" I needed to know as a future adoptive parent. As I dived into the content of the book, however, I found my head spinning at some of the (dare I say) stretched claims made concerning the mental state of adopted children. Some of the stories used to illustrated the experiences of adopted children could very well have been told about children who are not adopted. I DID appreciate the good ideas given for talking openly to my child about adoption! There was just a little too much gloom and doom for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first book I have ever thrown away!","review":"what an awful book. I read this because it was recommended by our social worker. I am the adoptive mother of a 5 year old. If I had read this when we first started to think about adoption it would have scared me to death. This book is mainly the authors opinion and sad story. There are millions of happy well adjusted adoptees in the world. THIS BOOK IS SCARY AND UNTRUE. If I could give it 0 stars I would. There are many wonderful books about the adoption experience. Do NOT READ THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"This is the most negative, depressing collection of unscientific and undocumented drivel I have ever read. I would recommend that you DO NOT read this book if you are considering adoption. If you give any credence to the author, you will come away feeling that no one should ever adopt a child, lest the child be tormented by \\"toxic shame\\" and worse from day one ever after. Yes, many adoptees have unique feelings and circumstances that they need to have validated and that need to be addressed, but this book should not be used as a guidebook or source of information in that regard. If you still want to read this, check it out of a library, don't spend your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"I am so glad to hear the other reviews of this books and that they mirror exactly how I feel about it. I read this book only as a requirement from our adoption agency but wished that I hadn't. It is extremely negative and, although it's an interesting point of view from someone who was adopted far before I was even born and when it was considered very taboo, I found this book to be of little value for adopting in the 21st century.It also has zero barring on the international adoption field and although it has some great chapter titles, the book could just list those and be of more use. Just a list of statements with a cover....allow me to research them on my own. I would suggest The Whole Life Adoption Book instead. Also required reading from our agency but really upbeat and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION!!!","review":"This was a book I looked forward to with high expectation...what a huge let down. Sherri's approach in her book makes a blanket assumption that all adoptees are broken & will never find true joy or completeness-simply because they are adopted. This book was promoted as a Christian book & contained no scriptures to back up the basis for her thinking. Between the pop psychology world view (for example- rebirthing was spoken about)& the obviously wounded overflow of her heart, I found it most difficult to glean from this book any really valuable advice. Skip this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative Book","review":"I thought the book was informative, however, I think it portrayed that the adopted child will always have this huge emotional hole that may or may not be the case. I have discussed this with many adopted adults and some of these adopted people don't agree with the premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book for adult adoptees who want to feel like victims","review":"This is not a book for adoptive parents but rather for adult adoptees who want to be told that all their problems in life stem from adoption. It is definitely not a good parenting book. The only adoptive parents who would enjoy this book are masochists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Foster Parents Also!","review":"We are almost certified as a foster family in AZ. We went through PS-MAPP training and I would say this book was that valuable. If you weren't adopted, it's hard to put yourself in their shoes. This book gives you some perspectives that would help."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stopped reading","review":"I couldn't finish this book. It was too bleak and one-sided. I am in the process of adopting a baby internationally, and honestly, had I read this book earlier, it may have scared me off. It's the account of ONE adoptee's experience, yet she attempts to speak for ALL adoptees. I was given her new book, 20 Things Adoptive Parents Need to Succeed, as a gift. Though a bit more positive, she still seems to be speaking for ALL adoptees. I would be cautious before choosing to read any books by this author... or just don't choose to read them at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychobabble","review":"I am sure there is some merit to the author's claim that adoptees feel some kind of loss at times in their life, but this book makes such a blanket statement about how damaged adoptees turn out, that it's impossible to take seriously.

He was so disappointed when it wouldn't change from flat to a ball.His older brother (20 years old) and older sister (16 years old) helped him. They read the instructions. It wouldn't work. It would only change to a ball if it hit the ground. The package says \\"Throw a disc ... catch a ball!\\" It also says \\"Pops into a ball at random!\\" The \\"at random\\" part is the thing you have to worry about. It also says \\"Time-Delay performance may be affected in wet, sandy, or dusty conditions.\\" We weren't in those conditions. It isn't reliable.

Text sometimes gets dull and too dry, like in many of reference books. In fact, the \\"referential\\" quality of \\"Site Planning\\" is the only positive feature of the book. When authors pursue the singular goal to create a comprehensive textbook, the liveness of arguments suffers a lot.

Cheap enough, and does pretty good job removing gunk from floors and other surfaces. But it's built cheaply, has very short cord, and after 1 day of cleaning kitchen floor and countertops, the connection to the steam nozzle broke. What a hassle to return it to Beach Camera -- if you buy this, house the packaging in a museum in case yours runs out of steam, too. Some sellers look for any reason not to take back a return, and they require packaging in pristine condition. My steamer is in the garbage, and I haven't even paid for it yet. Good idea, cheap execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"My tile floors are not smooth tiles. This steamer does not clean the tile indentations or the grout. It also leaves alot of water behind. I drag a beach towel along with my feet as I use it to dry up the water. It only comes with one cloth head which is not sufficient to clean my entire tile area and it is difficult to try to attach other clothes to the unit - I tried using different methods of attachment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed...","review":"I found this mop heavy and cumbersome. The cord is very short. It comes with only one mop head cover which gets dirty in an instant. When used as a hand held in the bathroom, it seemed quite ineffective. I do not reccommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work when received","review":"It may be a great product, but it did not heat up enough to generate any steam from the time we took it out of the box. Just received a prepaid ups label to ship it back to the manufacturer. Let's say we aren't thrilled with it so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I was really happy with this steam mop as it has attachments to clean other things besides the floors. It sprayed a lot of water, but I just assumed it was my problem and I would figure it out eventually. I tried to steam a shirt and it was soaked by the time I finished, AND the attachment flew off a couple of times, spraying steam and hot water everywhere. Luckily my curious two year son was behind me both times. The plastic piece on the handle that holds the cord broke the first time I tried to wrap it, but I figured I could live with that. HOWEVER! That was the first couple of days. The second time I tried to mop the floor, THE HANDLE SNAPPED IN TWO! I was not pushing it very hard at all! All in all, it is an amazing concept and worked fairly well, but like a lot of other products on the market these days, it was very cheaply made and broke easily. I am ordering the HAAN steam mop now and I really hope it is a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This seemed to work reasonably well the first few times for the bathroom shower, sink, fixtures, etc. It was not very useful for floors. It leaves the floor soaking wet and after a few swipes, the cloth covering is completely dirty and sopping. It is then too hot to rinse or wring out. It didn't make much sense to me. Then after about maybe eight uses (I can't remember exactly) it started leaking. It's sitting in my closet and hasn't been used since. It was too late to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works once, but that's it.","review":"Used it once and it worked fine.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first time I used it - but turned me on to steam cleaning!","review":"The handle on the main steam unit cracked in two the first time I used it to steam clean my kitchen floor. This occurred when I applied a little downward pressure on the unit while cleaning. I did not apply excessive pressure, which indicates that either the unit I received was defective, or the design of this steamer is flawed. The break made the unit useless. I returned the unit promptly to Amazon (they paid the postage since the unit was clearly defective) and I received a full credit within one month.I give this unit two stars, instead of one, because it did convince me in the very short time that I used it that steam cleaning is the way to go. Since then I have purchased a much more expensive dry vapor cleaner which I am pleased with so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"My introduction to Liane Foly was her \\"Au Fur et a Mesure: Best of Liane Foly,\\" still a favorite. Since then, I've gotten hold of seven or eight of her albums, but this recent acquisition is unique in her catalog. Essentially, it's the same as her \\"Les Petites Notes,\\" but here the songs are sung mainly in English. For anglophones, this might be a good place to begin listening to Liane Foly's music, which is a beautiful mix of French chanson and jazz vocals. Regardless of whether one can understand the lyrics, it's her voice that communicates. Also highly recommended, \\"Entre Nous.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pardon My Doo-Wah/Hefty","review":"Anyone who likes the music of the 30's/50's will enjoy this CD.The Hefty Singers add something that makes Hefti's music more appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is awesome","review":"love it ! one of lifetime best movie.The its a movie about a women in a interracial relationship with a controlling man.They had a kid and when they separate they share custody of they son.Things take a turn when the father take his son to a foreign country without the mother know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taken from me for real","review":"How can I review an item I never received when you figure that out for me I will be happy.

The only problem I am having is the network card connecting to my other PC, but that is no big deal. I can live without the network.

For that, I say spend your money else where, your better off without Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"SONY-Not at home","review":"I purchased the RX550 from a retailer other than Amazon three weeks ago. It has never worked. The monitor has flickered and the tower has a funny smell.At first I thought it was something that could be easily corrected. After going back and forth with Technical Support on at least three separate occasions, I learned that there is no authorized dealer in North Jersey who can come to my home, even if I were willing to pay. My only options are to convince the retailer to take it back or send it for repair. The tower would go to one place (paid for by SONY), but I would have to return the monitor at my own expense.If it works, it may be a great machine, but if it doesn't you are stuck.

Went back to the store with it and the service personel agreed it was out of focus. Then checked 3 other SONY monitors and all had the same problem (went to other stores and haven't seen an acceptable one yet)!! Text which is razor sharp at the left and right 3 inches of the screen becomes grayer and fuzzier in the center. I expected better from the Sony Trinitron name. I will now have to pack everything up and return the whole package.........very disappointing.Unit has style and looks, just don't look closely at the monitor or set it to 800 X 600, a rather low resolution for this size screen.Back to the ATARI.............."},{"rating":"1","title":"Available for free at NPR All Songs Considered","review":"You can download the entire 2 hour concert from the All Songs Considered web site for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really strange","review":"Very offbeat.

Filmed on location at the Alamo then relocated in Italy due to angry protesters interference in production, this movie stars Peter Ustinov as a Mexican General trying to re-capture the Alamo. Although Ustinov is great as the bumbling General, the only actor that could breath life into this movie was Jonathan Winters. Although Winters is at his best improvising comedy routines, he still manages to create some fairly funny scenes in this film. This film is a must-have for Ustinov and Winters fans.

Neither my husband or I have ever had a problem with it. I love the amount of time we have on the machine and we can instruct someone to use another box on the machine so we know right away if they have called.

I've been wanting to send it back and get another type as an exchange, but I figured that since I used it twice, I couldn't.

There is a lot of information and it sometimes bogs down a bit, but is WELL worth the read. This is one of the finest renditions of the \\"Arthur/Merlyn\\" tale. It's very different and not all fans of the Authurian Legends will appreciate the story.

For all others, take a deep breath and dig in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel makes history live","review":"I have read widely about the first five centuries of British history and I am constantly amazed at the lucid way in which Jack Whyte tells his story and weaves in the known fabric of history. His story telling skills are superbly demonstrated through his wide knowledge of the english language. This series is a delight to read and I simply could not put them down. I will read them again and again. His skill at weaving these stories is such that they are not enhanced by the occasional scenes of depravity described in the early books. This aside they are a wonderful read well worth the time if you are interested in early British history, people, philosophy, religion and action. All are well reasoned except for the puzzling ultimate acceptance of the domination of the early Roman church in Britain's religious affairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurry up Jack!","review":"The only problem I have with the Camulod series is the time wasted in waiting for Mr. Whyte to complete his next book.\\"Fort\\" is another one in the series from Jack Whyte that deserves a slow read.

My only comment is that they should both have been part five. There was a fair bit of unnecessary material in both books, that if edited out, would have made an outstanding single book.Besides this, volume 5 continues like the others to be a very engrossing read. The story of post-Roman Britons remaking their society in a land being overun by invaders is facinating. I highly suggest reading it along with all others in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming into the world of Historical Fiction with class!","review":"Thank the heavens for Jack Whyte.

Public? From context, he means DEVASTATE (p. 414 paperback). Decimation was a punishment used within the Roman army: if a unit had misbehaved badly enough, one in ten (10%) of the members of that unit were killed, I believe by stoning, and the killings were performed by their fellow soldiers in that unit. Certainly a severe punishment from an emotional standpoint but not catastrophic to the military function of the unit. Devastation, of course, means a severe level of destruction, certainly more than 10%.

Sally Beauman wrote as near to Dahne Du Maurier as is possible and I found myself turning over the pages in breathless anticipation. The end was different than I expected but as Daphne Du Maurier had left us in suspense as to what happened to Maxim and Mrs De Winter then Sally Beauman also left the door open to write another book. A thorougly enjoyable read and one I will treasure along with my other Du Maurier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review -Rebecca's Tale","review":"I could not get past the second chapter. I found this book boring and over-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I didn't read this book -- I listened to it on tape. I don't think I would have been able to get through it otherwise. Du Maurier's Rebecca is a classic -- it's not some kind of political tract tied to a decade the way this very poor sequel is. This book abounds with New Agism, rabid feminism, and politically correct homosexuality. It's very much a book of 2001, not 1951. Like other readers, I may just re-read the original just to get the nasty taste of Rebecca's Tale away from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"hello?","review":"seriously, has a sequel written by another auther EVER come even close to the original? no. and this is not the only sequel to the amazing novel Rebecca. deconstructing du maurier's deliberate vagueness about rebecca, maxim and his second wife is a doomed and misguided venture from the start. the POINT of the novel was that you don't know. and all attempts to clarify any of this by any other author just have such a feeling of being false even from the start. it isn't what REALLY happened (if anything in a work of fiction can be real), it is someone else's imagination. anyone could say what they thought the truth was, but that would make them no closer to du maurier's true intentions. so-called authors of these types of books need to stop capitalizing on other great works of literature and develop their own ideas. if they can't think of something new, they shouldn't be writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mixed Bag","review":"I had looked forward to this book with great anticipation and couldn't wait to start reading. My expectations were met beautifully until the last forty pages. I really disliked the way the author turned Rebecca into the heroine and the second Mrs. deWinter into a sad woman to be pitied when, in the original \\"Rebecca,\\" it was the other way around. In short, loved the book, hated the ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time, money & shelfspace. Stick to the original.","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. The character of Colonel Julyan seems to have been based on Louella Parsons or Hedda Hopper, and Rebecca has had a heaping dose of Shirley MacLaine. The author has attempted to give the book more of a duMaurier feel by using surnames from duMaurier's other books for her characters. Descriptions of people and places are lifted almost word-for-word from the original. The book oozes with some of the worst of current politically correct and new age ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pale Rebecca","review":"The original _Rebecca_ was fantastic - well-written and beautiful. The followup was, in comparison, dry and almost redundant. Although the characters telling the story changed (often a helpful novelist technique), the voice never did. All of the characters therefore adopted a motonotonous tone in telling their stories.The true power of _Rebecca_ lay in the mystery of a woman never met. Placing her in the full light of day in _Rebecca's Tale_, unfortunately, pales her power and mystery. Having enjoyed _Rebecca_ as much as I did, I found the sequel too flat to relish. Maybe the sequel would be better as a stand-alone rather than a followup story, as others have mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Rebecca, always Rebecca'","review":"Beauman's sequel is a fine addition to the de Winter story. She captures Rebecca with all the grace, beauty, evil, and deceit that DuMaurier wrote about years ago. It was neat to see the story from other people's point of view, especially Terrence Gray, Rebecca's half-brother. Anyone who is a fan of DuMaurier's novel and Hill's sequel will enjoy this continuation of the story. It brings closure to some things and opens doors to others. It leaves the story open for another sequel, should so be desired, yet is a conclusion if no one does. As a 'Rebecca' fan, I am glad to have this as part of my collection. A must for book lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes Away the Intrigue of the Original Book","review":"This story basically kills what made the original novel so great.Col. Julyan, an extremely minor character in the original book, secretly madly in love with Rebecca 20 years later?His daughter (who would have been 10 when she died), thinking about nothing except Rebecca?Mrs. Danvers, still obsessed with Rebecca?All these people obsessed about a dead woman???Without the original book, the story would never have stood on its own. It took me a while to even get into it, and the only reason I read it was because the original was so good.If you truly loved the original book, don't read this book because it will totally destroy that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Feeling Cheated","review":"The story itself was very captivating but the ending was horrible. It seems as though the author either couldn't find a satisfactory ending or became tired of the whole thing! This book left us with too many new questions and even fewer answers. I sincerely wish that I had stopped at \\"Rebecca\\" for my own piece of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"spare yourself","review":"Don't sully your memory of Du Maurier's 'Rebecca' with this book. The author attempts to continue the intriguing story of Rebecca from the viewpoint of an aging neighbor and family friend who was also professionally involved in the case surrounding her death. However, the unsophisticated writing and plodding plot should not even be compared with the original.There is so much unnecessary dialogue and irritating narrative (including excessive and pointless references to the main character's dog, Barker) that the plot stagnates. I started skipping paragraphs to get to the point. It's difficult to care about any of the dull characters who Beauman seemingly forgot to give differing personalities to.Don't bother with Beauman. Pick up Du Maurier's 'Jamaica Inn' or 'My Cousin Rachel' for far more wonderful and mysterious stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"No classic Rebecca this","review":"I found this book to be too long, tortuous and frustrating. Too many plot lines winding all over the place and never fully resolved. The threads of homosexuality and feminism seemed contrived and unnecessary. Beauman is no du Maurier.

May the original, masterful \\"Rebecca\\" rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rebecca's still a mystery","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I only read it because I love Daphne DuMaurier's writing and had re-read Rebecca last year. Questions about Rebecca's death/murder/suicide aren't answered. I don't understand why this book was written. What was the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I would have read the other reviews first...","review":"I would have never read this book had I read the other reviews first. I loved Rebecca. And so I hated this. So much so that I need to re-read Rebecca again to try and purge my memory of this newest Tale. As readers before have mentioned, because it raises more questions than provides answers, because of some of the \\"over-the-top\\" explanations of the past - as well as unacceptable present circumstances, this book was totaling unfulfilling.

This one was just not all that good. I found the \\"mystery\\" way to easy to figure out. Almost right away Nancy found out who the bad-guy was. There was just too much time wasted in the book, seriously the characters didn't do as much as they usually do. She had evidence against people, but she didn't do anything with it, it almost seems like she forgot it. I was thinking the \\"Haunted Showboat\\" would be scary like everyone said, but it wasn't at all.

Personally, I didn't find this book to be very good; although, it is not really bad. There isn't much action in the book and the mystery isn't overly exciting. In fact, by the time you get through the silly shenanigans concerning the girls being chased on their way to New Orleans by a man who stole Nancy's old car and the obligatory tour guide through New Orleans and actually get into the mystery, the book is already 1/3 over.

It is well written and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"This is a most engaging portrait of a model justice in the common law tradition. Justice O'Connor is a true American icon of humble and hardworking origins rising to the heights of leadership based on character, critical thinking and an ethic of service. Her good will and civility toward those with whom she disagreed is an example to follow. The narrative is well informed, nuanced and flows steadily in a current that merges national, judicial and personal events in the judge's life most artfully. A wonderful book about a wonderful lady and an excellent Supreme Court justice. It is the likes of Sandra Day O'Connor that make one proud to be an American.

He writes about his days from a naive rookie to his time on the Tactical Patrol Force and Narcotics enforcement, till he testifies before the Knapp Commission. He offers valuable insight to the culture of graft that permeated not only much of the N.Y. Police Department but the also much of the legal and political system at the time. Interesting as well are his observations on the young Rudy Giuliani."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Eh","review":"I was so excited to see that they had a Coconut one and couldn't wait to try it.

Besides I don't know if these bars work because they are so rich, they're too granolaly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Shipper!","review":"I ordered 3 boxes from this company (DAB Nutrition).

I have avoided caffeine over the past several years because it was just too strong for me. However, this Clif bar really works for me without giving me the jitters. Nice to have something that can wake me up for the day without making me feel wired and later causing me to crash. I usually eat one of these around midday when I'm being physically active, it truly does give you an extra little boost to help you meet your goals in an energetic but not frenzied way. I have no trouble going to sleep at a reasonable time and sleeping all night. I think it has 50mg of caffeine per bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy","review":"Favorite flavor.

I would not recommend these even though, strange enough, I DO LOVE cookie DOUGH even better than when the cookies are baked....theres just something different about it...like...for instance me, I'm trying to lose weight I was thinking of using these as breakfast bars 2 times a week, but it just feels like....ok I'm eating healthy....'and then'.....i pop this in my mouth and its mega sweet and just tastes like batter, lol. Everyone likes them....I mean they're not bad or disgusting.............I am able to finish off one bar....I was just hoping it would be more like a 'bread' - granola bar....instead of a clump of batter. Thats really the only way I can explain it. I would say go with the VARIETY PACK...............this way you can try a few of each, and then stock up on your favorite =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"best energy bar","review":"It's not as good as a candy bar but it's not supposed to be.

As an Internet consultant I'm intrigued by the possibilities of this digital age. The inevitable merging of telephony, internet, and televison require an understanding of each. Joel's book was a thoroughly enjoyable history of digital and HD TV. Sometimes reading like a soap-opera, this book brings the reader inside the decision making process of the TV industry and the FCC. It took me a day, maybe two, to read and I immediately started thinking about reading it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspensful, humorous ... a great non-fiction read!","review":"The story of the evolution of high-definition television surrounds us. Yet even now, at the dawn of its actual debut, few people really know much about it. Joel Brinkley's book is a teriffic way to learn about this undeniably fascinating story of the evolution of HDTV. He weaves tension, humor and science into an interesting tale of international and domestic political intrigue, all the while never losing sight of his mission. His ability to explain the political side of the scientific challenge, and how it comes together, is clever, no doubt about it. Mr.Brinkley's account offers readers a grand illustration of American know-how, creativity, politics and invention. I do plan to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well-written and interesting book","review":"This is a facinating and well-written review of the development and introduction of HDTV. It focuses on the political interaction of government agencies, the broadcasters, and R&D efforts, more so than the technology. It is ironic that although the U.S. led the Japanese in the research and development of digital TV, by that time there was no domestic TV manufacturing capability to take advantage of this.(Note: I read the original hard cover edition and not the soft-cover 2009 update.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing page turner","review":"This book is a must read! It is extremely well written. It's just takes a hold of you and you can't put it down. The characters are so relatable. The author has a art of descibing the scene, it's just so visual. As a Virginian, you have done us proud! Keep up the excellent work but maybe mention Lexington in your next work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite cd","review":"I own nearly 800 cds, but this one stands out as my favorite. It's so haunting and beautiful. But, I highly recommend spending the extra cash to get the UK import version. It's well worth the money. You get an extended version of the title track that blows the one on the US version away. Big time. Plus a lot more cool stuff including a dance remix of Wide Open Space. This album will not disappoint you.Think Dark Side of the Moon for the '90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Six is absolutely amazing. It is just as good, if not better, than Mansun's second album. The thing which strike me the most when I listen to this, is the amazing sense of unity between each of the songs. It's so well constructed I was completely flabbergasted the first time I listened to it. This unity is such a feat for such a long album (78 minutes or so).My favourite tracks are Six, Fall Out, Television and Cancer. Cancer is the best. Nine and a half minutes of brilliance. Just when Paul Draper sings: \\"What now of my faith... just a desperate exercise to limit pain...\\" It is sooooo good."},{"rating":"1","title":"hoses broke","review":"I do not recommend this grade hose the first time I used it, it split open and now sits in my garage useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud","review":"Got it today, opened the case and the needle was showing 250 psi. That is hooked up to nothing and never having been hooked up to anything. Tried using it on my jet ski to see if maybe some pressure would get the gauge to zero, or if the needle was just stuck. It moved from 250 to 255. Great, so my jetski holds 250 psi standing still and blows 255 running. hmmmm...? Now I have to wait another two weeks for another gauge to come.

Lots of violence and no real plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Film, Poor Release","review":"Tropa de Elite 2 is an excellent film, you should most definitely watch it. This release, however, has a serious flaw. On both the DVD and Blu-ray, the English subtitles are hardsubbed. What this means is that you will not be able to turn off the subtitles. Subtitles are useful and rather common on DVDs and Blu-rays, but it's also rather standardized the expectation to be able to disable them. There's really not a good excuse for hardsubs having been used in this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Garbage","review":"The quality of this tool is so poor, the little metal clips inside that hold the bit, stuck on me after 2 uses. If you want something to use with your zip gun like me, look somewhere else. It lasted 10 minutes in all before I had to beat my bit out with a chisel to free it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but disappointing","review":"I bought this phone intending to use it as a back-up phone/pocketable phone to my PDA phone. Unfortunately, it has a very primitive (as opposed to basic) user interface that is not easy to navigate. The phone also turns out to be much thicker than I had hoped - its no RAZR. The cover does have the speaker, but is otherwise a cheap-feeling plastic shell that adds to the already thick body. There is a colorful display of flashing lights and tones when the phone powers up and shuts down, but otherwise, it's nothing notable. The battery/back cover is a bit of a pain to remove - it requires two hands - one to press the release button, the other to slide the cover off.I haven't had a Motorola phone for ages, but this seems like a skin job on some old platform. The software seems as old as the StarTac phones of yesteryear. Get with it Moto! - your software is the most primitive in the industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy something else...","review":"My last phone was run over by a passing RV and I was in desperate need of a new one. I stopped by the local Cingular Store and pick this one up. For me it was the look and feel that sold me. Well if all i was doing was looking and feeling this phone would be great, but it sucks at anything else. I can barely hear anyone when I driving. The menu is a big pain in the ass. Cingular didn't even have anything on this phone, so when I bought it I had to manually enter codes in order to get text messaging and other functions working...lets put it this way, here I am on Amazon looking to buy a new phone because this one is useless(and I paid $200 for it at a Cingular Store).DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE YOU WILL REGRET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad buy!","review":"I bought this phone and returned it within one week!!

It has awesome ringtones and I love that it lights up beautiful colors. You can also set this phone to light up to the beat of music, which only does it for 10 straight minutes, but it's still really neat. It's light and sleek, and everyone compliments me on how awesome it is. The only bad thing I can say about this phone is that it sometimes won't ring, like 2-3 times a month, so not a lot, but turning it off and on again fixes that problem. Also, I am not recieving text messages right away. It usually takes a whole day to get the text message but that could have something to do with my phone service.

I bought this because I liked 'Twas the Fright Before Christmas, and I liked the unique yet cute artwork of all the monsters in it and the details in the background. But this book, The House that Drac Built-- it's hard to believe it's the same artist! I have tons of picture books, and this has the ugliest artwork of them all. The manicore is gross-- a weird face and sausage-link tail. I didn't find the artwork creepy or scary in the way I'd love to see in a Halloween book for a change, but this art was just completely unappealing. I love Halloween picture books, but I highly recommend In the Haunted House and The Bones of Fred McFee, both by Eve Bunting, Room on the Broom by Julia Donaldson, The Old Lady who Was Not Afraid of Anything by Linda Williams, or for an edgier book, Cinderella Skeleton Robert D. San Souci all over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"failed to mention the DEMON / DEVIL in the book","review":"The book is absolutely not appropriate for the age given. The gruesome (editorial words above) characters build up from midly fearsome to a demon/devil feeding a bloody old/undead lady. The demon's name is the \\"Fiend of Bloodygore\\". No child should be exposed to this greusome artwork. The author attempts to make it a \\"Children's book\\" by entering children into the story at the end. SICK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read","review":"My 3 year old nephew adores this book. He is really into monsters and vampires and the like. Within just a few times of reading it, he now has memorized it and has a wonderful time with the words and expressions.

It is a book I myself want to keep around for other kids as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"The only good thing about this book was the title. A tedious creeping fantasy. A pity the Myth part didn't refer to an Asprin comedy. The fantasy wasn't too interesting, and it didn't go far enough in the Lovecraftian direction for anything else. Too roundabout for me, I think, even though it certainly sounded like something I would enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one!","review":"Even if you're not a fantasy addict, this book is a masterpiece! It's compeling, surprising, frightening at times and thought provoking. But most important: It's well told. It's a story about stroytelling by a master stroyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Special","review":"It is wrong to compare this book to other fantasy novels. It is really one of a kind.The voice is pitch perfect and believeable; rather like listening to a brit from the WWII generation speaking to you--I've met a few. This makes what is related and the character's reactions to them shocking.The star of the \\"show\\" is Rhyhope Wood; the last piece of prehistoric forest left in Great Britain, and perhaps a doorway to other times, realities and certainly tragedy and madness.Where does the philosophy come from that most things are bigger inside than they seem? Is it a metaphor of the mind, of truth? I'm not sure but it plays its' role in this book.This is no happy little adventure with magic swords, or a visit to Merlin etc. It's an exploration of history and myth, reality and obsession. There is not another book like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folk Lore Rich","review":"I read this book the first time many years ago.And I bought an old paper back copy from this site. I enjoyed it just as much the second time round.What I enjoyed the most was the charactors and simply the ideas in the story line.While obviously some feel it lacked something, It made me 'see' the woods, the charactors, and feel the story.If it lacks, it makes up in originality in how all the various legends in folklore are woven together in a more modern setting.I say well done to Holdstock.Thank you for a treasure of a book.Thanks for giving me real enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Testament book","review":"I will be honest, we have not used this book in class, but what I have read from it on my own is good and informative and, I feel, has sound theology."},{"rating":"1","title":"puzzle2012","review":"pages were not good folds and pen and pencils marking.

But with anything that's gone on for so long, you have to wonder what was left out. I'll dock it a star for some rather strange compilation that gets strips out of order and leaves out huge chunks of strips in ongoing story lines. Additionally, Schulz's comments don't really illuminate the work behind the strip as much as one would hope. There also is no mention of the massive marketing of Peanuts products, and a section regarding letters Schulz has received is intriguing, but only covers a few pages.Suggestion...... A true history of Peanuts trivia, with comment on strips, favorite products, production notes for shows and movies, and other information that a lot of us would love to read.Still, buy it, or better yet, wait for the paperback, which will probably have the last strips in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peanuts a Golden Celebration","review":"I have not received this book to date..

On this album, the most impressive is the title-track, Closer. It is beautiful...absolutely beautiful. So is Briefly. Misunderstood and Extra-Ordinary stick true to what made it for them.

Their style is so distinct and has really crystallized on this album. BTE has combined the best of all the former albums onto this one, with great ballads, laid-back driving music, and standard rock-pop songs. I also think that the band has done a great job going back to the styles that we saw more on \\"How does your garden grow?\\" and \\"Deluxe.\\" I have to say the addition of the DJ only enhances the songs. Kevin's guitar on this album is adventurous and yet soothing. This is one CD that is going to stay in my 5 disc player for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Closer' is BTE's best album yet","review":"Being a fan of Better Than Ezra since 1995, I've followed them fervently and enjoyed each album they've made. With each record, the band has musically matured and progressed, while maintaining a solid musical identity.'Closer' is a culmination of where they've been, what they've seen and where they are musically. From the opening tune, \\"Misunderstood,\\" this is pure BTE, with Kevin's lyrics wrapping around the melody perfectly. The band never lets up, ranging from the throbbing groove of \\"Recognize\\" to the stripped-down honesty of \\"Closer\\" and \\"I Do.\\"The band is musically tight and lyrically intimate throughout 'Closer.' It's easy to identify with and is an amazing album - you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its More than \\"Good\\"","review":"This album ranks right up there with \\"Friction, Baby.\\" I really hope it catches on in the rest of the country.

Love the album!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Right About One Thing","review":"I just listened to the album for the first time. After their last attempt to follow the mainstream, I was hoping that they would not try and follow the latest trends and just play. But once again I was let down. Dance music is all the rave with the kids so what does BTE do, they include a DJ on their very cheesey popr record. I once thought that they were a good band. Now I realize they are just a band trying to stay on the radio. And most of the time, the radio is no place for a good band to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I loved this CD. I was just browsing in a music store and happened to notice it had just been released. Since I loved Deluxe so much, I figured this one was a pretty sure thing, and I wasn't disappointed. Better Than Ezra is just one of those bands that speaks to my emotions, and this CD is not exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Closer is not close enough","review":"I hate to give a weak review for a BTE album because they are one of my favorite bands. However, Closer doesn't come close to HDYGG, Friction Baby and Duluxe (it does surpass Artifakt, which thankfully--for the sake of the band and fans--was not released commercially). HDYGG is a hard album to surpass, and I never tire of listening to it. Closer, however, has only one really strong song (\\"Briefly\\"), and maybe two or three catchy, but forgettable tunes. BTE is a great band to see live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album, underrated","review":"This album is very good and underrated. Every song flows nicely. This is their best overall album. This band will probably never have the run they did in the mid 90's but this is still their best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet Another Transofrmation","review":"With every album, Better Than Ezra has grown and reshaped it's sound to either deal with the current trends in music or to mature as artists. With \\"Closer\\", this is no exception. By throwing a DJ into a few tracks BTE has made good use of an otherwise mostly misused trend in modern music. The ballads on the album, like \\"Closer\\", \\"A Lifetime\\" and \\"Get You In\\" are all effectively emotional and more reminiscent of their first major release \\"Deluxe\\". The more rockin' songs on the record \\"Recognize\\" and \\"I Do\\" seem to be a matured upon formula that worked so well on BTE's second record \\"Friction, Baby\\". And the first single \\"Extra Ordinary\\" reminds me a lot of \\"How Does Your Garden Grow?\\". So perhaps this record isn't as much a total transformation as an extremely effective blending of the elements that has worked so well for BTE in the past. In all, \\"Closer\\" is an excellent record and should be heard both by hardcore BTE fans and the more casual listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening to this one.","review":"A great album by a great group. I simply can't stop listening to this one. Unlike a lot of music out today, Better than Ezra spends more than 5 minutes on their lyrics and is truly committed to the craft of their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased fan","review":"I've been listening to bte for years and years. I bought Deluxe on accident and fell in love with their sound. Ever since, I've bought all of their albums. My husband loves them too and we played This Time of Year at our wedding reception. If you hated the heavy, scratchy-voice, grunge movement and now hate the boy-band, midriff, dancemix, pop movement and just want to listen to some good music with great lyrics, this is the album for you. Give it a try and if you like what you hear, get Friction,Baby and How Does Your Garden Grow. You will be very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ditto - Absolutely Refreshing","review":"I stumbled across Closer by accident when I was introduced to the song \\"Extra Ordinary\\". It was catchy and fun. All it took was one listen and I went out and purchased the album. A BTE fan, I knew I would not be disappointed but this album has been in every accessible CD drive since (purchased 3 days ago). I agree with the first three reviews written ( that is as far as I read ). Each individual said what I would have. This album brings a refreshing, light, dynamic sound that seems to have been lost over the years in the new wave of pop art. I have yet to skip a song. The influences are obvious and you won't be disappointed to hear that familiar sound in these BTE songs. I absolutely LOVE this album. To date ( and it seems to change ), Recognize, Get you In, Extra Ordinary and Misunderstood are my favorite tracks. Did I leave any out? Perhaps, the remaining few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great disc!","review":"I picked this up last night and put it in, expecting something that sounded at least a little bit like Garden. Man, was I surprised. I've listened to it about 10 times now and I really dig this record. Misunderstood, Extra Ordinary, Closer, A Lifetime, and Recognize are all stand out tracks. I defintely recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting Ezra","review":"Excellent Ezra album. Revisits classic style of Deluxe with added DJ spins, witty lyrics and excellent remixing. Could have done without the first radio cut, Extra Ordinary. That's a bit of a loser. However \\"Rolling\\" and \\"Lifetime\\" are two of Ezra's greatest. Definite A for Ezra and a must have for any Ezra fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the Study Guide","review":"I have never been dissappointed in anything I have ordered, until this.

But this 'book' is merely the articles related to the subject pulled from the Encyclopedia Britannica, it is a collection of articles and not really a book at all. Very little if any thing in this 'book' is unique, nearly everything in it can be found in the Encyclopedia. The Britannica company has pulled a fast one with software books like this one, they cut a small piece from their Encyclopedia and sell it at an inflated price.

I got to where I had to warn my neighbors if I was going to be using my mixer because it is extremely loud! I'm not happy with the fact that it's made of plastic either.

I had to laugh because that is just the kind of luck I seem to have!I put the unit together and have used it a couple of times since.

Because ABC pulled this on us, I refused to watch that network for years and I seldom watch ABC to this day - so THERE! I don't think I have missed anything either!

Although fun to mess around with, this fun only lasts for the first few minutes.The graphics of the game are also hit or miss, meaning that the characters don't always look like the characters from the movie, and given the power of the PS3 I found this strange.

But after hearing John's version a few times, you begin to realize that the quieter pain expressed in his take of the song is no less valid than Janis's cosmic heartbreak.

I'm a horror hound, unashamedly so, and when I learned that Mr. Brite had gone in a completely different direction I was initially disappointed. So I did what anyone should do when faced with such a prospect - no, not decry this betrayal and denounce the new developments before I gave them a chance, no indeed. I got me a copy of that there new fangled writing and had me a read ... and wasn't I glad that I had retained the sense I was born with because 'Liquor' is a delight. Mr. Brite (if that's not too formal) may have moved away from the subject matter of 'Lost Souls', for example, but he does not leave behind his gift for storytelling. Liquor is a terrific book and the proof, as they say, is in the pudding. Buy it, read it, decide for yourself, but absolutely do not discard it until you've tried it.

And mostly because of the cast. Chris O'Donnell plays the young naive blonde-ringletted D'Artagnan-his acting is rather horrible at times, but entertaining nonetheless. Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, and Oliver Platt are excellent as the three musketeers, their interactions always fun and entertaining. Rebecca De Mornay plays an especially beautiful, inticing Lady DeWinter. But the best of all are Michael Wincott as Rochefort and the incredible Tim Curry as Cardinal Richelieu- a little unfair, having the two actors with the sexiest voices in the same movie. Tim Curry is especially evil, and I found that the more i watched this movie the more i rooted for the bad guys- theyre just much more interesting. \\"All for one...and more for me.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I think The Three Musketeers is a great movie.

Awful! Just awful! The only reason I own this (mis)interpretation of the greatest adventure series in the world is because Michael is in it. And even his character is all wrong! Whoever heard of Rochefort having only one eye? Well, yeah, this is a common American view of it... Oliver Platt is the only other saving grace as Porthos.

It is a no brainer. A way to pass an hour or so without trying to think to much into it.So when the DVD came out I bought it...Big Mistake. I now have the only DVD in a colection of over 400 which doubles as a frisby.The transfer in letterbox fomat is so bad, that some of the sword scenes look more like they are holding weapons from a 70's vido game, pixelated....Don't buy this DVD it [bites]."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Three Musketeers","review":"First of all, the actors are have perfectly played these roles. The King and Queen are a bit young looking, but I suppose that it's the times. The plot flows well, with a past for one particular musketeer, and a future for our wanna-be musketeer hero (who, typically, is the hero), and of course, romance. The villain, though, was perhaps my favorite part of all of it, because he was played so evilly and so well. A slight drawback would be, I think, that things move just a bit too quickly, and some scenes and characters don't have enough time to develop. But it is an enjoyable movie, overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollyweird history rewrite of a Dumas classic","review":"Alexandre Dumas invented the genre of historical fiction by creating plausible characters in an authentic historical period. This Hollywood absurdity of a plot has Cardinal Richelieu scheming to usurp the throne of France. While the action is intended to carry this film the preposterous plot makes a mockery of the genre. The characters are not historically plausible nor is the story the least bit believable for anyone who understands anything of the period. This is unfortunate. The cast (Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Tim Curry) offered great potential for a rousing remake. The screen writers however acted as if they were ditzy teenagers from valley high who believed that history began in 1965. \\"Bill and Ted remake The Musketeers\\" This film was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Round Entertainment","review":"This movie is an excellent adaptation of the classic story, the actors work really well together. Romance,adventure,swordfights,betrayal and great one liners keep you glued to the screen from start to finish. I particularly liked this movie because it is a real action packed adventure with lots of laughs too. A good all round family movie that will leave everyone feeling that for at least the length of the movie they were living in the days of the Musketeers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Three Musketeers","review":"This is a great old favourite. I loved it years ago and I still love it now. The storyline is fun and exciting and the setting is great. Some of the characters seem a little corny a few years on. But on the whole, very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I found this movie very entertaining... Oliver Platt (Porthos) provided some great laughs. Charlie Sheen (Aramis) was one of the nice looking ones. Kiefer Sutherland (Athos) could have acted a bit more bitter... but he did an over good job. Chris O'Donnel (D'Artgnan) no. I don't think he took to this part well at all. I agree with several other reviewers. He turned it into mush. Tim Curry (Car. Richeliu) LOVED HIM! He played that part two ways to the director... funny or scary/serious. The director wanted to go for the funny way, mainly because everyone else in the cast would be as well. I would have loved to have seen him play it serious. Rebecca DeMornay( ?) was quite good as a seductress. The man w/the patch (can't remember name) did fairly well. Wasn't the best performance, but wasn't mush either. I give this film only four stars, mainly because of Chris O'Donnel's performance. No,it didn't stay true to the book, but I liked it anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to have paid to see. I really can't put into words just how horrible it is. It failed on every possible level. The acting was extremely bad, including Tim Curry's pitiful performance. The writing was a travesty. The directing was miserable. Everything about it stank on ice. But I think the thing that I hated most about was the way that they absolutely butchered Dumas' classic story. To call this picture The Three Musketeers is false advertising. The story is NOT the Three Musketeers. Don't waste your time or money on this. Instead, I recommend the fantastic The Three Musketeers/The Four Musketeers with Michael York, Oliver Reed, Charlton Heston, Christopher Lee, and Raquel Welch. Those two movies are 5 star performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was not based on Alexander Dumas's novel","review":"but on somebody else's story who used Dumas's characters from The Three Musketeers.

But for God's sake! This movie is awful! Why would you pass up such a solid plot such as the book had in favor of the boring thread pushed in this wretched adaption. While Curry gives an above-average performance, the rest of the cast is weak. Sheen looks like a chump (as always), and Chris O'Donnell obviously has no idea of How d'Artangan is supposed to act. This movie is not even worth renting...much less buying. Pass it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty","review":"This movie stinks, with bells on. It misses at every level: as a swashbuckler, as historical ficton, and most especially as a retelling of the Dumas story. On critic aptly described it as \\"Young Swords\\", i.e. a bunch of cool young actors dressed in plumed costumes running around aimlessly and waiving their swords with amateurish enthusiasm. If you want to see how it should be done, see The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers from the 1970s."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"this was one of the worst films i have had the misfortune to watch ever!the plot is weak, the actors act like school children and the actual story line has gone far astrey from the real book. all in all it was a complete, boring dissapointment and i suggest that this film should be thrown in the nearest garbage truck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous...should have been called \\"Three Guys With Swords\\"","review":"This movie is possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. Having been a huge fan of both the original novel, and the 1973-4 movie versions by Richard Lester; I was shocked and disgusted thatA: Disney put their name on it, andB: that they actually had the nerve to call it \\"The Three Musketeers.\\"Possibly my favorite/worst moment of the movie was a spot where a bunch of bravos yell \\"It's Porthos the pirate!\\" When I saw this in the theater, I distinctly heard three other people around me (besides myself) exclaim \\"Porthos the PIRATE???\\"It's a ridiculous, puerile, pitiful dilution of both a magnificent story (Dumas' novel) and a cinematic masterpiece (Lester's films.)If you want to see barrels of gunpowder explode, maybe you should get this movie.If, however, you want an inspired, dramatic, funny, action-packed adventure that's beautifully filmed, try hereThe Complete Musketeers (The Three Musketeers / The Four Musketeers)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun in France","review":"Ok...so you like period pieces and comedies. This is the movie for you. The acting is warm; the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and there's plenty of good comedic dialogue. Bloodless violence and subtle sexual innuendo leaves this a family film fit for any over the age of 8. It is fun. It is escapist. It is entertaining. Not \\"great film\\" but a heck of a lot better than a lot in that exalted category.If, on the other hand, you insist on historical accuracy, slavish adherence to Dumas' masterpiece, and grim permeating darkness, you won't care for this film a bit. Real film critics probably don't like the film...but then they almost never like what I do. The acting isn't crisp; the plot is only vaguely believable. The filming is adequate, but not inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO!!!","review":"Definitely a great epic movie and one of my personal favorites, The Three Musketeers, brings to the screen the tale of who else, but Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan. Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, Charlie Sheen, Oliver Platt, Tim Curry, and the gorgeous Rebecca De Mornay whose performances are simply amazing, make this movie one of the best of its kind. (Tim Curry's character, in particular, as Cardinal Richelieu, steals the show!)The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again. The castles, the battles and the costumes are all wonderful! The Three Musketeers is a movie about love, honor, bravery, loyalty, and heroes from a time long gone. It is a great movie indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the movie combo from the '70's by Richard Lester","review":"That this version of \\"The Three Musketeers\\" stinks to high heaven is obvious in about five minutes. The only point of perfection I noticed in this movie is that it seems to be a perfect combination of the worst version of a screenplay, worst acting, worst casting, and worst directing I've seen in a long time. Don't contaminate your mind or waste your precious time by watching this Sheen/Sutherland version of the story, but instead buy the movie combination release with both of Richard Lester musketeer movies included."},{"rating":"1","title":"What WAS That?","review":"I don't even know where to begin--the horrible acting, the terrible costuming, the obviously fake sets, the lack of continuity, or the cliched (and/or just plain stupid) lines? The \\"action and adventure\\" to which some have alluded is no more than a few people shooting each other or clashing swords while saying some really idiotic things; either that, or trying, and failing, to give the impression that they are truly courageous heroes. D'Artagnan looks and acts like a men's clothing model. The Musketeers are brainless wierdos. The king is a temper tantrum-throwing little kid. De Rochefort is obviously modifying his voice to make it more foreboding--but the fact that this is so obvious rather ruins the effect. And he looks like he should be in a gangster movie. Milady is definitely trying too hard. The red-haired doofus...I don't know where he came from. Well, that basically sums it up, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Horrendous","review":"I borrowed this DVD from the school library. After watching it for about 10 minutes, I couldn't stand it any longer. The movie just doens't have a soul, it's just \\"surface candy.\\" There's one chase scene after another, more sword fights than fishes in the sea, absurdly phony dialog, an irritating sound track (the kind you've heard a thousand times before), the sets all look newly constructed, the actor's costumes neatly stiched and pressed, each scene looks like it was rehearsed maybe once. But, considering all the 4/5 Star reviews on this thread, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. Just be sure and park your brain first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"This film is a dog. Ok, Tim Curry was entertaining, but don't waste your time.

It has the musketeers being disbanded; Milady's name is changed; Richelieu attempts to make a treaty with Buckingham and attempts to have the king shot at a birthday celebration; etc. It resembles the book in nothing except that MOST of the character's names remain the same. However, if you want to watch a comedy it is great. There are some very funny moments, although most of the movie is so dumb as to be entertainingly funny. The sets and costumes are great and so are the fighting scenes. However, it is very stupid and should have been made as a comedy. There has never been a good version made of this classic adventure story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Three Musketeers","review":"What an awesome movie. Perhaps the best version of The Three Musketeers ever made. The cast is excellent. It has a variety of things to keep your attention. Comedy, Action, and Suspense like no other.

The voices, including Jerzy Kosiniski who \\"speaks\\" Rumkowski (what better choice?), are conveyed with power and precision. The selections read are as various and well-chosen as could be imagined. The work as a whole is somewhere between a documentary and a stark meditation, treating the unique complexity of the Lodz ghetto's history with both restraint and clarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pollyanna the sequal","review":"Almost as good as the first.

The patterns look great, and are super easy to make. I had never used a rotary cutter before, but now I am in love with it. Whoever invented that little tool deserves an award. I go back to this book almost every time I quilt, which is once or twice a year. It covers cutting, including how to lay out the fabric, as well as great instructions for sewing, and then putting the backing, batting, and quilt together. Best of all, the book includes GREAT binding instructions. Binding gets me almost every time, and I have to go back and look them over again.

It was an instant success, comfortable, not too hot, holds its shape, moves with the knee and doesn't bunch behind the knee. But the club stopped carrying it, so when the one I had eventually became too loose, I started buying other types. No go! I was obsessed with finding the perfect brace that would take my mind off my knee pain, provide some compression to keep daily swelling at bay, and give support during workouts. I now have an entire drawer filled with knee braces. I had no luck finding one I liked as well as the Bike. I even bought one in a ski store in Park City at the Sundance Film Festival--this was not a quest only in my hometown. Finally, because I couldn't find the Bike brand anywhere in the Twin City area, I ordered it online from Amazon--the only place I could find it. I am once again a happy gimp!

No background was ever given to the career histories of the chiefs of staff & civilian secretaries especially Hap Arnold. To some, these histories are boring, but to others they provide a thorough background for how the Air Force organizes, fights, & wins any type of war that may surface.

Happily Ever After, Faded Pictures featuring Joe and Think Of You are pretty good choices for singles. The best songs on the album are usually the slow songs like Caught You, Think Of You, Happily Ever After and Another Minute. He Dont Love You has Case singing over a pounding R&B beat but the song actually works. The Soul Central Version of Faded Pictures is alright but its not better than the original. Tell Me is dull as dishwater. Where Did Our Love Go goes nowhere and Scandalous featuring Cam'ron is straight garbage. Outside of these flaws the album is a worthwhile purchase that proved that Case was not another flash in the pan artist and could have been a force to be reckoned with if he was given the chance. Standouts: HAPPILY EVER AFTER, THINK OF YOU, FADED PICTURES, CAUGHT YOU, HE DONT LOVE YOU and IF."},{"rating":"2","title":"best r&b this year","review":"who ever gave this cd 1 star has no taste for music. every song on this is tight, no joke. i bought this cd basically because of happily ever after, but every other song was tight to. next time i have a girl over i'm poppin' this cd in cause this is some love makin' music. i can't wait for case's next cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album is astonishing!","review":"I predict that Case's cd is going to be one of the Hottest and best selling albums of the summer. The long wait for this album was worth it. His words, the way he sings is just so sincere. This album has revealed a lot about Case from his previous years and album. Throughout the past years he has undegone some changes, such as: his style has changed it has matured, he is no longer an amature to the game of music. Also, what makes this album so good is the calloborations with other artists such as Joe and Camron which give it some more flavor.

After having spent a fortune on art books about Venice, I stumbled onto this book at London's National Gallery. I have probably seen everything in this book in the original Venetian locales, but they are photographed so superbly that some actually are better than live-and-in-person. For example, some of my favorite paintings by Bellini in the Accademia are deliberately kept in dimly lit rooms by the conservationists, and Tintoretto's famous ceiling at Scuola de San Marco are neck-cringing and dark. So, to study these and any of the other scores of paintings you need this book. Every single photo is in large format, sumptous color. This is easily the best book bargain I bought last year.

It is indeed physically ponderous (this 2nd edition is one very, very large book, not two slipcased books as shown in some illustrations). However, its content easily compensates for its considerable bulk. All historical periods of art history are chronicled, with copious illustrations well-produced and nearly all in color. The text is incisive and easy to follow, yet never boring.I recommend this book to any and all art lovers, whether beginners, advanced students, or just those who desire a comprehensive reference for library or home use. I personally consider this publication a better choice than the otherwise excellent Janson \\"History of Art\\" for most readers-- the writing is just more user-friendly, in my opinion (and the content is more inclusive, especially regarding non-Western art)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This is certainly not a good product.

The craftmanship shown on all the songs is beyond most \\"emo\\" bands(i dont care much for that term anyway). They play good, hard rock music, with a subtle melody buried beneath each chorus. Only on repeatd listens is the audience allowed to find the groove of this cd. The lyrics dont expand on anything beyond girl troubles but, are fashioned in a very unique way. In fact, the song \\"Our Weekend Starts on Wednesday\\", should be the anthem for any young person trying to begin a relationship. It's almost the perfect song about being in love, set to a killer backdrop of dueling guitars and awesome lyrics. All together, not a bad record, but a very good first record by a band that has a very promising future that I can't wait to be a part of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Hey Mercedes.

The bottom line is, the list of albums they attack isn't really based on an overall assessment of the body of work known as Rock-And-Roll, it's comprised of a list of albums they had something to say about or had some chip on their shoulder about. Their disclaimers to not take it seriously doesn't relieve them of the swindle they're perpetrating on readers.I perhaps would have given it two stars for the entertainment, but since this is an example of people trying to make themselves bigger by trying to make others smaller, it deserves only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Rock & Roll Book of All Time - Arrogance Unbridled","review":"The arrogance of these non-accomplished authors knows no bounds. To selfishly ridicule some of those most prolific musicians such as Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel and others in an effort to have their definition dictate what rock and roll is simply isn't credible. Who are these two idiots to have any aura of authenticity with their list? Write a song like \\"Ticket to Ride\\", \\"Highway Blues\\", \\"All for Leyna\\" etc. and then tell me you know what is what.

I called my 10 year old son and 5 year old daughter to listen. I took the book to my mother's apartment to read certain passages. It is not enough to read this memoir silently; it must be read aloud. Bobbie Ann Mason has mastered the language of this \\"postage stamp\\" area of the South, and even outside the marvelous dialogue, she reverts to the cadences of the speech of western Kentucky, not the homogenized speech that we hear in shopping malls today, but the old language with its roots in the old world. After a while I gave up trying to read CLEAR SPRINGS silently. CLEAR SPRINGS must be read aloud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a Deep Breath","review":"The stories in this collection are short in word length, brief, but resonate long after they are read. I had to take a deep breath after each piece, the subtext and implications of what Kuo is doing in using language and writing techniques as a direct reflection of the ambiguity of memory juxtaposed against an almost equally tenuous contemporary identity is fascinating and admirable. I believe that if more people knew about Alex Kuo, a 2002 American Book Award winner, they would enjoy reading this work, though I can also say that Kuo is a writer's writer. There is fine craftmanship in these stories as well as a diversity of thought and exploration that raises this collection above the pointless displays of colorless wordplay infesting contemporary \\"American\\" literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"product caught fire","review":"i had this plugged into my computer and backup harddrive for a total of 15 minutes before i began to hear the power supply sizzling/plastic bubbling. just as i am frantically uplugging the drive, and throwing the power strip off, smoke begins to billow from the hub ports. it could have been worse had i not stuck around... i cannot recomend this product for safety concerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for O'Reilly's Book Instead","review":"Better than some. Good basic intro to PHP, for the most part. Sections on mySQL are muddled. The bits on table joins, a fairly important topic, are explained poorly + all too briefly.

Thank god he wasn't my only source.Entire chapter waster detailing app that's on the CD --- an app which is pretty much useless to you if you're not running your own server.The index at the back of the book is fairly useless as well.All + all, I wouldn't recommend this -- unless you're desperate for a PHP/mySQL book + are sick of waiting for O'Reilly + Associates to publish theirs (which is pretty much the reason why I bought this thing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Guide","review":"We use much PHP3 for our http://www.siliconmail.com site.

The whole \\"funk\\" period is one of the worst career moves ever made by an artist of Tim's stature. What was he thinking? Or better yet, what were his managers/handlers/friends thinking? The band is godawful and the songs are bad. Maybe it was a case of people more interested in their paycheck than in having Tim's best interests at heart. Or was it that Tim wouldn't listen to anyone? The music business is littered with talented people who were their own worst enemy, and I think Tim probably falls into that category. His mid-period stuff (Blue Afternoon, Lorca and Starsailor) is truly some of the most original and stirring music ever produced; but save your $$$ and avoid this disc or any of the 3 funk discs (Greetings from L.A., Sefronia, and Look At The Fool)........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I understand the importance of a subwoofer !...","review":"I just previously purchased this maybe a week before the holidays ..

The stories are simple and bring out humor and emotion. Bodett's trademark deadpan narration about the funny and unusual events that take place among the significant townspeople are so good, it almost makes a person want to pack up and head for Alaska to live with these folks. I personnally enjoy these stories very much and listen to them while I commute back and forth to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life at \\"The End of the Road\\"","review":"What an excellent set of tapes!As a displaced Alaskan myself, I can fully appreciate the characters in Bodett's books: simple, straightforward folks. People who love their freedom and value the Alaskan way of life.But you don't have to be an Alaskan to enjoy these tapes. Bodett spins fascinating and humorous tales of smalltown Alaska that *all* can enjoy. And when the last tape is played, the listener will find themselves wanting to hear more about Stormy Storbock, Ed and Emily Flannigan, Tamara Dupree and the infamous Doug McDoogan.Bodett's writing style is simple, yet entertaining...and when he reads his own work, as he does on these tapes, his matter-of-fact humor is showcased perfectely.I highly recommend these tapes - they will turn your next big-city commute into a trip to Alaska!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Stories and Characters Told by a Mesmerizing Voice","review":"Ah, delighted to see that these are still available, and that there are 2 more volumes in the edition since we first got our box set about 12 years ago (I think).

And his characters and their adventures are as real and everyday as they are intriguing and unique.Our two sons grew up listening to these on car trips and have memorized a lot of the narrative. We pretty much wore out the first set, and I'm ready for a new one, especially since there appear to be volumes we haven't heard yet.

I knew the subject matter would be a little dry, but this book takes dreary reading to new heights. I see very little in this book that is fresh or insightful. The author's vision seems clouded by a desire to impress the reader with how brilliant he is, and by doing so robs his thesis of credibility. Most embarrassing of all is the \\"Tips to age-proof your life\\", how arrogant. I'm glad I only borrowed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless!","review":"I thought this book was speculative at best.

I highly recommend this album for those of you looking for something a little different and are tired of the stuff played on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"new favorite","review":"Thia album is amazing if you love alison kraus then you will love this album 5 stars for sure ~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aptly Titled","review":"Alison Krauss and Union Station continue to amaze with their ability to dig into American music both old and new. They combine the best of bluegrass, country, and folk and make it all sound organic. Two of the best songs in this set are by Robert Lee Castleman, a writer whose name should be a household word but isn't, alas. Castleman's songs are little stories; he is something of the Raymond Carver of country music (not to be confused with Robert Carver of audiophile fame). With expressive singing and energetic playing, the band provides solid musicianship from start to finish, and the recording quality is excellent. For old fans and new fans alike, this CD is aptly named."},{"rating":"2","title":"More classic bluegrass, who needs country?","review":"Alison and the boys strike gold again. I've only just got this album and I love it already. In fact after sampling some of Dan Tyminsky's own albums on Amazon, it reinforces my liking of this album and all the performances within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered down cliche' country music","review":"I don't know what to make of this CD. I'm a longtime bluegrass fan, and I've certainly heard of Ms. Krauss's reputation, so I thought I'd give it a try. Well...I just don't know. It's as if solid bluegrass musicians were hamstrung and forced to play lightweight, bland country music. There's just not much here to reccommend. For ever moment where there's starting to be some real melody and musicianship, there are twice as many long stretches of non-descript country music. The male vocalist in particular is about as generic country--not bluegrass my any means--as they come. Walk down music row in Nashville and you can find half a dozen men who could fill his shoes quite well. Overall this is a forgettable CD, and I'm not willing to take a chance on this band again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing CD From an Outstanding Lady","review":"I love Alison Krauss CDs.

The band really knows how to play and I was surprised at how strong the whole album is.I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes good female vocals with some old fashioned coutry/bluegrass mixed in. Maybe I am an old country/bluegrass fan afterall. Some songs remind me of 'O Brother Where Art Thou' soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Jerry, please!","review":"This is another great effort by AKUS, but for me, the following changes would have made it even better: First, I'd have loved to hear Alison really belt one out again, a la \\"Atlanta.\\" As any long-time fan knows, she has the pipes to do it. Second, O! to have mandolin-virtuoso Adam Steffey back in the band, with his deep and easy voice to counterbalance Dan Tyminski's wail. And last, but certainly not least, I wish that Jerry Douglas had been reined in a bunch. He IS the dobro master, and I think \\"Choctaw Hayride\\" is terrific, but here less would definitely have been more. New Favorite could easily have been called \\"The All Jerry, All the Time Album.\\" That said, I am enjoying this CD more each time I listen to it. This wonderful band can't possibly make anything but beautiful and joyful music.

As I child, I always cringed when my father would play the twangy style of bluegrass that was popular at the time, but \\"New Favorite\\" has opened my eyes, and ears, to the depth and power of bluegrass. I have never known music that could speak to the soul like the songs on this album do. The very notes themselves tell a story, before the lyrics are even begun.My husband and I do disagree on certain aspects of the album. He prefers the songs that feature Alison Krauss's angelic vocals; I prefer the songs featuring Union Station (particularly the ones sung by Dan Tyminski). All the songs, however, are amazing, and I thought the album was cleverly arranged, alternating A.K. songs with U.S. songs.I have given this album as gifts to others who really appreciate fine musicianship, and all have loved it. I really can't praise this album enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite!","review":"OK, I have to admit that I'm a tough sell. But Alison's beautiful, entrancing voice captured my attention from the get go. Union Station is a dream band filled with talented musicians who also have the gift of musical \\"soul.\\" As a huge fan of the other Allison (Moorer), who is also not played on country radio stations, I have to say this CD was the best purchase I've made in a long time.

A lot of the pages are duplicates of others or slightly out of order and all are blurred.This is not a reflection on Loomis' content or instruction, both of which are fantastic.

Upon contacting the manufacturer, they did not want to help me and they mentioned it is a \\"custom measurment\\"??? and it is measured diagonally!!! We are not talking about a tv screen here! and when someone mentions 54\\" tall, it is usually assumed it is going to be foot to ear! The second thing is that, they did not fill it it properly. At the waist, if i put it between my two fingers, there is no filling what so ever which makes it even shorter because the waist kind of bends. Sitting, it is barely 2 feet tall. I found bigger toys for $10 at our local flea market. Great disappointment. I am extremely pleased with the JUmbo Minky version which was massive and well worth the money.

I end up using having to use regular AA batteries when I go out and this battery pak when I'm at home. Next, the clip on the battery pack that releases it is easy to hit by accident when you're playing a game. Finally, it only comes in one color, Indigo, which doesn't mesh so well with my Arctic GBA.

They have a five year \\"limited\\" warranty.Second, cheap watches do not have to look cheap. Unfortunately, this one does. The dial looks cheap and so does the bezel. The movement is loose inside the case when the crown is out. The band is rough, ugly, and yes, cheap. It has a screw down back but no screw down crown. After a month or two it is unlikely it will be water resistant in the shower much less at 100 meters. If it keeps good time it will be fine as a beater watch but don't expect to impress anyone at your next social gathering. Croton makes some really nice and well crafted watches but they also have several low end lines and though not at the bottom this one is close. I got mine on Amazons Friday Sale so I got an Ok deal.

In holding with the previous critques, I agree that there are way too many overburdened plotlines carelessly jumbled together, a misleading title and all in all too much pathos. In the end I skipped through the pages, eager to wrap the story up! What I found extremely unnerving, too, was that Erdrich lets her German characters interject a few remarks here and there in their mother tongue. Only, why is it that their German is so unnatural, stiff and not once orthographically correct (\\"Wir haben verheiraten\\")? Maybe it is a question of cultural assimilation or, and this seems to be more like it, Erdrich just didn't take the time to go over the pages of her book once more after finishing (neither did her editors) and simply didn't bother to render an authentic novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-crafted and engaging","review":"Erdrich is a great storyteller, and is a master of language. This novel is one of her best since the her first three novels.However, I felt the end was rushed and disorganized, and so at the last, the story just hit the ground. I understand how this can happen to a writer, but it was disappointing that there was no explaination or reunion of Erich with his American family; only passing reference to Franz's death(?); suprising family relations; and no word after the War about Markus.The last two chapters felt forced and there were many more unresolved characters than usual. Perhaps the anishanabeg connection to wounded knee needs its own novel? It really felt dropped in and disconnected, not usually a complaint I have with Erdrich's writings.Lovely use of language though, which is the author's strongest talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good; can't put it down after getting into it","review":"The plot twists and turns make it very interesting.

And, yes, I will finish reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had her to look forward to...","review":"When someone sees me carrying one of Louise Erdich's books and asks how it is, my first question is, \\"Have you read her other books?\\" If the answer is no, I reply \\"I'm jealous. I wish I had her to look forward to.\\" Her books never fail to meserize me, from the first page. With flashes of dark earthy humor and knowledge of the territory surpassing any other writer, she brings to life a place and people so vividly, the reader feels they've been there. Her geography is distinct, like Faulker's Yoknapatawpha County. As are her people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family trees","review":"I hope that Master Butchers is the beginning of a new set of novels intertwining Delphine, Fidelus, and Cyprian's families in the way Erdrich wove and embroidered tales of her Ojibwe ancestors.

The book may not be for those who lack the patience and curiosity to listen at family reunions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book and author's reading","review":"After reading some of the other reviews I felt I had to chime in. I really love Erdrich's reading of her own book. I love her whispery, tender voice and who better to know where emphasis should be placed in the narrative of the story. I've listened to it twice (on the way to work and back) and have read it once. I don't tire of it and will probably read or listen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I chose this book as a book club selection based on the wonderful reviews and also on the book summary. Tomorrow is our book discussion and now I'm afraid every is going to be mad at me. I'm an avid reader and a huge fan of literary fiction, but this book was a huge disappointment!First of all....it's not about a master butcher's singing club at all, it's about a sad, depressing young woman and her sad, depressing existence. The characters were so poorly developed I found myself really not caring what happened to any of them. The sense of place was underdeveloped, so I couldn't really imagine what the town looked like. And the plot was non-existent. Every time I thought something was about to finally happen, it stopped. No characters, not sense of place, no plot.Another thing...not a single happy or uplifting thing happens to a single character in this book.If it wasn't a book club obligation there's no way I would have wasted my time past page 50."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Master Butcher's Singing Club","review":"I got half-way through this book and put it down. It wasn't rewarding to that point, and I figured there are too many other, better books to spend my time with.The book started out strong but just lost its way. Characters are flat, dialogue pointless and it really didn't have much to do with the singing club. Even the one passage worth reading, about the morphine, needs more development.I'm going to try reading another of Louise Erdrich's books, but this one isn't worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels almost like magic realism","review":"A very strange book indeed. This was my first Louise Erdrich novel, and though the pace was slow throughout, the lush language and unique characters kept me reading and enjoying.The relationship I enjoyed most was Cyprian and Delphine's confusingly half-platonic friendship / marriage. Delphine and her father also had some good drama, and I loved solid, capable Eva. Erdrich peoples her story with wanderers, hoarders, old maid power freaks, drunks, undertakers who treat the dead like canvases on which to apply their art, proud sausage-makers, circus performers, and a whole cast of other unusual characters.I'm not a big fan of over-long descriptions, and the book does bog down with them sometimes, but Erdrich's language is so captivating I found myself fascinated by things I would not normally even be interested in.The plot wanders a lot, and I'm not even sure exactly what happened at the end, but it's one of those books that stays with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is the second book I have read by Louise Erdrich, Love Medicine being the first. She has a way with words like few others and I plan to read more by her. Great story with a most surprising ending! I'm a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intricate and filled with delightful description","review":"The Master Butcher's Singing Club resonates well with both the time and the place where it occurs. Erdrich presents characters that leap from the page and give you clear, direct contact with their personalities from the beginning. She presents an amazing picture of her own deep roots from the immigrant side of the family--a small stretch from her other work that has been more directly connected to the Native American culture. Clear, lyrical prose begins and carries through the entire novel bringing the conclusion to a remarkable heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Title","review":"The Master Butchers Singing Club is a fine title to the wonderful story Louise Erdrich has put down for us. Immigrant American lives and Native American lives intertwine and I am so grateful that Ms. Erdrich continues to tell the story of her people, of Americas people. This country has continually suffered and still does from a strange amensia about history that involves war. The Master Butchers Singing Club tells us to remember what happens.This story is about many things, family and community, war and its long range affect on people's lives. The intriguing characters serve us a good lesson on morality. I don't want to give any of the complexities of this story away, I'll end by saying when I finished the book I found myself wanting to step out of the house and walk away into the wind."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was terrible!","review":"A friend loaned this to me, praising it to the heavens. So I felt obliged to finish it. Terrible! I cannot believe ths writer has the reputation she has...I think I read Love Medicine years ago in college, but frankly don't remember it. The characters are ill developed. Plotlines fizzle. The narrative is so indirect and oblique that some plot points are ridiculouly hard to follow. A complete waste of time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Erdrich tells a compelling story about memorable characters--Delphine and Cyprian, Eva and Fidelis--coping with trouble in between-the-wars North Dakota. But the prose is mostly unbearable, filled with sentimentality and unnecessary modifiers. This is a tale that would have benefited from sparer language, reflecting the harsh life these characters must have faced."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Master Butchers Singing Club","review":"Let me start by saying that I have been a fan of Louise Erdrich's for years. Her unique prosaic language, Native-American/mixed-blood characters, and midwestern landscape are awesome. However, I thought this book was worse than Crown of Columbus! It was so of cheap and tawdry, like an episode of the Gerry Springer Show. The story was boring and more predictable than a tabloid story. This book has caused me to conclude that Erdrichs best novels are The Beet Queen, Tracks, and Love Medicine. After those, this \\"exploration of gender issues\\" as late is pretty damned hoaky!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative, plush prose","review":"The writer drew me in - it was so easy to immerse myself in the world of this book.

I highly recommend every project Ms. Erdrich has had a hand in from her novels to her poetry, she is a master wordsmith and storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nope - it's not about men","review":"This book was lovely - I thought Delphine was a great character and I, too, will remember her for a long time. I have read most of Ms. Erdrich's books and I love them all - but this is one of my favorites. There are certain things you can expect from a Louise Erdrich story - wonderful descriptive writing, mysticism, strong women, and always a connection to Native Americans. This book doesn't disappoint.The book does wander here and there with subplots and different threads - but that is one of the things I love about Ms. Erdrich's writing ... it takes you on many journeys, but in the end everything ties back together - just perhaps not in the way you expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaw dropping conclusion","review":"The book club I belong to had decided to read this book. After the first 50 pages, I was bored to tears. However, once the initial backdrop is established, the story started to really get good.The book is set in post WWI where a soldier from Germany comes to America and sells sausages in North Dakota. At the same time, he crosses paths with another woman whose own life has been trying and difficult. Thru cirmcumstance, the lives of these two intertwine and the author does a good job of establishing real, three dimensional characters. Additionally, Erdrich masterfully describes the challenges of the late 20's and early 30's, before the modern conveniences we have so grown accustomed to.After writing a moving piece, Erdrich blows the reader away with a jaw dropping conclusion that will leave you speechless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Might be valuable in a group decision making process","review":"whether in business, or a civic organization.

He basically believes that young Earth proponents are applying artificially limited meanings to the original text and its original language and then intimidating those who challenge their perspective as being less than completely committed Christians.

He also goes on to say that the Bible itself points to creation , and therefore science, as it's \\"67th book\\". For example , the 4th day in Genesis uses the hebrew word \\"hayah\\"(to make visible) which is very different from the hebrew word \\"bara\\"(to create something completely new). This means that on the fourth day the sun, moon , and stars had already existed from verse 1 (the Big Bang), but that on the surface of the Earth you could not see the Sun, moon, and stars until God made them visible by changing the atmosphere from transulcent to transparent.

The man is inept when it comes to the Biblical languages as was proved when in a debate he was asked by Russel Humphreys if he spoke hebrew.

This is a much better book. ...Do not waste any more time with the logical errors of Hugh Ross"},{"rating":"1","title":"We don't need more Compromise!","review":"Ross's compromise is found in his approach and his assumptions. The bottom line is that he is falling into the trap that God warns about in Proverbs 26:4! Which reads: \\"Answer NOT a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.\\" and \\"Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.\\" God warns that we are NOT to answer the FOOL (an person that rejects God and/or His Word) according to their folly! However, in his \\"defense\\" of Genesis, he bases his arguments on the FOOL's own assumptions. In other word, he accepts & works from the fools own false presuppositions and unbiblical paradigm to base his answers. In so doing, he ends up with the same conclusions a the fools he is debating. The only difference is that he says there is God, and his opponents will either agree that there is a god or not. That is why he is \\"like unto them,\\" and not giving a good apologetic for the faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"On the surface, Hugh Ross's book \\"The Genesis Question\\" seems to be very impressive, with a great deal of figures and information. However, closer scrutiny of his reasoning and data shows just how wrong he is. Hugh Ross does not do science OR religion justice with this book, as he relies on specious reasoning, inaccurate data, and misleading interpretations of facts to arrive at his conclusions, much as many young-earth creationists do. Before buying this book, I suggest reading a review of it by G.R. Morton, also a Christian believer, who points out the numerous flaws in logic and fact far better than I....Ultimately, his book gives false reasons for people to believe in the \\"inerrancy\\" of the Bible, and provides ammunition for people who are already suspicious of Christians who are trying to make sense of the world through science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Anyone who can read and comprehend what he reads, can see that the first chapter of Genesis has absolutely no resemblance to cosmology as we know it -- even if we assume that \\"days\\" were really eons. Ross's interpretation of Genesis One is simply a case of Pathological Illiteracy. For example, he reduces the account of the fourth day (describing the creation of sun, moon, and stars; and their setting in the sky) to \\"the atmosphere became transparent.\\" The account of the fourth day says nothing of the sort.I don't know whether the Pathological Illiteracy is his own or his readers'. That is, I don't know whether he believes what he writes or deceives his followers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Transparent and Disengenuous Juggling Act","review":"Having read this book, I can conclude that anyone with an elementary familiarity with either the Bible or science will see at once that Hugh Ross is juggling facts and opinions in order to develop his story. In fact, Ross is even slippery: On one hand he denies believing in evolution, while on other pages in the book he says that plants may have developed naturalistically. Now if that is not organic evolution, then what is? Ross' other claims also tell us much more about his imagination than they do about either science or religion. For instance, were they alive today, I am sure that Neandertals and members of Homo erectus would be thrilled to learn that they only seem human but are really not, and that they are soul-less pre-Adamites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"This was one of the best books I've ever read!

I'm now, after a year, an accomplished C#/.net programmer, no thanks to this book. It is going in the trash as soon as I send this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money!!","review":"Don't waste your money on this book!!Confusing, unclear....\\"guide\\" to nowhere....Touching a variety of topics: VS navigation, menu, console app execution, oop (?!), ADO.NET, ASP.NET,XML...(you name it, it's there) by just scratching the surface of the topics (\\"here is what you can do,but why...go somewhere else...\\" - approach)."},{"rating":"1","title":"no steps would be better...","review":"My God the first two books step by step for VB.net and C++ are GREAT... so what happend to this one... well I don't know, but it lacks direction.

I would have gave it a 0 STAR but the drop box doesn't go that low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent C# tutorial","review":"One of the best C# tutorials available. Also quite a nice intro to OOP as well as the Visual Studio.NET programming environment.If you are new to programming, coming from a non-OOP language such as Visual Basic 6.0 (or previous) or even a long-time coder who needs a quick into to the C# language, you should be able to find something for you here in this book. The first half of the book teaches you the basics of the C# language and how to program using the Visual Studio.NET programming environment. The second half introduces basic Windows programming, some ASP.NET as well as ADO.NET and even XML.Obviously, Windows programming and using the .NET framework are very complex topics and no single book can possibly cover everything, but for the newcomer, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better starting place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy I picked it up","review":"For once an MS Press step by step book has exceeded my expectations. This book does an execelent job of explaining C# from three perspectives. New to programming, C or C++ experience, VB experience. It explains the changes from the latter two and points out how this is an improvment.As an experienced programmer, I've been able to skim chapters I already understand. There is a guide at the front that suggests chapters that I'd be interested in.I also like the chapter format, that gives you a estimated time to complete each chapter.I was scouring for a C# book that was going to give me as much info as I could get, without dropping the typical [money] for a computer book. This is definately the best one I found. I can refer back to it as a reference, and it touches on the other .net technologies too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic","review":"This book really doesn't get deep enough into C# to be of much use.

Each page not only pops up, but also has pull tabs to allow the figures movement. A favorite part is when Madeline goes to the hospital to have her appendix removed, murmuring, \\"I can do anything. I can do anything...\\" What better praise that when my graddaughter had to go to the hospital over Christmas, and, afraid, she closed her eyes and said, \\"I can do anything. I can do anything...\\" Happily back home, she asks me to read this favorite book to her every day, a little girl who found courage from another little girl, Madeline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norwegian-Celtic Explosion","review":"I received the three Secret Garden's CDs for Christmas, they were wonderful. Being a Norwegian American, I love how they combine the Norwegian style with the Celtic. A very powerful combination. Even my second graders love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music, disappointingly poor vocals","review":"The music in this one is a bit more new-agey and less classical than the group's previous two albums. The music itself is excellent, but the vocals sound so incredibly lame that it's embarrassing. The lyrics, the recording, and the voices themselves are just a mar on every song where they surface. Secret Garden is very talented and, in most ways, a joy to listen to, but the vocals ruin an otherwise wonderful listening experience (Dreamcatcher, especially the beginning, is a perfect example). Here's one slightly-disappointed fan hoping they realize their instrumental roots again in time for their next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawn of a New Century","review":"Dawn of a New Century can be classified as New Age, World, or Classical.This CD consists of 13 songs. (Tracks 2, 4, 5, and 13) Prayer, Sona, Dreamcatcher, and Dawn of a New Century are the only songs that have words. They are all very pretty, and I enjoy them very much. The other good songs on this CD are Tracks 7, 6, and 3. That only leaves 6 more. Those songs are all pretty, but aren't extraordinary. This CD is the best of all Secret Garden's CD's (in my opinion), and most certainly worth getting.I realize not all people share my opinion, but to give you a clue to what I like here are some artists/bands I enjoy:Maire Brennan, June Tabor, Clannad, Kate Rusby, Loreena McKennitt, Pentangle, and Enya. If you don't like any of these, you might not like Secret Garden.If you don't get this CD, well, we're not alike, but if you do get it, enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: Not For Everyone","review":"John Tesh collection maxxed out? Want something more celtic-y than your Michael Bolton records? Real celtic music a little raw for your tastes? This might be the album for you! To those of you who listen primarily to classical or jazz, do not buy this album. Purchase Loreena McKennitt instead. This album is banal, jejune, overly sentimental, and downright insipid. Hit the mute button at any time and I guarantee you will be able to finish the phrase. It is unfailingly predictable and cliche-ridden. Don't worry about these two, they're laughing all the way to the bank. I feel chagrined at being suckered into buying this album by the gushing reviews in this space, and hope to help others avoid the same fate.

It was so boring. It doesnt even compare to the first to cd's with the exception of song #2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another triumph!","review":"For some inexplicable reason, Secret Garden's music is either/or: you either \\"get it\\" or you don't. For those of you who listened to the group's first two albums and felt as if Fionnuala and Rolf had found a way to put your soul to music, you will love their latest release. I think they are certain to pick up some new fans as well, since the album branches out considerably from their previous efforts. The biggest addition here is the inclusion of gorgeous vocals by Karen Mattheson, Anuna, and Fionnuala herself. The group also expands its musical style, yet still retains a strong sense of Celtic and Norweigan tradition. \\"Dawn\\" is a beautiful follow-up to \\"White Stones\\": it takes a different musical track but still manages to convey the same sweeping emotions that will haunt you long after the CD has ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Dexter","review":"I bought \\"the Koran for Dummies\\" because I needed a companion to guide me through a reading of the Quran (alternative spelling) in order to assess the many claims that wing nuts on the web have been passing around around concerning Islam and Moslems. I figured that if I had a better understanding of the Quran I could either accept or reject/modify those claims. So far (I have read only seven chapters) the book has been excellent and has given me a better understanding of the links of the Quran to the Torah and the Bible as well as those areas where it differs from them. To date I have yet to find any written passages that would justify the extremist behavior of Islamist terrorists. More Americans need to read this book and the Quran so that we can quell reactionary behavior among some of our fellow Americans and to facilitate a more tolerant and accepting attitude toward other world religions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title and content dont match. Islam for Dummies couldn't be much different","review":"I expected a better book from dummies. The Author has tried to preach Islam, detailed the different sects of Muslims and their differences which are much beyond the scope of the study of Quran (Koran). I wish the author had stuck to Quran and its proper interpretation.The tips and facts are good but the supportive material is lengthy. The author sways away from the topic.The author has been awe struck by the magnanimity of the project and limited by the limitation of his knowledge and grasp of the subject"},{"rating":"2","title":"As a Christian....","review":"The Koran for Dummies is a really nice olive branch for the skeptic, the critic or the hater of Islam, or for anyone who just wants to gain a better understanding of this often misunderstood religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koran for real dummies who can't think","review":"For the first time since buying a book on-line I was tempted to wrap it up and send it back, this book was that terrible. It went out of its way to avoid any negativity or criticism about the Koran or about Moslems, whether mainstream or fanatical. This is a very sanitized version of this holy book, and unobjective to the extreme. I was searching for true meanings of the Koran elements but reading this version was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book for everyone","review":"I bought this book few weeks ago. The simple and direct language of this book helped me understand the Islamic concepts clearly and also cleared a few misconception which I had. Its written in such a way that everyone can get a good understanding of Quran.Highly recommended!!!Good job Sohaib.Suhail Ahmad"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Koran for Dummies","review":"I did not find this book to be at all useful or helpful. I found it impossible to cross reference from the book to the Koran. None of my questions were ever answered."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very misleading","review":"I really hope people will read the real Koran and not this politically correct white wash!The real Koran is FILLED with threats, cursings, and just plain hatred towards disbelievers (= non muslims). In fact, that is a majority of Koranic contents! The Surahs of violent threats and curses (against disbelievers) are written out in every chapter of the Koran. Repeatedly!!Any fair minded reader would conclude that the Koran is a book of hatred towards Jews, Christians, or non muslims in general. The Koran TEACHES people to kill non muslims. That is not hatred??How can this 'dummy' book ignore all that?? I am usually a fan of 'Dummies' book. But unfortunately this is not an accurate overview of the Koran."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock of bull","review":"As an ex-muslim, I checked this because a friend said I should read it.What I discovered is a complete load of manure. Either the author has never read the Koran, does not understand Arabic, or else is deliberately trying to whitewash this hateful, vile, violent religion.This is like a book on Scientology written by a brainwashed scientologist, nothing more and nothing less. He should be ashamed for lying like this - but of course, lying to infidels is okay if it gets them to convert!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How innoncent can one get?","review":"Seems to me few people have really read the koran. I did! It's boring as hell, full of contradictions, threats and punishments and apparently neither the author nor the one who put it on paper were very much inspired. It's a pity it is so boring, otherwise more people would read it and become aware what a dangerous philosophy this is about. In the name of God, everything is possible and authorized. And think about this one: \\"Why don't they contemplate upon the Qur'an. Had it been originated from anyone besides Allah Ta'ala then it would have been beset with inconsistencies and contradictions\\" (S 4 V 82). It says it all, doesn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This reads like a thesis","review":"I would recommend this book stay in the professional field for the experts looking for corriculum, data, and findings. I purchased this book because the Occupational Therapist my 2 year old visits weekly suggested I read up on \\"The Clumsy Child.\\"I found this book on Amazon. It reads more like a Master's Thesis than it does a book to help parents understand their children who suffer from clumsiness. It defined some things for me that I was not fully understanding, but I didn't find it helpful as a parent relating to a Clumsy Child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, \\"blue collar\\" mug","review":"I bought this mug based on price and practicality. I grew up in a blue collar home and I value something thats useful, durable, unbreakable, and, well, not fancy. This mug is all of that, and more. For years, I'd been using an old coffee cup for a shaving mug, and firmly committed to brush and mug lather, I decided to buy this mug. It's a lot bigger than I expected, which is a good thing. There's an internal ring that exactly holds a Williams shaving soap cake. there's enough room to really whip up some nice lather. As others said, it won't break, and I have a ceramic tile floor in my bathroom. The green color exactly matches the label on my Clubman aftershave bottle, if that means anything to anyone. I kinda love this mug already! It's a real man's mug!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Rubber Mug","review":"I bought a mug just like this one 40 years ago and have been enjoying hot lather shaves in the shower ever since.

I drop my current soap container on the bathroom marble floor at least 3-4 times a week at 5am in the morning so this is an improvement. I only dropped the mug once and no loud noise. Yay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good quality product","review":"This mug is very easy to hold while preparing the brush. Has a small depression in the bottom of the mug that holds the soap so you're not chasing the soap around bottom when lathering up the brush. Not usually wide awake in the morning, so having a rubber mug takes away the fear of having broken ceramic all over the tile floor or hard surface vanity top in case it's dropped."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about regular folk?","review":"I found it a bit hard to relate to the author on this one--she's a high-paid executive who can afford to hire nannies, housekeepers, landscapers, etc. It's a bit easier to have balance when you have money.

I was hoping that the lowering of the ph from this stuff would keep the ph low. I would put it in new water when I did my water changes, and it didn't really do anything. I put massive amounts in each gallon of water to try and permanently lower the ph in each gallon. It didn't last though. I monitored a gallon jug of water and less than 24 hours after putting 10 ml of ph down in 1 gallon jug of water the ph levels were back up to almost what they were before. I know this is because my water is so hard but it just wasn't enough. If you are looking to lower the levels, get Fluval peat moss extract instead. Put that in a media bag and drop it in your canister or power filter and it will have a more positive long term effect on your ph level. One box lasts for several months with positive effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry i purchased in ignorance","review":"realized that ph up and ph down -are not anything but temporary fixes; the real need is to cycle a aquarium and work with it with water changes or water from a reverse osmosis source in the first place-not mess with the chemicals which at best are a cover up and don't last long and really hurt the fish more than it seems they help. sorry I purchased"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexz Johnson is a special young talent!","review":"The first song I every heard this young lady sing is 'White Lines'.

Ms. Johnson plays the character of Jude Harrison who win an American Idol type contest and goes on to record her own albums.

Series 1-3 are the cream obviously and my wife and I have been enjoying them immensely. I am especially surprised by the comedic talents of Joanna Lumley (Patsy), who I only knew as the gorgeous but dangerous agent Purdey from the New Avengers series. Jennifer Saunders is a howl as Edina and Julia Sawalha is brilliant as Edina's long suffering daughter Saffron. I love this show and now rank it as one of my favorites along with such wonderful Britcoms like \\"As Time Goes By,\\" \\"One Foot in the Grave,\\" Butterflies,\\" and \\"Keeping Up Appearances.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"3 out of 4 ain't bad","review":"This is a 'must buy' for AbFab fans.

Luckily when I came home, it was playing on the \\"Comedy Channel\\". Who couldn't love the irreverant twosome of Edina and Patsy? Their antics are so brazen and politically uncorrect-like addictions to alcohol and drugs, slutty clothes, maipulation of others, to name a few.The humor is totally British and fabulously funny! I could watch each episode over and over again and still laugh.Saffron, Edina's daughter, is the bookworm, uptight antithesis to these two. Friction always arises between these two and Patsy herself picks a catfight with the young girl.I heard that more episodes will be made due to a cult following and I can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Worth It!","review":"I loved this show when I first saw it on Comedy Central, Me and all of my friends used to gather in expection of a new series of AbFab. Then Comedy Central seemed to run it 24/7 and into the ground. But, I thought, I hadn't seen it in a while, and I have a gift certificate, sooooo.Everyone should run right out and get this right now; the transfer is great, as usual, the DVD version shows far more detail, (if you have a laptop, look at it on it, the screen is small, but shows far more detail) and the extras are fun. A great show, and I am glad that Ms. Saunders has decided on a new series. That will give Ms. Lumley less time to do her weird travel show shown on Ovation, and give us more of the adventures of Pats and Eddy, who have all of the binges we'd rather not live through, but love to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"AbFab","review":"One of my favorite subversive TV shows.

Very durable! They both loved them. He's 8 months old and they are still hanging on his carseat. He plays with them each time we get in the car!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Baby will loves these bugs!","review":"These bugs are so great because they don't make carrying the car seat any harder then it already is. I bought a couple of other items to attach to the car seat to keep my son entertained and they made it hard to pick up. These bugs are great though, they can easily be removed, they are long enough for baby to reach them and pull at them. The one (even though it broke after about a month) makes a funny vibrating noise when you pull it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more...","review":"After reading all the reviews, I registered for the Bugs on Board. But my son just seems bored w/ the bugs. He's had them since he was a month old, and now at 3 months, he acts like he doesn't even see them on his carseat. I thought he would be more interested in them like the babies in the reviews, but I guess these just didn't do anything for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby loves these!!","review":"We have 2 of the bugs on the handle of the infant carrier and they keep baby entertained quite often!!

Today the ladybug's head came off in his hand. Luckily I was right there to grab it out of his mouth. If that wasn't bad enough - the pouch the squeaker is enclosed in (a very flimsy mesh) ripped open and came out pretty easily with a very gentle tug. Please make sure to check the toys yourself before giving them to baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bugs EVER!","review":"We bought these for our baby when she was 2 months old.

She loves them and smiles whenever she seems them. Great purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the original bugs?","review":"I wanted to buy another set of these for my niece, but when I saw them I was disappointed. These must be the new version of Bugs on Board. The original ones, which my daughter has, are SO much cuter. Primary colors, bright, interesting with rattles, crinkles, squeaks and mesh to feel beads inside them. EVERY one of them has crunchy wings, big antennas and cute faces. these new faces look spooky. ours include a bright red ladybug, a purple and orange flying bug, and a grasshopper. going to buy something else. these drab bugs aren't very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"$9 for these?

I hook them to her car seat when she is in the stroller and she just looks so content and mesmerized by them. Very cute little toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves them - but jitter toy broke","review":"These are great! My baby girl has loved these since she was just a few weeks old (she's almost 6 months now & still loves them.) At first, I'd place them on the sides of the car seat handle, so they'd catch her peripheral vision. It's been fun seeing her develop & her enjoyment of these little bugs just keeps developing, too. First she just watched them, then she batted at them, now she grabs & pulls & of course, tries to eat them. Only problem is that the jitter toy (the firefly) broke a long time ago, before she even got to the point where she could pull it & enjoy it. Still, she doesn't know she's missing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bugs Everywhere","review":"I have to say, this toy is great. We bought then for our daughter when she was 4 months old (7 months now) and she just loves them. As they are small and easily movable, we use them in the car, have them velcro'd to her car seat handles, lay them with her on her play mat and bring them into the restaurant. Whenever she gets fussy, we give one to her and she is good for 15 minutes. Perfect for the family on the move."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great distraction!","review":"My five month old daughter loves her \\"bugs\\" that we've attached to her car seat. Now that she is beginning to teethe, she jams them into her mouth any chance she gets. The other toys she has may fall out of the car seat, but with these bugs attached to the handle, they aren't going anywhere. Keeps her pretty entertained for our jaunts around town. The only thing that kind of creeps me out is that one of the bugs looks like a giant tick. But maybe that's just me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!","review":"Our daughter thinks that her carseat is the most horrible thing. We bought these bugs for her carseat when she was 1 month old and when she gets upset we say \\"look at your bugs\\" and she just looks from one to the next. The bugs really calm her down. The bright colors are great and she is now old enought to where she swats at the for fun as well. It is definately the best $9 I have spent yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Bugs","review":"My two-month-old didn't like being in his car seat so I bought the bugs for the car seat bar after reading all the great reviews. I'm sure these cute bugs work for some kids, but my son was not interested in the least. They've been on his car seat for two weeks now and it's not made a bit of difference in his fussing in his car sear.

She found them very entertaining and would pull on them and stare at them. Once we got the next size up carseat, we started using them on her stroller or just by themselves. This is weird, but her favorite part is the velcro. She just loves chewing on them more than any other toy just about. Even though she has plenty of teethers, for some reason she just loves the way the velcro feels on her gums I guess. We've gotten a lot of mileage out of this (...) toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for web developers","review":"Whereas Windows developers usually have a copy of Microsoft's 'Windows Interface Guidelines for Software Design' to turn to for advice on behaviour and usage of Windows elements, such a resource has been sorely lacking for developers of applications for the internet.This book fills the gap admirably.It provides a comprehensive set of guidelines on the use of the various components of an internet application (windows, dialogs, menus, buttons and so on), with detailed descriptions of their appearance and behaviour.As with any set of guidelines, there are individual elements and recommendations with which one could disagree.This is an eminently practical and useful book, and I believe it should be on the bookshelf of every developer of internet applications - whether using Java or another tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I did not like this book","review":"I was expecting code examples for programming GUI.

Not what I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"More quilting than patchwork","review":"This book is wonderful if you are looking for a quilting book. It has a lot of techniques and patterns for actual quilting (not necessarily patchwork). It is for machine and hand quilting. I have seen other quilting books and this one is good.

There is no doubt about this. My sicko friends love this, especially the ending. It has to do with a guy who grew up in the woods luring kids into a cannibalistic cult, where they sacrifice adults. It's stupid as all hell, but it's so much fun to watch. The ending is a laugh riot (though it probably shouldn't be) where all the adults band together and slaughter their own kids. It's gory, it's cheap, and it comes with a free spatula! Ok, it doesn't come with a free spatula (good marketing idea though), but I'm willing to forgive Troma because they've been so good to me all these years. To quote the movie, \\"Will you touch me now, Uncle, the way Grendel touched Mother?\\" Have fun kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE","review":"THIS MOVIE WAS SO GREAT!!!!!!

Simply put, the worst film I've ever seen (yes, even worse then Gore-Met, the Zombie Chef From Hell)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's TROMA.","review":"That's all you need to know. It's not meant to be frightening or creepy or \\"good\\" in terms of cinematic classics. All these people that are rating it 1 because it has bad special effects and isn't scary, they just don't get it. At all. Lloyd Kaufman is a nutball. He's a cinematic genius. They make their movies to be absolutely ridiculous, and for some reason, alot of these people just do NOT seem to get it. I find it hilarious that they're so completely oblivious to the fact that it's not serious in the least. How could anyone think that a movie about children being brainwashed into cannibalizing people could possibly be a serious movie? If you want to see a movie that was meant to try to scare you, go watch The Ring. If you actually have a sense of humor and find bathroom humor, crappy sfx and dubbed-in fart noises laughable, watch Troma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"I'd heard of \\"Troma\\" films for awhile now, so I thought I'd give it a go and actually see one of them. I want a refund. I got this for five dollars at a blowout sale.It opens with this kid and his father in the woods roasting marshmallows and chanting spells, campfire stories. The father gets his foot caught in a deertrap. He dies. The kid goes psycho.From there we see a perfect example of how not to make a movie.The gore is hoky and retarded. At no point was this shocking or scary. Laughable. And not even that laughable. Just bad.You won't be \\"tromatized\\", you'll just be bored, and if you have a weak heart maybe cheaply disgusted. I want my five back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"This is absolutely the worst movie that I have ever seen.

Some of the chapters are (1) VERY dry, (2) have looooong run-on sentences and (3) at times are quite difficult to figure out their logic/order. Chapter 2, for example, took me nearly a week to pick apart the run-on sentences, eliminate the 'garbage', piece together the 'meat' and then try to make sense of what was being said. It was painfully dull! Some of the other chapters, too, were about as exciting as reading a dictionary.I haven't taken the test just yet, but I did find this book to be quite nice.

Has Konami ever made a good sports game? No I bet not, they better stick with action games or their reputation might be as good as dead, this was made a while ago but it is still pretty bad, if you are still playing N64 I suggest you get one of the All-Star Baseball games, they are pretty good, or should I say they were good for their time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"This book is very very much out of date!

The chapter discuses behavior drives and how drives affect training. Never have I had a Sheltie like my Tim and now through the help of this chapter I am more in tune with my boy and training is now not only more affective, but more fun.

It goes through different theoretical models of learning and doesn't actually get into any kind of training until well into the book. It is difficult to follow and by the time my son and I started to get through the dense material our puppy was no longer a puppy. This book does not provide any kind of straight forward approach, rather it gives all the different approaches.

I initially found it at a friend's house and while flipping through the chapters I decided I needed one for myself. Though I am very familiar with dogs, the behvioural sections helped me get a handle on my new puppies' quirks and demands, particularly the section on typing your dog's profile. They were a new breed for me, and rescues, so I appreciated the explanation of behaviours I was not familiar with.

However, in reading the book I kept wondering, especially with regards to the whole Clipper fiasco, if the story might have turned out differently if the starting point was after 9/11. I am still waiting to see/hear about encoded messages that were decoded after the attack, that might have warned us before hand. In no way do I think the government should have an open hand into my communications, but when factored against stopping the slaughter of thousands, then I become a little unsure.

I work as a camp counselor and love to read bed time stories to some of my kids. This book is great because it has all the classics. The kids recognize the stories, and it makes it easier for them to fall asleep most nights because they already know what happens and they don't have to focus as much.

(Not that with the size of his advances - or indeed the rave reviews he gets in the papers - he needs much sympathy.) I just read Experience, my first Martin Amis book, and thought it bloody good. It's both thoroughly well written and completely engaging; all the narratives (perhaps with the exception of the stuff about Lucy Partington) gripped me and gave me lots to enjoy and think about. The stuff about Sir Kingsley is tops and a wonderful insight into the great old curmudgeon, and Mr. is remarkably moving about Sir K.'s death. I expect real Amis fans get a lot more out of it but you don't have to be a diehard to enjoy his navel gazing, it's not self-indulgent (well, maybe a little) it makes sense and it's interesting and if little Martin was worried about the size of his bum well, I was glad to hear about it. Plenty to get your teeth stuck into here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those teeth!","review":"Whatever inspired Martin Amis to drivel on about his teeth? Did he think we would be interested? Does he want to know about my uncle's gall bladder operation?Really this book was a sad, sad disappointment. Maybe I was taken in by all the hype. Maybe Amis's new agent has done a good job of promoting a mediocre piece of writing. The only thing in its favor is that Amis's penmanship remains as sharp as ever. The subject matter is more than questionable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amis is addictive","review":"I had to read this book for a Creative Writing course.

I wish I could write half as well. But the subject matter of 'Experience' (Amis, himself) makes me think I lead a more interesting life. If I was setting out to write my memoires, I think I'd leave my teeth out of it (even though they've given me some trouble). Or maybe a paragraph, maximum. If I wanted people to know about the things that struck me emotionally, I would almost certainly include girlfriends/lovers - not dead relatives whom I hardly knew.Most of the interesting parts of 'Experience' are the quotes from Martin's father, Kingsley. So who wants to read second-hand quotes? This book is full of explanatory footnotes that could easily have been included in the main body of text, and would probably have been more interesting for being so.It was a struggle to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky!","review":"When you can drive around crushing cars with a car that you see a body trapped in plastic twitching around in the backseat with you just dont say no.

I have researched this game for a while and I have heard nothing but praise. Gamespot, gamepro and ign all say this is an amazing game, Even in its early stages. The levels are huge! The cars are detailed better then ever. This game will fully use PS2 graphical capabilities. I saw some of the movies for the one player mode and they are freaky! This game was meant to be sadistic and that is exactly what they did. The game will run at 60 frames per second... even in multiplayer. That is pretty impressive. So the guys at Incognito will make a great TM game again. No surprises here. And for the one star reviewers research before you open your mouth. Dont listen to the japanese"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"The idea behind the game was pretty cool, car combat done with superb graphics etc.. But what I found in this game was a sense of gloom every time I loaded it up. You may think I sound crazy but if you're a parent, you may seriously want to consider passing on this game, there's not one ounce of positivity or kid friendly gameplay in it. I can't understand why they'd put such a depressing backstory in this game, maybe if they'd ended on an upnote with at least one character... but every character gets tricked, and then ultimately killed off in the end. It just really bothered me and therefore I can't recommend this game, not even to adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Well, I went to the local used video game store and picked up a copy of this for $15. I havent played the others in the Twisted Metal series, and probably because of that this game really disappointed me. Graphics are fine, but the gameplay was just chaotic. You start in this huge arena and all the AI cars just zoom around you and blow the crap out of you. The controls seemed a little awkward for when I tried things like circling around another car and shooting it, or just trying to shoot and evade in general. I put about an hour's time into it, but in the end I really didn't have any fun at all.If you haven't played and liked the other twisted metal games, stay far away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Spend Your Money On This!!!!!!","review":"out of any of the games I own this game is my least favorite.

It gets boring fast.. you need codes just to keep it interesting. I will say that the graphics are great and the vehicles and environments themselves are pretty cool.. but the gameplay isn't stellar and the storylines for the characters are ultra stupid. The game just needlessly erodes our ever evaporating shock factors and capitalizes on cheesy characterization.

It's your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUUUUUUGGGGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!","review":"This game has great graphics and a great storyline. However, this is NO different than TM3 + TM4.

TEKKEN TAG, FINAL FANTASY, and now twisted metal is back in black. The controls are pretty much the same but it's a whole new digital world. The graphics are amazing. The rain switches angles when your car turns, the explosions litteraly explode and shoot you backward, and the levelsand the backrounds are mindboggling. There are new cars with new lunatics driving them. But the classics such as Sweet Tooth and Mr. Grimm are still fighting strong. This is aa must have.

But, hey, its rated M for a reason. Strictly play wise, the game is amazing. The controls are silky smooth, the graphics never sputter, and the stories are so enticing, you'll be hooked until the end.

There are different modes you can play that will give you hours of fun.. If you are thinking about buying this game, you will have to have patience because it takes a pretty long time to kill your opponents.

I was expecting an Interstate76 style game with a worth while story mode and great multiplayer. The multiplayer in Twisted metal is great but I wasnt thrilled with the story mode. You fight in a tournement instead of driving full out missions, which put a huge damper on my liking.The games graphics are great and just driving around and running things over is enjoyable. The cons definetely dont matter that much when you see how much the game is. A cheap but well worth while buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible disaappointment...","review":"The game is very overrated. If you bought the other Twisted Metals don't buy this one.

I was very disappointed in this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"foolish","review":"Twisted Metal: Black may not be easy, not much in the way for cheats as compared to Twisted Metal 4 (including access to the bosses)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I own this Boring Game and the Physics model is horrible","review":"Finally a review from someone that really has the game.In a word Twisted Metal Black is boring. The game is all shoot, no story. Well, a few short plotless movies are included, but they hardly qualify as story.And if you're into shooting games, the shooting isn't much. Basically drive (or rather float) around and blow things up.For a driving game the physics are horrible, all the vehicles drive like hovercars or boats, not cars. And the dumptrucks drive almost exactly the same as the motorcycles.There's not much unique about this game, I've see all these weapons in other games, nothing new here. All the vehicles move unrealistically fast, I guess to make it more challenging. It's rated M for Mature, though I really couldn't tell you why. It's not gory or scary.If you're looking for great PS2 games, this doesn't come close to SSX.My recommendation for a good car game?Save your money for Gran Turismo 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone's got their games mixed up....","review":"How could you possibly give this game one star? you haven't even played it!

The story mode is great because they really put time in the plots of the stories. You gotta buy this game because with the limited titles that are out for ps2 now you won't be able to find a better game. If you do buy the game my recomendation is to play with Roadkill or Sweettooth because in my mind the are the best players. If you are i a mood to see a great story then definately beat the game with Outlw or Sweettooth.

GO BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Physics and no Originality","review":"The driving physics of this game are horrible, motorcycles and dump trucks handle, accelerate and brake in almost exactly the same way. The laziness of the developers shows through with them using the same phyiscs model for every vehicle.All the vehicles drive more like boats or hovercars than cars, drifting and coasting all over the place. If you touch the gas for a second you'll have enough inertia built up to drive a mile or two.The game play is nothing new, basically just wander around looking for power-ups and shoot like mad. Quake with a hovercar.Twisted Metal Black is very arcadish, not at all a good driving game and not at all compelling. I found it quite simple to beat and the computer opponents to be very predicitable.Strongly not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"game for sadists and gothics","review":"this game is sick. the entire plot is about people who kill people for no reason. its so gory and sadistic i almost puked. anyone who finds this game fun needs some help. this game was made by someone who has alot of issues. please, don't pick up this game, if you do, you should definately get some help"},{"rating":"1","title":"person stuck to front bumper and other extreme violence","review":"\\"Twisted Metal: Black\\" is an extremely violent game, beyond that of most first-person-shooter video games and war games.

Those are all for one-player mode though. In two-player mode you can battle against two to four players in a deathmatch. Then you can play the story mode on co-op and you can play an elimination round which is where each player selects up to ten cars. you battle against each other with one car at a time until the other person blows up one car then you swich into another.

As expected, the graphics are marvelous. The levels are huge, and there is always something new to be found. In one level, you can have the airplane flying overhead shoot missles at an nearby enemy!

This was a really great band and Dave Cousins is a fantastic talent who deserves more attention for passionate songs and original ideas.

I especially love \\"Deliciously Down.\\" I saw Cree's performance at the Lenny Kravitz / Black Crowes concert a couple of days ago and I was floored by her raw energy, her obvious musical passion, and her inspiring voice. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird But Impressive Debut!!","review":"I fell in love with this album after listening to it just once. Cree Summer's lyrics are kinda bizarre (they don't make a lot of sense), but you can overlook that. Produced by another favorite of mine, Lenny Kravitz, this album is a mash of R&B, hip-hop and a dallop of pop. The only sings I do not like are \\"Sweet Pain\\" and \\"Naheo\\"; everything else is wonderful. Get \\"Street Faerie\\" if you like Lenny Keavitz, this is just a female version of him! I hope she releases another album soon; I can't wait to hear what the \\"Street Faerie\\" has to sing about next!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing alternative to the stuff on the radio","review":"When I learned that Cree Summer was coming out with an album my curiosity was instantly aroused. (I read somewhere that she was actually in pursuit of a career in music prior to her gig on a Different World.) When I obtained the album I was so glad that I did. The Cree Summer and Lenny Kravitz collaboration was a great pairing. Cree has conveyed much soul and intensity in this album. My favorites are \\"Deliciously Down\\", \\"Angry Boy\\", \\"Revelation Sunshine\\", \\"Mean Sleep\\", and \\"Fall\\". The album is awesome. It has a folk, rock, and soul feel to it and is a refreshing change to the music I usually listen to (R&B, Rap). It's unfortunate that artists like Cree Summer do not have a forum on urban radio stations. I love all types of music, but wish that artists who don't conform to the \\"norm\\" don't get the attention they deserve. The lyrics and arrangements are tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please make another CD!!!!","review":"I love this CD and still play it faithfully. I wish that she would make another one.

This is one of the best CDs I've ever heard. It really doesn't fit into any category because it has a little of everything. Cree's unique voice and way-out-there lyrics make an album worth buying. I would definitely love to see her perform live or something because this girl rocks. If you buy this CD you definitely won't be disappointed. I can't say enough about her. If you are interested in Lenny Kravitz, I suggest you give this album a listen because Lenny appears on every song and produced the album. I hope to hear more from Cree in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better live","review":"I saw Cree on a second stage last summer at the Everlast, Black Crowes, and Lenny Kravitz triple bill. Little tiny petiiiiiite Cree was the highlight of the show. Once I got over the Frankie from A Different World stereotype, which did not take long, I was complete entranced by the melody of her voice and tempo of her music. The memory of her stage presence still remains strong over a year later. Believe it or not, after her strong performance, I was actually disappointed in this musical masterpiece. It ebbs and flows with a blend of funk, soul, rock, and of course, a Lenny Kravitz-like influence. Her duet with him, \\"Mean Sleep\\", remains one of the coolest songs I have ever heard. I can't wait for her sophmore release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Goddess of Sound","review":"Cree Summer's honey-like voice and smooth stylings are mystical.

Cree was amazing and in my mind stole the show. Her cd Street Faerie is one of the best cd's i ever heard. It ranges in style from the soulful r and b styled Soul Sister to the angry, venemous, and hard hitting Curious White Boy. Cree displays a magical element on Miss Moon and Revelation Sunshine.

Since getting the disc, I listen to that track everyday going to work. The duet with Lenny Kravitz is superb. I don't know how anyone can miss out on getting this one. This disc is a prime example of a great debut album (great music and lyrics). It is a total sing-a-long album.

Lenny's guitar riffs are a major bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Promising Debut","review":"Since hearing that Cree Summer would be releasing an album I've been greatly anticipating it. Now that I've indeed bought it, I'm deeply impressed! She uses her voice to great effect, writes entertaining lyrics and clearly has an ear for good music. A few more killer bridges as well as standout solos and this would have been a true classic. Lenny Kravitz might consider opening up the production and allowing in a few other musicians to help fill out the sound a little. Otherwise this is one of the best debuts in quite some time.

However it takes an unbelievably long time for the copies of the magazine to reach you even bearing in mind the quarterly nature of the magazine.

I like Spanish films. I am not a prude. I did not like this movie. There was very little character development. The plot consists almost entirely of him briefly hooking up with 4 different sisters. Should I be happy for his discovery of free love? Think he's a sleaze? He seems to be somewhere in the middle, just bumbling along.And what am I to think of the sister who accepts his profession of love for her and only her after she's watched him declare his love for the other 3? Is the wedding in the end a happy ending? I can't decide because I don't know what to think of the people who get married.Maybe it is all a political allegory that I don't get because I know so little about this period in Spanish history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and sexy, but also has substance","review":"I disagree with the Amazon editorial. Yes, this is a funny, sexy movie; maybe a young man's dream come true. It also has a lot of real commentary on Spanish society at the time; right before the Spanish Civil War. The characters end the movie thinking all is well in the world and don't know the Civil War is right around the corner. I am sure this aspect is lost on most American audiences, but it is a very real part of the film and juxtaposes the light, sexy, comic aspects of this movie. The scene where the priest hangs himself in the church right before the young couple get married is very symbolic of how the church felt at this time of liberalization and the backlash that led to the Civil War (1930s). See the movie! It is one of my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant, funny, sexy, sophisticated, and very \\"French-like\\"","review":"Belle Epoque reminds of a traditional French-style cinema, just like the title itself.It is a story of basically decent, but very confused young man (incredibly cute one, too), whose only concern is how to survive amidst the chaos of Spanish Civil War.The film begins with this young man, Fernando, almost being killed, but it ends with him being very much alive and happy. In the process, Fernando meets a lot of new people: an old man, Manolo, and his unconventional family, to say the least. The relationship between Manolo and Fernando takes a special place in the story, along with Fernando's amorous interest in Manolo's daughter(s).Apart from love and youth, Belle Epoque is also looking at Spain's historical background and hypocritical nature of society during the Great Spanish Civil War.Overall, Belle Epoque is both visually appealing and very philosophical, at the same time. It is a real masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish Classic","review":"Hysterically funny,great intra family rivalry and love.Excellent backdrop of chaos during Spanish Civil war.

Beautiful shots, great musical background and the most histerical situations that can happen to a family. But at the end, family is still family!!! Come and enjoy Belle Epoque, as we do!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I can watch this movie over and over. The cast is interesting, and in some cases, good looking. While there is some interesting commentary, this movie is more for enjoyment than serious thinking. As the main character has romantic encounters one after the other with four sisters of different personalities, you secretly hope he ends up with each of them in the end. The sisters and their father make up a very non-traditional family for the period, yet come acoss as being more well-balanced and likable than local teacher and his mother who are very traditional. Of course the backdrop of this movie is the republican period right before the Spanish civil war, so there are some issues pertaining to the church, government, and social structure, but the best part of the movie is the gorgeous look of the film and the romantic storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"I recently watched this movie and I believe it is the best Spanish movie I have seen. I would not call this fluff, not only was the movie hilarious, it also presented quite a lot of insight into Spanish history and had a really good cast of characters. Jorge Sanz manages to give the lead character a mixture of vulnerability and manliness that is just irresistible, you can see why all the sisters are falling head over heels for him. Ariadna Gil gives a great performance as gender-confused Violeta, I thought she acted just like a man. Juanito and his mother, the comic relief characters, were just hilarious.

Evolution marks the beginning of modern biological thought, and the Galapagos Islands played a major role in the development of evolutionary ideas. Edward Larson shows us how the archipelago was differently perceived by so many people from Melville and Darwin in the mid-1800s to later visitors up until the present day. While it would probably be confusing to learn about evolutionary theories from this book, Larson brings to light how some of those theories developed with respect to findings from the Galapagos. By doing this, one shares in the same act of discovery that has so enchanted the various researchers who have come to the islands.

The author takes several classical cognitive mistakes that humans make (some will recognize the classic names of Kahnemann and Tversky; they are one of the substrates of this book). The author applies such mistakes to a wide range of investment problems - holding on to losing stocks too long, anthropomorphizing stock decisions, and so on. The sort of psychology that makes you think that a coin that has flipped tails three times now has a 95% chance of flipping heads on the next toss. Most intelligent readers (the sort that buy Harvard Press books) could get the same points in a much briefer format, like a book chapter or a 10-page article. For example, people tend not to save enough for retirement because the future seems a long time away and they think they'll catch up and it will work out. Well, yes.

The episodes I viewed featured a single scientist pondering relics, forming opinions, then conferring with another expert who agreed. There was no debate, no exploring of other options, and innuendo paraded as facts. There were holes in the supporting evidence that I easily picked out.I'm a little disturbed at what is passing as scientific or professional analysis these days. Definitely not what I would consider a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest!","review":"I gave this to my brother for Christmas and it was a big hit.

Lewis plays a waitress in her usual moronic, whiney, deer in headlights, wide-eyed stupid way. She of course is in love with Pitt, a run of the mill red-neck who sits around drinking beer all day and chewin tobacky. (Insert Woody Harelson several years later). Then we have the X-Files guy, who is as boring as a second coat of paint. He is a writer, now ain't that excitin. He sits around whining all day about how the death penalty is bad and we should open up all the prison gates.I have looked deep within myself and cannot understand all the positive reviews of this film.

Great performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling Movie","review":"A movie about a killer...been there, done that, right? Wrong. Although a bit gory at times, this movie tends to focus on what makes this killer tick and the fear of his would-be victims. I gave this movie four stars instead of five because Juilette Lewis's performance of basically an ignorant \\"country bumpkin\\" began to wear on the nerves. Other than that, the cast was outstanding (yes, Brad Pitt, at least when he puts his mind to it, CAN act) and the story was solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid film with a standout performance by Lewis","review":"Kalifornia is a film that deserves to be seen. The key to the film's successs lies in Sena's (the director) emphasis on the present, not bogging the story down with tales of Early's(Pitt)childhood abuse or other such \\"reasons\\" for his insanity. We are not spoon fed a story but left to draw our own conclusions from what we are given. It is not a film about a serial killer but a film that asks who is capable of going crazy. This is not a question Sena or anyone can answer therefore it is rightfully left to the thoughts of the viewer. Lewis gives a heartbreaking performance as Adel, one that shouldn't be missed, while Pitt gives another excellent performance. Duchovny is Duchovny and that works well in his role, while Michelle Forbes gives a solid performance as well. Kalifornia is a great social commentary, not on serial killing, but on people in this country that have been neglected, left to sort through their societal rejection in a violent manner"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clever Off the Beaten Path Film","review":"This is an excellent motion picture competently acted, well scripted and neatly directed.

When it came out on video, I skipped it (Brad Pitt, David Duchovny -- pretty boys who think they can act, forget it!). Then, one rainy evening when everything else had been rented out at the video store, I finally sat down and watched this movie. What a surprise. These guys can act. Especially Brad Pitt. Playing completely against type, he shows that there really is a brain and talent underneath all of that \\"Interview with a Vampire\\" hair.

I sought out other Herbert works and found Whipping Star, (As well as the Dosadi Experiment), to be the equal of the classic series. The creative energy behind the beings, worlds and storylines here was so engaging that I reached a level of absorption in the story I rarely experience. Although the scope is certainly not equal to the Dune universe, the vivid imagery and peculiar characters make for escapism at it's best. This book is due for re-release in January. Buy it new or used and be prepared for some highly persistent images in your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Herbert Masterpiece","review":"This book is one more proof of Herbert's mastery. The effort and difficulties in communication between a human and a being that perceives our dimension only as a \\"wave\\" is wonderfully laid out.

That way if you lose or if you don't know what to do head over to the practice version. By the way my favorite challenge is the slots.

The album's redundancy and vacuity may be good medicine for insomnia, but those who are interested in hearing authentic Buddhist music may want to pass it up. Suggestion: try something other than Tibetan Buddhist chants for a change and listen instead to the Vietnamese variety offered on \\"Anthology of World Music: The Music of Vietnam\\" (Rounder CD 5140/41).

Having heard this recording for the first time on cd after not hearing the album for a number of years, I forgot just how exciting Shelton was. Shelton will always be known for the \\"Shelton bounce\\" style of playing: a syncopation that made his sound truly unique. This recording marks the cd emergnece of one the true masters.

They're easy to keep clean and since it's a brushed finish, they don't show finger prints or smudges. I have had these for a couple years now and they're still holding up wonderfully, and it's easy to change your decor around them since they coordinate well with most any color you put in there.

Flatware leaves gray marks on the surface whenever it comes in contact with the stoneware. Which, of course, happens every time you eat!Gray marks all over your dinner plates is not good! In fact, it requires a special cleaner, \\"Pfaltzgraff Stoneware & Porcelain Cleaner\\", and a fair amount of elbow grease, to get the marks off!!! And, even after you have them all clean, the very first time you actually eat on them, the marks are back.

After all, we are managed by \\" Homo economicus cretinus\\", so who will ever find out?This would be a great little gift book for an executive who takes themselves way, way, too seriously.

This may be strange because most of my favorite bands are punk and hardcore. I'm surprised Venice isn't very popular, because they deserve to be more recognized. Another problem is that people hear Venice and don't realize how good it really is, because they compare it to other bands they listen to. The trick is to not compare, and you hear a great artist.

It was good, but not what I had hoped; Spin Art was what I had hoped for. A truly wonderful CD, with the right mix of energy and smooth. From the first notes of guitar and harmonica that opens 'The Man You Think I Am' all the way through, Venice just creates a wonderful soundscape. I don't feel the need to comment on the wonderful vocal harmonies, the other listener reviews do that nicely.

I have never used a carrier that required 2 adults. There are oodles of more practical, comfortable, and convienient babywearing positions out there and this book had none of them.

For one thing, the dimensions were wrong--it said to get five to six FEET of fabric when it meant five to six YARDS, and since I can't sew to save my life, I had to make 2 separate trips to the fabric store with a wiggly baby to buy the extra fabric, then find someone who would sew it together for me. THEN, after all of that, the carrier didn't work for us. It would come untied, or sag, and was confusing to put on.Just get a basic ring sling.

I feel the book misrepresented itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book disturbed me.","review":"Hugh Ross decided to tackle some very BIG issues such as the trinity, the incarnation, God and Time, and free will. Unfortunately, I am uncertain to what extent scientific principles can help. Where his proposal of extra-dimensional analysis is safe, I have already read it in C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity. But much of what he writes I consider to be theologically questionable. Ultimately, the problem is that he knows physics, but he is not as well qualified as a philosopher or theologean. I would be eager to hear what William Lane Craig would have to say about Ross' theories. But I do not encourage this book primarily because it is too speculative."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bizzare synthesis of Bible, Science, and supposition","review":"This is a book which takes some strange approaches to try and use science to prove God. He often uses ineffective dimensional perceptions to try and prove God's nature. Hugh contend that Jesus could do anything in any dimension at any time during his life on the earth. Maybe, but I thought that being limited as a man was part of the purpose.The many graphs in the book attempting to show the rise or fall of a person into salvation or blashpemy are a waste of time. He attempts to reduce spiritual realities to finite lines on a graph. Some of his points may be right but his evidence is flawed and largely empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not thought through very well.","review":"The book reads like a poorly written high school research paper. Ross makes plenty of bold statements, but doesn't back them up with much specific evidence. As an example, Ross writes, \\"God can describe all the properties of quantum particles and quantum events\\"(37). Where in the Bible does God explain quantum physics? Statements like this, are what makes this book's arguement weak. Ross is comparable to the Catholic church. He uses God as a crutch, to explain what science has not yet been able to prove."},{"rating":"1","title":"baseless apologetics disguised as scientific rationalism","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, based upon the strength of the reviews. Unfortunately, after scanning a few chapters, I was absolutely crestfallen. As an apologist and a scientist, I do not appreciate baseless Christian apologetics masquerading as rationalism, whether or not a scientist penned them. Indeed, I found Ross's freewheeling mixture of lobotomized mathematics, misunderstood physics, and elenchic philosophizing to be both superficial and insulting. I should have been forewarned: conspicuously absent from the jacket were any blurbs written by knowledgeable scientists, though religious scholars totally ignorant of science praised the book to the skies.

And of course, the delectable descriptions of food preparation (and mispreparation) would leave any foodie hungry. I really enjoyed the continuation of her loyalty in trying to let us all in on the secrets of what New Orleans is really like beyond the beads and booze. Plus the relationship with G-man and Rickey is really fantastic. It just seems like far too often gay is another character in a book (in addition to the actual physical characters).

This cookbook was used in our household so often, the pages were stained with flour and oil and whatever else was on your hands while you made pecan pie--for thanksgiving, of course!So I was a spoiled kid, and I have this book to thank for part of that.

Not the worst, but considering Kubrick is the director, the expectations automatically grow and by that measure, it is hugely disappointing. From boot camp (which actually is the best part of the film) to Nam, the film never seems to find a correct note. Maybe Kubrick was trying to make a more surreal film about Vietnam, maybe in a way a satire, Im not sure. In any case, it never really works consistently. The subject of Vietnam has produced some of the most haunting films ever, but not in this case. I would put a lot of that blame on the cast. Not once did I believe that any of these characters were real. They came off as second rate actors trying to play soldiers and that is a huge problem with the film.

Also releasing the movie in Mono was a serious mistake. It is recorded in Dolby Stereo and should have been kept that way. Kubrick isn't getting royalties anymore from theatrical releases, so release the real thing.

All in all an excellent movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Metal Synopsis...","review":"In true-to-form Kubrick fashion, here is another graphic, disturbing and wholly controversial film.Think of Vietnam movies, and it's a near certainty that Apocolypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket will spring to mind.Set in two episodes, one in a Texas boot camp, the other in Vietnam the film has little actual plot. It could certainly be argued that the film is disjointed, almost directed on the spot. However, it's compelling.Overall, it's a true depiction of the depravities of war. Whilst not in the same league as Saving Private Ryan, it's bizarre camera angles, unrestrained violence and gore combined with plenty of black humour serves as an intense thought provoker. This film is one which seems to question the very nature of United States involvement within Vietnam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture Quality is Great","review":"I purchased a blu-ray DVD player and this Blu-Ray DVD (Full Metal Jacket) for my husband for Christmas.

I love Kubrick and I love this movie, needless to say I was very disappointed in this DVD translation. I have to say this HD DVD was an extreme letdown for me. This was the first HD DVD I bought, so I was ready to take the player back when I watched it the first time. I even applied a patch to my player and watched it again but that didn't help either. The graininess was almost unbearable for me, very disappointing. Some standard DVDs look as good or better in my opinion. If this is as good as it gets on HD DVD, I see why Blu-ray will win for sure. A decent HD cable channel blows it away for richness of color and definition.

Shows two aspects of army life during times of conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Badtimers","review":"Compare Stanley Kubrick's early masterpiece \\"Paths of Glory\\" with the turgid and vacant \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and you have a pretty clear picture of the magnitude of the director's decline after \\"2001.\\" Apart from some of the worst acting he ever directed, the film is rife with the neurotic obsessions that overcame Kubrick in middle age. He would not, for instance, cross so much a body of water as the English Channel to film at more convenient locations in Spain, but instead inflated his budget by having his idea of Vietnam built on English stages. In the end he was so discouraged by the final product he didn't make another film for 12 years. Anybody wanting a clear idea of what the Vietnam War was all about is going to have to look elsewhere; and if you want to see why Kubrick was once thought to be the best American director of his generation, check any of his films from 1968 backward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Cohesive Narrative. The Best Bit Is The First Half.","review":"I saw this crappy movie just out of curiosity about Vincent D'Onofrio aka Goren in his early days. It's not even worth one viewing. The best part of the movie is the first half, parts of which (I think) are viewable online; and R. Lee Ermey (a real-life soldier in the army) is hilarious as Sergeant Hartmann. I really dislike this movie because it's not a cohesive narrative. There's not one character (except maybe Gomer Pyle) that you can really care about, but even Pyle doesn't get enough screen time. It's just as if there are two parts of an idea assembled in a hurry, and the result is a huge mess. To quote a blurb describing another movie, \\"Scattershot narrative.\\" Worth only one viewing. Not as bad as \\"Scarface\\" (1982), but almost. Rated R."},{"rating":"2","title":"why the hell isn't this widescreen!?!?!","review":"first of all, let me say, that anyone who doesnt like this movie is a complete goddamn moron.

WHAT THE F@#*K?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest war movies of all time!","review":"Although this film has a bit of independent movie flavor, it still ranks as one of the best. Showing both the humorous and distasteful side of the Vietnam conflict I highly recommend it for those who enjoy dramatic and suspenseful themes. It is an altogether dark film, with flashes of hope here and there, and ends with the message that the soldier can be many things yet at the end of the day just wants to be alive. This is not a movie for young people, as it contains scenes of very graphic violence, but this is the realism of war that makes it great. It well captures the individual personalities that represent the men who fought in this conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Metal Jacket","review":"The product was delivered in timely matter and the condition of the DVD was without scratches.

It's just the standard tv size. Which really really is a shame. This really is a great movie too, the standard tv size just doesn't do it justice at all. These Kubrick collection DVDs seem like they were just slapped together with no real thought. Maybe someday this will be available in the far superior letterbox format. Until then, go to your local Blockbuster and rent the VHS version.there is no excuse for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kubrick and the Marines","review":"This movie gets better with age, and it is easier to see Kubrick's genius now then it was when the film was made. Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, senior drill instructor, is a tour de force. Who wrote those unforgettable insults and threats? Where did he learn to swear so colorfully and with such literary panasch? The scene with the jelly donunt is my favorite. Anybody who has played high school football knows how Private Pyle feels when the jelly donut is discovered, and everybody in the platoon (team) knows what the collective punishment will be. The characters and the names or unforgettable: Cowboy, Rafterman, Joker, Eightball, Animal Mother...In my opnion it is the best movie about war and the Marines ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greats","review":"This is one of my husbands favorite movies, so when I saw it on Amazon a month before Christmas, I decided it would be a perfect gift.

Some previous reviews have not been so glowing, but this reviewer suspects that they know not of which they speak. The film is intentionally disjointed as life was during that time for those who served. The film has a rather open and non-resolute ending - as did Vietnam for the United States. The images and camera work is top-notch as well as the tactical essense of the film. Having watched this movie several times, this reviewer believes it to be the most important addition to anyone's film library on the Vietnam War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrowing Kubrickian Look at War!","review":"As with all of Kubrick films this is meticulously crafted to create an effect an to show us the dehumanization of men at war. The film is divided into two equally compelling halves. The first being Marine basic training, R. Lee Ermey is scarier than any Vietnamese could hope to be as the drill sergeant who turns his men into 'killing machines'. The second half (vietnam combat) is also equally intense and memorable. Vincent D'Onofrio is also devastating as a clumsy confused private. Matthew Modine adds a little comic relief to a very heavy film but also creates a fascinating character. But this is Kubrick's achievement, his use of sets, cinematography and sound create a profoundly intense impact. A hell of a war picture. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent movie poorly transfered to DVD","review":"This movie remains one of a kind ( much like that little war in Viet Nam ) and is an excellent work by Kubrick. Serious movie buffs should boycott the film however until the studio wakes up and presents this film in it's original aspect ratio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie but a Stinker of a DVD","review":"I enjoyed this movie, but the DVD was a rush release if I ever saw one. No widescreen and only the center channel is used for sound. What a rip-off. I recommend you rent this before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost my virginity on this one.","review":"Get your mind out of the gutter. It was my first War and/or military theme movie that I saw back in the day. The movie illustrates a man's journey from initiation in the Marine Corp to combat in the Vietnam. The movie takes an entertaining and sobering look at America's Vietnam experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The REAL reason this movie has a following.","review":"Many people who see this movie have no idea why it has a near cult following in the U.S.. In the editorial at the product site I read a comment that said: \\"... he seemed out of touch with the vouge...made people wonder why he even made this film...\\" True the movie didn't havce much pop-culture apeal, but it does have the loyalist constituancy any movie could ever have, the U.S. Marine Corps. Marines generally love this movie. It is one of the most true to life depictions of what we go through in boot-camp that has ever been put to screen. In the movie we all see at least a few scenes of boot-camp life we ourselves experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Buying (again)","review":"If you're a fan of this film like me and had bought the Blu-Ray or HD-DVD before and thought \\"This is hi-def?\\", then you're in for a treat. This newly remastered version has a sharper picture and better color image and new commentaries to boot. While not as stunning a transfer as \\"The Shining\\" or \\"2001\\", this is still a much improved re-release. Trade in your old copy and purchase with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst transfer ever?","review":"Full Metal Jacket is one of the all time American movie classics. I have wanted a copy on Blu-ray forever, so imagine my total let down when I played this for the first time and found my copy has the worst sound levels you can imagine. The picture is super crisp and without flaw but I had to run the volume up to 70 just to hear the dialog. All those years wasted waiting for the best quality and the copy I have had for 10 years is still better to watch. I do hope that mine is an isolated copy because this classic deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic one-liners!

Lee Ermey provides a stunning performance as a drill instructor (he served in the Marines at one time). The Vietnam sequence is a generally accurate depiction of Hue with some impressive combat scenes. Overall a deep insight into what young men must have dealt with during the Vietnam War. Viewers will either love it or hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wide Screen Less","review":"One of the best movies of it's kind. One problem.......the 1:85 aspect ratio has been ignored. Why??

I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Widescreen is cropped version of Full Screen version","review":"I bought the Blu-ray version of Full Metal Jacket thinking this would be a true widescreen version, but it's not. The movie is actually a cropped version of the Full Screen version. After comparing the two versions, the Blu-ray version seems cramped and lacks the visual composition of the original Full Screen version.This rating has nothing to do with the quality of the story or the audio, which is excellent.The rating has everything to do with releasing this movie as a Widescreen version of the movie. If you want to see what you are missing, buy the original DVD version instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Deluxe Edition","review":"This has gone down as one of the WORST blu ray transfers to date. The Deluxe Edition is still not on par with the PQ of the Shining or 2001, but it looks HD. This version is a joke. You might as well watch the standard DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too overrated","review":"I dont see how anyone could think this is a good war movie much less the best ever made. I tend to agree with the other reviewers who say this is a mess. The bathroom scene with Gomer Pyle is totally overacted and could have been done a lot better. This movie never really pulls you in and when you're finished watching it you just feel like you saw a bunch of scenes from boot camp and war that were just kind of put together. I think Saving Private Ryan, Platoon and Black Hawk Down were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The low rating is not for the movie itself...","review":"...Since I think it's one of the most powerful war movies ever made. I saw it in the theatre when I was 8, and the boot camp sequence stuck with me. The reason I'm giving this 1 star is, why is there no release of the Deluxe edition on standard DVD? Is there some research that suggests that people don't buy standard DVDs any more? I spent hundreds of dollars replacing my VHS collection with DVDs- I'm not about to do the same thing with HD-DVD. Warner Bros, you owe your customers more than this.*Update, 3/4/08- With the recent developments in the market (Sony going with Blu-Ray and Toshiba saying they will stop making HD-DVDs), this particular product is even more irrelevant than when I first wrote the review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"First time I watch this movie was with my husband.

Very interesting..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype; subpar movie about Vietnam","review":"I saw this movie in the theatre years ago and could not believe all the hype about it back then, and neither should you now if you are considering buying this DVD. What blew it for me in this movie was the awful acting. In the battle scenes it seemed to me like the \\"soldiers\\" had just come out of their air-conditioned trailers. They acted very punky. They did not seem like they were on the front lines at all. Compare those scenes with, really, any scene at all in Platoon, and you'll see what I mean. Besides that, the movie is over-directed. Kubrick sometimes fell prey to his own sensibilities, and his bad sensibilities are all over this movie. It just didn't need to be done. I mean, this movie didn't need to be done. At all. 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible video quality for an HD DVD!","review":"Although I enjoyed seeing the training part of this move (my brother recently went through it and became a Marine), the movie does end up feeling un-American and un-Patriotic. But this is not a surprise, since when does Holly Wood create anything positive about the nation that gives it the freedom to create boring unpatriotic movies.The main reason I took time to right this review is to warn everyone that the video quality is truly horrible for an HD DVD. If you like this movie for its story or for some other reason, maybe you should just get the DVD. This HD DVD is definitely not one you would want to show someone if your trying to convince them to upgrade to HD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been nice...","review":"If this HD DVD would have worked, but it didn't, Maybe it was one a in a million difective disc, Nuff Said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Metal Jacket DVD","review":"Got this in only a few days.

Was everything it said it would be. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of two sides","review":"The only reason I enjoyed this film was based on the horrifying bootcamp led by R. Lee Ermey, or basically the first half. I'm surprised that Lee Ermey has never been acknowledged for his acting ability, because he is a truly talent, and can portray other roles besides drill instructor. The second half of this film is very tedious and boring, but I had to give this film four stars just because of Lee Ermey's memorable performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jelly Donought?!?!?!?!","review":"Like everyone else, I enjoy the first half of this movie over and over and over. It is by the far the greatest 'boot camp' sequence ever filmed by Hollywood. Ermy will have you howling with laughter at every profanity infested tyrade. You can hwatch the boot camp 'mini movie' all by itself and never tire of it.The second half has it's moments, but fails tragicly in comparison to the first half.

I find this movie to be entertaining each time I watch it, except for the mass grave speech. (What is with that guys meaningless speech and annoying voice?) I have yet to see a scene that hits as hard as the bootcamp finale.If you miss the 1980's when Vietnam movies were the top draws you can relive them with this one.

(Except for one scene including a high voiced annoying superior downtalking to the young journalist above a grave. Talk about an uninspiring speech!) I have to leave the room durring this scene each time i hear that mans voice. My highest criticism is simple though: Why no letterbox? I have DVD mostly because I can see movies the way they were made to be seen. Without letterbox this movie is still going to lack its theatrical power that I remember. I urge the makers to look at releasing this film in the correct format. Without letterbox this movie is not worth purchase. I just assume wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best war movie ever BUT DON'T BUY THIS DVD!","review":"Wait for Warner to wake up and issue a widescreen version. It's hard to believe Warner still gets away with its sleazy practices.With the exception of a few 'special films\\" (like Dr. Zhivago), Warner consistently delivers the absolute LEAST they can get away with: A handful of chapter selections, lousy transfer quality, (...), a dearth of extra material (often none at all), and most annoying: full-screen only format (which loses about a third of the picture).I sometimes buy these Warner rip-offs accidentally.

Boy was I wrong. The quality of this DVD is quite possibly worse than the video tape. The sound is only in 2.0 so you don't get anything new there and the only extra you get is a 30 second trailer. Definately stay away from this one if you have the video tape already, it's not worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Kubricks Full Metal Jacket deserves it place alongside 'The Deer Hunter', 'Platoon' and 'Apocalypse Now' as the definitive Vietnam war movies.FMJ is split into two distinct halfs, training and battle. This is unusual in a film, as the standard rule when writing a story is to have a beginning, a middle and an end. Obviously there are always exceptions, and in this case it works because the two part story reflects the grim reality of war. In truth if you can't survive the training there probably isn't much hope for you at war.The performances are uniformly excellent. More importantly the ending is really quite shocking. If you have seen Dr Strangelove you will realise that this probably reflected Kubricks own view on war. Watching the film again twenty years later, and baring in mind the problems in Iraq and Afganistan it does make you think.A great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stanley Kubrick USMC","review":"Full metal jacket is a bright loud well made well acted brilliant look at the Vietnam war.

It's not that it's a bad movie, it just leaves you feeling a bit empty afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, weak","review":"I watched Full Metal Jacket after watching Platoon and Apocalypse Now.

It's a sobering look into basic training for the Marines, with a gunnery Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermy) whose drill instructor are not too far behind him. The insults and barking orders rolls off his tongue like second nature. This film is really quite a classic among 20-45 males. It's funny at times when it probably shouldn't be. You kind of start laughing until you realize just exactly what is going on. The Marine Drill Sargeant Hartman tears these young privates into pieces and builds them up the Marine Way... except for one private, private Pyle (Vincent Deoferno) who is transformed in a way no drill sergeant wants to see. The movie has a lot of unnecessary shock factor seems in it. Much of it seems like a lot of scenes with no direction, but for some reason you want to see it over and over.

But, Full Metal Jacket blows it away. Completely. It's a more believeable movie for one. Second, much like another great war movie, All Quiet on the Western Front, it takes us on a journey with these young solders. We see them as kids, and then as full-fledged killers. The story arch is quite incredible. And it doesn't have some dumb Hollywood ending like Platoon had. The horrors of Vietnam are fully realized, and it didn't take a 1000 special effects to do it. Solid acting, and a great script was all it took. Oliver Stone, give your Oscar to Kubrick, he outdid you bigtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best war films ever made by one of the best directors of the 20th century","review":"Simply one of the best war movies ever. Saving Private Ryan is great, Platoon, Little Big Man, Hamburger Hill are great, yes and Go Tell the Spartans, Apocalypse Now and Soldier Blue are a slap in the face, but this is honest and brutal like no other war film. No John Wayne bs; this one hits home...Not anti or pro war, just a statement, really of war, and how it affects those who are caught up in it. The acting, production, direction and filming is all classic Kubrick and really great! I'm replacing my DVD copy with this blu ray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Video, Disappointing Audio","review":"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The picture was 1.85:1 (or something close to that), and completely filled my widescreen LCD. I would rather of had 2.40:1.Video quality was very good to great. I only saw grain on one scene. I give it a 9.0 out of 10. Very good for a movie this old.Audio quality was disappointing. It was only Dolby Digital 5.1, and there were hardly any surround sounds, if any. The sound came from the fronts and center. I don't recall any sub-woofer bass, but I could be mistaken on that.Overall, a good Blu-Ray purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flick","review":"Kubrick's \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is a classic film of the war genre and what can be said about Lee Ermey?

Before his death, Kubrick personally oversaw the creation of these DVDs; every detail down to the typefaces used on the packaging was Kubricks choice (Research has led me to believe this is true, though I cannot confirm it in any way). Due to the advent of the VCR and Kubricks disdain for Pan&Scan, The Shining (and later FMJ) were actually filmed \\"Full Frame\\" by Kubrick, and later matted for theatrical release to avoid Pan & Scan butchery by the movie studios. That is why these two DVDs are Full Frame. We will see the films as Kubric intended them. True, I prefer the shape of widescreen; it is more \\"stable\\" and pleasant, compared to 1:1.33, but I'd rather follw the masters orders..."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST TRUE TO LIFE MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER I MEAN EVER SEEN.

It portrays the horrors of what you must endure to become a soldier, and the sergent has a dark humor to him that most people find funny. From the shooting of the sarge to the killing of the vietnamese girl the film is all drama, very powerful moments when they are getting plucked off by the sniper, and when they finally kill her it makes the mood even more powerful, as you witness the horror of war. Great film making through and through...Kubrick rulez!"},{"rating":"2","title":"me love this movie a long time","review":"Platoon is probably the best war movie ever but this one comes pretty close. The boot camp sequence in the beginning with Lee Ermy as the sergeant is priceless. The treatment and language used on the recruits is harsh and unbearable. You 're happy that it's not you going through this hell. When we are transported to Vietnam you sense relief for the soldiers that appear to be under less pressure here then at boot camp. There's even comedy relief that Kubrick allows in this midst of chaos. I love the way Kubrick uses the sniper in this movie. If you haven't seen the movie I won't give up the identity of the sniper but it was a nice surprise. I agree that it doesn't depict the Vietnam war as well as some other movies but it doesn't try to be a documentary. The purpose of a movie and with all of Kubrick's work is to entertain the audience. If you want reality watch the news. As with most of Kubrick's work this one was again overlooked at the acadmeny awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full MMetal JAcket","review":"Full Metal Jacket presents some very real looking scenes.

Great characters. I'd really like to see it available in a widescreen anamorphic format. It's much too intense for just the standard version!

For those who haven't seen the show, just look at her picture on the box; she looks like a woman wearing a hat that belongs somewhere, anywhere, else. It's like a pimple on cheese.

Archie, the man responsible for bringing the boy to see Wolfe in a fit of pique, is deeply troubled and forces Wolfe to pursue the matter. THE GOLDEN SPIDERS touches home with this beginning, but sadly loses focus with a more traditional approach when other elements enter the story. Even though the case is solved, it always struck me as irritating that the boy's mother who is used so well by Stout earlier in the story, is totally ignored by its end. I always found this emotional distance a bit off-putting about this book; it's almost like Stout was afraid of allowing his characters more than one human moment. For this reason this is one of my least favorite of the Wolfe series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of the Nero Wolfe series.","review":"This book is a bit of a departure for the Nero Wolfe series. Usually these are character driven books-there can be a distinct lack of action in what is admittedly a more cerebral series than is the norm in this genre. However, this book features a very complex plot with a multitude of characters and lots of actions. And, while character may indeed take a rare second place to plot, the fact is the characters are all nevertheless well developed and intriguing in their own right, so nothing is lost on that score.Moreover, it is a genuine classic Nero Wolfe story in that the interplay between Wolfe and his intrepid assistant-Archie Goodwin is as good as it gets in the series. The story also makes use of the full ledger of periodic regulars to the series, another plus.All in all it adds up to a great story and one of the best books in this large series of work.A great read from a great series. If you like Wolfe, you MUST read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tragedy of Bataan","review":"Good DVD with brief interspersed comments from a number of the Bataan Death March survivors. Excellent film footage of the March from both the U.S. and Japanese which I have not seen before. My dad was at Bataan and I found it very interesting, and suggest other's who had family members go through this ordeal to get a copy - especially for the grandchildren to see what their grandparents went through to give all of us the lifestyle's we enjoy today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The True Story of the Bataan Death March","review":"This is an excellent documentary on the American and Philippine defenders who resisted the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in World war II. Tragically ... shamefully, for months they fought heroically without reinforcements or supplies due to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's \\"Europe First\\" policy. He even ordered General Douglas MacArthur to escape to Australia while Major General Edward P. King \\"surrendered\\" the 75,000 Americans to the Japanese. It's after this surrender that the heart wrenching \\"Death March\\" took place. The sacrifice and suffering these men endured is told in bold detail through film footage and first-person accounts from fifteen survivors. This DVD is a \\"must have\\" for any WWII history buff. I rated it 4 stars only because it should have been an hour long instead of 30 minutes. Today it seems everyone in the armed services is called a \\"hero.\\" This film introduces you to real Heroes in every sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was skeptical at first, now I'm Impressed","review":"I decided to buy WHITE LIES after reading a number of really good reviews of it (notwithstanding the weird Kirkus review above that seems to have little to do with the actual book). At first I was skeptical. Just another book, by a white guy no less, on race. Just another guilt trip, I thought. As I started to read the book, I began questioning many of my assumptions and attitudes about race. The book took me on a journey, a journey through fragments of feelings, and ideas, and memoir that I could relate to and that really made me rethink every attitude I have about race, about black people, about my personal relationships with the people I live and work with. This journey was not always easy. Berger's writing can be demanding and even disturbing; but it is also elegant.This book is not just another white guy's self-rightious argument about race. It is gentle call to self-examination that is truly worth reading and pondering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confrontational, Provacative, and Inciteful","review":"At first, I just picked up the book to skim through it, and all of a sudden i find myself reading through chapter after chapter- it completely sucked me in.

It's a compelling book that I would recommend to anyone of any nationality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"It's nice story filled with charming characters and funny moments.

This Taiwan-Copy of \\"Balls of Fire\\" is first rate quality, picture and sound and anything you can wish for in a remastered DVD. If you want THIS movie, get it at it's low price. If you are a snob or real freak, get it at its \\"English Original\\" price. If you don't know what I'm talking about, get something else. Well, I prefer the remake with Danny Kaye to this first Howard Hawks-movie, but then I prefer American Jazz to dated American slang. Gary Cooper against Danny Kaye? impossible to chose. \\"Ball of Fire\\" has more bite, \\"A Song is Born\\" too much schmalz, but then there is the music and Danny Kaye.I have both of them, on DVD and VHS. Best of two worlds."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the movie - hate this transfer","review":"As this is the only way you can get this movie right now- there's nothing for it. Please be aware though that the framing on this release is COMPLETELY messed up. People's heads getting chopped off and such. I am familiar with this movie as I have a Criterion Laserdisc release from many years ago (LD player starting to die, so I wanted a replacement). If you are familiar with Criterion, you know that their releases are always respectful of the film. This version was not. If you have no other way to see this film, I highly recommend it. Otherwise, hope for another release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooper and Stanwyck star in old-fashioned romance.","review":"This brilliant vehicle for Gary Cooper is the movie that made me fall in love with him. He's at his gentlest most out-of-touch-with-the-real-world best here. Paired with Barbara Stanwyck, the prototypical hard luck gal with a heart of gold, this is one of those rare sentimental movies that invites you to join in the fun without insulting your intelligence. There are some eminently memorable lines as well as some great shots of Stanwyck as a nightclub singer. Book knowledge meets street savvy in this sweet romance. It's an old-fashioned movie, in the best sense of the phrase-- although it does have a car chase of sorts too. Don't miss the brilliant lighting on Stanwyck's eyes in the motel, near the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for a bare-bones DVD","review":"Terrific film, but a $20 retail price for a DVD with absolutely no extra features?

As much as I love Barbara Stanwyck, this film just didn't age very well given its preoccupation with outdated American slang and the barely credible(even for the movies) \\"love-story\\" between Stanwyck and Cooper.

Often when I tried to buy boxers at the local stores the styles and sizes were very limited and it seemed like I could never find the right size. That may be because I am a pretty standard men's large and maybe those sell out quickly; I don't know.

I will definitely recommend this product to other friends and I will buy more of it before Christmas. I only wished that the money that I paid for it was less than you could get it at a store.

I remember in the end Snow Deer comes to live with her father and his white wife. So why the heck would Snow Deer father get upset that she loves a white man when he loves a white woman? Cassie Edwards romanticizes Native American culture so much that she makes her great great-grandfather a chief and her great grandmother a princess. Give me a break. She could've kept this story.

The strange thing is I learned NOTHING about South Africa, living conditions for whites and blacks in South Africa, and the effect that apartheid had on people in living in South Africa. This book was written in a hoity-toity, avant garde, stream of conciousness fashion that it was impossible to know what was going on.

I quickly found out that Sony's quality has apparently taken a severe backslide. As other reviewers have mentioned, my changer would power down after 1-20 minutes of playing music cds. This progressively got worse, extending to the dvd functions. The last straw was when it shut down twice during 1 movie. The DVD function was horrible, in the 16 months I owned it, I was not able to watch a single rented movie on it without it getting hung up.

Boy was I disappointed. The picture quality was good, the sound was terrible and 7 months after I purchased it the carousel stopped working. I would put in a DVD and the machine would not register it was there. When I picked up the machine I could hear parts moving around in it. The sound was so terrible I would have to turn the volumn all the way up on my Sony TV just to barely hear the movie. When I called Sony about it they told me I would have to pay for all repairs.

It's completely random, meaning it could play through a cd perfectly fine, and then the next time, shut off halfway through the cd. Theses cds are new and not scratched. Also, DVDs skip, even when no scratches exist. As other opinions state, I too have had good luck with Sony in the past which is why I purchased this model.

I had a Sony 5-disk CD hanger that I bought in 1994 that worked like a champ (I gave it to my folks), so I was initially excited about the gift. It almost immediately started with problems, mainly on 'track shuffle' it would shut itself OFF after about 20 minutes of play. Now it will shut off periodically when just playing a single CD. It also struggles with some DVD's to just keep up - often 'freezing' the video out while the drive churns through the disk to retrieve the data. This isn't just with rental disks - it happens with new disks as well. Sony customer service told me to \\"unplug it for 1 minute\\" to reset the memory, and a factory service under warranty did not resolve the issue. As a loyal Sony customer (I have a STR-D560Z receiver), I am more than disapointed in how things turned out.

It was great and very easy to hook up. It worked great. However, after a year the CD player will play a music CD for about 30 mins and the whole system will then just power off by itself. The warranty expired, and now Sony wants me to pay a min of [$$$] to fix. Unbelieveable! Would I purchase another Sony CD player, probably not for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound!","review":"...The picture quality and the 5-disc changer are great. However, the sound is pathetic. I own a quality 54\\" big screen with great speakers, but I have to turn the volume up full blast just to hear CD music or the voice dialogue from a DVD. What a disappointment. It may work better with a 5.1 receiver, but I don't think I will keep it long enough to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"In for second repair","review":"The unit I bought began freezing and pausing during DVD and skipping during CD play after the 30 day trial period. I sent it back to Sony repair center and they tagged a different problem (jittery picture) which they claimed they fixed. When I got the unit back, the original problem was still there along with a new problem, jittery picture. While I await it's repairs once more, I have read several other reviews from Sound and Vision readers and Audio Review to see that my problem is not unique. Others have reported the same problems. There is some serious defects or flaws in this unit making me wish I never bought it. That said, I do like all the features if I can just get a unit that doesn't fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product starts failing after 1 year (warranty period....)","review":"There is nothing worse than a product that starts failing just after the 1 year warranty period. Problem is skipping and stopping in the middle of CD's and DVD's. I started happening only occasionally and I thought it might be dirty disks - but soon realized that it occured on new disks and worse - it starts happening more and more frequently. From all the other reviews I see that I am not alone and this must be a reliablity problem with at least this Sony DVD player. At this point, I am checking to see if there is anything I can do to fix this thing cheaply but most likely this 1 1/2 year old DVD player is heading to the dump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Sound but LOUD Power On","review":"I agree with everyone that says the unit has decent sound. That aside, the real positive is the price because it has a couple annoying issues that I hoped were unique to mine but I found out later I wasn't alone. Okay, the problem, the unit does not remember your last volume setting so when you turn it on, it's start out very loud. Also, the speaker pops occasionally. A-L suggested I lower the line output of my receiver to minimize the volume issue but that's a lame solution. As for the popping, the instructions tell you to turn on the XM receiver or mp3 player first to minimize the problem but it's not totally effective. Word is from A-L that the popping occurs at the end and start of songs. In summary, all I can say is, I'm glad it was expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Altec Lansing","review":"Altec Lansing has decent prices but the products are shoddily made.

Calvin Klein consistently makes all their clothing and apparel for a more slender cut. I know because I'm big guy and can't wear most of their stuff. That's why these Calvin Klein's perplex me. For some reason they are a perfect fix in the body of briefs but the waist band is REALLY loose. I don't mean that it falls down. It stays against the skin. It just seems like a much much looser elastic. Like I said, I fit great in the briefs but I could fix two of me in the elastic.

I strongly recommend GAP or H&M or even JOCKEY instead. They are more expensive but they are on the money, 7 of those boxerbriefs/briefs and you are good to go. If you are buying Calvin Klein underwear please know that these 3-in-1 briefs (H&M 3 in 1's though are gorgeous) are not of the same quality as the other brands I have mentioned.

Early chapters are weak. The later ones usefully overview the possible integration levels (database, method level, user interface, etc.), what the tools and aproaches do, and their relative strengths and weaknesses. Very few examples are used and there are no case studies. There are no guidelines or framework of how to plan and select the best EAI approach. Occasionally obscure terms and concepts are used without explanation and the content is never related to a real project situation. The addition of guidelines, EAI selection criteria, real case studies and of short, pithy product reviews would help considerably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very outdated, lacks substance","review":"I found the material on this book to be very outdated and the coverage of the topic is very shallow.

The book aim either at high-level managers to give them an introduction of what EAI is or at students who don't know anything about EAI. It is full of lot of abstract concepts without any implementation plan or idea. Most of tech described are out of date.I think a good book talking about EAI at least should have a chapter to compare all possible integration ways and should give readers their pros and cons. Also a good should talk about EAI vendors, such as IBM, Vitria, WebMethod, etc. What they really did, how they did, what we should concern today.

The middle section contains about 100 pages of obvious filler, consisting of descriptions and histories of several companies in which Mr. Lanyi's clients have supposedly invested. The author's attempts at humour are mostly shopworn cliches that grow tedious by the third or fourth chapter.

My advice, don't take the bait; life is too short and time is too valuable. \\"Confessions\\" contains little of value for either the novice or experienced investor.

Anyone who has spent a minimal amount of time studying the market knows this is highly unrealistic. Lanyi must think his readers are either suckers or fools. I can only assume he has something on the publisher and/or editor to get them to back this vanity project.

The CD is applaudable alone for their talent and catchy music, but just as admirable is the message they send through their music. The themes of hope, faith, love, and truly knowing God make this CD all the more special. Each of the ten tracks on the CD are fun and extremely entertaining. \\"Spinnin' Around\\", the album's first track, sets a good tone for the album and other highlights include the catchy and inspiring \\"Change a Heart, Change a World\\", the sweet and compassionate \\"Wish That I Could Read You're Mind\\", and the enjoyable and peppy \\"Tell Me Why\\" just to name a few. The CD also features two extra tracks: the infectious \\"Start Jumpin\\" and a beautiful remake of \\"God Bless the U.S.A.\\" This is defiantly at CD worth picking up and would recommend this to anyone looking for some truly good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom loves it too!","review":"I am the mother of two children age 6 and 10!

HAPPENED","review":"Well, I used to be a huge ST fan when i was younger, for about 11 years... but this album is just sad, I mean suicidal tendencies has always been heavy aggresive music in whatever they do, thrash/punk, but this is just [unacceptable]... there old punk was special, unique, there metal music opened bigger oppertunities and wider audiances, i remember how much i enjoyed Rockys solos, and the heavy agressive fast music, with mike muirs voclas, which would open my eyes and hit me, with such meaning and how special there music was..... i thaught if they got back together, the band would do what they do best...carry on ST they it's meant to be, heavy, agressive, powerful, the things which got them recognized and caught everyones attention in the first place, however, this album is a joke.....(MIKE MUIR, WHAT ... WERE YOU THINKING) IG is it's own thing, this is supposed to SUICIDAL TENDENCIES, my suggestions:(EITHER STOP THE BAND NOW, OR MOVE IT IN THE DIRECTION IT's SUPPOSED TO BE IN)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"This cd is awful. It's not like their early stuff like some people say. It doesn't sound like the self titled or Join the Army. It is mostly boring punk-inspired rock with sprinkles of funk and gut-wrenchingly embarrassing lyrics. It's not even punk rock because the music mostly plays it safe by intentionally staying well within the confines of the pubk style of the late 90s. There is no inspiration to be found here. Mike Clark is completely underused here. Dean Pleasants is underused. The drummer and bass player get to shine on this album which is really the only redeeming quality. Terrible, terrible cd.

Dr. Joseph's prose is beautiful, and her portrayals of the characters are acute and heartbreakingly sad sometimes. This book is about how we try in the end to look for love and belonging, whether this is with a lover, friends, parents, children, or our siblings. What makes the books so wonderful is that the author very successful tells the story of each person's lives in their own perspectives, without confusing the voices. After the book, I really felt like I walked for a day in the shoes of Marcy, Sidra, Paul, Kent, Curtis, and the many others. Her characters are not always likeable, and you may not want to meet them in real life. However, you are glad you know where they came from and how they came to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, engrossing literary fiction","review":"Compelling and enjoyable, this novel lends credible voices to the adolescent-to-twentysomething characters that, in various examples of contemporary literary fiction, often sound contrived to me. The chorus of narrators employed by the author to relate the stories of protagonists Curtis, Sidra, and Paul sometimes distracts from the plot--a few too many points of view make things unnecessarily complicated here. But the complexity of Joseph's characterizations more than makes up for this. Her sketch of gay teenager Paul is especially sympathetic, without being condescending or cheesy. I found the story smart, relatively straightforward--even with the non-linear narration--and ultimately well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Ok","review":"This book is a little strange!

The DTS sound is not any fuller or crisper than the original fullscreen DVD, merely converted to DTS format. In short, this DVD is not worth upgrading to, and the fullscreen side is the only one worth watching. Save your money if you hope to improve on the original DVD's quality - the new anniversary DVD is actually an insult."},{"rating":"2","title":"It surprised me","review":"I'm not a fan of animation, not unless it has \\"Disney\\" in the title, but I ended up watching this on the late show one night.

I loved it so much the following day I went in search of it for purchase. Well worth it, I've lent it to other non-anime fans and they've loved it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another example of DVD editing.","review":"Yet again we have an excellent film (definitely among the best of all anime films) that has suffered at the hands of DVD editors. What makes the editing even more bizarre is that the scenes removed (I checked each omission against the full, VHS version)were neither gratuitous nor explicit, almost as if the scenes were cut for 'running time' reasons! There should be a law against releasing films without a warning about the cuts. Afterall, as soon as even a single minute of footage is removed post-release, it is no longer the original film, whether it be for censorship, running-time, director's cut or whatever. Get the VHS version, and ignore this DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Includes full screen print and updated audio...","review":"Hi, the person whom wrote the buyer beware review is a bit misleading...this print of the 10th Anniversary Edition also includes a full screen print (which is better I might add) then the cropped and often grainy widescreen conversion (which I do agree with the other post on being poor). However the updated and remixed/mastered audio tracks are worth this upgrade and truly make the difference in editions. I would opt for this one, although the specials/extras are a bit short, this is usually the case with most Manga series releases, although with that being said, the remastered picture quality in full screen and the Japanese 6.1 Track is well worth this edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT","review":"WOW ninja scroll was so GREAT to watch...excellent in everything..i wish they would do part 2!the charecters were so good...so imaginary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most entertaining anime I have ever watched!","review":"I have not seen much anime but this one is definitely very entertaining. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MANGA FILM EVER!!!!

Unfortunately, not many of us are fourteen years old anymore.If this is indeed a \\"peak achievement of Japanese anime\\" you can keep it. For those of us spoiled by classic western animation this could be a big disappointment - only the lips moves when a character speaks, static images are panned and scanned by the animators (or brought forward rapidly if the character is supposed to be running towards the camera), cels sequences are repeated over and over (a scene of a river filled with dead fish uses this trick - the same fish, in the same relation to the others, are repeated rather than freshly drawn.) On the other hand, there's a nice use of color in NINJA SCROLL and some of the fight scenes are very well rendered.Still, being mildly impressed with a scene or two doesn't make a movie recommendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated","review":"Having seen some animes and enjoyed them, I was casting around for some good animes to purchase.

Well, yes. But it's weak. Mostly there are just random fight scenes. Now, the fight scenes aren't bad, but there really needs to be more than fight scenes to make a good movie. And I don't understand why they decided to have blood spray from every wound as though someone had opened a fire hydrant.Ninja Scroll does have some cool parts, but it's mostly a weak plot full of mindless violence with some random sex thrown in.

Yeah sounds awesome, but wait until you hear what comes next to judge the movie yet. The man takes a young girl back to a temple, and rapes her, that's right, rapes her. It is completly disgusting. I hoped that it was just one scene, there wouldn't be anything else like it. I fast forwarded to the next scene, yet another sex scene. This was the most disgusting anime i have ever seen in my life. Why it is so popular is beyond me, I cannot believe people are actually applauding a movie as shallow as this.

Before viewing it, I was warned that it was ultra violent but even that didn't prepare me for what was to come. This is without a doubt the most violent cartoon I've ever seen, and that can either be a good thing or a bad thing. Blood sprays accompany nearly every action sequence. However, I found the action sequences to be rather well done, and they were my favorite part of the film. Besides that, there isn't really much here as much of the other material is garbage.

THe scenes help to show that even though Kigaro is this tough femal ninja, she is suseptable to everything a female is. It proves that no matter how hard she tries, she is still a female, essentially she is a tom boy, not a very big one, bu one non the less. The whole film seems to move toward her coming to grips with what she truly is and the whole plot involving Jubei and his long lost villain is secondary. The movies is about a woman coming to realize that she cannot be what she is attempting to be. It shows us how a person can only be what they already are or what they are destined to be.

Expect buckets of blood, including gruesome scenes of a monster drinking blood from a bleeding man. Expect language, lots of it. Expect nudity, and not just a little, but even a couple rape scenes along with the nude and sex scenes.

If you are faint of heart of stomach, or have a weak constitution all around, and haven't seen this movie, it is best that you keep it that way. ... this movie still stands as one of the most violent OAV to ever come out of Japan.

This movie is violent as all get out, and that's fine, so were flicks like Vampire Hunter D: Blood Lust and Sin City, and they were still able to tell a compelling, engaging and original story.

I could not stand to watch the female lead get herself raped almost every 20 minutes!! Also, the violence is pointless. One of the few things that I like is that the English voice actors didn't drive me nuts. And there is some depth when the main characters confront each other about their feelings.

By the time I figured out what this movie was even about I grew so disgusted with all of the character's I didn't really care who won.Wonderful artwork is this film's only redeeming quality.

The plot is intricate and exciting, with flawless action scenes, incredible animation, memorable characters, and an storyline that will bring out the strongest of your emotions.

Since then, the mind has matured in the way of anime, and this one is still near the top.

The 1:33 to 1 ratio murders this DVD as I buy DVD primarily for a movie's true aspect ratio. I want the full picture. Also, the English 5.1 soundtrack is very nice, where's the Japanese 5.1? I prefer watching Japanese movies in Japanese, I don't mind subtitles at all but I really enjoy 5.1 (I didn't spend all that money on a nice system for nothing.) Anyhow, other than the better picture quality and the English 5.1, there's not too much difference between the DVD version and the VHS version.

To those narrow minded people who were \\"appauled\\" by the sex and violence let me ask you this, why did you buy this movie? Did the concept of a violent ninja movie seem like that much of a shock? They must think that back in the Edo age of japan all people did was throw little magic balls at each other and have cute little animals come out and fight until one got a little hurt!For those who are thinking of buying this movie I say buy it this was a movie that for me and many other fans was a steooing stone to becoming a TRUE anime fan.Five stars for the Movie, in any format you can get your hands on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The apex of Sword & Sorcery anime","review":"This is the best Sword & Sorcery anime ever made (and, imho, the best anime period).

He meets some small old guy, who poisons him. And he later counter-acts this poison with poison? WTF? The plot is asinine, the action is ridiculously stupid, and its ridden with unnecesary sex scences. I would reccomend to stay away from this, and if you already have bought it, burn it. If you've already seen it, cut your eyes out and destroy them. I would prefer many other anime's, like Ruroni Kenshin.

And I was warned against the sex and violence, neither of which I'm squeamish about--and I'm a HUGE anime fan, I rarely find an anime I dislike--but I really didn't enjoy Ninja Scroll. I was excpecting something great and found something mediocre. Yeah, it was okay to watch once, and I guess we all have to do it, but it's not something that I'll watch over and over and over again like Utena. In a word, it was dissapointing. The villans were creepy, yes, Jubei kicked butt, yes, but the yoda dude made it seem cliche, and I always dislike one dimensional villans. I dunno.

Without it, at best it's a 2-star book.It will be the first book I return to Amazon.Don't bother to order this one -- wait until the publisher \\"splurges\\" on color photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Indeed","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but unfortunately it was very disappointing. The \\"After\\" photographs all tend to look like waiting rooms and the photography within the book is quite amateurish, as was pointed out by other reviewers. And the author dictates far too many hard and fast \\"rules\\" to the reader without real regard to logic or personal taste. With few exceptions, the redone rooms lack life or personal style - most are rather sterile and uninviting. The main focus of the book is on living rooms, a technique which grows tedious quickly. Allover, a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary ideas that are badly executed","review":"I can only assume this book has sold on-line because people cannot see it first. The ideas are basic and not creative, but the worst part is that the after shots are dreary and not well done at all. Pick up a good home magazine or decorating book instead of this one. You would not want your home to look like these pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use What You Have","review":"This is a good book for people who have no experience or formal training with decorating. I found the top 10 tips for avoiding design disaster to be helpful and easy to understand. The pictures in the book are very outdated, but made me feel like I might have a fighting chance with my own space."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very unattractive book","review":"This is a very unattractive book. The photos look more like bad snapshots of boring, cold rooms. Totally uninspiring. As a homeowner and a designer, I like the idea of working with what I already have, but many decorating books help me do that while also showing me beautiful yet believable photos of rooms. I am always tweaking what I already have, and my favorite decorating book remains The New Decorating Book. Another favorite is Flea Market Decorating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was hoping for help in redoing my livingroom but found that this book doesn't take into account that you may have a television in your living room. Seems like it was geared to much more expensive homes than my level."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book seems a little amateurish. . .","review":"This book does help one view a home's design more objectively, however Laurie Ward does throw a few too many \\"musts\\" and other rules around. Her designs are indeed uncluttered and often reflect a marked improvement over the \\"before\\" photos. However, many of her \\"after\\" photos are lacking in real warmth and personality. I believe this book to be helpful to those who are just starting out and need rules-oriented \\"hand holding,\\" but would not recommend Use What You Have Decorating to those who wish their homes to be rich with texture, personality and comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk","review":"The worst decorating book I have ever read...do the things suggested here and your house will have no personality or pizazz!

I reallyexpected a lot of colorful photos of taking some common items andusing them and re-arranging them in a stylish way. This book hasno photos what so-ever. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I found this book to be a huge disappointment and a complete waste of my money. It is a book that does nothing but gives you ideas about how to rearrange your furniture, which I think anyone who has any sense can figure out how to do without buying this book. I was hoping for a book that would teach me how to spruce up my old couch, give me ideas for painting old furniture, give me suggestions for slipcovers, something like what I get from the TV show \\"Trading Spaces.\\" Instead, I got a lot of pictures of rooms that looked really ugly before the furniture was rearranged and looked only slightly less ugly afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"Lauri tells you to NOT use doilies.

We moved out of state and were starting with lots of odd pieces of furntiure. This helped us with design fundamentals by giving concrete ideas and no-nos. Lots of these types books give photos of cool rooms but no real explanation of why it works. She spells it out for you. I would buy this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful","review":"This book was a big disappointment.

If you want a boring room, follow the advice in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to arrange your couch and loveseat","review":"This book was a huge dissapointment. Every single layout was the same.

I have seriously learned more from one or two hgtv programs about redesign and makeovers than I did reading every word and studying photo in this ininviting, uninstructional book. This is the worst book buying decision I have made in more than a decade. I wish I could get my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointment...","review":"I ordered two books to read on interior rearrangement; I needed some guidelines to follow. The first book was this one, and the other book was \\"Decorating for Good:..\\" by Carole Talbot - a far better book. I like to attack things from a logical set of rules and this book does not offer it. Caroles book offers a set of guidelines to lead you in a direction that is flexible, but has a strong underlying foundation. I read Caroles book first and I loved it,but I was totally dissappointed after reading this one. Too constrictive and opinionated. The pictures are good, but you have to figure it out for yourself, how she came about the solutions she did."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new here","review":"This was just \\"furniture rearrangement 101\\".

We have moved 7 times in 5 years with the military and we wish we had this book for the first 5 moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more or less than the title claims","review":"This is not a comprehensive guide to decorating but neither does it claim to be. The author promises to help you arrange your rooms in a more livable way. She delivers on this promise by sticking to a few core guidelines and hammering them home throughout the book in many different real world examples.How useful is this book? After reading her advice on bathrooms and spending less $50 on new acccessories our guest bath was transformed dramatically for the better. If you want advice on how to decorate from scratch there are many books better than this one. But if you want a practical guide to get the most out of what you already have then you will definitely want to try this book out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a D","review":"I love decorating books. I go to the bookstore and look at them all. And I buy 6 or 7 of them a year. I admit I did not buy this one. It sounded so good, but open it and it's terrible. The ideas the author, whom I've never heard of, writes about are OK, but they are nothing newl, and they could be summed up in one nice magazinze article. I buy a decorating book for big glorious color photos as much as for the writing, and this book does NOT have those photos. It's a big disappointment, and it's a surprise in this day and age to find a decorating book that that looks as if it were printed about 30 years ago before color photos were common. The only reason this must sell online is that people love the title but don't realize that they aren't getting much for their money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-HAVE DECORATING GUIDE FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD!","review":"I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of Lauri Ward's book and the wait was worth it.

The book gives advice on many of the common decorating mistakes. The book is easy to understand and has good illustrations of before and after room arrangements. Wow! what a difference furniture arrangement makes. This book covers everything from furniture arrangement to pictures and lighting. Each chapter has specific examples and suggestions on how to fix the problems. The book focuses on using what you already have, not on buying all new furnishings. However, there are a few suggestions for bought items, but they are not large and expensive. This book is great for anyone, especially if you are on a budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well done","review":"The title sounded so good, but the book disappointed me. No great pictures and only limited ideas. I liked some of the room arranging tips which, although not new or original, are practical. But the author has some silly, dictatorial rules that just don't fit today's way of decorating to suit one's own tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"good to start with","review":"I think it is a very good book. As the author says, read the entire book first and then start to rearrange you furniture. I was amazed how easy it was to change the look of my living room just by applying a few simple rules described in this book. I wish the author gave some examples about other rooms: bedrooms, bathrooms, and hallways.However, once you are done rearranging your living/family room furniture, it is good idea to get an additional book about interior decorating: with COLOR pictures. Eventually, you want to 'spread your wings', to add some more color (maybe paint the walls some other color then the recommended white or beige), use more fabric and different textures. I got 'The New Decorating Book (Better Homes and Gardens)', paperback, which I leaf through frequently to get more ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"This book sounded so good, but then it looked so bad once I received it.

I mean, what other kind of decorating is there? Maybe I thought it would teach me something new. Maybe I'm just upset with myself that I bought it without seeing the real-life book. If I had looked it over in a brick-and-mortar store, I would not have purchased it. Maybe I'm just upset that I didn't think of writing it myself! If you have any decorating instincts at all, you don't need this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown.","review":"I was disappointed in this book from the start, but it wasn't until I got to this little gem regarding wall color that I knew I'd be carting it off to the second-hand store: \\"For most people, white is the safest choice. It is neutral and will save you the anxiety of choosing from the hundreds of colors that are available.\\" Talk about condescending to your readers... blech.I suggest a more accurate subtitle -- something along the lines of \\"Transform Your Home into the Blandest Possible Landscape Using Ten Rudimentary Design Principles.\\"Props to the author, though, for reducing clutter in nearly all \\"Afters.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too elementary","review":"You can save this book and buy a much better book.

It is not a keeper - I have about 25 such books that I enjoy looking at over and over again. What's wrong with this sad little book? First: the pictures were dull in black and white - making it hard to see details. Second: you are encouraged to use the furiture you may have - but this book does not encourage too much use of your personal collections and other decorative items. They are \\"banished\\" from the room. Third: all this informmation on placement of furniture is free every day on the several TV channels that are strictly formated for home/room design. Okay - maybe not completely free - you need to pay your cable bill! Fourth: I won't get back the money I spent on this book when I put it out at next year's Yard Sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the point!","review":"This is a how to book, simple, concise and NOT a coffe table decoration.

The case studies were good, but only one or two of the presented cases showed where you can put a TV. About five or six showed where you can put a piano.

Clearly it's for people who has a piano in their living room and a separate TV room or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best do-it-yourself decorating book","review":"This book is the most down-to-earth realistic book I have seen for the DIY person. The most important things individuals need to know, design principles are all included.

We have a story and some action. The graphics are excellent, and the story is decent, for a video game.While the story in the game isn't as involved or character driven as the story of Mechwarrior 4: Vengeance, I think it does it's job.Where this game really shines, even outshines MW4, is the player interface. This game is easier to play, and I think better overall than MW4 because of it. A storyline is only about 10% of a game, while the interface is what you have to deal with throughout it. A game as complex as this needs a good one. The mouse-controlled, moving targetting reticle is one of the points that makes this one better than MW4.If you want a good story, get MW4, if you want good (and easy to control) gameplay, get this one.One word of warning, this game will NOT play in Windows 2000. I have a dual-boot system with Win2k and Win98, so I can still enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from Britannica","review":"This software is, in a nutshell, mediocre.

But this 'book' is merely the articles related to the subject pulled from the Encyclopedia Britannica, it is a collection of articles and not really a book at all. Very little if any thing in this 'book' is unique, nearly everything in it can be found in the Encyclopedia. The Britannica company has pulled a fast one with software books like this one, they cut a small piece from their Encyclopedia and sell it at an inflated price.

There was no way to get a tight fit for the carseat using the 1 inch rule.

My carseat is a convertable carseat, but the pictoral directions only show how it is used if you have an infant carrier type carseat. I really wasn't sure that i was using it correctly b/c the directions were so poor. I have a 99 Voyager, and use the Alpha Omega car seat.

My fervent wish, as I neared the book's conclusion, was that there would be other books with this character still in existence. You can't imagine my joy when I discovered those beautiful yellow spines at my neighborhood E.J. Korvette. (They were $1.19 at Korvette's - $1.50 everywhere else.) I have every hardcover Nancy Drew - and now my two oldest daughters have had a chance to experience her as well. There is much to be learned in all the books. Because of Nancy I knew the chemical symbol for gold, where Macchu Picchu was located, and a slew of other things well before we learned them at school. Love the books...and love this one the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Drew Review\\"","review":"Nancy Drew books have always been known as the number 1 mystery books, I agree. The Hidden Staircase leaves you suspensful and hanging. I would recommend ages 5-15 to read this book. Nancy is a teenage slew who lives a life of a detective and a teenager at the same time. She goes on a date then hears she has case to solve. This mystery is of The Hidden Staircase. Two old ladies claim to have a ghost living in their house, so they want Nancy to solve that mystery. At the same time her father has been kidnapped. So as you can tell, this story leaves you hanging and wondering if Nancy will pull through with all of this. If you read the book you can see what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hidden Staircase","review":"If you like mystery books, you should try The Hidden Staircase. It's a very exciting mystery. The main characters are Nancy, a detective, Helen her best friend, and Aunt Rosemary. Some other important characters are Wille Wharton and mean Gomber. I loved this mystery book. It was interesting, exciting, and you never knew what was going to happen on the next page!I really like how the mystery ends. Something I didn't like about the book was the mystery had to end, although the book was great. The Hidden Staircase is one of the best books I've read!The mystery took place in the Twin Elms, a house, and Nancy has to find who or what is scaring them. She searched day and night looking for clues. Nancy and Helen found a secret staircase and it's surprising to find out who is in it! I loved the way the author told about the hidden staircase in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"High on my ND list","review":"There are several ND books that I read as a young child and now my daughter reads them too.

Really nice small gift item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great tome on Macintosh programming lore","review":"I have owned several of Scott Knaster's books. He used to own the Macintosh programming domain in the late eighties. Sadly I got rid of my Mac OS programming books in the early 90's (never get rid of books) and bought it without realizing I had it once.This book has several interesting trivia tidbits, but it is 99% outdated. Some of the debugging techniques are useful only if you are still developing for Mac OS 9 and have access to MacsBug. While carbon apps in OS X may have similar restrictions/caveats, the memory representation and debugging techniques are useless because it just doesn't run that way.As Macintosh programming lore, the rating for this book would be 5 stars, get it if you care about Macintosh programming archeology."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coolest tool in my kitchen!...well, almost","review":"This is a wonderful place for a book holder...eye level, folds up out of the way, and doesn't get splatters on any pages.

However, delivery service was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Wood and Acrylic Under Cabinet Cookbook Holder","review":"This is a great product. I was a little reluctant with the price at first but once I got it installed and have been using it now for several weeks it is worth it! My cookbooks were starting to become torn, smudged with food and frayed. I didn't like that because I want to be able to keep them in good shape not only for me but maybe for my kids some day. This cookbook holder was VERY easy to install and we enjoy it. I'm glad that I also purchsed the flip up plastic (acryllic) page holder. The page holder is also nice for keeping my food covered fingers from touching the pages when I am looking at the exact ingrediant that I am suppose to use next. The only downfall is that the inside width is 17 3/4 inches and not every cookbook will fit in there. Very good product though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is a piece of garbage.

I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good 3D, but a little boring.","review":"This blu ray has some decent 3D, but I found myself falling asleep while watching it.

So unless your really into surfing, then this probably isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Wave 3D","review":"Viewed on Sony 60NX810Okay (so-so), educational, some oomph, but where is the ultimate wave? Was a waste of Kelly Slater (world champion surfer?) as you would have expected the producers/directors to capture something dramatic/sensational. I have seen far better wave tunnel surfing on TV and in the movies, but certainly not here. Not much of Tahiti is captured, kinda gives a feeling of being a deserted place of untold beauty.Advice: Rent rather than buy, that way if you like it you can buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous and engaging","review":"Our family loved watching this movie, which had good use of 3d, a story, and of course some excellent surf footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful 3D film","review":"This was the 3rd 3D DVD I obtained after getting my 3D TV. The picture is stunning. The sound is also a treat for the senses.This is the story of a former champion surfer from the USA invited to Tahiti to surf and enjoy the good times. There are also lots of local shots from helicopters of the surf and the islands lush greenery. One of my favorite characters in this film is the little guy, appears to be about 7 years old, learning to surf and also has fun in the water with the local surf instructor. He's a real scream to watch. I am not in the least bit into surfing but this movie is treat to watch again and again. And like I said, the picture quality is nothing less than stunning on my passive 3D TV.My only complaint is I was curious to see what the cameras they used to make this film that were mounted on surf boards looked like, this was not shown in the supplemental material."},{"rating":"1","title":"This video sux!","review":"Bought this to check out my new 3D TV and cause I surf.

For a person just getting their feet wet on the 3d blue rays because of the reasonable price alone,its worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"What a great film. It really shows the beauty of both the islands and 3d technology. Some of the most spectacular 3d I've seen yet, had to wipe the water from my eyes a few times. It really has a nice diverse selection of eye candy, from fire dancing to scuba diving on a reef to surfing, all fit nicely into the 3d format. The scientific part of the movie is also entertaining and informative, explaining the mechanics behind waves and how they form. If you are expecting a movie full of surfing and primarily focusing on that then don't watch this. It was partially put out by Tahiti's tourism industry, so it shows you many different things you can do in Tahiti. However it is done beautifully and really pulls you into the movie. It made me ready to hop on the next flight out to Tahiti and rent a bungalow over the water. And what's more for $15 and some of the BEST 3d I've seen I would say this is a must have 3d blu ray for anyone with a player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"This is a 40 some minutes long documentary. It is not boring but it is peaceful. In fact it is so beautiful that while I was watching all the underwater scenes, I was totally in the movie and fell asleep. I have an active shutter system that does justice to all the vibrant colors and the images in this movie simply perfect. There was almost no ghosting except for a second or so. Some of the 3D effects are good. Especially the under water scenes and the solar system explanations have some pop-up-and-outs. If you are expecting some crazy 3D effects though, you would be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This was a grrat movie. All of ours loved it. Our kids are 2, 5, and 9.

I doubt that the people of Tahiti evented surfing or waves, but that does seem to be the main theme of this disc.The 3D surfing is very good, bu there is far too little of it. Other 3D is also good.

Before buying, I carefully checked the fit specifications on the Park Tool web site. On two different bikes with seemingly typical six notch bottom bracket lock rings that measure within the published specification range of the tool manufacturer, this tool does not fit well enough to allow me to put sufficient force on the lock ring to turn the lock ring and it tends to damage the lock ring because it does not fit properly. The bike store salesperson was careful to warn me that once the tool is out of the package, they do not give returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely removes lock rings.","review":"I used this to remove the left (non-fixed) lock-ring from the bottom bracket of a newly scavenged late 70s Peugeot UO-8 frame.

It does not. The large opening's teeth do not line up with the grooves and the single tooth cannot get a good angle and is too large to fit (without modification).I would normally give something like this a 3 star (neutral) rating because the tool is not at fault for my inability to use it, but in working with it I noticed a few flaws that make it a less useful tool. The most significant one is that the teeth all have heavy beveling, leaving lots of slip room for grooves that are not a perfect fit. The next is that the steel is not of good quality for something that might experience a lot of torque. It may be hard enough for whatever its intended application is, but I can't imagine needing a specialty wrench for something that doesn't need to be tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, BUT....","review":"Fits the locking ring on my Rans Stratus bottom bracket, but for some reason the teeth that engage the ring are tapered a bit making it hard to keep the wrench on the ring. It slipped several times because of those tapered teeth, making a nice scratch in my paint finish. Good quality overall, but design should have had blunt, squared teeth that stay engaged in the lockring. Park tools are usually flawless, this one disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I NEED VOLUME 11 TO COMPLETE MY SET!","review":"This is a wonderful set of cookbooks, but I'm one short...

The thing starts out OK if you're not put off by something that screams techno-disco and shoves every old disco stereotype right in your face. But after about the first third of the album, the whole thing goes right into the toilet. To give you some idea of the last two-thirds of the thing: Imagine a music camp for 10-12 year old boys who have never had any music experience. Then after one week (and only one week) of camp the boys are turned loose on an assortment of synthesizers and drum machines. The result would be a fairly accurate representation of the last two-thirds of this album. The girls who do the so-called singing here try to salvage it by throwing in what are supposed to be (I guess)...little squeaks and grunts, but the whole thing is beyond saving.

Although we now are used to more authentic equipment and more searing battle scenes, \\"Combat\\" will always be the inspiration of any well made WWII story. What gets me is that Vic Morrow was so underrated by Hollywood, his Sgt Saunders is a weary but determined leader and Vic Morrow fleshed out this character in a way that few could. What you will get with this series is good drama and action,well written and acted. This is a series that rather than glorifying war instead pays tribute to those who went through the ordeal of battle and is done so by talented actors,writers and directors."},{"rating":"2","title":"This program has unique introductory music","review":"Many programs of the era had their own introductory music and this program was no exception; the music was by Leonard Rosseman.They always start out with \\"staring Rick Jason and Vic Morrow.\\" Instead of great sweeping epics this program focuses on a single squad with their trials and tribulation with confronting and some time co-operating with the Germans in WWII. Each episode is one hour and has to oppose a problem and a solution in that time. This was back in the time of professional privates.In 1967-1968 Vietnam if you were lucky certain areas actually had TV broadcasting at 1600 hrs. You guessed it; this was one of the programs. I wonderer what the locals thought of the episode?This would be a good series to own. Not just for the nostalgia, but the personal conflicts portrait in the program are still with us today.Combat - Season 2, Mission 2 ~ Rick Jason"},{"rating":"2","title":"the next step","review":"A few years ago, I was fortunate enough, through a friend at the time, to discover a group called Delerium. Their ambient, techno like songs from the album \\"Karma\\" drew me in and after buying the album, I was completely hooked. Ever since, I've waited for a follow-up to the album that would match the versatility of Delerium. Then, as I curiously listened to different albums in a retail store, I found it. After hearing the first few tracks off this album, I knew \\"this is it!\\". Odonata, the first release album by Amethystium, has done this and possibly more. From the soothing and ethnic sounds of \\"Calantha\\" to the lush and serene sounds from \\"Enchantment\\", this album is a *must buy*.Similar artists and albums include Madonna \\"Ray of Light\\", Delerium \\"Poem\\", and select tracks from Moby \\"Play\\", Dido \\"No Angel\\" to Enigma, Anggun, and Deep Forest."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is no Coppy Cat of Enigma","review":"I dont understand why Ive seen reviews of this album being a rip off of Enigma and Deep forest.To say its because he uses chants and flutes- is the most sorriest excuse to use for calling him a rip off. Its like saying every single band that uses a guitar and electric bass is a rip off of every other band that uses guitar and electric bass. Pathetic.I think this is one of the most smartest made albums I have listend to in a long time. And If I had two things I could compare this to being in similar with, it would be of course *Enigma*, and Depeche Mode. I hear alot of cool leads and melodies that would sound more from the synthpop genre , and more of the ambient sounds that would typically fit the new age genre. I think Amethystium has created something new all on its own. And it is quite simply the most elegant album that I have heard in a while. Five star rating, Id advise anyone to pick up this album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Etheral feeling","review":"Not much to add to my fellow reviewers... I stumbled across the album from Delerium's Chimera and was thrilled by the etheral, almost trance-like music. If you enjoy trance songs, like Silence or Eternal Odyssey by Delerium, that put you out in an orbit trance-like thought. Was that cerebral enough?All-in-all I loved the album and if you enjoy trance/new age then I think you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM THE FIRST IN LINE FOR THE NEXT CD!!!!!!","review":"It doesn't get any better than this!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NEURODISC IS THE WAY TO GO","review":"I don't know how to put my love for this CD into words! First of all, if you're an Enigma fan, you'll love this CD. As a matter of fact, I have never purchased a product from Neurodisc that I didn't love. Their Trance is great and now this! Incredible music!!! If you don't have this CD, it's definitely worth checking out. You won't be disappointed!!! Great driving music, especially if you're stuck in traffic and great music to make love to...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sugar for my taste.","review":"Based on what I'd heard about this CD and it's (misleading) comparissons to Enigma, I was expecting a stronger, moodier, dramatic sound from this album. No such luck here. Amethystium not only lacks soul, it also lacks originality. The high pitched flutes and synthesizers heard throughout especially get annoying.Buy it if you like totally bright and optimistic, one-dimensional music. If you're looking for music with depth and contemplation, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eww.","review":"When Norway isn't producing church-burning death metal bands, it's putting out the exact opposite: bland hold music. Amethystium's Odanata is something I'd expect to hear while waiting for the next operator to come available. Listening to it is like listening to neutered Vangelis. If Enigma is too harsh and heavy for you, Amethystium should do the soporific trick. Stash this in a drawer with the Nyquil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amethystium","review":"I was so dissappointed in the cd. This music is so familiar.This guy actually takes sounds from Delerium, Tangerine Dream, Enigma, Deep Forest and others that I recognize (David Arkenstone) and combines them as his own. I even recognize the flute solos from other cd's. This is absolutely not creative.I was tired of listening to it before it was finished. Don't waste your money on this one. Just buy the other artists he is compared to for a more creative and unique experience. And by the way, this sounds nothing like Mythos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I have 3 albums by Amethystium. They are all great. I classify them as instrumemtal New Age albums. The music is very relaxing, and is great to have on in the background when you're reading, writing, or doing something else where vocal music would be too disruptive. While there is some singing going on, it isn't in a language that I recognize, and the voice generally comes across just as another instrument, rather than a means of communication.The music here is much more melodic, more like traditional music in its structure, than you would find in an \\"ambient\\" album. But it is also very smooth, flowing, with a rich texture with several instruments working together to create beautiful, soothing harmonies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"This amethystium album has a pull to it!! I was introduced to Amethystium through pandora on my blackberry last summer. I had just got into observational astronomy with a new telescope and needed alot of patience.

I will buy more of their albums!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best album from amethystium","review":"this is the first amethystium's album i listened back in 2001. i loved it since i heard the very first track. amethystium's music is in genre similar to enigma, era or deep forest, but i enjoy it much more than other performers. it did not spread wide probably because of poor advertising. never get tired of listening to it. totally recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amethystium - Odonata","review":"I listen to this CD at work every day - all day.

Amazon's customer service response was horrible and seeing that I received this item as a gift I had to go through the person that ordered it each time it needed to be returned...What a hassel! Amazon provided a 10 credit for my trouble, but I now realize that I can't use it at Babies R Us, Target or probably anywhere else for that matter!!!

Literally. While the writing is wonderful, and the photography is breath taking, the physical construction of this book by Sierra Club Books is the worst I've ever seen. Immediately upon opening this book, the binding failed and the pages all separated from the cover and from each other. Perhaps the publisher felt it was best to enjoy this product in a loose-leaf format, or maybe they believe that glue contributes to global warming, and to use any in this product would have harmed the planet. I've never before owned a book that disintegrated immediately as this one did.If this book had held together I would have rated it five stars without question.

After a week of heavy winds the pool was not looking so good and all kinds of debris was floating in the pool. This skimmer had the surface clear within 30 minutes and even cleaned up a good amount of the stuff I stirred up vacumming the grunge from the bottom.

There is an extreme urgency in this story to quell the problem, and keeps you the on edge throughout ALL six parts, an element missing in a majority of six-parters. Baker and Sladen are brilliant, Baker giving a dramaticperformance with hints of his own absurdity. Harrison Chase is an unforgettable character and is quite chilling! All actors involved give it their best. Some interesting video viuals are used for the Antartica location, really quite effective. Not only was the story influenced by \\"Day of Triffids\\", \\"Quatermass Experiment\\" and many others, it also echoes \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" as our heroes and outcasts nail and hammer themselves in Chase's mansion.

This not only makes mixing it more difficult, the effects take longer to kick in. (The BSN disolves almost like alka-seltzer). Taste is awful I got the rasberry lemonade. Some people say taste isnt important but if you have to drink the stuff almost everyday and they can taste good why not? The BSN orange taste great and I dont even like orange drinks. Now most important is the pump which again fails for me. The BSN came faster, stronger and lasted for the workout. Great Pump.

I feel that my muscles get a better supply of oxygen during my workouts, thereby prompting me to push myself a bit harder.

I have noticed that if I take this on an empty stomach, I do feel a bit unsettled. I have started to eat some crackers while drinking it and it has solved my indigestion. My second complaint is that this makes me feel a bit dehydrated, especially when I am doing cardio. Thus, I have to drink more water during my workouts than I would like.

In addition, you're getting only 32 calories and 100% of your daily required folic acid in one serving. Because you need only take one small scoop a day, one cannister lasts a few months.

Even if you think it's NOT effecting you. . over time it will in a very real and bad way. My suggestion: IF you take it, take one scoop. If your body get's used to it. . . stop taking it for awhile. Use it only on days you are burned out or tired. But, I coudln't do it. If I had the jug, I would take it no matter what. It was just such a rush. So, I have to sadly stay away from it.

There was one good scene with the detective and her agent, where they each had one funny line. Whoever wrote the songs confused lots of notes and arpeggios with music. The lyrics were so silly they might have worked in a Marx Brothers movie, but were pretentious in this production.

Despite all efforts to suppress individualism the communist regime of the late 1960s Czechoslovakia allowed Utz to keep a spectacular private collection of porcelain amounting to more than a thousand pieces, all crammed in a small two-roomed flat in Prague. The account of how Utz built up his collection is truly moving and the humour with which Mr Chatwin describes his peregrinations across Europe is irresistible. Wars, pogroms and revolutions offer excellent opportunities for the collector, Utz remarks ironically!The novel is a sharp account of the history of Middle Europe from the 1850s to the Prague Spring in 1969, of the history of the Meissen porcelain production, of the absurdities of communism and also of the Czech spirit of which Mr Chatwin is a very keen observer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!

How can anyone forget the scene before she enters the palace whereas she adjusts her, ahhh, assets.... LOL! This movie has it all and delivers the goods in an appropriate manner. John Goodman was recently on SNL, and cracked a joke about only 7 people going to watch this movie of his when it was in the theaters; everybody laughed...they would have laughed a ...lot more had they seen the thing.

I did get involved with the characters and the movie kept my interest. If you like war movies I would recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, with some good parts","review":"After reading and hearing first-hand accounts of the Battle of Stalingrad I found this movie very disappointing. While it tried, I don't think it came close to expressing the horrors and tragedy of the battle, and worse, it had too much contrived silliness, such as the scenes with the young Russian woman. It does deserve credit for showing that humanity existed among some of the German and Russian troops, and for some effective combat scenes. If you would like to see a better movie about warfare in Eastern Europe, I strongly recommend the Finnish movie \\"The Winter War\\" (in Finnish \\"Talvisota\\"), about the 1939-1940 fighting between Finland and the Soviets. It has excellent characters and shows the terror of combat and the cameraderie, squalor and sorrows of the front lines, and life on the home front. It is not as slickly made as \\"Stalingrad,\\" which actually is a point in its favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and enduring...","review":"Before \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" there was this powerful and total indictment of war in general and the historical opinion of the average non-political German patriot/soldier during World War II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stalingrad","review":"I was very excited about watching this movie, however I was a disappointed. The visuals are very good (uniforms, equipment, bombed out city, sewers, winterscape). The action sequences seemed cheap, much like an old spaghetti western, which really disappointed me. Could have been a great movie and topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Time","review":"In my opinion this movie is well worth your time...and possibly buying. There aren't many movies about the Russian Front (that I've seen) and it gives you somewhat of an inside look into the German army. No movie is perfect, and there are some parts that could use some work...but then again, I don't direct movies, nor do the majority of the people who are writing bad reviews. So, as it is, this movie is worth your time and is very interesting.I'm not sure why the DVD versions apparently don't come with subtitles, so VHS will sadly have to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good war movie","review":"Since I saw this movie after seeing Saving Private Ryan, I thought that most of the battles in the movie could not match the Spielberg's well-staged battles. However, what is great about this movie is not the battles (some of them are quite gruesome,) but its depiction of the doomed humans who lived and died during the battle of Stalingrad. The movie continues to build up until its devastating ending. The final scenes are just excellent. Then why didn't I give 5 stars to this DVD version of the movie? It's because the DVD lacks the goodies that I expect these days (background, etc.) The DVD transfer is acceptable, but not very sharp. There is also no liner notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this movie","review":"I can't comment too much on the historical accuracy of this film.

Always an interesting premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the best","review":"This is a brilliant war film, incredibly well-done. The director did the right thing -- he focused upon telling the story and ignored entertainment. The result is one of the most entertaining war films I've ever seen. Don't miss this one.

Tora!\\" and/or \\"The Big Red One\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Stalingrad","review":"A quick summary would say this is another \\" Saving Private Ryan\\" film from a German standpoint. ( although Stalingrad was released long before Saving Private Ryan) Both films take us down to a platoon level to show the grim horror and reality of war on a day by day, hour by hour, blow by blow basis. Stalingrad was one of the most bloodiest and ferocious battles of World War 2, which blunted Hitlers thrust into Russia and then was ultimately a turning point. The film Stalingrad promises alot ( it is from the makers of \\"Das Boot\\") but I felt I gained no real affinity with the characters portrayed and therefore the film petered out and the last half hour dragged on. However, even with these deficiencies this is still a good, strong film and has some 1st class battles scenes ( especially the Russian tank attack). It rates as one of the better war films made but doesnt reach the same heights as \\" Das Boot\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stalingrad","review":"This was a very poor film of the seige of Stalingrad. The acting, plot, English dubbing and flow of the movie was of poor quality. Although it tried to show the suffering of both the Germans and Russians during seige of Stalingrad, the acting and characters in the movie were not interestng enough to hold your attention. Far below the overall quality of the other DVD I purchased at the same time, \\"Enemy at the Gates\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An Anti-War Piece of the Combat Canon","review":"I came to this film out of curiosity - I'd been writing a historical novel about the Eastern Front war, and as that wound dow, this turned up. It's by the makers of the critically acclaimed German submarine move Das Boot (The Boat), and the same gritty reality comes through here.As with all good war writing, the nature of war makes the film an anti-war piece of the combat canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good reenactment of the battle","review":"I'd have given this movie 5 stars if the ending didn't drag out for as long as it did. The battle scene in the factory was intensively surreal, bringing out true true horror of hand to hand combat. It ranks right up there with Saving Private Ryan's opening sequence. It was a unique thing for me to see a war movie from the German point of view. I hope some of them actually did have a conscience. Too bad they all didn't. Like I said, the movie's ending was a little slow, but it did move to it's logical ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very graphic movie and holds you attention","review":"A good movie very explicit maybe a bit overdone showing the German soldier in a poor light a little undisciplined always sterotyping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at the top but still one of the best war movies","review":"I saw this film when I was in college. It is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. The movie gives you the German perspective without trying to vindicate them or anything like that. It simply shows how everyone became a victim of something bigger than themselves: war and the winter in Russia. It is a very good movie an a must for fans of WWII movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's my motivation to buy this dvd?","review":"Why does this dvd have an english (dubbed) soundtrack only. It was obviously made in german (like Das Boot), so why no german soundtrack available? Surely some people would prefer to watch the film in the original german soundtrack with english subtitles. But no subtitles either! What were the people who compiled this dvd thinking! Why not include the original soundtrack. Surely this was available.One of the best parts of the film, a scene showing the platoon listening to a speech by Hitler (the actual recording) over an improvised radio, also has no subtitles! So good luck to anyone who would have been interested in knowing what the speech was about.If ever there was a film that could benefit from rudimentary features like a choice of language or subtitles - this is it.Probably one of my favourate war films. Probably the worst DVD in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stalingrad","review":"The film views the Battle of Stalingrad from the eyes of the German Army. I'm generally don't watch foreign films, but this one is well made and I liked it enough to watch it more than once. \\"Stalingrad\\" makes a decent companion film for \\"Enemy at the Gates\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent film. The men depicted here are my uncles, my godfathers, and many other young German men who never returned home. Never mind the rightness or the wrongness of the war, the effect of this film is powerful. The frozen faces of the men ground into the Russian soil by tanks are the same faces of those in my family albums. This is the counterpart to the great generation. They were real people with real hopes, ideals, and illusions. This movie is best seen in German with English subtitles. Unfortunately many a nuance is lost in translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real History","review":"As a war historian this movie shows the true depiction of what war is like. There are no heroes as in Saving Private Ryan or any John Wayne movie. This story leaves you with a sense of empathy for those soliders who were sacrificed at the gates of Stalingrad. By hte way if your looking for a nice, well acted clean movie you probably would not like tis one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"This movie was a real disappointment. Nothing about it was impressive. It seemed that all the scenes were shot and then edited together. Nothing flowed and you can easily get lost trying to figure out what was going on. To compare this film to Saving Private Ryan is nonsense. Not even in the same league. After the first 20 minutes I really didn't want to watch it anymore. I fast forwarded through the rest, stopping occasionally and then moving on. Enemy at the Gates was a much better Stalingrad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a biased, anti-German, hack-job this is.","review":"I'm just glad that most of the 6th Army isn't around to see themselves portrayed in this way, Spielberg couldn't have ripped them any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible, terrible movie!!","review":"What a pathetic attempt to try to make something like \\"Das Boot\\". First, the acting: It might not come across when subtitled, but when one listens to the German intonations, the whole movie sounds soooo over-acted. The actors themselves, though considered stars in their (and my) home country, have obviously wasted their talent for what is an overall disappointing piece of film. Yeah, the film: Apparently, this movie marks a return to the \\"good old days\\" of post-war German film-making (the 50s), when the role of the German \\"Wehrmacht\\" in the war was down-played; essentially, our boys were just naive but otherwise honorable tools in the hands of some bad Nazis. Sorry to spoil the party, but this movie is unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stalingrad-A Good Film To See","review":"If you're looking for a romantic ending type of war movie, when a hero comes in to save the day, this is not the movie to watch. This movie is told through the eyes of German Storm Troopers who are trapped in Russian where in their only option is to be killed in battle or to freeze to death. The besiegement of the city of Stalingrad quickly turns from a seemingly ingenious decision by Hitler into the hellist realization of the imminent defeat of the German army. There are two major war scenes, the openning one in the city of Stalingrad and the second on the outskirts of the city (infantry verses tank battle). Both scenes are good but contain slighly unbelievable parts. This movie will be a good addition to your war movie collection. Although I do not speak any foreign language, I recommend that you buy all foreign films with subtitles and not English dub over versions. Also see the French film \\"Capitaine Conan\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but fascinating","review":"I was inspired to watch this movie again after having finished off Antony Beever's excellent Stalingrad history. It was instructive to watch it when all the details of the battle were so fresh in my mind, because the movie takes great pains to incorporate many of the details which made the siege unique. The movie is flawed- there are quite a few stock characters and some scenes which are poorly done (the maniacally laughing general comes to mind), but the battle scenes are well done and perhaps more importantly, the perspective is tremendously fresh. You simply don't see the Wermacht protrayed sympathetically very often, and it takes movies like Stalingrad and Das Boot to remind American viewers that the German soldiers were not cartoon characters. Not perfect, but highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Victor from ,Crucial Cold and Hunger,Russia-includig Napolron and Adolf Hittler- in World History !","review":"After pincered encircled German 6th Army andother Axis Army,following unsuccessful Air Supplieslead to Surrender to Russian Gen.

For example the blood is obviously fake and the severed body parts look faker than Britany Spears. Aside from the bad fx, the plot is weak. The last forty minutes drags on,and on. The english dugging is terrible, they say things not even closely resembling the original actor's lines. Buyer beware, don't believe the hype about this movie.

The best German genes were killed off with the aggressive warriors who bore them. The lesser genes stayed home or ran away and their offspring made movies about giving up, shooting one's self, and consorting with the enemy. One look at one of the starring \\"German soldiers\\" indicated the actor's true ethnicity and when I looked it up I was confirmed. Some people, so to speak, will do anything for money!And it was an obvious attempt to play off of the success of PLATOON in uniforms that looked aptly too much like olive drab than Feldgrau."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reminder of how bad Foreign films are","review":"I read a lot of books about Stalingrad, and decided to buy this DVD, after watching this movie, I was sorry for discounting the negative Amazon reviews before buying it, this film is a real disappointment, the acting would have to be the worst I have ever seen, you NEVER feel that your with them in battle, but rather with them on a movie set. The film is about a small group of German soldiers enduring the suffering of war, much like the movie Platoon, showing a more humane side, leaving out most of the atrocities committed by the Germans. The language is German and dubbed in English, so if you watch it in English, don't expect there lips to be in synch, its better watching it in German and reading the subtitles. This film really belongs in the $5 dollar bin at your local shopping mart, definitely NOT worth $28!."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT MOVIE","review":"AUTHENTIC, makes one wonder how one small country like Germanycould inflict so much injury&suffering; on the entire world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget about saving private Rian!","review":"when you've seen this movie, and compare Saving private Rian you realize where Spielberg got his idea from. Spielburg should at least split his oscars... But this movie is purer, more honest. No heroic actions in Stalingrad. Not even a Tom Hanks like character, who is in a way still the classic American hero. If Saving Private Rian blew you away, go see this one. Its better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A film with an agenda.","review":"This is not an unfiltered look at this epic battle, but rather an anti-war, Oliver Stone-ish statement wrapped conveniently in the most devastating battle of the 20th century. It is, as well, palpably over-sympathetic to the Soviets at various points. Additionally, the film is capped by a truly bizarre bunker scene involving a few German soldiers and a Russian woman. The only saving grace for the film are some cool battle scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful even if Finance isn't your favorite subject","review":"I'll be honest. I hate finance! Even my own. That's why I have a financial planner. But I have always been frustrated with my lack of knowledge on the topic. Even if you have a financial planner, you still want to know what he or she is talking about, right? Well, this book does an excellent job of explaining all of this and more! I feel so much more in control and knowledgeable. I'll still never be an expert -- mostly because it's not the area I wuold want to be an expert in. But now I feel more comfortable on the topic even if it's in casual conversation.

Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed.This is truly a book for dummies. It covers a lot of little basic things, but nothing well at all. It's a jack of all trades but master of none in real life. The messages were simple: save and stay away from debt, but the material was loosely organized which makes it difficult for the reader to synthesize -- wasn't the writer who was supposed to do that? -- and implement. Basically after reading it you'll scratch your head and wonder where to start. If you were not a dummy, you'll feel like a dummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was OK at best","review":"I would not recommend this book. It is very short sighted. For a more in-depth look into proper financial planning, I would look elsewhere. If you are starting out new in financial planning take a look at this book for the budgeting part. Then look elsewhere for the other parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the young and ignorant (i.e. me)","review":"I have to agree with many of the reviewers who gave this book just a few stars: this book is very basic.That's why it was so useful to me, a woman in her 20's who is still figuring out the basics of money management. Tyson does kind of skim over each topic, but if you are looking for a broad look at personal finances this is perfect: it serves as an introduction to paying off debt, investing, handling retirement funds. It helped my husband and me figure out which area we need work on (and which topic to buy a more specific book about). I gave it 4 stars because it seemed the author could have given a bit more advice about paying off \\"good\\" debt like student loans. Not recommended for the money savvy, but great for all of us financial dummies out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. Lots of suggestions.","review":"I've had this for a while now and have loaned it to a few people. A very well written book. I hate books where the author thinks you know a ton of stuff going in, even though they are 'beginner' books. This one is written in easy to understand language, yet in a smart way. I'm not sure if there is a newer release, but the one I have is very good. As with most advice, though, you have to use what you can. If more people read this and used some of the advice, there would be a lot less credit problems now a days. The best advice is don't buy with credit--if you don't need it today, save up and buy it. If you can afford the payments, you can afford the savings even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in every way.","review":"Thorough and written in user friendly language.

As I read through the text, I was greeted by humor and a down-to-earth style I thought was well-needed in this field, which can be intimidating to many people. I learned a lot about helping get through my own financial situation and then passed the book along to my mother.

Brilliant songs, particularly Dead Sea Burning and Skyscrapers, only serve to make you wonder what could have been with this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Stuff!","review":"As near as I can tell from the liner notes, Uttara-Kuru is a collective group that centers on two musicians, Seiichi Kyoda (who is listed as playing \\"other instruments\\" on the credits, which apparently means he plays percussion and keyboards, including synthesizers), and Kazumasa Yoshioka (who is listed as one of the producers, but is not listed as a performer). Their music is too lively to categorize as New Age, but it is not quite jazz, either. Remember the Mannheim Steamroller recordings of the \`70s? Uttara-Kuru seems to be the \`90s Japanese equivalent. Fun stuff, very well recorded, great for showing off your system, but not really containing a whole lot you can really sink your musical teeth into. Still, this is very pleasant listening.

I love eclectic blends of Asian music combined with true talent. Neither East Wind nor Prayer appeal to me as anything close to enjoyable and aren't even in the same category as Jia Peng Fang or Mizuyo Komiya.

Essentially, the only disappointment is the sandalwood-scented booklet, which is written in halting, infantile English. According to it, the recurring theme is snow, and perhaps that is true about some tracks. To me, the music spoke of greater, almost ineffable things. \\"Our Life\\", \\"Wings of the Eagle\\", \\"Niigata Okesa\\", and \\"Falling Through a Cloud\\" are easily the best tracks on the disk, each taking a different approach to achieve great results. Boisterous flute melodies, sweeping synthesizer tones, hoarse chants, ululating lyrics, and nature sounds coexist to produce an enlightening, mind-opening effect. An emphatically recommended choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini-disc player","review":"The product was delivered in a timely manner. Actually it was early by two days! The Disc player was in excellent shape and the seller also sent a blank disc which was a plus! There has been no problems since I had the player and it has been used on a long road trip recently and I only used 1 rechargeable battery which is really good! The only problem was with the sound, when hooking to the car the sound was a little lower than usual but I'm sure if I played around with it a lil more that can be adjusted.

The author really knows what he's talking about and he writes with such humor that it's an enjoyable book to read rather than a slow-bum boring one. So far this is the BEST book on buzz marketing I've read and I've read quite a few. He lays out the concepts of what to do and what not to do so well and even though he has a buzzmarketing company he doesn't toot his own horn too much where you feellike it's a commercial for his company.This is the type of book you'll want to keep on your reference shelf and read over and over again.I've used his techniques to make my novel a success and get it recently sold to Warner Books.Jeff RiveraAuthor of FOREVER MY LADY on Amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertainment, but no instruction","review":"Hughes provides some backstory on a number of corporations, and those insights are mildly amusing. He also pulls bits from his career and weaves them into the text. But there's no real how-to here. The result is a book that is entertaining, but offers little in the way of instruction for entrepreneurs seeking to get big buzz for low bucks. Poor copy editing compounds the pain; virtually every page has at least one error in grammar or syntax. If you're captivated by reality TV and typically read supermarket tabloids, Buzzmarketing will suit you fine. If you're hoping for a step-by-step structure for building your business, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I am not sure what I was looking for when I bought this book, but the stories were wonderful and I enjoyed the book.

The writer distorts historical fact to fit her own agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ungrateful Daughters","review":"Although I am interested in the history of the English monarch, I found this book to be very dry and a bit boring. it is divided into multiple parts. At first it gives a series of biographies for each of the important actors of the time, Queen Mary Beatrice, Princess Anne, Princess Mary, King James II, and Prince William of Orange. These biographies cover the same time period and often overlap. I think it could have been much better written or organized. While both sisters were vilified, Anne came across as the master manipulator. The author showed her obvious dislike for Anne through her descriptions of her physical appearance and behavior. Further, she described Mary's reign in detail while ignoring Anne's. In addition, I expected to read more information about King James' son. The book did not describe his attempts to retake the crown or how Mary and Anne thwarted such attempts. Overall, I found this book to be disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matt Helm, a damaged girl and a race against time! Great!","review":"One of the classic -- early -- Matt Helm books.

It also helped with my flattened nipples when my milk first came in and I was experiencing engorgement. The only downfall is that if you are a heavy leaker (as I am) the inserts will not absorb all the milk and will spill as soon as you bend over. I had to stop using them because of this.

They're just for home use (in my opinion). What do they do? They help sore nipples. They REALLY help sore nipples. What more could a nursing mom want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relief at Last","review":"I had been using the disposable pads and Purelan; but, still experienced soreness.

After a successful lumpectomy for breast cancer [they \\"got it all\\" with good margins], my surgeon prescribed 6 weeks of daily radiation treatments. A major side effect is the sunburn/tenderness of the skin after a week or so of treatments, for which they give you a healing lotion to start using immediately. My nipples became irritated eventually, and I needed help for the times I couldn't go braless and wear a soft shirt. In my mind, I designed the perfect solution--a firm, domed covering with air-holes for ventilation. Before calling the patent attorney, I looked on-line to see if it had already been invented! Fortunately, it had been, and I got them within a few days. They work perfectly, and my radiation tech and radiologist see them as a new help for their patients. Spread the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful BUT your bra has to be bigger to fit them!!","review":"I love them!! and would have never it made it through breast feeding without them. HOWEVER, you have to compensate for the extra space in your bra for the shell. If not the bra is to \\"full\\" and it creates a lot of pressure against the nipple. So the bra fits well without them you need to find a new bra or some bra's have the adjustable cups. All I'm saying is these are great and yes you do have to see if they are to tight and making your nipple red, however once you get the right fit with everything it is HEAVEN not having anything touch your nipple."},{"rating":"2","title":"girlfriend said they were the best","review":"my girlfriend complained of her nipples being sore from breast feeding and these had great reviews so i got them.she loved them, they dont touch ur nipple to aggravate it yet still catches any leakage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I don't recommend these shields.

The college is in Texas, yet NO ONE has a Texas accent. Jason Bateman's character exists only to make a pertinent comment at the right moment to make Bakula's character turn the Jeep around and head back to college to pull off his one last triumph for the team and get the girl. And don't get me started on the transparent manipulation of putting Kathy Ireland in football pants to kick a field goal.

Screeching lyrics and weird explorations of the scary parts of depth come thru in the first half of the cd. My girlfriend and I were deeply disapointed. The second part is what makes it two stars instead of one. There's 13 songs without lyrics that are kinda cool. But overall in my opinion this cd is not a keeper.

And is this really music?","review":"Man, I was so disapointed in this CD. It is nothing like what I was expecting, John is not much of a singer, must have been all the SMACK he was on. In my opinion he never should have put this out and never should have bought it. He can play the guitar but it is nothing like what he does with the RHCP. If you want to hear a REAL guitar player then rent the movie The Song Remains The Same, turn up your sound system really loud, sit back and have your mind blown. Of course most of you may be a little to young to remember that history making performance at the Garden....Peace and wuv to you all...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Niandra Lades and Usually Just Overrated","review":"First of I am not a john frusciante fan.This cd in what i read is john frusciante best cd up to date...maybe its that im not into red hot or john f but this sounds to forced.I think john is aiming to bad for the eccentric madman genius label that his heroes have(Syd Barret,Capatain Beefeheart).Yeah there was some moments in here that did something but other than that this is for serious hardcore everything john/red hot fans.I Got this expecting to hear more songs in the style of those seen in his heroin isolation period footage.....Hearing him drugged out of his mind screaming and doing noises like that would of made it a better album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Lunacy and Babble","review":"John Frusciante has finally gone crazy! This CD feels like John took his 4-track recordings and slapped them on a cd just for the sake of releasing something! Even his famed guitar playing on this CD is so random that it is tough to make it through most tracks. Meanwhile his lyrics that he splurges over the guitar smudges sound like a journal reading of high sqeals and mumbles. If you are looking for a great follow-up to his previous cd's this is NOT it. If you are wanting to go insane pick this up now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shirley Temple of Doom is J.Perez","review":"I purchased this when it was first released in '92 (?) and no one could understand what exactly it was that I liked about this album.IT BLEW MY MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In the middle of the grunge explosion, here was an album of 100% pure expression, recorded on a 4-track.RAW vocals & guitar (forwards and backwards), insane lyrics (literally & figuratively), infinite in it's emotional content. Brave, daring, original, beautiful & sad.An autobiography of self-destruction.John Fruciante is a true artist and quite possibly a genius(a term thrown around WAY too losely nowadys).America's answer to Radiohead, except he's one person, and an extarordinary one.This is my FAVORITE album by John Fruciante!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful thing ive ever heard","review":"your friends may give you weird looks but if you like it (which anyone who gives it a chance usually does) it will be an invaluble gift.

Because of him i started to write music that comes from inside of me, from my soul. he guided me to his world of art and spirits and altough i never saw a spirit, and i don't really sure that they exist i feel comfortable in that world. now about the album. it's really two albums in one cd. the first album (Niandra LaDes) is from track 1 to track 12 and this album is a collection of beautiful songs. the second album (Usually Just A T-Shirt) is from track 13 to the end of the album and all the tracks sounds like one large song.so the bottom line is that this album is a door the another world. a haunted but calm world. there are some people who can't pass thru that door but i did pass thru it. and i'm glad i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"believe the positive reviews-this is a very cool album","review":"it's engaging. his vocal range is somewhat limited, but i appreciate that he tries to hit those high notes anyway. the guitar playing as you probably figured, sounds amazing. this sounds very low fi and was obviously made by john with just a four track, but to me that's what's so friggin cool and original about this. this isn't an album for those who are complacent with the same banal f.m rock station format but at the same time, when you hear the guitar on this recording, one easily comes to the conclusion that john's guitar sound is a crucial element in the chili pepper's musical dna."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"All right... maybe not quite that good, but this solo release from the guitarist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers is well worth your money. John's stream-of-conscience lyrics and beautiful guitar playing will fill your mind with vivid images that can be both horrifying and humorous. As for vocals... well, John does sing with a passion. Undoubtedly, there may be points where his pained squawking and gargling will almost compel you to hit the skip or stop button. Resist this temptation though and you will be rewarded with moments of pure bliss where everything just seems to come together and work. Definitely a cd that will challenge your concept of what music is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most artistic album I have listened too.","review":"This album has what it takes to be one of the BEST albums. If you're a huge fan of the guitar sections in the chili pepper songs, this would be a good album for you to have. John Frusciante mixes some new psychodelic sounds in some songs, and yet in other songs you can hear a tiny bit of that Red Hot Chili Peppers sound we've grown to love. The voices John ranges from can be a little out there, but the more you listen to him, the more this album will grow on you. I definitely recommend this album if you have taste for art."},{"rating":"2","title":"john frusciante is not crazy","review":"for all the people who review this cd as part of john's herion years is wrong. John wrote most of the songs during bssm, when he was NOT using heroin. THis cd is a beautiful look into a genius' mind. I can't help but be happy every time i listen to it. It isn't for all listeners though, it may take a while to get past the unconventional playing and singing. But i have to say this is my all time #1 favorite cd. There is so much emotion twisted into the chords that it pushed me to tears when i first listened to it. I LOVE THIS CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey hon! Baltimore Nostalgia that's not worth buying.","review":"Back in the 1970s, a friend's older sister had this bumpersticker on her car. I had no clue what it meant, but found out it was for a cleverly named popular seafood restaurant in Fell's Point (near downtown Baltimore) where they serve mussels and crabs and such. I grew up eating such creatures and liked their taste, but when I realized they were live animals thrown in to boiling water to feel excruciating pain and die, I stopped eating them. Years later at my natural grocer, I enjoyed delicious & authentic tasting mock crab cakes made with Old Bay seasoning.Hey hon, here's my advice as a former Baltimoron: Skip this sticker & buy a container of Old Bay seasoning instead, so you can enjoy that crab cake taste cruelty-free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grill!!

I was a bit skeptical ordering such a large item from Amazon and on having to put it together myself. Delivery went very smoothly. The company that delivered it even brought it up into my 3rd floor walkup apartment.I think Weber claims that it takes 10 minutes to put this series together. That might be a slightly fast - but I definitely had it up and ready in under an hour. One person can do everything except one lifting step.I use it even more than I thought I would and it does a great job.

The story felt choppy and cliched. Plus why are all the major actors in this S. American drama all played by Anglo-Saxons. Since when did a Spanish land baron start speaking with an English accent? The casting made this movie totally unbelievable for me. The weak screenplay coupled with the cast doomed this movie from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointed....","review":"I did really wanted to buy this dvd.

Totally the opposite: just spoil it. And the good feelings to see a good movie again, at your home, is completely gone.The movie itself is great!

And after that, if you still like it, then you may buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The House of the Spirits.","review":"I had seen the VHS version of this movie years ago. After reading the novel and renting the DVD i found it had been shortened and it was not true to the real essence of the story at all. Important aspects of the novel are left undeveloped, the movie skips about 20 years to attribute the events that were supposed to happen to Alba, to her mother, Blanca, played by Winona Ryder. The cast is famous and their acting is okay, but the dialogue is not good at all. I feel robbed for renting this DVD, it was a real disapointment. I think I could've done a better job at providing the audience with an enjoyable film that develops all important aspects of the story than Bille August. Now I feel like i had to let everyone know to not waste their money or time on this DVD.

My book group had read the book, and we were looking forward to viewing the DVD. The local video rental shop did not have a copy in stock, so I ordered it from Amazon with over-night shipping. It arrived the day prior to our meeting, but I never opened the DVD until the night of our viewing. It wouldn't play. Reason? It was formatted for a different region of the world. We (the U.S. - and Canada) are region 1, and somehow we were sent a DVD that played only in a different region of the world. Quite frankly, I'm concerned that future DVD purchases may have the same difficulty. I can't understand how a product shipped from a location within the U.S. to another location within the U.S. would be formated for a completely different region of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a widescreen version available?","review":"I've been anticipating when this film would be released on DVD. Unfortunately there was no indication anywhere on the website what aspect ratio it was. When I received it, to my disappointment, it was a standard screen version. I am assuming there is no widescreen version available. This is really stupid that some theatrical DVDs are being released only in standard version when there are increasingly a lot of people out there, like myself, who are purchasing widescreen TVs. I've vented my anger but I doubt if it will do any good. It still is a good film but not as enjoyable to watch on a 55\\" big screen TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did these fine actors do this bad movie?","review":"The cast list included Jeremy Irons, one of my favorite actors since \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" in 1982.

Meryl Streep is irritatingly ethereal as the book's clairvoyant protaganist. Jeremy Irons is by no means a convincing latino.

Now, this is nothing on the seller, I got my movie in the mail pretty quickly and there was no problem there. This is about the movie itself. If you can stand scenes or rape and pedophilia, this isn't actually a bad movie. I just wish there was a cut version, because all the rape, sex, and really creepy pedo scenes could have been cut and you'd have an extremely awesome movie. However, if you're not expecting it, like I wasn't, that's all your going to be thinking about for the rest of the movie. Even when the movie starts to get better towards the end, it seems to find ways to remind you how disturbing the beginning was, and remind you of how you'll not have any desire to see this ever again. Because of this movie, I will probably never watch a movie again without looking up spoilers."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!","review":"I LOVE this film, I've seen it now many time over!!!

I have always loved this book and have had that very same goal ever since the fifth grade when our homeroom teacher read it to us. The book concludes when Barbara Cooney the author says that her Aunt Alice (Miss Rumphius,) tells her that she too needs to do something to make the world more beautiful.

I immediately thought to myself \\"what was that book with these flowers??\\" and called up my lovely mother. It felt like a long lost dream. I could remember the symbolism, but not the specifics. When I was young, I think I was enthralled with little Alice being able to paint the clouds and even more so when she becomes a librarian and transforms the landscape by the sea.

They are SOMEWHAT uncomfortable. Sometimes they make my nipples a little sore, to be expected I guess, but not painful.

I wore them for several hours the day I got them - at least six hours - and my nipples were not even potruding right when I took them out of my bra.Also, as a word of warning, if you are pregnant and attempting use of this product, PLEASE consult your OB/GYN before purchasing. I was unaware that stimulation of the nipples can cause uterine contractions, and in some cases, premature labor. So, you want to be certain to clear it with your doctor first. I spoke to a certified lactation consultant that said anything of the sort should only be used after 36 weeks, but even then, you must have your doctor's approval to ensure everything is safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT! HOT! HOT!","review":"This cd is awesome!! Each mix is beautifully done, especially the Thunderpuss 2000 mix (who also worked on the fabulous \\"It's Not Right, But It's Okay\\" by Whitney Houston). The KLM mix isn't bad either (KLM being Keith Litman, who has also worked on remixes for George Michael & Charlotte). It has been a long time since I have enjoyed the original version of a song, usually I only like the remixes, but I love the original more than a couple of the remixes!! Good work from The Berman Brothers!! If radio programmers are smart they will embrace this song as the dance number of the summer!! Much better than Amber's previous singles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amber","review":"Amber never fails to amaze us. She is so talented and this song \\"sexual\\" is her best yet. Following a long list of hits Amber is sure to make it hit out of this one. Can't get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More tracks than you think","review":"Someone recently reviewed this excellent single, saying there's only one track. Wrong! There are seven. I guess what it says above is a misprint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating","review":"This has to be one of the most annoying songs I've heard in my life. How can anyone like this garbage? My former roommate used to play this song all the time. Bland lyrics and an even blander beat. It's no wonder I haven't heard this one played very much. Amber makes the Spice Girls look like Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dance or Work Out Tune!","review":"Amber has a great voice! This cd single is excellent. Put it in your stereo or Walkman and listen as you work out or dance -- the lyrics are easy to remember and the tune is really catchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SOUND OF THE FUTURE","review":"Amber has the most unique techno sound in dance today. Sexual seems to capture the very essence of her style. Always a smooth dreamlike quality blended with an exotic techno flair. Don't let the femme fatale image fool you, this girl knows how to add a competitive edge to her sound.If I didn't know better I'd say she was from the future. Because the music sounds just that. Ahead of it's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"hot traxx","review":"I first heard this song back in early 2000 at a nightclub. I fell hard for the song.....I had to buy it....I couldn't find it. Then someone told me about it. I ordered thru Amazon.....the rest is history. When I hear this Li Da Di song......I just wanna get down and dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfactory","review":"unsatisfactory----no packageing, instructions, and only 3 loose batteries. Also looks refurbished and not new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this steaming pile of hippo excrement.","review":"This product sucks. I bought it a few weeks ago and it ran out of batteries after two days, and, as another reviewer said, the batteries are expensive. And the pen runs out of ink quickly.I would reccommend jumping in a pool of rabid, starved pirrhanas then purchase this disgrace to human intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, marginal execution...","review":"The idea of a 4-in-1 lazer-light-pen-stylus gadget was too good to pass up. Now that novelty is gone, reality is; poor battery life, marginal construction, pen & stylus get \\"stuck\\" requiring constant disassembly & coersion. All in all a good idea, but I'd say pass & save a few dollars & headaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Student with a review","review":"This story is a bout a girl named Hannalee. Her older brother, Davey, breaks up with his girlfriend Rosellen to go to war. The Civil War. Hannalee is shipped away from her home is Georgia because she wants to go to war. Houses are burned, people are killed, and people blast cannons. Hannalee must face the hardships of her new life in war. Hannalee has to fulfill her promise to her mom about returning home to her nice and wonderful life back in Georgia.My opinion of this book is that it was action filled. Nothing ever stopped happening and Hannalee is a very brave girl to go to war. Nothing in this book was boring or dumb.I am writing from San Anselmo, CAlifornia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Turn Homeward Hannalee Already!!","review":"My 5th grade class a few weeks ago started reading this book and right after Hannalee left Georgia I wanted her to go straight back to Georgia already. This book to me was not very intrigueing. I suggest you don't read this book, but if you still want to you, your going to take a lot of time up in your life to read through this boring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual","review":"An unusual and unusually well written novel. This is partly an alternative history novel in which Britain and Germany reached a peace agreement in 1941. It is even more a complex psychological novel about the nature of twinship and an exploration of the nature of reality. The nature of the twin experience, the idea of alternative and branching realities, and the interpenetration of dream and reality, are combined in a reflecting and ultmately ambiguous manner. This book could easily be an incoherent mess or a series of shallow gimmicks, but Priest's skill as a writer and his careful research into WWII elevate this book well above the norm. While ostensibly a science fiction novel, this book is one of those rare genre works that deserve mainstream attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written","review":"This book desperately needed a thorough editing. The writing is dull and repetitive, and the lumpy structure simply does not work, including multiple repetitions of the same scenes, long and uninteresting \\"character development\\" scenes that flop around, and inexplicable jumping back and fro between timeframes. The book is boring -- after slogging through about half the book I started jumping entire pages ahead to reach the end, which is ridiculously flat. The characters are uninteresting and confusing. And the prose is banal -- even scenes that could support exciting changes in pace are poorly written. This is undoubtedly the worst book I have read in years and I felt cheated by the glowing reviews that were simply misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coverage of vocabulary and skills","review":"In my job as a middle school teacher, I have a new responsibility. Our school has recently implemented a series of \\"exploratory\\" courses allowing students to have exposure to a wide variety of subjects in 6-weeks rotations. I teach French for three weeks, and then I switch to Spanish with the same students. This resource is very helpful to increase vocabulary and skills (such as posing questions and conjugating verbs). Also, the Spanish version of the same resourceSpanish, Grades 6 - 12: Middle / High School (The 100+ Series)(author Rose Thomas) is a mirror of the same images and workbook pages, so it serves as a nice resource to connect between the two subjects for my students and me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful for class, but not for university students","review":"As a teacher, I am always looking for resources. I use it for study groups or extra materials. I just wish it had more activities in it that older students could use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didi Seven","review":"So far this product has either not worked at all or took the color out of the fabric while leaving the stain in place. I have not tried it on something fresh so that may be part of the problem. I will use it again on a fresh stain. If that doesn't work then out it goes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oustanding! Shipping could be faster.","review":"I've used this many a time before and it works wonderfully on just about every kind of natural (organic) stain on carpets, clothing and upholstery. It is my \\"Go To\\" answer for stains. I had to restock. Only negative is that shipping was slower than expected - about a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER","review":"I ordered Didi 7 from this seller over 3 weeks ago and after 2 weeks,(had not received yet) I contacted them and got NO REPLY. I filed a claim with Amazon and they cancelled the order and I got my money back. On another note, I did some research on Didi 7 and it turns out, several years back, Didi 7 was created using a recipe they had stolen from a stain remover called \\"OFF\\"! OFF can be found nearly everywhere in big grocery stores and big retailers for about half the price as on here. If I wanted a product from \\"TV\\", I'd buy it through my TV or better yet, wait a few months and get it at my local Walgreens!!
