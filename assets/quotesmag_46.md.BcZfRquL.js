Kidde's customer service is definitely not","review":"I had a house full of Kidde 1275 smoke alarms, and after several malfunctions (including one electrical problem causing it to literally \\"go up in smoke\\"), I replaced them with the i12040 ... only because I wanted something that would \\"drop in\\" with the current mounting system and wiring. That they did, and I've had no false alarms in the month they've been installed.Why the 2 stars? Previous to purchasing, I contacted Kidde (via their customer service web page) to ensure the i12040 units had the same mounting system as the old 1275's and to ensure the wiring would be compatible with all the Kidde alarms on the system. Kidde never responded. I found out from a do-it-yourself web forum that these would work fine.Kidde's customer support is notoriously poor. The old 1275 units were deficient in design and/or manufacture - and Kidde refused to acknowledge this. I won't give high marks to a company that won't respond to customer service issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked 1 month then random false alarms","review":"Replaced the older model as everyone else and was happy with how easy it was.

That it does. However it is also supposed to set off the other alarms on the same hardwired interconnected line. It does not. It works only solo. We discovered this when we bought a set of alarms that would set off each other via a wireless connection, only to have the whole system go nuts on us when we tried connecting them both. We then tried this unit in a new location and thus realized it's only setting itself off and not ALL our units as it should.

After about a year, one of the new units started with false alarms. Same time (3am), same room (bedroom). It's entirely possible there is some weird atmospheric condition in the room causing the false alarms. How are you supposed to figure that out? For now, the offending unit is disconnected. It's a small house with several other units that (so far) have not caused any trouble other than join the problem unit in the false alarm.

The inside circuit board is burned BLACK from overheating and popping a resistor. It actually got so hot it melted the white buzzer wire to the circuit board and discolored the top of the white housing! I emailed Kidde and got a stonewall of \\"that is supposed to happen (the crispy burned circuit board)\\", \\"its out of warranty\\", \\"it was a power spike\\", \\"its near the end of it useful life\\", etc. When I confronted them with the fact that if the unit had encountered a power spike, why are the rest of them okay and it didnt affect anything else in the house....at that point they simply stopped returning my emails. I am shopping for a different system to replace the Kidde CRAP, even if it means rewiring the house for a competitors system! I am turning the detector over to the Consumer Product Safety Commission for further evaluation. Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better products out there.","review":"It's been my experience that Kidde wired-in smoke alarms are prone to problems.

Our electric heat pump had a relay go defective. This caused the heat strips to activate without the fan. This caused the unit to overheat, generaing hot gases to rise through the ducts to our bedroom. We were alerted at 3:00AM by the Kidde detector and shut down the furnace before any damage could occur.There was no visible smoke just an eye burning odor. I will purchase additional Kidde alarms in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiddie Smoke Alarm","review":"This item was a replacement for one we already had.

I HATE these things. One month after they were installed they began going off one evening. No smokers, no one cooking, etc. They proceeded to go off 2 more times that night until we finally disconnected them. Two days later I come home from work to find the fire department at my house. The stupid things had been going off all day. The \\"faulty\\" detector was identified. I bought a good old fashioned battery operated one to replace it. I'm waiting for the others to fail now.

My old alarms had been going off at random times, and 10+ years old-- which is why I needed to replace them. I've had two of these units installed for ~3 weeks and not one false alarm. After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to go with the the Kidde brand, vs. the First Alert I could buy locally. I was pretty proud of myself, as a female new to home improvement projects, that I was able to successfully install two of these without any issues. I have 4 more left to install. There were only 3 wires I had to worry about and it was just a matter of connecting them. I would recommend you have a wire stripper. The first one I installed without one (using a scissors to strip the wire), and borrowed a wire stripper from the neighbor to do the second one. I've since bought my own so I'm ready to do the last 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"i12040 gotta be kidding","review":"I bought 11 of these after my 5 year old Kiddies started to give me false alarms.

Number 5 is on my lap right now because it thinks it has a dead battery, yes, even after i just put a new battery in. I probably don't need to mention that everytime they give a false alarm it is in the middle of the night. 3 kids wide awake, wifes, lets just say rather upset, and i am trying to get to sleep while high on adrenalin after running around the house trying to figure out which one is going off.

This is the 5th time that we've been woken up in the middle of the night by a screaming alarm. What you must realize is that it's not just a slightly loud sound, it's a screeching deafening sound. It woke my neighbors up. When this happens I literally jump out of bed and run in circles. Because all of the smoke detectors are connected, they all sound and you can't tell which one is the problem. We've just removed them all.

I started out a big fan of Omar Tyree's but this is ridiculous. His last great book was Just Say No, but this one was horrific. I didn't like the storyline at all, it was very slow and just idiotic. I'm not normally this hard on authors, but this was bad. I try to support Tyree's work but after this I can't continue to anymore. Sorry but this was a diappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attack of the Cliche","review":"I listened to this book on audio, and as far as I could tell it was one long, exhausting string of cliches liberally seasoned with the F word. Maybe he meant it to be -- to say that his characters think and talk in cliches like many people -- but here it served to make the whole thing rather annoying to listen to, and I felt embarrassed for the seemingly idiotic characters.I haven't read any of his other books, but this one is written in the manner of a linguistically challenged person describing a B movie in great detail to a friend.If you love cliches, you'll love this book - but unless the author meant it as a spoof on the overuse of cliche, it's hardly good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's the story of Leslie, a Haitian college student attending an HBCU. Leslie has had a rough life and is trying to better her life by attending college. She is a strong and determined to succeed. All of her family members look to her for support. When her mother calls her from her death bed, she revels to Leslie that her grandmother was an high priestess and that Leslie looks just like her. Leslie is estatic and doesn't know how to deal with this new revelation. She begins reading up on Vadou and starts taking things into her own hands when trouble comes knocking into Leslie's life.I gave this book 4 stars only because I didn't like the ending. Hopefully Mr. Tyree will give us a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD!!!","review":"To me Leslie is a very good book. Usually it is hard for me to finsih a book because the book is boring. Not Leslie. This book started out a little slow but over all it was very good. This is the first book I have read by Omar Tyree. Liking this book so much I also read Flyy Girl which is another good book. I'm 12 and it was kind of inappropiate for me(a few parts where charcters are having sex.)Other than that, I believe that this is a very good book and as long as your mature enough I really believe that you should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly","review":"i liked this book alot but to be brutallay honest i feel it was a bit direspectful to haitian people. i felt it was streotypical to automatically conect leslie being haitian to voodoo and i personally feel the book would have been much better having dis included the whole voodoo thing. overall i really did like the book and i found it hard to put down and being that im not the biggest omar tyree fan that is a bit of a suprise. i recomend this book to everyone and anyone as proof that not all his books are boring to be specific a do right man(it really wasnt a great choice if you feel me). in closing i would say that this book had me on the edge of my seat and i would read it again an again but its due tommorow (lol)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book...Lousy Ending","review":"Well written book...with a lousy ending.Why you want to treat us like that Omar?Dogg there MUST be a Sequel on the way, right?Amazon readers...Black, White or any other race, creed and/or color: If you enjoy mystery and supense, set in a real time setting...get yourself a copy of Omar's book.

Of all his books i've read, this is the best yet. Leslie, the main character was a strong, powerful young black woman. I could relate to some of the things and attitudes she showed and had towards others. She stood up for her heritage and family proudly, being a minority.I would this book again. The only bad thing about this book is the ending. He left us hanging at the end.Omar should have a sequel in the works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Social Commentary? Supernatural?","review":"Omar Tyree had good intentions of writing an insightful look into the lives of the haves and have nots of black society. But, there is an excess of everything. An excess of characters, subplots, genres. I never felt like I knew or cared about any of the characters. Leslie justifies all of her actions by stating she just wants to be left alone. The voodoo plot is poorly examined and improbable. There are too many characters and too many viewpoints without explanation or motivation. The ending is inconclusive and begs for a sequel. Wait and read the sequel, you won't have missed much."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ...!!","review":"It was a struggle to finish reading this book! It was highly unrealistic. And it was very annoying reading the French and the English translation. I also found that Omar Tyree treated his reader as an idiot as he still felt the need more than half way thru the book to keep saying \\"Her sister, Latecia\\" well hello I already know, that is her sister!! Don't get me wrong I liked his other books but I just think he really fell off with this one. I'm really surprised I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favorites","review":"I loved this novel. i've been a fan of Omar since i read Flyy Girl. i've been hooked to his books since then. Leslie is one of the books that i couldn't put down, i loved it from start to finish. As for me being a hbcu student right now, i loved that it was based at a hbcu and on top of that in New Orleans, Louisiana. One of my favorite cities to travel to. The way he introduced each family member, made me had a love for each one. It's a thriller, horror, and love story. He really out did himself with this one. You go OMAR!!!! i recommend this book to everyone,if you don't like to read this could be a great start, it has drama and sex all tied in one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"Leslie and Diary of a Groupie, Mr. Tyree's two most recent books have been horrible. Leslie was a terrible story that was too long and just seemed thrown together. There really was no reason for the murders to take place and the whole voodoo portion of the book was just thrown in there to add some spunk which didnt work. I'm glad I bought this book used, but still mad I even wasted [$$] on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dark and unrealistic","review":"i read this book- i thought omar missed the mark on this one- the storyline was dark without any real explanation as to why, it concentrated on the myth of voodoo and i never once felt connected to one of his characters. leslie was what- to who? the story was told from so many characters- the 3 roomates, her brother, father, sister and even her mother. my question, is \\"who is leslie\\"- to the reader? was i to feel sorry for her strifes in early child hood? was this to justify the unreal acts of violence that peppered the book. (i did not think so) well, i 'll pass on the seasoning the next ime round... the book was preaching in one voice and justifying violence in another... i was perplexed to what the message was here... the story jumped about so often, i could not form a picture in my head who was who from the first chapter. this was not one of omar tyree's best books- not by a long shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is my first Omar Tyree book and I am truly disappointed. I had heard that he has good books, but this one was a turn off for me. It was too simple; It almost seemed childish. The whole story line was so unbelievable. The characters were lame. I may try another one of his books, but I hope my next choice will help me get over the disgust I have with this particular book. Sorry Omar Tyree fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very lazy work","review":"This book was very lazy. It just dragged on and oooooooooooon. I took a liking to the main character Leslie, but i wish i could put her in the hands of Toni Morrison or a better author and watch her blossom into a much better story. I was a little confused and disappointed with the ending. It was like Leslie was in the wrong story. There could have been so much more done with this character, but Mr. Tyree was too lazy to be creative. I ended up throwing the book away or giving it away, i dont even remember. Its just not sitting on my shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Disappointing","review":"I felt strained to complete this book. It took too long to bring the story together. By the time it got interesting enough to not put down it was over. What I would like to see is a sequel. But only if Leslie is still the main character and has beaten the charges against her. To see her learn about her powers and how to use them without all the wrongfully placed vengence would be good. The other priestess who recognized as the war priestess has a lot to offer. I felt there were too many loose strings left and the book had no closure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Punk Rock movie","review":"A lot of films claim to be made in the Punk Rock style and of course they are not.

Lyrics are well thought out, and hopeful, but of course contain the nowadays obligatory cliches.There are several notable tracks on this album:1. Silhouette: acoustic to hard rock, really moving song with a 60's southern country-rock feel.2. Light sleeper: haunting melody line that drifts along with the song, and it has a *gasp* key change!! Which is unheard of nowadays.3. Autumn Red: a 3:4 song that again has some great melodies.I would definitely recommend this album, nice and refreshing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New addiction to Driveblind","review":"I absolutely LOVE the Driveblind album!

Randy, who just moved to Minnesota from NYC, is wild and outspoken. Sabrina is bubbly and talkative, everyone's friend. Shy Allison is a brilliant student, and preppy Katie is used to playing by all the rules. But against all odds, the girls become friends.In the first book, the girls further bond against Stacy, the snobby principal's daughter who never ceases to gossip and try to tear down other people, as they try to get used to life in the seventh grade.The one characteristic that makes Girl Talk stand out from other series is that each book includes several \\"transcripts\\" of telephone conversations between the girls, usually about whatever the chief problem of the particular book is.

The author's spare text is thoughtful without being intrusive; a perfect compliment to the compelling images that accompany it. The text conveys a straightforward warmth and appreciation for the author's subject that are both refreshing and inspiring. This is a book to pore over, savor, and return to.

In each chapter, they give examples and run downs on how our actions/behaviors affect the actions/behaviors/potential of our children and how to recognize whether we need to work in the particular area or not.

It is not entirely different, but as of this year, it includes \\"simulation\\" questions that are extended case studies. This book will not help you prepare specifically for those, so you will need to use the resources NBCOT offers through its website.(Also, the review tests in this book will not give you feedback on whether you would have passed the test.

There is one central camera shot throughout - you do not see the crowd or any thing else; the video is focused only on His Holiness and his translator. His translator is used about 50% of the time, but he is very articulate and helps the overall discussion rather than hinders it. His Holiness always adds a compassionate humor to his dialogues, and this is no different.There are some issues during certain times with the microphone cutting in and out, but if I were to guess, I'd say it was caused by His Holiness adjusting his robe that kept displacing itself from his shoulder and inadvertently bumping the mic. The problem lasts only a few minutes.

Unfortunately, most of the book is devoted to the angst she suffers unrelentingly for 20+ years. There is little indication that she achieved much emotional growth during this time. One is left with the impression that she would have been a happier, healthier person had she chosen to work with incest clients as a private therapist rather than a county social services employee. This book describes one woman's emotional journey, but is not a good representation of actual work within the child protective services system. The book also would have benefited from a good editor and a decent spellcheck program. Misspellings and grammatical errors abound, and in at least two instances lilac bushes bloom in the late summer. The author even manages to misspell the name of her favorite 1980's Boulder restaurant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This book, while worthwhile to some, is not autobiographical, and should not be advertised as such.

This is a must read book that tells the story of one family who endured great hardship at the hands of the United States Government (during WWII). There was no crime, yet a father, a mother, and two young boys were imprisoned as criminals. The story also tells of compassion shown by a few people to help two boys return to the country that was their home. A moving story, that tells of the courage and determination of a young boy seeking to return to the country he knew as home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hohenasperg?","review":"A good read, I rate it highly. And it's important for reminding us that Japanese-Americans weren't the only internees. But the title is misleading; if you're looking for information about Hohenasperg, this is *not* the book for you. The author spent only one week at Hohenasperg, and that appears to have been due to an administrative error which was rectified fairly quickly. Hohenasperg appears as little more than a refrain in this story. And though his father appears to have been mistreated, and this of course had a negative impact on the entire family, the other family members were voluntary internees, choosing to remain with the father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you like hunting","review":"This is not a video for someone who actually enjoys hunting, the \\"hunters\\" in this film clearly have no talent.

Use this and an internet translator site (like Babelfish)and you can make your reservations in some of the same hotels that Edelweiss and other formal tour groups use.This new edition expands on the first by adding Corsica and updating the Alps/Dolemite section.

This is totally an annoyance, to drop what one is doing and get bare handed to operate the most used blade is not well thought out. Using the Wave, I can open the most used blades with gloved, one hand operation. It seems like a small thing but in everyday use, the Wave wins hands down.

The pliers are sturdy enough to do almost everything except the heaviest work you would normally use a lineman's pliers for. The more typical \\"Swiss Army\\" tools (e.g. screwdrivers, blade, bottle and can opener) work just like they do in a typical SAK. I've used the saw a few times to cut small branches and drywall, and it seems as sharp as new. The only damage I've been able to do was to dull the wire cutters a bit; I only use them now on copper, and I overtorqued the smallest driver and twisted it a bit.

It's a shame it didn't last very long. Is it an accurate description of the comic book Spider-Man? No, but so what! Neither are the other cartoons, or the movies for that matter. It's really as if we go back to the early days of Peter Parker (which would have been in the early '60's) and see what it would have been like if it took place in the early 21st century.

Fortunately he did not catch the swearing (we don't curse around him) and he's too young to understand anything sexual. But he is at an age when questions about death arise and this did not help. If you do choose to let your younger viewer watch this then definitely use caution but I wouldn't recommend it.From my adult eye, I also have to say I'm not a big fan of that style of animation.

The computer animation is downright creepy, the character designs are unoriginal and repetitive, and the backgrounds are bland and boring. But I could deal with all of that if there was good writing. Instead, we get generally boring scripts fighting villains that mean nothing in the overall Spider-Man mythos.

This \\"hip\\" new version won't snag a new audience, there's too much superior competition. The current X-men cartoon series sets the standard, followed closely by DC's Justice League. The new Spiderman cartoon is a lame attempt to cash in on the Tobey Maguire movie's success, well if owner Avi Arad (sounds like a third rate villian) wants to cash in yet again - he'll need to dig a little deeper into his fat pockets.

It lets you use the leverage designed into the tool to position each board where you want it and to hold that position while you fasten the board. You simply can't do that by hand. It may look expensive based on the parts description I gave, but it will save you both time and money and make your finished project look much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Works great for straightening out planks.

My son in law's dad was kind of the \\"expert\\" on this project and he was skeptical at first of the tool, but after putting down a few boards he was sold on the tool, it works great and saves a lot of grunting and groaning trying to pull the boards straight.

However, it was a big disappointment. It lacks an adequate grip on the joists, and tends to slip back along the joist, just when you are at a critical point. They need to redesign the gripper jaws to really grip the joist. I'd recommend some type of cam-like action. To keep it from slipping I found that I had to drive a screwdriver or a couple of nails behind it into the joist. The same problem occurs with the \\"Adjustable\\" attachment for wider joists. All-in-all I would not recommend wasting your money. A crow-bar or heavy screwdriver driven into the joist works just as well and is easy to use.

Cocaine Decisions and Nig-Biz are recorded during the famous riot in Palermo. The band keeps playing over the crack of tear-gas grenades; one of the most chilling live recordings since Bob Dylan's 1966 Manchester Free Trade Hall gig (the \\"Judas!\\" concert.)

Because the cutting teeth are oriented on the pull stroke, you get a thinner kerf. A thinner kerf means less material to cut through so you get a finer cut with less effort.

Great for trim carpentry work as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine tool for cutting SOFT materials","review":"The replacement blades are ridiculously expensive, especially relative to the price of the saw, but this is a fine tool. great for all types of cutting in wood or plastic.

The reason ozzy did the cover songs for the box set to begin with was because he was sick of his fans being ripped off, you see Ozzy knows he has too many but the record label was gonna put out the box set either way. Ozzy decieded to put out some cover songs as something extra for the fans.He didn't have the time to put the effort into make a new studio album so what he did was recorded some stuff while he was on the road at Ozzfest 2004. That might actualy be the downfall of this record actualy, Ozzy didn't have the proper time to do it right and after getting off stage every night was probably realy tired, it might come across as Ozzy not putting enough effort into the songs.Now that this is done Ozzy should take a little break and then get back to doing what he does best, making some new orifinal music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its what was needed","review":"I read a review on here from a person who stated why Ozzy released a box-set and all. The reviewer is right. Ozzy didn't want to release the box-set but the record label told him it was time and it was going to be released no matter what. If you people don't like Ozzy, or think he should retire, then don't purchase his cds or even listen to him. He is supposed to be going into the studio, giving a no-one guitarist a chance to play with Ozzy (wich is definitly a an honor) on a new album. You all know damn well, if he asked even a great guitar player from any band, they would gladly play on a new Ozzy record. He wants to bring someone new into the metal world. How could fans of metal music be dissing the architecht of metal himself? He made this music, and he does it best. He will die before he gives up metal. Peace out Keep Metal Alive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"While I am of the opinion that much of Ozzy's recent work is quite good (I Just Want You, Perry Mason, Junkie, Gets me Through), this is not. A truly awful product.While this is supposed to be a tribute to classic songs Ozzy treasures, most of the arrangments are so bad it may discourage younger listeners from hearing the originals versions. If you haven't heard King Crimson's \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", Mountain's \\"Mississippi Queen\\", Arthur Brown's \\"Fire\\", or (god forbid) the Stones \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" do yourself a favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!!!","review":"I only listened to the previews of this album and DON'T BUY IT!!!!!! He picked the wrong songs to cover. Sunshine of Your Love (Cream), Sympathy for the Devil (The Rolling Stones), Mississippi Queen (Mountain).

The true fans bought the box set and there is no reason that the extra tracks on this release couldn't have been put on there just as easily, but since the record company and the Ozzy camp felt the need to make some more money (as if they both really needed it) they decided to tack on a couple of outtakes from the original sessions and repackage it as \\"new\\" product. If you want your fans to support you, then you also have to support them by giving them their money's worth and not issuing rehashed product. Everyone is starting to do this now and as long as the public buys it, the record companies will keep it coming. With all that said, the cover versions on here work for the most part, some more than others, so I would have to give it 3 or 4 stars for the music, but the marketing ploy brings it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozzy listens to the same music my parents do","review":"This album is good, suprisingly good for an aging rocker who nearly died about 2 years ago. His voice hasn't changed much since \\"Blizzard of Ozz,\\" he still sounds like good ol' Ozzy. Jerry Cantrell did some excellent guitar work here.

It's amazing what people will do for money. Even double crossing loyal fans. The only thing redeeming about this cd is Jerry Cantrell's guitar work. truly he is one of the most underated guitarists of all time. he gets 5 stars in my book, this cd does not. so Ozzy releases a box set and does the right thing in putting quite a bit of unreleased and new material. then he releases this which has all the stuff you bought the box set for plus 3 or 4 new songs, so if you want all the songs you have to buy this too. A swift kick to the groin indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"Oh how the mighty have fallen. I think the vessel that used to contain Ozzy is just being led around by Sharon.

Jeffries brought Helena and Daniel to life and did not change their behaviors or feelings simply because they were now main characters. The adventure and humor was wonderful, and the way Helena and Daniel interacted was great. The two were both useful in getting out of difficult situations in taverns and on the road. (Helena with her cane and Daniel with his glares). And they certainly did manage to get into quite a few scrapes! It was nice not to have a book filled with stupid misunderstandings, but rather with adventure and fun. It would be helpful to have read A Dangerous Love before this book.

Absolutely, and no one does it better and with the worlds most amazing band than FZ!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remaster sounds like butt.","review":"This CD has the worst mix. Drums sound like poop, and the vocals are in your face, and annoying. This remaster improves nothing except the Zappa's bank account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommeded","review":"The die-hard Zappa fans love to cut this album down since it lacks the eight minute guitar solos and tons of overdubs. Some say it's too silly and comes from that era where Frank released double albums because he could. But this is a funny, complex, and definetely one of the most accessable albums he made. Nothing too wild or cacaphonic. Everything stated in earlier reviews (Coneheads, title track, etc), is true. Long story short, it's a very enjoyable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control","review":"I realize that Zappa was releasing music to amuse and occupy himself without regard to critical or commercial reception. Nonetheless, far too much of this album sounds half-baked. Employing lyrics that are, on average, mediocre just obscures the technical complexity of the instruments. What might have been a fine instrumental becomes an ad hoc attempt at topicality. Granted, a song like \\"You Are What You Is\\" succeeds beautifully, but too many of the other songs are unfunny and poorly crafted lyrically. Most of this period is hit and miss in a given album and this proves no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Frank, what happened?","review":"Do yourself a favour: if you haven't heardWe're Only in It for the Money, beg, borrow or buy a copy straight away. On that album, Frank Zappa produced a brilliant suite of tight, bitter little songs and experimental segues that systematically dissected the late 1960s. Such was the strength of that album that it remains relevant and compelling even today.'You Are What You Is' tries to do the same for the late 1970s and fails pathetically. Wit, experimentation and genuine artistry have been replaced by nasty smut, college-freshman level social comment and empty virtuosity. This is a messy, mean-spirited failure from a once great artist.GrabWe're Only in It for the Money- preferably withLumpy GravyandUncle Meatas well - instead: that remains a great trilogy and a crucial piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"so cool","review":"my brother has a copy of this book, and i just loved it. it has everything. it's great, every fan of punk rock should own this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artist pictures were graphic but it's Freud...","review":"I'd completed a Psy 101 class with a glossing over of Freud and I just wanted to cement in some concepts and possible inspire some additional readings. I was impressed that the language used was easy but not insulting. The glossary in the back was handy. The commical pictures helped to quickly illustrate the points being made. I read cover to cover and found myself laughing out loud a few times. While Freud certainly is interesting, I am now moving on to read some others written about in the series. A few of the pictures I thought would be nice to have as a fun note card; some illustrations were just overboard. I certainly would not want a child or teen to come across the pictures in this book.

The \\"Music Box\\" is actually a piano (a present for Billy Gilbert from his wife) inside of an appropriate sized crate. Take one L&H, one VERY long stairway, one highly MOBILE crate, one locked home (Gilbert had just left), one baby carriage pushing female who laughs at L&H, one stern policeman, shake well, and you've got one hilarious cocktail of delivery mayhem. The timing never misses a beat and the special effects are incredible, especially noteworthy for a film produced in the 1920s. The \\"Music Box\\" seems to have a life of its own which only adds to the hilarity of the situation.

This way, I can slide the hooks to any position on the rail and add additional hooks as I get more pots.

My nails were finishing nails whose tops were flush with the surface of the wood and therefore couldn't be pulled using a claw hammer. I might have given this five stars except I don't have any experience with other nail pullers. Oh, I used an 8oz rubber mallet with this nail puller, though I understand a \\"machinist\\" hammer (e.g. \\"ball-pean\\") would work too (eye protection is a good idea in either situation).

One of the worst aspects of the program is that there are description of the sounds and definitions -- all written in ENGLISH. If children are supposed to use the CD to learn the sounds of the language, I can guarantee that they are not reading the lengthy definitions.

You see that it was not an easy job and that we did have to make some sacrifices.

A real hunk of junk. Stay away from this product, unless if you are happy buying a new two hundred dollar vcr every five months. Obviously while parts are under warranty, the labor isn't after 90 days, so you would pay as much fixing it as to buy a new one. What a waste of money. I've had bad vcr's before, but this is by far the WORST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most user friendly VCR","review":"It looks good sitting on top of the DVD player, the picture and sound are decent. So why am I not happy? I have used VCRs for more years than I care to admit. I have never, since my first archaic VCR had a problem programming them to record a show in the future even without opening the user manual. The programming of this VCR is not at all user friendly! You would think to just hit the menu or program button and be on your way following a step by step menu to set time, date, etc. But not on this VCR. But even if you get past that part, I was frustrated because I could not just punch numbers to set the time and date for recording, it had to be done by half hour increments for time (without an am/pm toggle no less) and day increments for date. I do not have time for that when I am trying to program the VCR on my way out the door to work. I want to hit the numbers and keep it moving. I typically love JVC products but this appears to be a poor relation."},{"rating":"2","title":"HR S3901U","review":"TO ALL THE MANY THAT HAD PROBLEMS WITH THIS VCR GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND LEARN HOW TO READ AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTONS.

The soundtrack was recorded with the 106 member Los Angeles Philharmonic. This disc is a re-recording with a 65 piece orchestra, helmed by composer Ernest Gold. However, all of the well remembered themes are here, and some bits of memorable dialogue. Also included are full versions of \\"Thirty One Flavors,\\" and \\"You Satisfy My Soul\\" - the songs heard during the scenes with Dick Shawn and Barrie Chase.

I have seen the movie dozens of times and it's just wonderful to have the music available when I drive around, though somewhat less madly than these characters.

Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus is SO much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, if you like the music equivalent of pablum","review":"The Jonas Brothers are geniuses in the same way Britney Spears was the most original artist of her generation. Basically, the cultural powers that be at Disney decided to pluck a New Jersey trio of photo-ready teens from obscurity and ram them down the throats of teenage girls (especially the ones who do not yet have enough sophistication to download pirated music from Chinese servers).

They're the next big thing! Buy it!!!","review":"Which is more or less the line from the usual trend [...] sources. What I heard here is the standards of modern music being pushed further down into the ground and recieving another brutal beating. The Jonas Brothers suck, alright. But that's not the real issue. The issue is what are we going to do about the crappy record companies that market this UTTERLY DERIVATIVE effort which has as much difference from Hannah Montanna as Kylie Minogue varied from Jason Donavon back in those days? Ignorant teeny boppers and their dumb, brain addled soccer mom folks.

Can't wait for their next album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!","review":"All I have to say is wow! I am a HUGE JB fan and this completed my JB collection..for now anyway. The second I got it, the 2 new songs went straight onto my ipod and the dvd went into my DVD player. I LOVE the music videos especially S.O.S and the concert was sooo good! These boys are one of the most talented groups to come up in a long time. There music is upbeat and inspirational. They combine positive messages with guitar and drums and do it beautifully. Nick's voice is just off the charts and Kevin's guitar talent is in more then I can put into words. Joe's energy on stage will keep you jumping and wanting more. Coming from an 18 year old, you need to BUY this! believe me, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for kids and parents","review":"This CD was selected by our 7 year old. He and his 2-year-old sister really enjoy the upbeat, sing along friendly songs. The themes of the songs are sometimes silly, but this isn't for me. That being said, I do not mind at all having this CD playing incessantly in the CD player. The music is pretty good and it is something we can all enjoy. I highly recommend it for any kids that are looking for something that is just for them, but a little more mature than the \\"little kid\\" songs!

I would definitely buy it for the live concert footage! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jo Bros Make Fun and Upbeat Music","review":"I have recently become a fan of this band. This album is a step up from their debut \\"It's About Time,\\" with funkier, more complex songs. Hit songs \\"SOS,\\" and \\"When you Look me in the Eyes,\\" drive the album, while tracks such as \\"Goodnight and Goodbye,\\" and \\"Hello Beautiful,\\" trace te bands evolution from rock to soul. There is something for everyone on this album. The reason for four stars is that compared to their new album \\"A Little Bit Longer,\\" \\"Jonas Brothers,\\" falls short of the emotion portrayed in songs such as \\"A Little Bit Longer,\\" \\"Sorry,\\" and \\"Can't Have you.\\" However, this album is better than most of their peers including Miley Cyrus. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"killer hooks, great rhythms, awesome lyrics","review":"What can I say? The Jonas Brothers have certainly matured since they recorded their last album It's About Time. Gone is the youthful innocent voice of youngest member, Nick. Also gone are the angelic pop sounding tunes that defined their early sound. Their latest album, which the Jonas brothers co-wrote and performed on, features slamming punk rock rhythms, crunchy electric guitar licks, and killer hooks. The songs are very catchy and permeate your brain instantly. If you wrote off their first album as a KidsBop type of novelty, think again and listen to this album. These guys are really talented for teens and I give the album 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, great tool, made even better...","review":"This is a wonderful tool. I picked up a leatherman tool just over eight months ago and just received the tool adaptor. It takes an already extremely practical tool and makes it even more so.

After getting the attachment, I am scouring local hardware stores for more great hex bits. Now if i could only find a great carrying case for all my bits..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated Zappa album","review":"I'm going to dissent from the consensus here and give The Man From Utopia five stars, since I think it's one of Zappa's most important albums from the 1980s. The chief attraction is the development of his technique of independent sprechgesang/parlando in tunes like The Dangerous Kitchen and The Jazz Discharge, where he's basically rendering a half-sung/half-spoken atonal vocal line that's harmonically and rhythmically independent from the accompanying instruments. Steve Vai famously doubles the vocal lines in a manner that Zappa seems to have developed in parallel with musicians like Scott Johnson (John Somebody came out in 1982), and well ahead of others like Estonian Péter Etövös, who famously worked with Stockhausen and cited this album as a major influence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than my vinyl...again!","review":"This was the biggest surprise i got when buying the cds of lps i already have. Of course everybody knows about some mixing differences in almost all of the catalogue, or the adding of modern bass and drums to the old tracks in Ruben & The Jets, or the added vocals on Sleep Dirt...all of which irritated many people. This was the last cd i bought as my spanish printed lp sounded good. For sure i was not expecting the changes in chorus and lead vocals of 'cocaine decisions', the extra organ which changed everything harmonically in 'The Dangerous Kitchen', the totally different mix in 'the radio is broken' or the extra song (Luiggi and the wise guys) which is not in my vinyl version.Is it better? no, it is just another version of the same album.

Man, could he be a real jerk sometimes. For me, this is unquestionably his worst album ever. The songs sound like something he could come up with in his sleep. Even the instrumentals are boring. The production and sound quality (normally top notch on a Zappa album) isn't up to his standards at all. The only thing Zappa is telling me here, is how sick and tired he really was of making \\"rock\\" albums at this point of his career. Believe me, together with \\"Drowning Witch\\", \\"Francesco Zappa\\" and \\"Thing Fish\\" this is an album to avoid unless you are a serious copletist of FZ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is going wrong","review":"Unfortunately this FZ's album make me cry for the money i spend for it...

What happens to Spock makes no -- forgive me -- logical sense. The author doesn't tidy up the gaping plot holes very much. She just puts a little more meat on the bones of story that already has skeletal flaws. Huge chunks of the novel were so close to word for word recitations of the movie's dialogue, they might as well have reprinted the actual script and sold that.And call me a stickler but I do wish these writers would study a bit more Star Trek cannon and the technical details rights. The Kirk's Enterprise is NOT a Constellation class starship. It's a Constitution class. Kruge's ship is a Bird of Prey not a \\"fighter\\".

Space Viking has the sheer readability and forward momentum of good pulp science fiction but with an extra historical dimension lacking in most pulp. Or to put it another way, this could be the best Heinlein-style novel not written by Heinlein. Also could well have been an influence on Star Wars, but don't let that put you off. Set in the same (\\"Terro-Human\\") future history as Piper's Fuzzy novels, but after the breakup of the Federation. The stand-alone quality of Space Viking, plus the action and economy, put it a notch higher in my affection than the Fuzzy series. This was probably his best sf novel and should by rights be put back into print."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost science fiction classic","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was in my late teens; I recently re-read it and found it to be as exciting as the first time around.

It is one thing to listen to him play; it is quite another to see him play. All I could say was \\"how did he do that\\", even after seeing him.

The sound quality and picture quality were pretty good, considering the filming from the mid 80's and transfer from some older source. All the songs were really fun and have watched it numerous times. Compared to something like 'Orchestra Yes' DVD, it was inferior. I highly recommend this DVD; as I had looked on the web for copies of it for a few years and was hesitant to order some bootleg cheap version. I'm glad I waited.

He has been on multiple episodes-- nice if they could have pulled from the multiple appearances.Nitpicks aside- this is a great DVD- His beautiful performance of Are You Experienced alone is worth the price. Amazing to watch him play a solo live that originally was presented backwards. All tracks are standouts.Like many of you, it brings back my memories of trying to catch this on VHS back in High School- and being amazed at his versatilityt, speed, and seemingly impossible left-hand contortions.

However, if you are looking for some great Zappa guitar solos, look elsewhere, this cd contains maybe about ten chords and possibly a five second solo somewhere in there. Guitar aside, it's clear that these are the songs which Zappa put the least amount of effort into. So, if you're prepared to buy a cd merely for its amusing qualities and you're ready to turn all your musical tastes off, be my guest. If you want a fine Zappa album, again, look elsewhere. These are not good songs, and if you like them, I'm sorry if I am offending you, you're tone-deaf.

This is not his first book on the subject, and he treats it with a personal touch that makes it very captivating to anybody, not just New Yorkers. This book is a treasure of little-known facts, peculiarities and anecdotes. I had a lot of fun reading it along with a map of today's network, to see how it evolved (and sometimes \\"devolved\\"). Very lively, with some classic NY politics, some catastrophies (including the departure of the Dodgers), and descriptions of how the subway helped make NY what it is today.

Looks great as my computer monitor, PS3 looks nice as well on hdmi. My only complaint so far is that the hd tuner in my tv seems to get weak signals on a couple channels. It's frustrating tryin to watch NBA playoffs in hi def when the tv keeps glitching out."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first HDTV","review":"I recently decided to upgrade from my old 32\\" CRT TV. The size of this TV is perfect for my apartment, the quality is top notch, and the price was unbeatable through Amazon. I priced the same TV through several local retailers and found the next cheapest deal on the same TV to cost about $1000 more with tax included. The TV shipped within about 7-8 business days in perfect condition. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsung HLS-5679W - Excellent","review":"This is the perfect TV if you are looking for high quality picture and aren't concerned with mounting the TV on the wall (you can't...) The picture is incredible and it is a BIG screen to enjoy your favorite movies. Great design allows the TV to fit nicely in a family room setting without overwhelming the room. Nice sound though would recommend a high quality surround sound system if you want the full experience. Amazing price on Amazon, at about $1550 I cannot think of another TV that can compete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Have had this TV for over 5 years. Not as flat as some others now, but excellent picture and sound for anything, especially sports and gaming. Although, I had to replace the motherboard ($100 after some intense searching) about a year after purchasing, I will chalk this up to a simple defect in the factory part as the replacement board has last quite a while now (Knocks on wood)."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to fix this TV once it breaks","review":"This review is more for people who already bought the TV and wonder why it isn't working after a year and a half or so.

(You'll notice color banding on every SD mode with the exception of movie mode, which is washed out) Unfortunately, I am not an expert and I am having trouble calibrating this tv correctly myself. At under $1400 this tv is a great deal, but if I have to spend $400 on a professional calibrator, the \\"deal\\" kinda disappears.For the record, I have also seen the 5687w out of the box, and the settings are slightly better, but still not great.

First he replased the main and then he replaced the sub power, both not doing anything to solve the propblem with the picture. The worst thing is that they didnt have any LED in stock which was the part that was badly needed! I'm currently waiting for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"This TV is Garbage and so is Samsung","review":"I purchased this TV in April of 2007 and it was faulty from the start. The screen kept flickering pink every once in a while, until about 2 weeks ago the screen went dark. No picture, no color, just sound... whatever happened to TVs lasting like 15-20 years like the ones my parents used to own.I called Samsung and they sent a request to their crappy middlemen service company. These idiot service people don't know anything about fixing TVs and they take their sweet time ordering parts from Samsung. It's been over a week and it could take another 2 more weeks.I find this UNACCEPTABLE. Samsung's TVs are garbage and so is their service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within a week","review":"I didn't even have this TV a week when the LED engine died, leaving only the sound but no picture. Now I'm faced with the frustrating task of dealing with Samsung's wretched customer service. Since there's no authorized Samsung repair centers in my area, I was told I'd have to wait at least 2 weeks for Samsung to authorize a local repairman to fix my TV. Of course, once they find someone to fix it, I'll probably have to wait at least another 2 weeks before the set is actually fixed. Now I wish I had bought a TV at a local store so I could just call them and have them haul this piece of junk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The price will keep dropping -- for good reason","review":"Video and audio are out of sync. Blacks in non HD programming are often grainy. It has an audio optical out, but it does not pass along DD 5.1 signal, so it's pointless to use the tv's audio output. \\"white glove\\" delivery service is a total joke. That is, a disaster. Insufficient space to describe the entire chronology, but Eagle and their partners are buck-passing incompetents. To top it off, when set was finally delivered, I had to help the driver unload it from the truck and then help him place it on the stand. The final topper is that the price drops by more than $100 just after I purchase. Sometimes a bargain is not worth the $ you save. I would return this lemon if it were not for the myriad hoops through one has to leap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV I have ever owned.","review":"I love this dlp tv. Incredible picture.

I decided to purchase this samsung instead. I made the right choice. PLANET EARTH HD on this thing looks awesome!!! STAR WARS on HBOHD has been a new experience for me.

I'm still trying to get the best color settings figured out, but that's to be expected.The only complaint is the verticle light shift that is noticed when you are either above or below the center of the TV. You can definately notice a decrease in brightness. That makes the height placement of the TV tough, ie. if you play a Wii standing up vs. sitting on a couch for a movie.Overall I'm very pleased. No snags or hitches anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and moving","review":"This is the first Indonesian film I've ever seen, and I got a preview copy from a guy who was on the crew in San Francisco (no names!).

How the American director can be permitted to use a blurb describing himself as some sort of Indonesian avant-garde filmmaker is beyond me. You want bad Indonesian fun? Check out Lady Terminator or Mystics of Bali on dvd. You want high quality subtitled films? Look at what's available from Between Three Worlds Video at Monash University. This movie though is a real dog.There is one redeeming feature: the revelatory acting of Pak John Wolff, America's most influential Indonesian language teacher. I watched the movie with a gang of former Cornellians, Indonesians and Americans. We could barely stand to watch the thing (and ended up fast-forwarding a bit) but whenever Pak John appeared, as a colonial Dutch ghost, we were doubled over laughing.So muridnya Pak John, nontonlah.

Jena Malone (Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, Stepmom) shines in this film, just like she always does. Two things that will always go together are Jena Malone & an Indie/Black Comedy. But I'll have to admit some of the best acting in this film was that of Brad Renfro (The Client). He plays a 'closet' homosexual, and the obvious reason he hides it is because of his \\"tough as nails\\" prison father.A lot of the characters in this film are like a lot of people you know & see in real life. And thought most label them as poor, white trash...You discover in \\"COAG\\" that they have passionate souls too.Also, on another note..Clifton Collins, Jr. was one of the best things in this film, and one of the funniest too. So, buy it, rent it..do what you must. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Confessions","review":"Jena plays Rena Grubb, a pregnant teenager. She resides in a trailer home with her brother who may possibly be gay, her half-sister, and her mom. Her father is in prison. In addition to the various assorted issues at home, the movie leads up to a family visit to prison where a few more issues arise. This movie is an awakening for Rena and her family. Before the visit, Rena idolized her father, however, comes to see that he is a loser. Incredibly, by the end of the visit, the family came to realize they have each other and can begin to move on with their lives. Which is the redeeming feature of this witty dark humored movie. Although the movie was released in 2002 it is timely, especially in light of the television hit, \\"Secret Life of the American Teenager.\\" If you are a Jena Malone fan and for some reason have not seen this movie, you need to see it. Jena Malone at her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only music to soothe my baby!","review":"This CD was the only music that would calm down my baby when he was upset.

The dialogue excerpts (likely from a film or video master) make the music sound worse because they're crisp and clear. (Although we can do without that dead Groucho joke about the elephant. Obviously the film wasn't a laff riot.) Yet another case of bad engineers wreaking havoc on good music, an enjoyable (though not especially memorable) Sherman Brothers concoction from the movie musical's last days.

After that, maybe you'll be fine. Also, and this is probably true of all JVC VCR's, I found it very difficult to use, and I'm very gadget literate.Funny thing is, I bought this just to transfer approx 10 tapes onto DVD (feeding VCR output into computer), and then probably wouldn't need it anymore. I used it twice, and then couldn't even get the VCR to turn on. Unfortunately, this was after 3 months of business travel, so warranty expired - out of luck. When I called JVC, they said I could take it to a service center for an hourly labor - yeah right!I noticed the fuse inside was blown, but every time I replaced it, it would just blow again. I never liked JVC for other devices, but thought they might make good VCR's. Now I will never buy anything from them period."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor performer","review":"I've had this machine for over a year and experienced recurring problems with its performance.

Other than that it's the same thing. I've had mine for about five years now and am quite satisfied with it. One handy feature mine has is called \\"Nite Mode\\". This mode darkens the picture to make it easier on your eyes if you're watching at night with the lights off. VCR programming is easy and intuitive.The only major improvement I'd make is to the quality of the remote as certain buttons on mine have begun to stick or not work at all. I suppose it's normal wear and tear so I got a universal remote to deal with that. Another thing I'd like is the option of a rear A/V input as opposed to having them in front because this makes for some awkward running of cables around the set.

On tarnished metal, a bit of compound helps to remove the tarnish at the cost of shortening the life of the wheel, which is to be expected.I really wonder how hard it would be to make these from a piece of stiff felt at only a fraction of the cost.

I felt as if he was a child trying to call attention to himself rather than letting the stories speak for themselves.I also got annoyed with the emphasis on celebrities. Many of the stories featuring celebrities were simply not all that interesting, and would have been too weak to include in such a book if the main characters had been no-names. To me, they came across as gratuitous name-dropping.Still, it was nice to see a book that painted a realistic picture of what it's like to be a belly dancer, and some of the stories were rather funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disgrace","review":"This book is absolutely terrible. Maybe a couple of funny stories but overall it is an incredible waste and a torture to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is perhaps the WORST book I have ever suffered through.","review":"The only reason I give this book one star is that Amazon won't let me give it a zero or negative rating. I hope it was printed on recycled paper, because it would be a crime against the universe to have cut down a tree for this bumfodder.Most of the stories don't even have a humorous element as they are little more than celebrity name-dropping, and even the potentially funny stories are killed by Long's lack of talent and his trying to make himself the center of attention.If this book is an example of Long's comedy, his live \\"performances\\" must violate the Geneva Convention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough laughs","review":"I waited from this book to find funny stories about dancers from all over the world but there were just few stories that really were funny. Book was filled with stories by Jodette and Dallal, of which the first was really boring: maybe it was fun to live that life but for sure it was not fun to read... and what has the last story about Prince fan do in this book? There could have been so much more to read if the author was more concentrating to really fun and interesting stories instead of dropping famous names."},{"rating":"2","title":"less force needed on this one than on its competitors","review":"You need to exert less force on this squeezer than its competitors - I had one that looked like the Norco (dark green enamel finish).The Norco or its look alike lasted regular, near daily use for four years until the spindle thing that holds the two pieces together just snapped in two one day. The enamel was also peeling off.The finish on this OXO version is more durable and looks like it can't chemically or physically peel off. This item is superior in feel and design to the one I had. Should last a few years, hopefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Device","review":"I'm quite happy with the squeezer. It's exceptionally solid and comfortable for the price, yet compact for the drawer. I'm pretty strong, yet I think I'd have trouble breaking it. I do wish it were slightly larger. It's labeled as a lemon/lime squeezer but a big ol' California lemon is a tight fit. A little larger and you could squeeze smaller oranges with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Problem","review":"The one problem with this tool is that when you squeeze the citrus, the enamel on the top half of the squeezer picks up a sticky film from the citrus rind that won't easily come off. You can't just put it in the dishwasher, you have to actually scrub hard to get it off. I believe a differt brand of squeezer without OXO's type of enamel would work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limes only...","review":"This item is incredible for juicing limes. It does such a wonderful job and gets every last drop. However, it is horrible for juicing lemons. It is sad because if it was labeled as a lime juicer only, I would give it 5 stars. Then again, I probably wouldn't buy it if it was labeled as just a lime juicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good juicer, ridiculous packaging","review":"Great for limes and lemons, too big for key limes. I got this to replace one of the enameled ones after all the enamel started flaking off. I believe the clear anodized finish will last much longer. This juicer came alone in a box the size of a litter box though, completely wasteful packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juice squirts out the sides","review":"I bought one of these to replace a standard Mexican aluminum squeezer that I broke when trying to squeeze an old, hard lime. This product definitely had more attention paid to design and materials, and is probably stronger, but, juice squirts out the side - not a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but limited to small fruit","review":"This is a lovely juicer for lemons and limes. It juices them thoroughly without wearing out your hands. If you use lemons frequently, this is a great device. However, if you want to juice oranges, You will find it is too small for most of them and you will end up with juice all over the counter. The label on the piece of cardboard the squeezer was attached to specifies that it is for lemons and limes, but the Amazon description just says citrus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another squeezer","review":"When compared to other, less expensive squeezers (of the same type as the Progressive Metal Lime Squeezer), this squeezer just doesn't stand up. The simpler models do a better job squeezing the juice, are less prone to annoying (and sometimes painful!) squirts in the eye, and seem tougher than the OXO model.Caveat: if you buy one of the simple squeezers, try to get one without the latex paint. It'll just come off anyway, probably in pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase!","review":"This product looks great and functions perfectly. The only problem is that the silver coat will wear off in a number of months use and leave a oily-black residue on your fruit. It's unbelievable that OXO hasn't taken steps to fix this issue as all their other products are very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO GOOD","review":"I have another brand of squeezer, less design and more cheap, that does the final job better....squeezes better the lemon/citrus than the OXO Good Grips Citrus Squeezer. I suggest to try other brands. I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"OXO Good Grips 1057962 Citrus Squeezer","review":"I was very disappointed in this product. It just didn't work as well as squeezing by hand. DO NOT PURCHASE. This is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"My bare hands work better","review":"OXO is my favorite brand of utensil. What a shock to discover that they make such a lousy juicer. While the grips are fine, as OXO is known for, this juicer's utility is practically nil. After juicing either limes or lemons, and squeezing as hard as a 200 pound man can, I can still squeeze out another tablespoon out of the rind with my bare hands. I returned it to the store and I went back to my technique of slicing through the citrus pulp with an ice cream scoop and pressing the sides of the lime half together with my hands. Much more effective and less work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, OXO! This product is a lemon!","review":"This citrus squeezer is probably fine for soft Meyer lemons. The aluminum is weak and brittle, and will eventually break--especially if you use it DAILY with tough-skinned lemons. My first one lasted perhaps 4 months before breaking. My second one didn't quite last two months. I'm very surprised, since I generally love OXO products, and (normally) find them to be of high quality. If you intend to use fresh lemon juice daily, I recommend investing in a citrus press. That's what I'm going to do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"It is very durable and lightweight, easy to wash and store since its size is equal to that of a knife to eat, ergonomic and very good for the south American limos, recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"whipped through a bag of lemons and had lemon drops within the hour","review":"I definitely think that simple=better. It has a nice handle and cup size. You can do a bunch of lemons in a snap and have cocktails ready. Now you just need a lemon tree!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lime Squeezer","review":"Item works fine but does squirt some juice out the top om occasion. Best one, easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfactory","review":"Used once on the type of lime we get as a routine, medium-large, but smaller than a small lemon, it left 1/3 of the pulp unsqueezed, which I extracted with my teeth, yielding an estimated 1/4 of the juice obtained by the unit. The design looks like a hypothesis that failed. I've looked for the Ecko aluminum unit we used in Mexico, but haven't found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well made, poorly designed","review":"It is a well made little gadget. However, the designers at OXO set out to improve the original Mexican design with the addition of a little mound in receptacle used for the lime or lemon. This actually prevents the fruit from being completely squeezed. So, while I like this little gadget, I will be buying a stainless steel one without the fancy design touches by OXO."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to use","review":"I bought this at linens and things a few days ago and was thinking about returning it. I have only used it for lemons, and it is very difficult to squeese and leaves a lot of wasted juice in the lemon. I think it may be more effective for my husband since he has stronger hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for limes!","review":"Got this for limes and it works great! This squeezer has a sturdy feel and gets the job done -- just be ready to work out those hands. When squeezing it nearly turns the lime inside out to get all the juice out. I haven't tried it with lemons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like","review":"This juicer, when juicing key limes (which are small) has too large of a gap when fully compressed, leaving much of the juice and pulp unsqueezed. We came up with a workaround by stacking 2 or 3 squeezed halves together and squeezing them again. But this did not work very well. After a few minutes, I wanted to return it.Why is this? Why not form the two pieces so they fit snugly together, and let me decide how hard/much I want to squeeze a lime or lemon?I think this device would be better suited for full sized lemons, with thick rinds, and not key limes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a time saver","review":"This really saved me time and effort when I had a huge bowl of key limes to juice last summer. I've also used it on clementines and small lemons with good results. It might not work as well for large lemons, and I wouldn't expect it to work with oranges. Like all OXO products, it's well constructed and ergonomic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit and comfort","review":"A product that actually does what it's supposed to, they hold their shape and don't wear out quickly, you get a long time out of them before you need to replace them. Just be careful who you order from, it took a month to get these because I was never told they were out of stock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money On This Cheap Bootleg!","review":"First off the film is fine low budget action/Sci Fi flick starring Blue Demon but the problem here is this cheap bootleg by EastWest Entertainment is incomplete. What's missing you ask? Why it's the ending, about the last ten minutes of the film are completely missing on this DVD so there's no point in watching this crummy version because it will leave you hanging. There is an official DVD from Mexico available which is complete of course but sadly for those of you who don't speak Spanish there aren't any subtitles available on that release same is the case with this cheap bootleg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of rubber material subpar","review":"I already use a an air blower called Giottos Rocket Air Blaster, but I wanted another one with an detachable brush, so I ordered one. Although one reviewer said it is of good quality, I deem it is of less quality compared to the Giottos. Good rubber should feel and smell like a car tyre; quality rubber should provide good grip (resistance from moving) and elasticity. IMO, the Hakuba does not. Also, because of its flatter shape, it squirts out much less air than the Giottos. Although the Giottos costs more than the Hakuba, I consider it a better product and much better value. The Giottos has three sizes, but I prefer the largest one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product, easy to set up","review":"My disc golf baskets arrived within two days after I ordered them. They're easy to set up (no tools!) and seem solid and durable. Great baskets for the price, nice to way to set up a little course at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"good gift","review":"Order came on time. It was a gift for my son, a college student and avid disc golfer. He is very happy with the quality of the product. It is solid and works very well for practice of his sport. The only negative comment he made is that the chains grab a little better than the baskets on disc golf courses. But, he says, it builds confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I've had one of these for two years now. It is easy to assemble and disassemble and is overall a great basket. My only complaint is disc catching. You'd have to double up on the inside circle of chains for this to catch like a pdga basket. I make about 25% less putts, but it's great for practice and a good basket for the money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Goal For The Coal","review":"I bought this target after researching all other ones in its price range, and no complaints yet. It's very sturdy and just the right weight to carry it across the yard. However, I wouldn't recommend this to be a very mobile unit b/c of it's weight, but it does break down easily with a tool. And, you'll rest easy at night knowing you can throw discs at it in a hurricane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cha' Ching","review":"This is a good basket for the back yard. It's fun to putt with. The fact that it only has 14 chains (as opposed to 24) will allow for some putts to blow through or bounce out but that doesn't detract from the fun. My first 1 I bought 5 years ago and it has been outside the whole time with no rust at all! I have three of them now- that in of itself is a testament to the quality and the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nexxus Dandarest Shampoo","review":"I love this product and can't get it locally anymore, so I am very happy that I can still get it online. Nothing has worked better for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruelty free Dandruff Solution","review":"This is a dandruff shampoo with the proper active ingredient recommended by my dermatologist to treat my flaky scalp. I don't have severe dandruff, just a bit of flakiness, but this stuff stops that. The big difference with this dandruff shampoo versus others such as Head & Shoulders or Neutrogena's T-Gel is that Nexxus does NOT test on animals. Those other brands do. This is a big deal for me, as I will not use products that are tested on animals. It took me a long time to find a shampoo that was cruelty free and had the proper ingredients for treating dandruff. Many other brands that don't test on animals do not have any active ingredients, yet claim to help dandruff. None of those helped me personally, though others might have better luck. I really hope Nexxus never stops making this product, as I don't know what I'd use in place of it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try another","review":"Purchased in May, in the shop now, should have just chucked it and bought another, probably will anyway.Very light unit as described in previous review.

We have a rather bulky projector on it (Epson MovieMate 72). We use it in our house, where it has to go from smooth floor to carpet. It works but bumping up to the carpet requires being careful not to tip, and as the other guy said, there is not an easy way to secure the projector to the top, other than gravity. But considering how expensive other cart solutions are, this is a relative bargain. Still seems high in price for what you get.Although we went with the minimal style of this cart, in the end I would have liked a cpu stand or a 2nd platform to put a dvd player or PS3. But again, we are happy with the single pole style of this cart. As long as you won't need a place to put the dvd player, this works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Handy Tool","review":"I don't care what the \\"Pros\\" think.

Once you nailed in your end studs, you can use Fast Framer to space out the remaining studs.

I was like wtf? is this the same Finch that caught my ears in 2003 and had not let go for awhile? Well, to answer my question yeah it's the same guys but the sound as countless viewers have noticed is no longer \\"screamo\\" like What It Is To Burn was. This is flat out angry-as-all-hell hard alternative rock! Yes, alternative would have to be the best way to describe the new sound, becuase it does not quite settle into anything more than that. They've definitely changed, but the album is freakin awesome! Not a single bad track. If you don't mind bands taking a complete left of center turn, then you might like it. But if you like your favorite bands to keep to the cookie-cuttter formula they're known for, then go listen to The Used or SotY or hell even New Found Glory, because this is strictly ODD stuff here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Finch Patton.

One word: AWFUL! What happened guys?? I love it when bands mix up their sounds and try something new, but it just isn't working with these guys.

In fact, \\"What It Is To Burn\\" is probably more poppish than this album. \\"Worms....\\" had to give one the feeling that Finch were leaning towards an edgier, darker sound.

They sounded perfectly fine, I have to say that finch and thrice were my two favorite bands but now finch lost all respect from me. They tried to go hardcore with this alblum and they're not hardcore. This new album failed to meet any of my expectations. If they would have kept along the lines of their previous alblum or even went a little more hardcore with songs like project mayhem in the new alblum they would of had an amazing new alblum - but they didn't. They changed their drummer and their sound and it's just upsetting what they have produced. I loved this band but this new sound just doesn't sound great at all. They should really consider a new name because this isn't the same band."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst sophomore album of all time","review":"Finch follows up an original, catchy, widely popular album with a colossal piece of crap.

There are a certain percentage of people out there who consider themselves \\"hardcore\\" who will embrace this album because its a different move for Finch but honestly if I wanted to liste to growling hardcore Finch is not the band im listening to.

That being said, it's no surprise that Finch's latest offering, Say Hello to Sunshine, is full of derivative and mostly heartless drivel. Moments of clarity only peak out in the beginning tracks like the urgent opus \\"Revelation Song,\\" but the rays of light are few and far between. Electronic manipulations flanked by hook-heavy guitar thuds and rampant screaming only serves to validate a clear sense of indecision on the part of the group. Regardless, I'm sure there are more than enough Finch fans who'll find diamonds in the rough here, I'm just not one of them.- Ryan PradoSynthesis.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ","review":"After listening to and LOVING What it is to Burn i bought this album without a second thought.

Letters to You pulled me in and I have been listening ever since.Their new CD is just a natural progression of sound for the band, why the hell would they want to be making the same album time after time? Their fanbase wouldn't expand, and people would be tired of hearing the same power-punk-pop crap over and over again. I think Say Hello To Sunshine is an amazing collection, the songwriting is excellent and very diverse. The CD is much darker and harder than anything the band has brought out, not quite radio friendly but I'm not one to really care.I'd say the best songs on the album areInsomniac MeatFirefliesReduced To Teeth (my favourite song by far)A Man AloneBitemarks And Bloodstains"},{"rating":"2","title":"great album very different","review":"yea the ppl who say this album sucks are just ppl who are hung up on pop punk screamo and dont want to accept anything new and want this album to sound just like their last one. finch fired their original drummer and changed producers b/c they both wanted to make an album more like what it is to burn. they werent open to new ideas, and this album is full of them. i think every song is pretty freaking good and its just so refreshing to hear something that doesnt sound like a rip off/combination of old finch, thursday, MCR, the used, etc cuz thats what every band sounds like nowadays. so now after this cd catches on maybe all the new up and coming bands will copy say hello to sunshine one instead of what it is to burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progress with a smile!","review":"Finch, FInch, Finch. Now, when \\"What it is to burn\\" came out, I liked it. It was new to me. Over the last 4 years I have progressed thanks to bands such as The Mars Volta, Rush, At The Drive-In,and the Pixies. This cd fits in perfect with my ratation of prog/alt. music. The timing changes along with the lovely melodies makes me think of Incubus, but with an emo twist. Overall, if you like progressive music with a bit of catchiness, check this cd out. Otherwise, buy The Starting lines new Cd (Their new one is good and I hate myself for liking it.). \\"Say Hello to Sunshine\\" is for the open hearted/minded.

The more I listened the more I liked it. It is very different from What It Is To Burn and that's what dissapointed me, but now I'm pretty sure it is better, as it is holding my attention for such a long time after I started listening to it. Not many albums can do that for me. This is unlike anything that has been released recently, which makes it totally fresh. In my opinion I think Finch are genious for making such a drastic change, because it was just the right move that the music industry needed.

I really enjoyed Finch's first album WIITB and their LP. The fast rifs and screamo chorus worked awsome together. My little cousin sent me WIITB when I was deployed during OIF I and it was the perfect album to to get psyched to when in the gym or rolling out on missions. In their seoncd album, Finch has completely altered their sound and lost the hard edge that I found so appealing. The angry and emotional lyrics that were so cool on the first album have been replaced by annoying whines and whispers. Bottom line: Finch is no longer the in-your-grill rockers that they once were and this album was a big let down. Check out the band Rise Against for some good new school punk tunes with a screamo edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN I LIVE?","review":"What happened to Finch?!

Nate Barcalow is rarly singing at all, and the screaming doesnt sound as natural as it did in the first. Also on the first album there was some variety in songs, on this one you can listen to one song, then skip to the middle of another song, and you wont even hear a difference.

I loved what it is to burn and I was happy to hear that they made some changes so that they would not sound like all the other screamo bands that copied finch. Changing their sound was a great idea, but they did not go in the right direction. This cd has some screamo influence (mostly glassjaw) but most of this cd sounds like mainstream metal bands such as slipknot, incubus, sevendust, system of a down, disturbed (ironic since finch and disturbed once had a fight becasue finch said disturbed's music was terrible). I can understand changing your sound because a thousand bands copy you but by doing so...they copied a thousand bands....they went from being copied to copying. Not to mention they picked some of the most horrible bands to rip off. some songs arent as bad but I can't get into this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"This album is one of the biggest disappointments I've known. This is not the band that I fell in love with. Their sound has completely altered from \\"What it is..\\" and not for the better I may add. Some people say this change is for the better, yet how can it be when a very, very large portion of their fans are left in the dust?You will not find anything remotely like...Letters to youPerfection through silencePostscriptStay with meWithout you hereWhat it is to burn (demo ver.)WaitingBury meApologetic theoryEnder...on this new album.

Finch's \\"What it is to Burn\\" album was so great that I expected this one to be even better. \\"Say Hello to Sunshine\\" was an all around bad album. There were a couple good tracks, but I still had to force myself to hear this CD all the way through. This new Finch sound just doesn't flow right. Their music and lyrics have lost the feeling that made their \\"What it is to Burn\\" album so extraordinary. I hope we see the old Finch in their next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen?","review":"I was waiting for this cd for a long time to come out. without knowing a song on the cd I bought it. \\"What it is to Burn\\" is such a good cd I thought how could this one be bad. Well some how Finch made the worst cd that I now own. I try to listen to in, in fact I listen to it 6 times and I still don't like it. So if you like \\"what it is to Burn\\" this cd is nothing like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip","review":"It took them a couple years to write and release this album. That's a shame.

Absolute crap. I really liked their last album. I wanted to like this album. Listened to some songs several times trying to like them, but couldn't find a single song I thought was very good. Bitemarks & Bloddstains was the closest they came. The guitar on this sounds horrible, no power behind it. The lyrics a re crap. I like vague lyrics, i think the Deftones are great, I think they tried a little to hard to be vague and original & ended up with crap.On a side note I don't understand how someon could compare this nu-metal. Is the new thing to do compare anything you don't like to nu-metal. This CD doesn't approach metal, not even nu-metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Finch made an amazing record in 2002 with \\"What it is to burn\\". This album is much different. They ditched the pop-punk hooks and went for a sound similar to Faith No More. In my opinion finch is trying too hard to sound different, the songs are terrible. The recording sounds way too flat, sounds like they didn't want it to sound overproduced. Don't waste your money on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say *Hello* To Garbage","review":"I was pretty impressed with finch's debut \\"what it is to burn\\". It was a good mix of punk/rock/hxc and techno. I'll be the first to admit that I've never been a fan-boy for this band, but I did enjoy their music enough to buy \\"say hello to sunshine\\".After listening to the first two songs, I was ready to throw it out my car window. I understand that bands like to change, but if you're going to completely redo your music, you should change the name of your band as well.Change can be good, sometimes. Finch is one of those bands however that just cannot pull it off. I can't imagine they'll be keeping too many fans with this crap.If you enjoyed the debut, buy with caution. I'd almost suggest going into this record as if it were a completely different band, fronted by nate. That way, your expectations won't be letdown. Don't think so? I promise that if you even half way liked the debut, you'll *hate* \\"say hello to sunshine\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"say hello to finch's new album","review":"Finch's latest effort, \\"Say Hello to Sunshine,\\" is considerably darker and heavier than their other works. \\"Say Hello to Sunshine\\" is obviously Finch's own, rather than the Glassjaw-injected \\"What It Is to Burn\\" album which was released in 2002. With songs inspired by Poe's \\"Fall From the House of Usher,\\" among other literay works, this album is a must have for all hardcore/screamo fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Listening?!","review":"I'll admit like others that when I first put this CD in, i was slightly disappointed. It wasnt the same Finch from 02. But after \\"listening\\" to this CD again with an open mind, I realized that was the beauty of it all. Its an amazing album with great moments. In all honesty, out of a 14 track CD, there are only 2 songs i thought it could do without (... so that definitely is saying a lot. It's not the same Finch, but thats what makes it that much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricked =(","review":"Hey, this is my first review. Last night I was watching TV and saw the video for \\"Bitemarks and Bloodstains\\" and I was like \\"Wow, Finch has a new CD\\". I liked the song so I went to the website and then it played \\"Ink\\" and I was like \\"this is pretty good\\". So now I go the album and I listened to \\"Ink\\" and \\"Bitmarks and Bloodstains\\" then I went on to all the other songs and I was like \\"Wait? What is this (...)?\\" Everything was almost the same and I hated all of it. I'm just finishing up listening to the album right now and I'm almost falling asleep it's so boring but I can't because there is too much annoying yelling. I can't listen to this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion.","review":"Well,I was waiting for this CD to come out for a while actually.Then I got it, day one!

It is darker and more grown up.Everyone changes.Change is good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...","review":"I recieved my copy of this album yesterday in the mail, and while I loved the old album, just because you liked that one doesn't mean this one will appeal to you. Most things about this album completely contrast with What it is to Burn, Nate doesn't scream nearly as much, and the album's overall appeal is much darker. It is still a very good album, which is constantly growing on me. I have to say, A Man Alone is a very enjoyable track. The first time I heard it I wasn't paying attention and I heard \\"Old man loneliness is a son of a bitch\\", I was like...wait what? Good album overall, very enjoyable, but not too much like the good ol' Finch you may expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is different, but a good different","review":"Yes it is a different sound and everyone who doesn't like subjecting to change won't like it, but it is a great record non-theless and you should give it a shot. Listen to it a couple of times and if you don't like it at all then you don't like change and I personally think this album is really good. A lot of bands are the same, meaning a lot of bands are doing the screamo thing and I love it, but you got to listen to something different. There is a couple of songs that threw me of course & they're ok songs but the rest of the album is really great and I think some people are just going to dislike them for the change but they shouldn't, they just wanted to make something different. I love finch and their music is still the best for me because they're not trying to be something they don't want to be and because they're music is really good even though it changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"how is this a new boundary?","review":"after reading these reviews, those that bring up things like \\"a great new sound\\" or \\"theyre no longer emo\\" is all a bunch of bs. for one finch was never emo so dont even bring that up if you want emo look at get up kids. second, they had a unique sound and this new album is not unique. you can look through lists and lists of hardcore bands and find crap like this everywhere. it is nothing new. another thing, this is not maturing to go into this darker crap, it is more emo now than it was before if you think that way with all the complaining in this album. one of the things that made what it is to burn such a good thorough album is that it had a wide variety of everything. this album is simply boring and repetitive. that is my piece"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"I've been reading a lot of reviews while suffering through this tragedy of an album, and it seems like the reasoning behind the people who actually rated it well goes something like this: \\"I've always loved Finch, Finch is cool! All my friends like Finch too, so this album rocks! I've only listened to the sample clips on the website, and they didn't seem that great but they were only clips anyway so I love this CD!\\" Once you sift through and discard all those crappy impressionable-twelve-year-old reviews, you find that nobody really has anything good to say about this album at all. I don't blame them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so disappointed","review":"I'm not sure what kind of feedback Finch got to What It Is To Burn to put out this sort of follow up album.To be honest, there was hardly a song I could connect with in some way. The entire album seemed to be made to make my ears grate. \\"Brother Bleed Brother\\" is a good song, but very unlike What It Is To Burn, I just couldn't find a place to stop and love life.I'm...let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"maturing\\" as a band","review":"So I'm guessing that their third CD will have a country sound...Don't worry though, they'll be \\"maturing as a band\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the same band.","review":"I am in the same boat as everyone who has listened to their previous album and still can't get enought of every song on it.Say Hello to Sunshine was easily my most anticipated album in a long time. Every song I had heard from Finch had been amazing, but this album truly is a dissapointment. I honestly cannot believe this is the same band who put out What it is to Burn.After listening to this album 5 times all the way through on my way to work, I have given up on it. I can't imagine a scenario when I would ever listen to anything on this album again.You can say change is good and the band has matured, but I have to disagree. All I can think of when I listen to this allbum is cookie cutter Nu-Metal circa year 2000. Nothing on this album shows originality or maturity. Hopefully Finch will listen to the fans and make up for this on their next album and go back to the original sound that we know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"different, but still the shit","review":"I was really hoping for something very similar to their first album, but I didn't get it. At first listen I was dissapointed because it wasn't as poppy as expected. After a few listens I decided that this is just plain and simple awesome rock record. I think most people giving this a bad review can't handle stuff that doesn't have a super catchy chorus. If you thrive on pop records, just say no, but if you want a quality rock cd purchase this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost...but not quite","review":"For some reason I decided to race to the mall during my lunch to buy this CD...even tho i had heard a few tracks, and had been sketchy about liking it. When I purchased the album, I already knew that things were going to be...not like Finch, the Finch we all loved a few years ago. I gave it a chance, and so far, only listenign to it for a breif period of time, it is...to my surprise, a lot better than what I was expecting...but a lot worse than the catchy loveable old styled Finch. My favourite song is number 13, and 3. I seem to notice that Geffen has had a few bands change their \\"style\\" such as Blink-182 and now Finch. although I do believe that a lot of the screamo bands sounds the same, Finch, on of the bands who started it, tried to change and be different...but it didnt work for them this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The change in sound is not the problem ...","review":"... bad songwriting is the problem. This pathetic collection sounds like something from the bottom of the Glassjaw reject bin. There is not one song on here worth listening to more than once (that even proved to be too much). Their last CD wasn't bad, and I'm all for changing styles if it can be done with proficiency. However, all that happened here is that Finch has shown us all that they have very little talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a Finch fan, don't buy this album","review":"Being such a hardcore fan of Finch (especially \\"What it is to Burn\\"), I must truly admit what a disappointment this album is. Gone are the days of ear-grabbing riffs, mind-blowing melodies and tear-jerking lyrics...i.e. everything that made us love Finch in the first place. If they were looking to harness the next revolutionary/evolutionary progression of their music, they failed misserably and come off (in this album) as an Incubus \\"Morning View\\" ripoff, with overdone screamo to hide their lack of effort. I can't encourage you enough to buy \\"What it is to Burn\\" and really get a knack for this band...but in the mean time, save your 15 bucks and invest it manure...cause at least it smells better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith No More Wannabes","review":"I bought a ticket to a Finch show before I ever heard the band. Only because a good band, Rx Bandits, is opening up for them. So, I thought I'd pick up Finch's CD so I'd have an idea who I was going to see. Can anybody say ,\\"Cheap Faith No More rip off?\\" Like a thousand bands before them, (Korn, Incubus, etc.)Finch has stolen Mike Patton's signature sound and bastardized it. This time under the mask of whiny emo-punk. Save your money and buy the \\"Real Thing\\". Don't waste it on these unoriginal phonies. Myself, I'll be walking out the doors before Finch ever hits the stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf finch","review":"i feel terrible writing this about Finch, cause i love them i think that \\"Falling Into Place\\" and \\"What It Is To Burn\\" were awesome cds, even songs I've just randomly downloaded off the net by them such as \\"Frail\\", \\"Apologetic Theory\\", and \\"Bury Me\\", those cds and songs are what make Finch. What happen to them during this new album release? This cd is so boring and absolutely no songs stand out, I could barely tell when one song ended and the next started. Songs like \\"The Casket of Roderic Usher\\" don't even have the right to exist, thank the gods that song was only 1m 50s, cause its absolutely pointless.

I had extremely high hopes for this album, and I am very disappointed. I just don't get how they could have spent soo long writing this ablum, and STILL make it suck so bad. There guitar tone is gone, catchy hooks are a thing of the past, and they must have drank a whole bunch of suck juice. Seriously - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I bought it for $10 bucks...and I want it back.If you want an awesome ablum....buy What it is to burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experience brings maturity","review":"The first one was good and even unique, after every band was trying to immitate Finch, Thrice etc', Finch put some extra senses into this album and in my opinion raised themselves by many levels. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another sweet album.","review":"I'll admit it, I didn't think I would like this CD very much. I listened to the demos and along with pretty much everyone else, I didn't like the sound that was so much different from What It Is To Burn. BUT, Say Hello To Sunshine is not a dissapointment in any way, shape, or form. It is wayyy different from Finch's earlier stuff but in a good way. It's harder and heavier and surprisingly catchy. If you like the songs What It Is To Burn, Untitled and Grey Matter, there's no reason you won't love this CD. As far as people saying Nate doesn't scream as much or it isn't as hard, just listen to Insomniatic Meat, Reduced to Teeth and A Man Alone. I absolutely love these songs, and along with Dreams of Pslocybin, Ink, and Fireflies, it makes it hard to take it out my CD player.Finch's new CD is a friggin gem, and whoever has said negative things about it probably hasn't even given it a chance and knocked it based simply on expectations. Pick it up and you won't be bummed, my word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"When I read some of the bad reviews on here I for one was excited. Although I loved the previous album, hearing people say it wasn't like old Finch and less catchy...blah blah it made me think it wasn't for the emo crowd, which is good for me. And I wasn't let down when I bought the album. I was listening to it the first day I got it (for the 2nd time) with my buddy who is a huge metal head, and he asked who it was. When I told him it was Finch, he didn't believe me cause he hated the previous album.Now while the sound is different, you can definately still tell it is Finch. By no means is this a sellout album, a sellout album would have come out a year after the one before sounding exactly like it. This is MUCH harder and reminds me a bit of Glassjaw.This CD was definately worth the wait and is a must have for a Finch fan who always wished they were a harder band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dremel Brush 443","review":"This Brush is not a good as the other 2 Carbon Steel Brush bits, the end is to compact for the use I wanted, i.e. polishing stones.

The rubber gets hot and the drum will slip after a while on the rubber. Take it apart, and slip a miniature O-ring, (available at most hardware stores for pennies), onto the shaft, put back on the rubber on the shaft, put on a drum, tighten the screw and it is like new.

The John stuff is cool (Zappa's solo on \\"Well\\" is killer), but by and large it's a different mix on some pretty awful cr*p. The new live stuff is the heart of the matter and there's not enough of it: a great Status Back Baby, Concentration Moon, and Cruisin' For Burgers.

With this set, originally issued in 1992, it's like he's going over really old turf again and it's nothing fresh, enlightening or special at all. In fact, it's unfunny, tiring & a real indulgent snoozefest.

He was at his best when he was skewering the rock form, like he did with this band.

Especially recommended for school and community library California History collections, The Great California Story is also available in a hardcover edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I Really Know What California's All About","review":"The Great California Story paints a vivid picture of just what it is that makes California such an amazing place.

Nope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary","review":"Worth the price of admission. Three live shows for the price of one, all of them remarkable. In typical Devo fashion, the album starts with the later show (1977 if I recall correctly) and moves backwards toward their more confrontational, primitive and punky days. Quality-wise, it's a mixed bag, but it's all well worth listening to, even if only to hear early Devo in their element. At the end of the album is one of their earliest shows, opening for Sun Ra. Let's just say that I don't think anybody was still there when Sun Ra was ready to perform; Devo gleefully clear the house with what must have seemed at the time to be bizarre alien noise, along with a healthy dose of insulting the audience. In true mongoloid fashion, the audience responds with threats of violence.

I get so many comments. Nobody seems to know what deathstick means. Is that a snowboard manufacturer? Is that a band? Every now and then somebody will say. Do you frame? I say no, but I am aware these guys make some of the best framing hammers on the planet. Best quality tools period. These hats are equally fine. I work out in them daily ride bikes, work in the yard ect. It takes a good year or two of constant abuse to wear one out. And when I say wear out I mean color faded, not ripped. The only one I damaged was because I hot dried it in dryer and it shrunk to small to wear. I now wash them in the sink w/ hot water and let air dry over night. When the black gets faded I buy a new one. Old one goes to goodwill in fine condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"misrepresentation","review":"Back of hat does not read \\"make the nail bleed\\" as stated in the advertiment, but rather Dead on Tools.

Cook Rodgers & Hart Album, Judy sings to overblown arrangements of great songs. The nightclubby orchestrations minimize the power of each song. None of her great trills, deep emotions and ubridled joy displayed on the \\"Where Oh Where' album are in evidence here. Honoring various Broadway Divas was a great idea. Sad to say it is not up to her best standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"for chess nuts only","review":"Nabokov seems to have specialised in brilliant, obsessed characters, weaving them into complex situations that get more and more, well, convoluted. When the character is sympathetic or funny, his novels succeed. But when they are evil or too recondite in their pursuits, they fail, at least for me.While my chess pals love this one, I found it frightfully boring, certainly one of the worst of his novels. But then, that is really saying that it didn't work for me and is a matter of taste. I just didn't like the character and didn't care if the end is yet another chess-like trick. Indeed, the only reason I got through it was my own compulsion to try to read everything that that great novelist wrote.Get it if you like weird chess masters and want to enter the mind of a particularly sick and narrow one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What it's Like to go Mad","review":"This is one of Nabokov's early works, but it's a very mature story--the prose is sparse, unnecessary detail is nonexistent and the story is maddeningly gripping. Nabokov follows (although not usually linearly) the young Russian chess prodigy, Luzhin, through his strange and obsessive rise to the top of the chess world, his marriage to a fascinating and caring woman, and his slow, maddeningly intricate and psychologically complex 'downfall' (though this isn't the right word). I recommend this book for at least three reasons: 1) It's short and gripping 2) Nabokov's prose is inspiring and 3) The story of poor Luzhin makes you feel as if you too are going mad (this is a good thing--you get to experience a plausible account of madness without--let's hope--going mad yourself).

The first time I used it I felt self-conscious wheeling it along behind me, it's so gorgeous.The red is a deep, rich color, and the leather is high quality. The bag is very well made. My 16\\" Toshiba Satellite fits perfectly. There's room for a few miscellaneous items, as well as a couple of files and a notepad, so I was able to stash things in it and not have to bring my purse along too, although it was a snug fit.It took me a few minutes to figure out how to unzip it from the wheeled platform, but it's actually easy to do.

I can squeeze an outfit and pajamas in the briefcase along with my 15\\" MacBook Pro, but adding a few papers, wallet, etc, it gets a bit tight.As long as I take the minimum clothes (which is ok by me) I can still take this bag. I hope to beat it up a bit to soften it.I would like to add: IF you use this bag with the wheels attached, it doesn't fit under the airplane seats - unless you are business class or better - but then, you have more room above your head, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big and nothing fits in it","review":"The bag is huge but nothing fits inside.

It's mainly the story of a girl standing under a street lamp in front of barracks, while the fog is darkening the streets of a little town ; and who will stand with her when the night falls and the shadows are swirling around? Although there are a few modern songs on the CD, most of the songs recorded here are nostalgic of bygone days, of men who wan't come back, of flowers on the graves. The voice of Marlene Dietrich is a bit hard and hoarse, a voice in black and white. It reminds you of all these fascinating movies in black and white of the thirties (think of Lang, Murnau,...). Technically speaking, the rythm, here and there, is too fast, and the recording is not very good, but it's not so important. Just listen and and take a dive in the crooked and foggy (and disturbing) streets of pre-war Europe and the smoky cabarets of Berlin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marlene Dietrich Die grossen Erfolge","review":"Extremely happy to have received this disc which I had not heard for some 43 years since I was at college in England"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"The last 3 or 4 songs are old, good recordings.

A definate chill up the spine when he hits that certain note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even merit the 1-Star","review":"One of the worst recorded set of vocals I have ever heard (over 60 years of listening). The voice is as if recorded through or in a very large drainage pipe or cavern. Any CD vocals from the forties, or even thirties, I've listened to sound better than this 2005-produced mess.

The cgi animation was copied from the Barbie movies, the band/demo record was copied from the first My Scene movie, the look was copied from the Diva Starz, the doll movie thing was copied from mattel, and the song albums from the movie was copied from Mattel as well. The My Scene dolls wear beautiful colors , normal hairstyles, have a great movie, and a well-behaved celeb that a lot of girls look up to(the stories are ALL rumors).

However, once we put it through this strainer it is perfectly translucent!

It would take 15-20 minutes per batch of manually squeezing and pressing to strain the grounds out of the milk, which would mean 45 minutes - 1 hour for 3 batches of just straining. Ain't nobody got time for that. I initially balked at the price, but eventually resigned myself to buying this after researching less expensive products. I have no regrets at all - all I need is this, a pot, and a wooden spoon and I have 3 batches of milk done in 15 minutes. It doesn't get all the grounds out, but it gets more than what I was previously doing, which was also wasting a lot more and producing a mess. This wastes nothing - the grounds are easy to save, I simply stir the milk which pushes it through the strainer, and it's easy to clean - rinse and brush with soapy water and hang it up to dry.

It does set up easy, but the slightest breeze will cause it to collapse in on itself. It does pop back out but is very irritating to be constantly bumped in the head when the wind blows. Even with the sandbags full it still would lift off the ground in a breeze. We had to bury the base in sand and put coolers inside along the edges to hold it down. I am talking about 3-6 mph breezes. Another poor design is the windows. One day a light shower came while on the beach and because the window closure panels are on the inside the rain came right in and soaked the inside. If you just want some shade in your yard or at a festival where there will be no breeze or rain showers this may work for you.

The face of the hammer is also rounded more than most which is fine until the face goes smooth, then the face starts slipping off the nail unless the blow is dead on.

I'll tell you why!","review":"Up here in Alaska, we are very cautious with our purchases,especially in the field of hardware. When I first saw this hammer, orGOD STICK as I now call it, I was a little skeptical of its powers. This price for a hammer?\\", I thought. Luckily, my wife Elen, may she rest in peace, got it for me as a Labor Day gift. This hammer was the best investment I have ever made! At most, 3 whacks sends Mr. Rusty Nail into his proper place. Not only does this superior tool serve as the BEST HAMMER ON EARTH, but is also light enough to keep in my glove box just for safety precautions. I greatly encourage anyone considering this wonder-hammer to buy it. It is well worth the price and pretty much \\"pays for itself\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Stick was Dead on Arrival","review":"I ordered a Death Stick and anxiously awaited its arrival. Amazon and Tool Crib did a great job delivering my order quickly. Then I took the Death Stick to work and showed it off to all the other guys on the job site. All were impressed with the magnetic nail set and balance of the hammer. That was at 7am. At 10am I was showing all the guys on the site how the handle had snapped off on the first nail I tried to pull with it. I wasn't even pulling with any force. Glad I wasn't up on a ladder trying to get a stubborn nail loose or it could have been quite a wreck. After looking at the handle where it snapped off (right where it goes into the head) and the opening that it fits into, it appears that the narrowness of the handle where it enters the head and the small amount of wood that actually takes all the stress would make this a common problem with this hammer. A better name for this product would be Dead Stick. Buy a Woody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dip Stick","review":"I was so excited to get my new hammer, I thought it would be worth it, But within 3 day's after getting it the magnet fell out of my hammer, Which was the main reason for buying it.

I disagree, this is NOT the worst DEVO CD ever released. This CD is a great way to show the 5 spuds' musical range with this Muzak style CD. What also helps is that they picked the best songs to further De-Evolve. I would have licked to hear a muzak version of Smart Patrol/Mr. DNA and Disco Dancer (if they would have waited 3 or so more years).

From the bluegrass version of \\"Beautiful World\\" (who'da thought it possible!), to the power lounge-lizard \\"Whip It,\\" this shows Mark Mothersbaugh and the boys to be the true geniuses they were and are today. I suppose the casual Devo listener might enjoy it, if they knew the songs on the album in their original forms. If you thought \\"Whip It\\" was the best (or only) thing Devo ever put out, DON'T BUY THIS RECORDING!

Though these are only two of the six or seven films Breen did at RKO, the quality of the Roan Group's releases far surpasses any other public domain offerings.ALPHA's double feature release of Bobby's films should be avoided.

It focuses primarily on the New York experience but includes a national historical perspective. Problem solving courts represent the greatest sea change in criminal justice of this generation. They are smart on crime. This book explains why we should bring this model \\"to scale\\".My only objection to the book concerns the authors indifference to community supervision and their dismissal of probation. This may be uniquely New York City issues, because probation and law enforcement are vibrant and critical members of problem solving court teams across the country. The drug court model works best when the strength of community supervision supports recovery in the offender's community. Drug Courts are about accountability, public safety, and recovery. Community supervision specializes in those specific goals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"Don't waste your money on this overpriced junk.

Reading Koester's description of a small conference of academic \\"call girls\\" is all too similar to the real thing. The pompous posturing and politicking of such a group is every bit as tedious on the printed page as it is in person. If one is looking for an enjoyable academic satire, try David Lodge's Changing Places or Small World, try Richard Russo's Straight Man, or even try Jane Smiley's Moo; for a somewhat more serious expose, try Carl Djerassi's Cantor's Dilemma.Not that I wish to dismiss this work entirely; Koestler's novel is far more successful as a bleak commentary on the direction of the human race, mostly due to the two brilliant short pieces which frame the centeral academic tale. These pieces remaing brilliant and haunting despite the dry centerpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Parody of Academic Jet-Setters","review":"Koestler, best known for \\"Darkness at Noon\\", left us a satire of modern academe easily on a par with \\"White Noise\\".

The mounting system is also hugely improved (Thanks, company partner Escort). For the money, it's a good buy. If you don't travel too much over the limit, or if this is a first detector - it's a good one. However, if you can swing it, the RX65 or Passport 8500 is a much better performer. That \\"next step\\" in detector pricing brings w/ it A LOT more sensitivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great detector","review":"I tried this RX-55 and found a lot of false alerts -- it seemed to just go off for no reason and I passed like 4 police cars and nothing.

Women's gowns were high-waisted, sometimes clingy, sometimes short, sometimes with a train, depending more or less on the circumstances in which they were worn, and bonnets of many shapes were all popular simultaneously; men still favored plenty of color but were clearly moving toward the modern shape of dress. Tierney's two dolls have 15 plates of clothes (eight outfits for him, 22 for her--here too the modern style of more garments for women than for men is taking shape) that range from walking dresses to court formalities.

I was home alone at the time. The sound was coming from this blender, somehow it spontaneously turned itself on and was operating at a very high speed. I purchased it about a month ago. Thank goodness I was home. Hopefully these machines don't pose the danger of causing a fire if left on for too long a period of time. I am returning mine. Please beware. I am now unplugging all my counter-top kitchen appliances when they are not in use. I don't think quality control in manufactured goods is what it used to be. With so many items being manufactured abroad, one wonders if some of those countries have quality control standards that exist in the US. Another example is the Dell laptop PCs which have batteries that spontaneously combust.

I find it a comfort to know where the President stands and where he takes his counsel from. That he openly communicates with God and has no need to hide it. I find that the people who criticize this action are afraid and fear is always a result of ignorance. If you know God, than you understand that it is not the President who seeks more power and more glory, but he humbles himself to the one power that can change lives. All of the great and effective leaders of this country, from the beginning, took their counsel, unashamedly , from God. I enjoyed hearing the history related in this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Mr.Bush be saved?","review":"Mr. Bush uses religion as a way to brainwash the Christian right. The truth of the matter is he was not \\"hand picked\\" by our Savior. Jesus Christ died for the sins of mankind. Hopefully in his pure heart, he can forgive Mr.Bush, although it may not be possible. Mr. Bush is a dark soul who sold it to Satan. It's the only way to explain his obsession with wealth. A true Christian would give to the less fortunate, not send them off to die in a war to make him more money. When his time comes, Our Savior will send to a place where he can never hurt again..

Since he has been re-elected by a huge majority it looked obvious to me that the Hollywood celebrities and left wing politicians are not a good representation of what the Americans really thought of their president.For having a more American view of George Bush and explaining to me why America thinks he is the right man for the hour, I give this DVD 5 marks. I have gained a respect for this man, for standing up for what he thinks is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting and manipulative","review":"As a non-American interested in the complex relationship between DC politics and religious conservatism, I had hoped to gain some general insight into the major themes invovled, such as just how much Bush's grasp of world events is conditioned by religious messages. Unfortunatlely this DVD has the sole intention of reassuring the converted, catering to those who already believe that a Christian faith is a pre-requisite for effective government. I might suggest that any 'critical' piece about religion in government must at least acknowledge the historical debate about the relationship between church and state; this piece of mindless propoganda is so limited that it doesn't recognise even such basic starting points for debate. Anyone who doesn't know their history is condemned to repeat it, and this DVD is proud to ignore such subtle points in favour of a few facile messages. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"infomercial","review":"This film is unabashed propaganda. Like \\"Fahrenheit 911,\\" it provides an extraordinarily one-sided presentation with one objective -- to get you to agree with its message. Like \\"Fahrenheit 911,\\" it is \\"selling\\" you a \\"pitch.\\" Unlike \\"Fahrenheit 911,\\" it is driven by traditional film marketing ideas rather than the more unique, creative energy of a Michael Moore.If you like watching the shopping channel, you'll probably enjoy this film. If you like George W., you'll find this film inspiring. If George W., is not your cup of tea, you'll be hitting the eject button within 10-15 minutes.I watched this film in order to gain some insight into the world and mind of George W. from the point of view of those who support his vision and policies. The film is informative to that extent, but no more informative than an infomercial attempting to sell you a particular product. So, if you're looking for a stab at educational objectivity, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Rubbish","review":"This DVD is bad enough to convince me to write the only review I have ever written. It seems to be intended for a really uninformed audience of beneath average intelligence. The dubbing of G W Bush (God Bless his deceased intellect) is atrocious and painfully \\"door to door\\" salesman in it's presentation.The documentary rambles on in the most horrific and laborious monotony of a preacher suffereing from an overdose of anti depressants and the only message appears to be an extremely unconvincing argument that the current President is the absolute epitome of Christian graciousness and self suffering.What absolute rubbish. Anyone who finds this work of any interest or value really does deserve to be forced through the entire excrutiating experience of watching the film from beginning to end.The only thing I liked about it was the relief that it was not too long and that it did, EVENTUALLY, come to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good acquisition","review":"I am very happy that I acquired this DVD.

The people who made this \\"documentary\\" should be ashamed of themselves. The Bush administration is the most spiritually empty group of profiteers I have ever seen. And I am not an atheist. I believe in God. I believe George believes in God. I also believe he will go down in history as a lesson to future generations about the dangers of unchecked power, arrogance and greed. If I set out to make a satire on the GOP and it's pact with organized religion, it's distortion of what true compassion is, I couldn't have done a better job. I want to show this film as a comedy to friends. My only question is, how do I get a copy without having a nickel go to the people who made it?

Bush when he talks so much about his Christianity, I have two questions. Who would Jesus bomb? Who would Jesus torture? Another couple questions not addressed in this production...just where in the Bible are we instructed to kill for profit...to send young people to war as a first resort and to lie to accomplish our goals?

But what a yawn this DVD is! The only point they make through the whole thing is that George Bush is a religious man, which they hammer over and over again, as though we didn't know that already. No in-depth look into how this specifically affects his policy-making both here and abroad. Plus, the re-enactments are just plain dumb and the overall production is poor. Basically, a transparent \\"documentary\\" offering no substance at all. The Frontline documentary \\"The Jesus Factor\\" is far more informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Would Jesus Bomb","review":"The faith of George Bush? He is certainly not a man driven by facts but his own warped convictions. The real problem is Bush thinks he is God. Or at the very least, he is God's personal favorite. After all it must have been divine intervention that rescued Bush from Alabama National Guard.Never being part of the drug culture, I've often wonder how much coke it takes to make you believe your God.Now it is a fact that Bush loved the nose candy during the seventies along with side order of beer. He had admitted this much.While Bush claims that Jesus is his role model, Bush is no Jimmy Carter.

Compelling story of the conflict between the poor Australians and the lordly English. The best part though is the music. Irish ballads by Mick Jaggger and ballads by Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristoferson make this worth buying for the music as well as the movie. The sound track is worth buying separately too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly inaccurate","review":"I'm an Australian and have been researching Ned Kelly for 25 years. I watched this film at the movies when it came out. It was terrible then, and is even more terrible to watch now. If you are interested in the Kelly Gang, there are some very good books: recommended \\"A Short Life\\" by Ian Jones. See if Amazon has it! It is a very accurate account of the life of Edward Kelly, which is more than I can say for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the script?","review":"There were some good things about this movie: the photography was nice. The action scenes weren't too bad. I somewhat liked the music.If only there had been a real screenplay to hold it all together. I can't tell whether the acting was any good, because they had so little to work with. As for historical content, it's amazing that so much of it was incorrect, given how little of it there was.I'd recommend this only if you think Mick Jagger looks good with that beard. Otherwise I'd say buy a book on the Kelly gang if you want to learn more, buy the soundtrack if you want the music, or watch the Heath Ledger version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big casting mistake","review":"Ok, the only reason I watched this was because I'm a big Stones fan but I didn't really expect it to be too good or even memerable and its not. One thing is that I read somewhere that Ned Kelly was a big guy, about 200 pounds, and so I don't think Mick Jagger was a very good pick for him since Mick is so skinny. Another thing is the beard. It just looks hideous. The accent Mick puts on is also hideous, anyway, he mumbles the whole way through and his acting is VERY flat. The other actors weren't too good or memoralbe either. The script must not have been too hot because the only scenes that I really remember are the wrestling match and the end when he gets captured. If you want to watch a good movie with Mick Jagger in it watch Performance instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waylon, Kris & Jagger","review":"Saw the movie Ned Kelly long ago and it wasn't as bad as the reviews.

UML was not yet invented, and a lot of concepts explained here have changed or are now out of date. The concept is good because it focuses on learning OOD and makes it distinct from learning an OO language which only is the tool. But if you are a beginner, you can find far better book. Not enough examples in this one. And the given examples are very simple and with no interest. This book only gives you a broad picture of what OO is and never really enter in the detail.

After that the bits became dull and did not cut as fast. I also had to watch the equipment because it could get real warm. I also made an attempt to cut 3/8 inch ceramic wall tile and 3/8 inch marble tile. They don't perform well at all. I ended up buying a rod saw (it was a hand saw) with Tungsten carbide grit edge blade to do the job (slow..real slow, but they did cut nicely after I had some practice).

It also cracks just from being bent a little or from cutting down the same line over and over (I sell items I sew and use the same cutting lines frequently). I've used my mat almost every single day for the past 3 years sewing. Amazingly enough my smaller Dritz mat, which I've owned longer and used just as much, still looks brand new.

It is double sided, although only one side has measurements the other side is blank... but both have the \\"self healing\\" surface. It is pretty cool when you use the rotary on it and make a little slice in the surface how the slice does disappear... I was very pleased and excited about this. I use a Olfa rotary cutter on it as recommended but when making a curved cut it still left a light slice in the mat that did not heal (hence four stars)...

He has another black woman who is horribly mistreated by a man only to be saved by a big muscular hunk. I'm often very unhappy with the sterotypical ways Mr. Perry portrays blacks. The ignorant banter of Mr. Brown sets us back by about 50 years. This time he threw in a loud, obnoxious Latino to add to the sterotyping. I do think I could get over that though if he would come up with a different storyline. I truly don't understand what the love for these movies is all about.

His plays are legendary but he has no idea how to make a decent movie. Who in there right mind would cast Angela Bassett and Rick Foxx as a couple? Movies are very different from plays. Many things that go over great in front of a live audience would never work in film. He tries too hard sometimes. His movies don't feel like comidies and they never quite stack up to any of his plays. In the 90's it felt like for the first time blacks were beginning to make quality movies for us all.

Then, my enthusiasm turned into admiration when listening the wonderfully played \\"Quicksand\\", surely the best song on this soundtrack. But J. J. Johnson's score also manages to capture the gritty realism of the streets and its surroundings, and the incidental dialogue that we keep hearing through the entire record helps us establish the link between Womack's words and the context of the film. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"So rough so smooth, thank you J.J and Bob","review":"J.J Johnsons score, and Bobby womacks vocal delivery make this a top funk soundtrack to own. Most def in the same league as Mayfields Superfly. Wonderfully powerful instrumentals sit comfortably next to the vocal tracks. The chase scene and laments are all in order. But it is the conceptual feel that holds this beauty together. J.J's full orchestral arrangements are funky and sophisticated, hot and cool as hell. I especially dig the title track and \\"If you dont want my love\\", and \\"quicksand\\". Both tracks are strangely depressing and deeply soulful.Respect the funk, Baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Your Money","review":"originally released in 1972, this soundtrack compiles six tracks performed by bobby womack and peace, and five instrumentals by j.j. johnson and his orchestra. the music contained within is dead-on early 70s funk and soul. as you may expect, there are many quality tunes on this cd, although quite a few are repeated in different forms and a few more are simply your unoriginal standard [funky] soundtrack tracks. even if that bothers you though, tunes like the top notch \\"harlem clavinette\\" should keep you from being disappointed. there are plenty of short funky pieces that are just as original and experimental as they are accessible. plus, bobby womack is in top form and belts it out on all of his soulful selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great business book about a true legend","review":"I had read Monica Langley's excellent book Tearing Down the Wall's on Sandy Weill and when I saw this I knew I had to read it too. Since it was a business autobiography, which tend to be poorly written I didn't except much. I was suprised, this book is very well written and a true page turner that I simply could not put down - I finished it in a week.Sandy Weill is the real deal, he reshaped the financial services industry forever. Of particular interest is how he had a falling out with Peter Cohen, Jamie Dimon and later John Reid. It is a shame that like Hank Greenberg, a true legends career had to end under the ruthless self-promoting Elliot Spitzer and sad to read the toll it took on Sandy but like almost all else he has overcome everything and his legacy is one of greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Lacking in Useful Information","review":"I read \\"The Real Deal\\" in the hope of gaining insight on how to be a good manager. The book did not help; the main \\"insight\\" I gained was the suspicion that Weill's success was largely due to his having strong people as operational assistants - eg. Cohen at Shearson, and Dimon at Citigroup.The one other potential insight I took away from the book was Weill's endorsement of requiring top executives to hold most of their stock until retirement (thus avoiding the incentive for short-term manipulations); it was also somewhat interesting (and disappointing) to read of the key role played by politics at American Express while Weill was there."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Deal at All","review":"For all its girth, this book is shockingly shallow and a huge disappointment for anyone hoping to learn real secrets behind the author's successful business career. There is a lot of score-settling and finger-pointing at those who he felt mistreated him (like proteges Peter Cohen and Jamie Dimon), but very little in 'take-away' value about what to look for in building a successful business. I was reading this book simultaneously with Danny Meyer's \\"Setting the Table\\" and the contrast could not be more striking. In a much shorter but infinitely richer and more rewarding volume, Meyer painstaking reveals all his business success secrets; the reader feels totally cared for which emulates the experience of being in his restaurants, whereas the Weill volume left me feeling that Mr. Weill cared not one whit for his readers because it imparted so few useful insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous - self excusing with no real content","review":"Sandy spends all his time blaming others for the problems he encountered with personal interactions and does not give any insight as to how he made and negotiated the actual M&A deals. 6 discs of Sandy patting himself on the back with no real content.

While a lot of the stuff he says in the book is also in other books, it comes off twisted. And contradictive. One part of the book stands out in my mind in particular.He talks about how James Dimon and how he couldn't join the board at Citi Group. He says in the book something like \\"I told Jamie if he can convince the board to let him be a member then he should do so.\\" A few pages later, maybe 2, he talks about how Dimon got onto the board after all and Weill felt betrayed he would go behind his back like that to convince the board to letting him join.That last paragraph sums up the book pretty much.

My first thought was \\"this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it is so stupid.\\" But at that time I thought the movie was a fantasy, by the time I got to the end and realized it was much different than I expected, I thought \\"I would have to watch it a second time to really appreciate it\\"... unfortunately the movie is not good enough to waist my time on a second viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Journalers and Altered Artists!","review":"If you love to journal and altered things, then this is a very cool movie!

I needn't have worried. This is truly one of the most cinematically beautiful movies I've ever seen. If it's a little slow to start, give it a chance, you won't be disappointed. The twists and turns leave you breathless, with the tension building until you don't think you can take any more. And you won't be able to guess the ending. This is a 'feel good' movie that could be a blend of The Fisher King, What Dreams May Come and The Neverending Story. If you loved any of these, you'll adore this. Not to mention, it's perfectly safe for any family member. If someone gives it a bad review it's probably because they expected the usual amount of gratuitous sex, profanity and violence. This movie is refreshingly free of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant weekend movie","review":"Watch the whole thing!

Everytime the writer attemptsto tell stories in the book it's interesting but evertime hekeeps refering back to small details that shouldn't have madeit in the book. The most interesting thing that I learn in thebook is how Rap (Hip Hop of Today)has been around for decades!Back in the 1920s jazz musicians where using a style referedto as scat jazz in which they used their voices to make soundsof various instruments. This required a great deal of patienceand intellegience to come up with a style like this.

I took it apart to see if I could squeeze the sides together to hold it, no good since the metal lugs that are inside won't stay there.

The timer works just like an alarm, but it only 'wakes to music' not a beep or buzz.Some negatives - we lay our unit horizontal. We couldn't see the clock when it was vertical.

Mark Urban's book, half biography and half military campaign history, does much to restore Scovell to his rightful place. Readers will come away with both an appreciation of Scovell's considerable talents as a military administrator and a code breaker and also a decent understanding of the flow of events during Wellington's great campaigns during the Peninsular War. While the battles are not neglected by Urban, much of the book of necessity is aimed at describing the events behind the scenes which are so often neglected by standard military histories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book on a fascinating culture","review":"The Atlas of Ancient Egypt has been for years one of the best popular reference works on Ancient Egypt.

The situation is absolutely funny and the judge who deals with the events is a caricature of competence. A first wife declared dead by a court, a second wife who will never be one really due to the arrival of the dead wife back onto the scene, and all the peripherals of such a situation. The interest of the film is the character played by Cary Grant : a shy, frightened and boneless lawyer and husband who can never come to a clear cut decision in an intricate situation mixing up misled court decisions, bigamy, love and jealousy, truth and lies.

It is Military in nature, but the framkework has widespread application. Conflict is conflict -- be it on the battlefield or in the marketplace. This is not a blood-and-guts story; rather it is a framework for developing and evaluating strategies in their most fundamental forms. He blends his own combat experience with a comprehensive understanding of history. He dares the reader to be so progressive. Leonhard's style is forward, bold, and entertaining. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique perspective","review":"What really impresed me about this book was Leonhard's application of physics terms to modern warfare.

All of the gifts that Declan MacManus has shown us since his debut, are on his display here. This album is most well known for \\"Allison\\", and, \\"The Angels (Wanna Wear my Red Shoes), but for my money the most amazing gem is \\"Less than Zero\\", and then on top of that there is his most easily recognizable songs: \\"Watching The Detectives\\" This was a great Cd when I own the cruddy sounding Columbia version, but now we have the wonderfully remastered Rhino edition. Complete with the original album as well as a 2nd disc with early versions, B-sides, and Outtakes. A must have for anyone who enjoys this wonderful artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The big debut","review":"The debut album of my so nerdy he's cool man. Not surprisingly, this is the place to start with when going back to the early genius that was Mr. Costello. \\"Allison\\", \\"Watching The Detectives\\", \\"Red Shoes\\", \\"Welcome To The Work Week\\" - all the cool tunes are here in their two minute punky new wave glory. Plus it's the remastered version complete with a ton of liner notes and a whole separate disc of rarities. Now if they would only stop re-issuing it every two years I'd be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed: Too many versions!","review":"Sure, it would be nice to have the 2nd disc of live material, but I just can't see buying this CD a third time. Release it separately for those of us who have at least 2 versions of MAIT, or offer a discount or something. Is it any wonder why people don't buy much music anymore? They are too busy buying the same thing, released several different ways. I'm a completist, I have (pretty much) every Elvis Costello cd (most, 2 versions) and I guess I'm just getting tired of this cycle. As far as the music, I'm not even a big fan of MAIT; his work after this is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah...but...","review":"Ok yes it's been released a million times. Luckily I've only bought this once - the Ryko 21/2 Years set. The live stuff is great and unavailable elsewhere. I got this locally for $20, new.

Now comes Rhino with their repackaging of everything including all the 80's and hopefully 90's cds. The other two cd's in the first installment (All this useless beauty/Spike) are great \\"new\\" additions to any collection. \\"My Aim is True\\" however is very close to being the same musically. There are only four songs that differ from the Ryko release. Also Elvis wrote new liner notes and the booklet has more photos than the Ryko one. This is a slightly better package than Ryko's. It has just enough extra to make it essential for fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis Costello's \\"My Aim Is True\\" is a real gem","review":"Elvis Costello is one of the most influential and inspired musicians of the last quarter century, and his debut album \\"My Aim Is True\\" is his quintessential masterpiece. From the rip-roaring \\"Welcome To the Working Week\\", to the blues inspired \\"Blame It On Cain\\", and his gentle, yet brutally honest love ballad \\"Alison\\", \\"My Aim Is True\\" beautifully exhibits the full range of his talents. He pours his emotion into each note as though the guitar were an extension of his body, manipulated as easily as flexing a muscle. His emotions are not masked as is evidenced in \\"Wave A White Flag\\" his ode to spousal abuse, but rather they complete the songs, allowing for a touch of tenderness to dilute even the cruelest anthems. While his influence is certainly not as far reaching as that of the Beatles, Dylan, or Hendrix, it is no less poignant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good aim","review":"Brisk and informed rock debut from this thinking class hero had all the touchstones of a noteworthy first release even if a majority of tricks were stated right away in the first track- intelligent yet catchy structures fused with multiple styles to create something fresh for aggressive as well as slow songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Elvis Costello's first album is probably his best. Released in '77, one listen and you'll see what real music is. This is before talentless people ruled the charts courtesy of a mixing board. This album is from the times when you actually used to need talent to be a real artist. One of the best albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just great songs","review":"I remember having a very bad image of Elvis, lumping him into the \\"new wave\\" phenomenon for years. Then I finally listened to this cd. The songs are nothing short of incredible. Not a bad one in the bunch. The production is stark but that just enhances the power of the tunes to stand out on their own without gimmicks. I'm not sure he ever made another album as complete as this one, though I followed him through several more excellent lps. This one's a definite keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pop/Rock With Intelligence and an Attitude!","review":"Dylan may have changed the lyrical content of rock and pop, but I feel Elvis Costello with this debut, changed the song structure of rock. These are punchy 3 minute gems with strong melodies. But it's the lyrics that stick to your mind like a character from your past. The album starts off with \\"Now that your picture's in the paper being perfectly admired..\\" Well, you know this guy is different..but he writes so good. My favorites are The Angels Want To Wear My Red Shoes, Alison, Miricle Man and Watching The Detectives. But really the whole album is a rock and roll joy! When I first purchased the album over 20 years ago, the lady working at the album store said \\"My he looks like Buddy Holly, but his name is ELVIS?...COSTELLO? There's a little bit of all of the best of rock in E.C. If you don't like this album, you are not a true rocker. The new CD sound by the way, is marvelous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis Lives","review":"A great solid debut from, as Rolling Stone once called him, \\"a man who looks like Buddy Holly after drinking a can of STP.\\" The additional songs are mostly acoustic, stripped down and offer a nice contrast to the rest of the album. -- Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far ahead of his time...","review":"...that's really the most definitive statement that I can make about this modern masterpiece. This album has absolutely stood the test of time. \\"Allison,\\" \\"Watching the Detectives,\\" \\"Less Than Zero,\\" \\"Waiting for the End of the World,\\" and \\"Not Angry\\" are a few of my favorite songs of all time. And they're all right here, conveniently placed on one disc. Is life good or what?Put it on and throw a party."},{"rating":"2","title":"We can never be sure.","review":"While we can never quite be sure what, exactly (if anything), \\"Less Than Zero\\" means, we know that it's a great song. Like every other song on the album, \\"Less Than Zero\\" flows over nicely rounded hills that Declan McManus (Elvis Costello's birth name) had landscaped while working in a factory. The bonus disc contains some interesting things (for true fans).Elvis Costello, of all people, seemed to know how to write about heartache, and in his earliest works, it's none more apparent than in Alison. The girl he wanted seemed to have wandered off to marry someone else after ignoring Elvis's attempts at courting her, never noticing that his aim was true.Overall, this is a classic album and any true music fan should have at least an original copy; any true Elvis Costello fan should have the reissue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"What can you say. This album showed everything good about music. Lrics second only to Springsteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for the money but there must be a better guide available","review":"This publication has some useful statistics but falls short on providing essential information such as adjustments for loaders, adjustments for high or low hours, what to expect for hours for a given model year .

One was taken to the vet because he got pretty sick. Seems hairballs were the problem. I initialy used petroleum jelly. They won't just take it off your finger so I rub it onto their paws. They hate it, but that's why they lick it off.I figured i'd give this a try. It's flavored so maybe I could spare pissing them off and they would like licking the stuff right from my finger. This was not the case. So I thought, fine, I'll just put it on their paws. BAD IDEA. They slung it all over the walls and my bedding. It doesn't have the same consistency as petroleum jelly.I have been feeding them food designed to help them pass hairballs. There are a few out there and I recommend you find one they like because you are not going to want the hassle of administering this product as many times as you have to. I recommend petroleum jelly in the mean time. Seems the food takes a little time to start being effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"cats hate it","review":"My cats hate this and won't touch it.

I have 7 cats, none of whom would take a lick of this product. Even after putting this in the fridge and mushing it up in the tube before dispensing, the goop is way to viscous and drips right off of my finger, leaving a sticky mess on the floor.

It was just an okay read, not romantic and a bit on the disgusting side, i.e. too much talk about villianess vampire sucking her victims dry. Oh and there is an ancient vampire who is described as if it is an alien from space. The constant doubt of the character Beth is annoying, she always thinks of herself as unattractive; it gets a bit old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"I'm sorry that I do not agree with the rest of the reviewers. Perhaps it is just that this type of book is not to my taste. I was expecting a vampire novel with an erotic element and an exciting plot. Well the vampire part is correct, but the rest was not there for me unless torture and impotence are erotic. It took more than three quarters of the book for the vampire and his mate to find mutual satisfaction in a less than erotic manner. The book was suppose to be a page turner, but for me the only page turning I did was to skip parts that were so boring and detailed that I could barely keep my attention focused on the plot. Clearly I am in the minority and most of the people who read Ms Squires' novels know and appreciate her writing style. This is my first attempt at reading one of her books and it will be may last. If you are looking for an erotic love story vampire style, \\"The Companion\\" is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot! Hot! Hot!","review":"Out of all Susan Squire's books, this one is my favorite. The story telling has a dreamlike quality, but the emotions are sizzling hot. I like my romance books to have exotic locales and exciting heroes and heroines. I prefer them in plenty of dangerous situations and with dangerous enemies. This book provided all of them. Therefore, I loved it. I will watch out for this author's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"If you have a dremel you know that they produce good stuff to do what it does.

Do you want to know what anyone is thinking? There is a way by using peas and snakes. \\"If a madman is touched by a diamond he will be cured of his malady\\" (good to cure your mad relatives, although perhaps out or reach for much of the common folk). Do you laugh at it? Russian have believed that way for centuries, and similar beliefs have been shared (do not use the past tense!) by the other European -and American- people too.All this and more is compiled in a very orderly way by the author, in a masterful work that can be savoured by the professional historian and educated layperson alike. Besides, the book is not a difficult reading (content: 5 starts; pleasure of reading: 4 to 3).(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Electrifying, Educational, and Soulful","review":"I am a blues newbie and really enjoyed this book.

The adjustability and number attachments available for this piece are fantastic.Only con (if you want to call it that) is that the pull-up bar is pretty smooth, so when your hands get sweaty it becomes hard to use. (This is just physics though - the bar is metal) You can fix this with some $0.79 tennis grip tape. Just wrap the non-knurled parts of the bar and you've got yourself a perfect rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best rain recording","review":"My wife loves the sound of rain.

Works great for settling down our new baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I am very disappointed by this CD. The first 20 minutes or so are excellent, but after 20 minutes the rain sound is barely audible. As a result, the noises that I want to block, which necessitated the purchase of this CD, wake me up. This wouldn't be a problem if the CD had several tracks, so that I could just set the first track on repeat and listen to the first 20 minutes over and over again. Unfortunatley, the entire 60-minute CD is one single track.

Not a keeper, but, an OK read.

My experience with cordless mice is the batteries go out just when you need them most, so corded is the way to go. Just recently, the latch that holds the retractable cord's door closed broke, so I just bought another Pocket Mouse Pro.The only thing I don't like about this mouse is the cord tends to have a coiled memory, that is, once it's unrolled, it tends to stay curly. This means that it often comes out of the mouse semi-coiled, and then easily gets tangled up with the mouse or curls under the mouse when you are using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product--I've worn the feet off of mine","review":"My wife and I both use these with our laptops and love them. It works with any computer that has USB, and has no batteries to run down, so it's always ready. I've had mine for 2 years, and am about to replace it because I have literally run the feet off of it--the little nylon pads on the bottom have worn down to the point that it sort of scrapes when it moves. I am surprised to see the negative reviews about the cord, because I have had no problems at all. You need to be reasonably careful when retracting the cord so that it doesn't bunch up, but it seems very sturdy. I carry mine in a backpack where it gets jostled around with a bunch of other gizmos, and it continues to work perfectly. I used to think a wireless mouse was the ultimate for mobility, but those have 2 problems: 1) batteries; 2) most of them come in 2 parts, so if you lose one, the whole thing stops working. This mouse has neither of those issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great no problems - great for user on the go","review":"I was originally planning to purchase a wireless mouse for my laptop but stumbled across the Kensington PocketMouse Pro. This mouse has worked flawlessly for me. With this product, I don't think I would purchase the wireless version - I want the mouse to be always available, always working. I don't want to have to worry about battery management. The retractable cord is very slick. It retracts nicely into a compartment in the mouse. My only comment is that the mouse is small so don't expect this to be ergonomically perfect. That said, it is an order of magnitude better than the built-in pointer mechansim on my laptop. Overall - this product is excellent. I am an XP Pro user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor execution.","review":"I purchased two of these when they first came out. The retractable cord was great, but I have found two problems with these mice. On one of the mice the retractor mechanism broke. Now, my other one is fine, and I will probably chalk it up to my fater being a bit too rough on it. The other problem is much more annoying, and is present on BOTH of my mice. The problem is with the scroll wheel. The wheel has a tendency to \\"stick\\" between knotches causing the screen to jump up and down erratically. It is very difficult to use the wheel without this problem popping up. I have never had this problem with \\"quality\\" scroll mice, only cheap ones. I think Kensington cut corners on it's design. On the other hand, their WIRELESS Pocketmouse resolved both of my issues and is a FANTASTIC mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"good hardware, bad XP drivers","review":"Don't bother. The XP driver is beta, and won't uninstall. The first clue something is wrong is the fact that they don't ship software with the mouse, but expect you to download it from their website before installing the hardware. Sounds like they needed a little more time to cook the software to me...but it is still not ready yet! Now my Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop \\"blue screens\\" several times a day. So I bought a Microsoft optical mouse instead, and now my system thinks it is still a Kensington mouse. I guess I have to reinstall XP to kill the mouse.Save yourself and stay away from this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat cord, but....","review":"That retractable cord is just phenomenal. Unfortunately it's connected to this garbage Kensington mouse. After a few hours of use the optical hardware started flickering, and eventually it just shut off. I can still make it light up once in a while, but never long enough to use it to navigate Kensington's website and tell them to get their act together. If yours isn't broken yet, then congrats for now. At least in a pinch I can still use the cord retractor on mine to make a Batman-esque escape. Right idea, wrong mouse/company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kensington Mouse................","review":"The idea of a retractable cord for a mouse really saves me time from untying tangled cords from my laptop case.

American Buffalo, The Edge, Oleana (sp?), The Spanish Prisoner and, I think, State and Main. None of them are deserving of the reputation Mamet enjoys. The Spanish Prisoner is mildly interesting, I suppose, but none of the others fall anywhere near the top of my greatest films list.This movie was just a dull action film dressed up (and not very convincingly) as an art film or as something with intellectual appeal. The dialogue gets so fast and furious at points that, if it weren't for the all the frequent repetitions, you'd have to be rewinding all the time to hear what was said.We gave it our best effort, but in the end, we both agreed that we'll pass on any future Mamet productions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a simple film.","review":"This is not a simple film.

It seems that the reason for the kidnapping might not be what everyone thinks, but that doesn't mean the the girl is not in danger. And as he draws closer to finding her, other forces begin to work against him to actively prevent him from succeeding.

The lines between the different characters was so bizarre, and so cryptic, you often found that you had lost track of the important moments because you were too busy trying to figure out what the hell they were trying to say to one another. One of my favorites was \\"You gotta get me to the tall corn\\". It sounded very Dora the Explorer-like."},{"rating":"1","title":"ohhh baby!","review":"To say that David Mamet is an utter thumping no-talent is to gravely insult no-talents. This movie is so bad it would be inappropriate for me to explain what is bad about it. This would be analogous to calling the cops to a scene of mass slaughter and having them arrive and say, \\"Sooo... what seems to be the trouble here?\\"\\"Well, these people... they're all dead.\\"\\"Aaaand that's... bad?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mamet is coasting","review":"on Glengarry Glen Ross...still!I endured this last night and will now try to spare you the experience.I had a bad feeling during the first few minutes. Then, about 10 minutes in, there is a scene where two Delta trainees are in a room together. Oh man, I could feel it coming, but I didn't want to believe it. Sure enough, the training sargent issues his instructions and steps back. Last man standing joins the unit.At times I laughed, but basically by the end of the movie I was sick to my stomach that I had paid $4 and two hours of my life watching this. Although when the wooden Kilmer leans over his female accomplice at the end and says, \\"Oh baby\\", I did have one last chuckle.No more Mamet for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think the director and producer were on crack...","review":"I can honestly say this is the worst movie I've ever seen.The acting is stilted and disjointed to start. The diaglog is as banal as it gets, and most of the time it doesn't even make any sense. The scenes jump from one to another with no intelligible transitions.This could have been a good movie, but it seems like everything about it was based on chance with no planing whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible....","review":"I read the reviews and should have known better but I like Val Kilmer and Mamet did a good job on the \\"Unit\\" series, but this movie was utter garbage. I thought maybe there would be some merit to it being that Eric Haney (Inside Delta Force) was a military adviser on it, but I was wrong. Very confusing movie with absolutely dreadful acting. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another stupid action flick.","review":"When I read about this movie I thought it would be a political thriler or something close to that. Boy, was I missguided. The screenplay sucks big time!!! It's just a stupid patriotic action movie where 10 people have to die just to save a slut who happens to be the U.S. Presidents daughter. C'mon Hollywood you can do better than that!!! And as a Val Kilmer fan I have to say \\" What's wrong with you Val? You can't be so desperate!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The most thrilling part was the credits because that meant......","review":"this movie was over.I found this movie to be awful.

The story is interesting but the dialog and acting is absolutely dreadful. Hearing Val Kilmer running around calling everybody \\"baby\\" was painful. It took everything I had to watch the entire thing. Sometimes the dialog was so bad and so cheesy that it didn't make a lick of sense. Honestly, I've seen pornos with better acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mamet finally went over the top.","review":"Some people can't stomach Mamet's quickfire dialogue. Some hate his use of actors as automaton dialogue delivery devices. Others are bothered by the twist upon twist of his films. I believe that these are great to a point. That point was passed in this movie.The clever dialog turns to just plain non-sense. The plot is just jumbled weirdness. The wonderful actors talents are wasted.Try Heist, State and Main, or Spanish Prisoner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baaaaaad!","review":"Get a lobotomy if you want to hope to enjoy this movie.

The Presidents daughter is supposedly missing, either she was sold into slavery or she did it herself. Kilmer and crew set out in search and things dont seem what they appear to be. Some of this movie doesnt make as bit of sense as others but it adds up to a good performance by Kilmer as always. Along for the ride is Derek Luke (Biker Boyz, Antwone Fisher), Ed O'Neill (Tv's Married With Children, The Bone Collector), Aaron Stanford (Tadpole, X2: X-Men United), Tia Texada (Bait, Tv's Third Watch) and William H. Macy (The Cooler, Pleasantville). Both Macy and O'Neill are in small and wasted roles and it looks like they had fun shooting up Luke a lot. The end with the airport seems forced, dont you think? Directed by David Mamet (Heist)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and Chaotic","review":"This movie is poorly written. The plot is chaotic and meandering and greatly suffers from a lack of coherence and believability.Val Kilmer plays a Secret Service agent tasked to rescue a senator's daughter after she was abducted and sent to the Middle East to be sold into the sex trade. It turns out it is hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys and nefarious plots are afoot. But as the plot unfolds it is flat and really not well conceived.Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"I could only handle watching about half this movie before i ejected it.Just the wooden way the dialogue was delivered by Kilmer and the unbelievability of the film was enough to drive me crazy.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts good, but lacks good plot and is political biased","review":"This movie starts good, but oh what a bumer in the end. Just when you start to get currious about this movie, it turns more unrealistic every minute. The whole story just made no sence to me, why do the characters what they do, they seem to have so many more options that are much more likely. But what bothered me more is the kind of sick ideas that are the basis of the film. I think that we should always question state power, also the presidents power, but I can not happen to think that this plot idea has something todo with political inspirations that only Hollywood liberals have. Who else can tie the war on terror wich such a visious idea about the presidency, as is done in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"LARRY","review":"AN INTERESTING START.

Spartan is about an gov't agen who likes to do things his own way played very well by Val Kilmer. Who decides to go look for the president's daughter who has been kidnapped. But little does this know that this who thing goes all the way to the oval office. What made this film refeshing in the terse dialog between the characters. They may not say much but you understand what they are trying to say. After seeing this i am starting to think that Val Kilmer is an underrated actor. he gives a very good performance. As with mamet regulars William H. Macy and Ed O'Neil gives a very good yet understated performance. This is a political thriller for people who like to think and this is action mamet style."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Movies of 2004","review":"\\"Spartan\\" is for smart people. Lame-o's will get lost within three minutes. I made it till the end. The daughter of a powerful political figure is kidnapped and thrown into a global sex ring. Of course it's up to Scott (Val Kilmer) and his special agents to track down the fools who dared to take that girl. Scott likes to ask bad guys questions with a repeated stiffness and then roughs them up. You'll have to see it, he's great. Other stars include Derek Luke, William H. Macy, and Ed O'Neill. And there are lots of conspiracy twists in the movie, so pay attention. You'll be glad that you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless drivel","review":"This and Van Helsing are the worst movies I have seen in the past 5 years. The entire film was utterly painful to watch, and the dialogue seemed like it was written by a retarded monkey. I would sooner pay $8 to have the memory of this film erased from my mind. The only thing that kept me from drowning myself in the toilet after seeing that film was to write this review in hopes of deterring others from making the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"You either love Mamet or you hate him, apparently. . .","review":"I've read many of the negative reviews on this space, and while some of them are from disapointed Mamet fans, most of them appear to be folks who know nothing about the Pulitzer winning writer/director. If you love Mamet and simply adore the dialogue of films such as \\"Wag The Dog,\\" \\"Ronin,\\" (written under a pseudonym) and \\"The Edge,\\" you'll like Spartan. I loved it. Of course the dialogue isn't realistic! Don't expect realism! In order to enjoy a film as \\"Mametized\\" as \\"Spartan,\\" you need to forget reality and immerse yourself in the world Mamet has created -- a world which, much like the worlds of Wes Anderson (Rushmore) or The Coen Brothers (Intolerable Cruelty), grabs hold of stereotypes, cliche's, and the corniest of dialogue and twists those elements to make them entertaining again. From the reactions I see here on Amazon, this appears to be for Mamet fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mamets' Best Work Yet","review":"David Mamet does plot twists and stories that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat better then anyone. Spartan is one of his greatest achievements.Val Kilmer, who I have always enjoyed, has had a bad run for a while. It is great to see him back on his game, and this is arguably his best role since Tomestone. The acting in this movie is top notch, with everyone down to the smallest player adding to the film. At no point was I pulled out of the movie by a performance.The writing is of course superb. Mamet can craft a story like few others. The unique cadence of the dialog is something that really drew me to this movie. While it is unique and has a strange feel to it, this in no way detracts form the movie.Everything about this film works for me, and I am happy to see Kilmer back on his game.

I found Sibley to be the best guide for the field. While there is limited information, this guide provides essential information needed to make a positive identification. It includes multiple images of birds as well as any variants for gender, age, etc. While I would definitely suggest at least looking at other guides, I would say this is the essential guide for time in the field. Additionally, now that the larger Sibley Guide has been split into a Eastern and Western version it is portable: it fits in my back pocket as I trek through the woods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put on your specs","review":"Don't order this book if you are over 40. While the Sibley guides are well loved by many people, this version challenges the printing industry in terms of small type. If you can read 4-6 point type or walk around the woods with a magnifying glass, maybe you will find this field guide useful. I myself was totally disgusted that I could not read it in the house with my reading glasses on. I wondered if I was being picky, so I compared it to other field guides I have for birds, flowers, mammals, and trees. No question. The type in this book is much smaller and harder to read than any other field guide on my shelves. In addition, the copy I received seemed to be off color for anything that was a reddish tint."},{"rating":"2","title":"best field guide","review":"By far the best guide book to take into the field.

This one does the trick. I flipped through various other guides (Peterson's, NG, etc) at a bookstore, and I found this one much more intuitive and efficient. I find the illustrations to much more effective than those of other field guides I encounter people using.Pictures are helpful, but when I'm making an initial ID, the illustrations are what I go to first. They tend to be much easier to see the important field marks necessary, without too much wasted, excess information. When I see a bird I'm not sure about, I almost always grab this book, and then follow up with checking my iBird app for pictures and songs/calls for a final confirmation.Of course, different guides will be more effective for different individuals, so be sure to check out multiple ones at a bookstore before coming back to amazon to get the best deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the birds!","review":"This is a great book. It is easy to navigate and the illustrations are excellent. The range maps, illustrations and text descriptions are right together. Older field guides had color plates with page numbers to find the text. When I purchased this \\"paperback\\", I was a little concerned about durability. It is really not a paperback. It is bound like a hardback with quality paper. Instead of the hard cover, it has a soft laminated paper cover. It should last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sibley guides beat all.","review":"Don't settle for your average birding guide. Sibley has been studying birds his whole life.

I don't know if buying here means it will come from some third party seller or still from the same seller as on tv - I purchased mine through the infomercial.

All in all the Spin Spa is working great for me and it does make feel like I've gone to a spa everytime I use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outstanding for as long as it lasted.","review":"I really thought this was a great brush. The balance is good, and the handle isn't slippery when wet at all. It has two speeds and did a great job. I didn't expect much for twelve bucks, so I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this thing worked -- that was for about five minutes. After that, gears inside its little head seemed to rattle and slip and eventually stopped rotating the brush entirely. Now, it just makes noise, leaving me with a twelve-buck back brush.This really is a good idea for a product and would definitely be worth more if a reliable company made one. Maybe one does. I'll certainly look for one and buy it if I find one. This, however, is just a cheap junk item, something to throw money away on either to see if it really does work or to give as one of those obligatory gifts to folks not at the top of our gift lists.Since none of my relatives read Amazon reviews, I might just buy a couple more of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth even this price!","review":"I was really looking forward to getting this item. As I have difficulty with my joints, and movement in general I thought that this would be a valuable bath aid. It is not.It is far too weak to be of any practical use. After using it once the \\"high\\" setting barely spins, and the \\"low\\" setting might just as well be called \\"off\\". Pressing it against your skin causes it to just stop spinning, there simply isn't enough power for the SpinSpa to actually work. Even fresh batteries don't help.Although the pumice stone attachment is actually quite nice as well as two others, in the end they worked better when I REMOVED THEM from the SpinSpa and just used them by hand. Definitely not worth the price I paid to this company.If you are someone who needs a serious bath aid, save your money and pass this item by. I'm going to look at the other bath aids on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 week planned obsolescence at best!","review":"In college I studied planned obsolescence. It is the practice of marketers taking a product into the market place srictly to make a quick profit based on concept alone knowing full well that the product will not last any length of time and is poorly engineered. In short they knowingly make a cheap product for a quick buck. This product fits the bill to a tee. The profile and weight at the head make it an ahtletic challenge just to hold the brush in reverse to scrub your back. The unit is extremely under powered. Any friction at all needed for proper cleaning and exfoliation stops the rotation. The center lug on my brush broke the first day. I would pay a lot more for a brush that would truly do what this brush pretends to do. This product is a joke as a bath brush but it makes a real good home defense club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good shower brush","review":"Other than being a little under-powered with batteries, the brush, with all its attachments, is the best deal. The handle is very long and the assortment of brushes is overwhelming. I suppose that if the motor was any more powerful, one might risk hurting oneself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"If you waste your money on this product, you will have no one to blame but yourself. The concept is desirable; that's the only thing this item hits on.

I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept but weak power","review":"This product was wonderful for the first run. Good concept for the price.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs More Power","review":"I bought this product once it was available at department stores. I was quite excited to try it out. It's very easy to work with, but lacks power. If you turn the product on without an attachment, you can immediately notice that there is more power in the gears than with an attachment. This in itself is mildly disappointing. When you use it in the shower, you cannot apply pressure to the Spin Spa because it will stop spinning. In my opinion, it feels like you get an insufficient result simply due to the lack of torque in the brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife loves it","review":"My wife saw this in a catalog and requested it as a gift.

While it worked it was almost worthless at best. The slightest amount of pressure would slow the spin head down to a stop, even with brand new batteries. About the 3rd week, it slipped out of my hand ( water, soap.... no non-slip handle) and fell to the tile floor. It LOOKED ok but I could hear something rattling inside, and it never spun its little head again. It's junk, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last","review":"I bought two of these & both quit after 2-3 uses.

I have been using this brush for a long time, but it is important to buy the Lithium-Ion AA batteries (for use in high-tech devices), because this thing drains power like there is no tomorrow. If you use the Li-Ion batteries, this brush will work fine and last for a long time. You can get these batteries at any store in the regular battery section."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does spin...I'm not overly impressed","review":"The commercial for this had me sold...good job for the commercial. This item is not all that it is cracked up to be. The expoliating attachment is almost useless....it's design is too bulky to spin, thus it rolls around on your skin, without much proficiency. The other attachments don't feel like they do much because they don't lather the way a rag or other items do. I really got it for the pumice/pedicure feature.

So basically, I tucked it in the back cupboard and there it has been for several months now. Last week, I broke my right wrist (being right handed, this has been a real challenge). Ah yes, I remembered my brush now, thinking that it might be a help in my situation. I pulled it out of that back cupboard, put brand new batteries in it and VOILA! IT DID NOT WORK AT ALL.

It has spoken to me on my spiritual path in a deep and very personal way. I highly recommend it, and in fact am buying 3 copies to give as gifts. She has made an amazing debut with this beautifully lyrical, poetic and rich work. I can't wait for #2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature Christian Lyrics with a Contemporary Sound","review":"Nichole Nordeman has done a great job putting a fresh sound together in her debut album. Although she is in her early 20's, Nichole has the insight of someone much older. Her lyrics are mature and bold. She puts a modern look and feel to her Christian-based songs which allows the listener to relate well to the message. The great gift you receive from listening to her music is a 'connection' to the songs. You will get a feeling of \\"I know what she is talking about, and I've been there\\"! For anyone who likes contemporary music a-la Alanis Morrisette and Sara McLaughlin you'll probably love this too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wide eyed","review":"My sister and me realy LOVE this cd. Oh, wow. I'm a poet and i didn't even realize it. anyways, back to Nicole Nordeman. my sister likes 'River God' and 'Wide Eyed' best, but i like 'Is it any wonder' and 'To say thanks'. it is a realy cool cd!! and you will realy love to get it. im serious, you will!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for Christians","review":"It would be a shame if anyone avoided this album merely because Ms. Nordeman is labeled a \\"Contemporary Christian\\" performer. This is a wonderful album with a strong, emotional performance and fantastic compositions. Whether she whispers or wails, Nordeman's voice is perfect, and her passion for her music is evident. Although her lyrics reflect her faith, Nordeman is never preachy, and the themes of self-doubt, love, and uncertainty are universal. With a sound reminiscent of Tori Amos, Alanis Morissette, and Sheryl Crow, this CD is for anyone who enjoys music, no matter their beliefs or faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"She sounds like the Angels singing praises to the Lord.","review":"I was pleasantly awaken to hear that refreshing voice Nichole on tv. It was the very first time I heard her and it surely put some sunshine back in my rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I saw her in concert at Great America. It was the best concert all day. I loved the music and the beat of the concert. The words have a great spiritual uplook and are good for teens (girls) but mostly christains since the unsaved would not understand some of it. \\"Is it any wonder song\\" is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!","review":"This is one of my favorite CD's! This is one you can play over and over and it doesn't get old. The songs are really beautiful and the lyrics are very touching. You won't regret buying this one. Some might call it christian lyrics with an alternative/pop sound. Simply wonderful...for teens AND adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nichole Nordeman","review":"Nichole Nordeman is one of the most inspiring songwriters I've ever listened to. Her songs stir up strong emotions. She causes me to reflect on my relationship with GOD and the way I sometimes act towards other people. Her songs make me step back and look at my life in a different way.I absolutely love Nichole Nordeman. I hope you enjoy her music as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CCM Album By A Wonderfully Talented New Artist","review":"I was surprisingly impressed with this CD. I was captured by the title tune to the CD, \\"Wide Eyed\\" so I decided to buy the CD; I was not dissapointed. Ms. Nordeman is an excellent songwriter and a great singer. This CD is very refreshing. Some other great cuts on it include \\"Burnin'\\", \\"Is It Any Wonder\\" and \\"To Know You\\". I hope to hear more from this great young, inspiring artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redken mens bar","review":"My mom has been using this product since I was a little girl. Even though it is for men it is apparently ph balanced and she swears by it. She has always said not to lather up with the soap in your hand, but rather wet a washcloth and rub the soap into it. That way this pricey soap lasts longer. Personally I think it is a very high quality soap and smells \\"clean\\" without smelling cheap or smelling too \\"manly\\". I do not use it personally because I am not that picky but if I was I would absolutely use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage DVD of a GREAT SHOW available on bootleg !f","review":"Hi folks,this is a spectacular (if too short) film of Foreigner and Lou Gramm just tearing it up!

She was skeptical at first, but now that we've both used this one for a few weeks, WOW! What a huge difference the second wheel makes. And the construction of this one, compared to the two-wheeled Jackson we almost bought, is superb. We only had to spend about $25 more for this one. and it's worth every penny. I've filled it with 250-300 pounds of rocks, and had no problem on the steep side slope of our yard when hauling them to the back for dumping. The thick tray is sure to last much longer than the thinner ones I looked at when shopping around.A great product. If you haul anything heavy, and want a wheelbarrow that seems like it might last a lifetime, this is the one you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Industrial Grade Material Relocator","review":"The best and lightest wheelbarrow on the market until someone invents one with a titanium tub. As a Southeast Texas homebuilder this tool gets tons of abuse but still keeps haulin it. Assembly was simple and straight forward and was completed 20 minutes after the jealous UPS guy left. (I was glad when he left too. I wasn't sure I liked the way he was eyeing my new barrow)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two wheel barrow","review":"This item is VERY awkward to use. It is heavy, does NOT STEER well and has been a great disapointment!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!","review":"Instead, buy Cheap Thrills. If you are looking at this and thinking that this \\"Best Of\\" CD would be good to buy because you want to get into Zappa, DON'T! Cheap Thrills is a much better representation of Zappa's catalogue. It includes many of his classics such as Joe's Garage and Catholic Girls and some live stuff and is generally a much better compilation than this. Also, if you end up not liking Zappa (which I doubt will happen) Cheap Thrills is (as the name says) cheap. Amazon has it for like 7 bucks and I got it at a music store for around 3 bucks. So, in conclusion, DON'T BUY THIS!! Buy Cheap Thrills, and if you like it, buy Son of Cheap Thrills, and if you still like it then go to the You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore series and so on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"....Spend the rest of my life in San Ber'dino.....\\"","review":"Yes, it'd be great to have all 50 or so albums FZ made to be able to absorb what a unique genius he was but for the average listener that's not really practical. So you have to rely on \\"compilations\\" and I find this one to be very satisfying when I need a Zappa \\"fix.\\" His ability to find sarcastic humor in the \\"serious\\" world of rock and roll will make you laugh out loud. He is in a category shared by few who combined high-quality musicianship with biting wit (Randy Newman, Tom Waits come to mind). Just listen to \\"Be in my Video\\" or \\"Montana\\" and I dare you not to crack a grin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start here!","review":"This is not a comprehensive collection, but it is a great place to start if you are new to Zappa. This was my first Zappa album and some 35 albums later I still crave more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"Take some stale puns and rehashed jokes that wouldn't have made the cut on Saturday Night Live, a guitarist who thinks playing fast is playing well, a second-rate band that can't decide if it's rock or jazz, and you've got Frank Zappa. He was a trailblazer for freedom of speech and I admire him for that. But if you want funny, try Loudon Wainwright."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good reason to know not to pursue any futher Frank Zappa","review":"This disk had one or two good tracks (\\"Sexual Harrassment in the Workplace\\"), but most of it was just musically uninteresting-- and this is the evaluation of a person that listens to and enjoys just about all forms of music.If this is the most commercially successful material that he could produce, this CD is a good warning to avoid Frank Zappa.Not worth more than $5."},{"rating":"1","title":"So funny I forgot to laugh","review":"I gather from the other reviews here (and elsewhere) that this is supposed to be a well-chosen compilation and a good introduction to Zappa. Well, if this is the best he could do, I certainly don't need to hear any more.This is nothing more than Weird Al Yankovic with better instrumentation. And it's not funny. It's puerile. Sure Frank's a good enough guitar player, but his solos are not worth having to sit through all of this unlistenable garbage. Sorry, I tried to get it, but I just don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent compilation, but his \\"best\\"? Nah.","review":"The music on this disc is the closest to the mainstream that Frank got. It's good stuff, but he was at his best when live. Check out the \\"You can't do that on stage anymore\\" series from Ryko. I suppose if you want to get a cross section of his music this will suffice, but I can't say it's really representative of his larger work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but falls way short","review":"Zappa (like the Grateful Dead) requires more than a compilation of short snipets to get the real picture. Instead of this, start out with Apostrophe or One Size Fits All. Then move on to the really GOOD stuff: Roxy and Elsewhere, Fillmore or the You Can't Do That collection. Like the Dead, its the live stuff that will get ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading.","review":"\\"Strictly Commercial\\". The title says it all. Zappa was incredible, but this collection does not reveal to the new listener what Frank was capable of. None of these songs are bad, but most of them are just novelty songs (\\"Be in my video\\", \\"valley girl\\", \\"disco boy\\", etc. ) that get old FAST. Peaches en regalia is wonderful, but rather than buy this collection you should get \\"Hot Rats\\", the album which it originally appeared on. I saw that at least one reviewer on this list was turned off by Strictly Commercial, and that's really a shame. If only that individual had bought a different Zappa album first I suspect he might have had a more positive response. I think curious new listeners should avoid this and try \\"One Size Fits All\\" as a first step into Zappa's world. Or maybe \\"Lather\\", or \\"Chunga's Revenge\\", or \\"Absolutely Free\\", or \\"Shut up n play your guitar\\", or..."},{"rating":"1","title":"songs cut too much","review":"While this cd contains some of Frank's best work, too many songs have been edited to make them shorter. FZ's songs tell a little story and removing parts of it prevents the listener from enjoying the full experience. Some of his better guitar solos have also been cut. They should have kept all songs full length and put them on 2 or 3 discs if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's zappa","review":"This was some of the first zappa music that I ever heard and it definitely turned me on. I think it gives you a good cross section of what frank was capable of. Everything from peaches en Regalia to Muffin Man which blew me away and got me very interested. From there I went on to buy Hot Rats, Joe's Garage, Apostrophe/Overnight Sensation, Bong Fury and many, many others. I think that just for the variations on Don't Eat The Yellow snow and Montana that this disc is justified. One final warning though, if this disc catches you, be ready for the ride of your life and the feeling of lifelong loss that you found Zappa after his unitmely death. Peace, Love and Good Happiness Stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take the title literally.","review":"I'm new to Zappa - but I would say this is a disappointing compilation, particularly having since heard Steve Vai's excellent compilation of FZ Original Recordings. Check it out instead: it actually gets to the bottom line of the artist. This compilation doesn't, and is another example of how bland compilation albums created by the music publisher typically are."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't do this","review":"A terrible waste of money.

Be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"take my name away!","review":"someone gave me this album and I've only been able to hear it all a little at a time. I never listen to it now. Zappa could shred on guitar, he played with other competent musicians, so why do I dislike Zappa's music? It's a question of taste. I dislike his STYLE. I don't find it clever or funny - just stupid. And very, very SELF-INDULGENT. Have you ever seen \\"200 Motels?\\" That has to be the most self-indulgent dung heap ever committed to celluloid. I guess I like Zappa best when he's just playing as on HOT RATS, but even his instrumentals seem to scream, \\"look how clever I am!\\"Zappa himself was actually a very cool dude and I would recommend to anyone \\"The Real Frank Zappa Book.\\" I have heard some of his other albums, and believe me, I love experimentalism (Faust, Mr. Bungle, etc.) but I can't get behind someone recording idle conversation into a covered grand piano as if it was an ingeniously clever thing to do.

Or, more accurately, the most \\"commercial\\" music from a decidedly non-commercial performer. Zappa's only \\"real\\" hit was \\"Valley Girl\\", although \\"Don't Eat the Yellow Snow\\" and \\"Dancin' Fool\\" managed to achieve moderate success. All of these songs could be classified as \\"novelty\\" songs, which would probably tend to be the most accesible type of music Zappa recorded. Almost all of the songs here have at least some humour to them, other than the instrumetals, naturally. Some may complain that this CD doesn't explore a wide enough range of Zappa's music, but it is a good introduction to his music for the uninitiated. I find it thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"exhaustive and well desceribed","review":"this book is exhaustive and well desceribed.

The explanations tend to be far too complex and inaccessible for most graduate students in the social sciences.

Within a day, I needed one of the spatulas to stir the onoins and celery going into a spaghetti sauce. It worked just as expected and there were others that I also used for cleaning out cans of tomatoes and tomato paste. Have used more as time went on.

I recommend this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set of spatulas & a great color!","review":"Got 2 sets of these for Christmas gifts on a friday sale.

I cried from the front to the back. It made me think about what would happen to me, what I would do, and how I could go on living if I was to ever lose my husband.

But somehow I doubt that happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book in less than a day, and once again was disappointed by one of Ms. Steel's most recent books. It was highly predictable and had very little character development. You never really get a great insight as to her husband, and the 3 daughters are just kind of there, compared to Jaime and Peter. I never got the impression that Jaime was handicap as the author wrote him to be. Overall, I am disppointed in the fact that for her last few books, they have seemed to have been hastily written, way too predictable, and have a regurgitated story line. Even the names in this book were ones used in other pretty recent books. I've been reading Danielle Steel for years, and sadly instead of getting better, her books have gotten profoundly worse. If you want to read a good Steel book, read Message From Nam, Fine Things, or Daddy. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Story","review":"This book is a predictable love story, what we've all come to love about Danielle Steel's books. Perhaps we'd like a bit more UNpredictability, but most of the time I enjoy the story anyway. Reading a book like this makes you feel so thankful for what you have, that's always a good thing. It also makes you think that if anything bad were to befall you, you could probably survive. This wasn't her best book, but I thought it was decent. If you want to read a really great love story by Steel, check out: The Ring, To Love Again, Summers End, Answered Prayers & Passions Promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"I don't like reading a book, and finding myself looking back to clarify details. I found some details in this book that did not agree with each other in latter chapters. I feel that Ms. Steele writes too fast now, and the stories race to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really should be 3 stars but...","review":"The beginning of the book was excellent and then it tapered off towards the end. The House on Hope St, has tones of her earlier and much superior book \\"Accident\\", which I highly recommend. Pick it up for a good read, but realize as soon as she enters the relationship with the doctor, everything is textbook romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Author = Same Story ??","review":"I guess I'm lucky to have started reading DS very recently. If I have read her earlier books, (like the ones recommended here, the good ones) I would have been even more disappointed. After my first book, Granny Dan, I wanted to try DS again, expecting something different but something that would show it's the same author. Ho ho ho !! Yeah, the same author all right, but the same story?? OK, it's not exactly the same, but close to what I read before. I'm scared to buy another book of hers because I'll get the feeling I've wasted money. Anyway I'll try 'The Ring' someday when I recover from the fear of spending money on the same story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I am still waiting for Thurston House II","review":"As always, I snatch up the latest DS novel, read it over a weekend, and say - I MISS THE OLD DANIELLE STEEL! Where is the history, the geography trips, something to learn while we are being romanced. The formula is tried and true - as one who has never missed one will attest - but I want more.. I am happy to see \\"normal\\" woman (not stunners with long flowing manes) who work and manage families - and not perfect familes either - good characters there - and I am happy that the would-be new love was not a clone, but guess I want it all. Overall, a fair summer beach/rainy day book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The House on Hope Street","review":"I am and probably always will be a great fan of Daniells Steele, but found The House on Hope Street to be the same old story...much sadness in the begining....happiness in the end....seems her books always contain well educated people and stunning husband's and wives. However, as usual, it is difficult to put the book down once you have started. It was worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable summer book","review":"I read this book pretty quickly and I must say it was very enjoyable. I felt a lot of sympathy for Liz and her kids and everything they went through. As in most Danielle Steel books, it ends well.

No woman with five children can practice law full time, much less trial law, even if she has a woman to help her at home. Then suddenly that same woman is alone with a growing practice which would require her full attention. In addition, she has a mentally handicapped child who requires her full attention plus four other teenage children not even mentioned in the book who must need mentoring! When does she find time for that? This is probably the worst book Ms. Steele has written. It's completely unbelievable. She's getting hard up on subjects!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bittersweet","review":"This is a \\"fast as you can\\" page turner!I enjoy all of D. Steele's books and haven't been disappointed yet!

Give me more at the end, though...what happens??? Give it a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The House on Hope Street","review":"Disappointing..... The House on Hope Street is not one of Danielle Steel's better works. The story is pretty much described on the book cover and does not vary much from that content. I was disappointed that she did little to expand on this story. It was a let down after reading \\"The Wedding\\". Danielle Steel can certainly do better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Former Fan","review":"Truthfully, I haven't read this book so if you can't use my review, that's fine. I just wanted to vent about this as it really bothers me how Ms. Steel's books are continually on the bestseller list. I quit buying Danielle Steel awhile back. Her books are all about the same thing! Somebody always dies and/or miscarries. Her childbirth scenes are horrible--nobody ever has an easy delivery. Her writing style drives me crazy! I have frequently wanted to send one of her books back with all the unnecessary words crossed out. If all of the \\"the's\\" \\"ands\\" and other repititions were removed the books would be cut in half. How many times can one person begin a sentence with \\"AND\\"? How many times can one person write the phrase \\"Not just a pretty girl, but a beautiful woman\\"? Plus,I actually read the phrase \\"fatally killed\\" in one of her novels--huh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"SURLEY TO BE ANOTHER GREAT HIT......","review":"I HAVE NOT YET READ \\"HOUSE ON HOPE STREET', I JUST FOUND OUT THAT IT CAME OUT,AND SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT THIS NOVEL WILL BE ANOTHER GREAT HIT, AND I CAN'T WAIT TO READ IT:) THIS SHOULD BE ON EVERYBODY'S SUMMER READING LIST:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The House on Hope Street","review":"I found the book very touching and close to the heart. You felt you were right there in the story. I felt the characters were well written. You understood how deeply Liz & Jack loved each other. When Jack was killed, you felt the pain that Liz felt. Once again Liz feels the pain when her son is in the hospital fighting for his life. She meets Dr. Bill Webster who saves her son and a relationship between Liz and Bill starts to blossom. I found the book very moving, fast reading and totally enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Shallow Steel","review":"The House on Hope Street is typical of Danielle Steel's most recent work--unoriginal, rambling, shallow, practically dialog-free, sophomoric, grammatically incorrect, and seemingly unedited. I miss the earlier Danielle Steel whose quality novels were written well, when she had to prove herself in order to be published! Now, she just blasts them out without any thought to character development, creative dialog, or research. After yet another disappointing book, she's made me resort to re-reading her well-written classics rather than waste my time and money on her new releases. For those readers who are impressed by her recent novels, check out her earlier works and you may be really impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DS is back on track","review":"\\"The House on Hope Street\\" is the best book Ms. Steel has written in a long time. She showed signs of her former self with \\"The Wedding\\" and with \\"Hope Street\\" she returns to the style that suits her best, telling a tale of love, love lost, and love found. This book is not without its faults, but it's obvious that it was written with more care than some of her recent works. It's a small book and therefore a quick read, but it avoids some of the pitfalls Ms. Steel has become prone to such as repetitiveness just to fill up pages.If you are a DS fan, you should enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another touching book from Danielle Steel","review":"I love every book I have read by her, and this one is no different. She really knows how to capture your attention and make you feel like your experiencing the story yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorta Boring","review":"This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"No seagulls is a plus... but it's a little dated.","review":"This Cd is about 20 years old now and the recording sounds a bit thin, like rustling paper. I love that there aren't a whole bunch of squawking seagulls and that it's an \\"Atlantic\\" sounding beach, however. The market is flooded with big \\"Pacific\\" sounding ones in this genre. The price is ok, but all things considered, I like the Cape Cod Soundscapes series here better, and how each one is labeled with the individual beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it doesn't come in genuine Dremel packaging, it's not a Dremel","review":"Having read the other reviews here, I am very leery about this particular product -- and vendor.

Not to plunge cut, I used a drill bit to cut 4 holes at the corners, then tried to use the 9901 to laterally cut across the plenum for the duct work. Its a joke. Doesn't work , chatters, smokes, and just wont cut worth a darn. I really wanted it to cut a circle duct hole in the sheet metal plenum of the furnace, but decided to try it on a rectangle one first and was greatly disappointed. So not even the official dremel 9901 works for sheet metal as they claim on the packaging. I think the one review here is an accurate one for this tool when they say it worked great for carving a pumpkin. I believe that it what it is good for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks Easily","review":"I got this to cut through 12 gauge steel. It only made a dent in the steel before it broke.

They mic out at 3/32\\" at the cutting head, whereas 9901s are 1/8\\" from shaft to head. Additionally, 1 of the 3 I ordered has burn marks on the metal, indicating it may have lost its temper.

This bird doesn't fly away, he stays about the same distance from the microphone the entire time. About 30 minutes into the recording he began to have a birdie tantrum, something upset him, but he stayed and stayed. I gave it a 2 star for surf.

It covers introductions to the world's deserts, with emphasis on North American deserts. The book covers general skills pertaining to desert survival (Water, shelter, food, navigation etc.) and also has sections on desert hiking, biking and photography that were good for the novice and refresher for the expert. The chapter on desert transportation was excellent and a subject often over looked in similar titles. Over all I found the book to be quite good for the novice hiker to experienced desert dwellers like extreme adventures and military types."},{"rating":"1","title":"wood stake puller","review":"i purchased the stake puller primarily for wood stakes. the concept of the puller is OK but the performance is useless for anything you cant pull out by hitting side to side and pulling out by hand. the jaws for the stakes are to short and the peg just slips off when you apply pressure. if the jaws were at lease an 1.5\\" long the tool would probably work better. it doesn't seam like there was much product testing when it was designed.bottom line if your pulling wood pegs 2' or more in the ground don't waste your money unless you plan on modifying the puller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick ass rebar puller","review":"Works flawlessly on removing rebar that has been hammered in to the desert surface.

I used it to pull up 3' concrete stakes and 2' rebar stakes. I don't recall the diameter of those concrete stakes, but they were just a hair to thin. The rebar was definitely too thin. The stake puller worked on the test run at home (in my grass backyard) but kept slipping out on the playa. However, I wedged a screwdriver between the puller and the stake (to effectively increase the stake diameter) and it worked like a champ!Would I buy this again? Yes (there is no way I'd want to pull out stakes driven almost the full 3 feet into the playa), but it would be nice if the fitting was smaller to work with more narrow stakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome P&W CD","review":"This CD has various artist.1.

Out of all of the CD's this was the only one that was damaged.Well, we returned this product and got a new one within 3 days.

Also to be able to put it on repeat to assist with memorizing. I had the cassettes before. Alexander Scourby's dictation of the King James sounds so good because of his English accent. Also, I really like the attitude with which he speaks the words of Christ. He's the only one I've heard that says them the way I imagine Christ would say them. The DVD was included and it was a really good documentary about what it took to get the Bible translated into English so the average (English-speaking) person could have their own copy in their native tongue.

The case keeps the CDs together and is convenient for transporting. It can easily be kept in your vehicle.

I found myself wishing that it would be mandatory reading in political and Christian circles.

I usually judge these anthologies by a different criteria then I do a regular book because they usually just do not measure up to a full length novel. This one I can say actually does measure up. I think that it is because it has three novellas instead of the usual five, and that this has allowed the authors to fully develop their characters in a way that most anthologies do not allow. Each of the novellas would be worth buying individually. There was only one problem I had with the book, the first two stories were historical romances and the final story was a contemporary.

Though the original book (The Will of God)was certainly easy to read, Laird's working process helps the reader to personally apply the concepts of the Intentional, Circumstantial, and Ultimate Will. I used this as a personal, individual study book. But, after experience in many religious study groups, I believe this well thought-out, understandable, and thought-provoking workbook would be an effective group tool. It lends itself to both quick applications and in-depth growth. I appreciated the growth potential and the non-preachy attitude. Guidance to finding my own answers and positions was much preferable to being molded into a preconceived format. Yes!

Loads of inconsistencies, like showing the same boat sometimes appearing to go North, then South, then inland and sometimes in the middle of an ocean .. I don't know. It pretty much summarizes the movie. Lots of fight scenes interspersed with random cuts to scenes that for the most part are just filler and barely tie what plot there is together.Not being an admirer of fight movies, I can't claim to be an expert, but I'm sure I've seen better in older films .. and the settings are so contrived, I thought I was watching a video game.Good points: It wasn't so bad that I couldn't sit through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmph","review":"I don't know about other people, but I thought that movie was pretty horrible.

Van Damme did fine on the fight scenes, but the rest of the movie was lacking at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knife-sharpening! Flashbacks! Pointless religious imagery!","review":"One of the most horriffic atrocities ever foisted upon the movie-going public. At least twenty minutes of the film is devoted to scenes of people sharpening knives. There are random flashbacks riddled throughout the movie -- and then at one point, they are ALL SHOWN AGAIN, just in case you missed them the first time. Jean-Claude Van Damme is CRUCIFIED, the culmination of a string of pointless religious imagery. There are approximately seven lines of dialogue, none of which are sentences of more than four words. (Example: \\"I like scars.\\") The rest of the time, the actors are simply yelling. Waaaauuuggh! Yaaaarrrgghh! Ugh. Ed Wood made better movies than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"So bad it's good","review":"OK. Let's cut right to the chase here. This is a terrible movie.It is in fact, so bad, that is transcends badness. It's a trite saying but it really does. There aren't many movies where the topless women aren't perfect in all respects. And you'd never expect them to say \\"I'll understand if you're not here in the morning.\\" (actual line!)Other gems of dialogue include: \\"We can make a better world!\\" \\"I like the world the way it is.\\" \\"Go to Hell!\\" \\"Been there.\\"You can't find that in just any movie!Of course, since JCVD isn't really worried about showing that he's a brilliant actor, and is instead concentrating on showing how bad he is, you don't really pay much attention to anything but the fighting.

Also, open fields in a grass covered savannah-like areas have man-holes and massive labyrinths-like systems below.You do get an unexpectedly nice mullet on the main villain, as well as some top-notch dialogue.All in all, if you're forcing yourself to watch the entire Van Damme catalogue, you'll have to watch this one too!

I'd say you'd have to be at least 25 to enjoy it, because of it's sentimental and nostalgic atmosphere.If you can get past that, it's actually really good. I've always enjoyed postapocalyptic reality-of-life depictions. The music is a bit much, but it does portray survival of the fittest in a realistic sense. The characters beat each other up a bit unbelievable and the breaking-himself-off-the-cross scene was absurd even then, but the fight scenes are well done and closefaced showdown scenes were gold. Definitely one for the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Damme's rock-bottom worst...","review":"Director Albert Pyun has done it again. He's taken an interesting premise and muddled it with monotonous dialogue, jittery action, pointless camera angles, and an irritating feel. Pyun, who also directed the similarly awful \\"Omega Doom,\\" is my absolute least favorite director and this movie shows why. Every scene in this movie looks dirty, gross, and disorienting. Added to this are horridly awful performances including a young Jean-Claude Van Damme, who should've stayed far away from this. Word has it that Pyun and Van Damme did not get along while filming. I'm not surprised. Van Damme looks bored in every scene and this is his absolute worst performance; it's even worse than \\"Maximum Risk!\\" Two more sequels were made, but they're even worse. Van Damme fans like myself ignore this shlock. We've seen better from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy had potential .....","review":"This actor had potential as an aciton hero.

Made in 1989, this is one of the lowest points of his career, a totally brainless, ultra-violent ( not against violence in films - they just have to have some purpose !! )and bad acted movie.

Cyborg whether the creators realized it or not has a strong Anime feel to it. Sadly the movie is complete and total garbage.The story here is that Jean Claude Van Damm plays a warrior in the future who is out to get revenge on the leader of a gang in the Anarchist future. There also happens to be a deadly disease plaguing Mankind, and a Cyborg knows the cure. That part of the story is irrelivant. For the most part it is Van Damm traveling across the US attempting to catch up to this Madman and stop him. Somewhere in the movie we get flashbacks of his past and at one point he gets the chance to bang his female companion. OVerall this movie is a waste and you can tell Orion Entertainment was Milking Van Damm for all he was worth at this time.

Horrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie!","review":"This was one of the earliest Jean Claude Van Damme movies and it was a good one.It was set in a futuristic setting with a futuristic theme. The main selling point in this film were the exciting fight scenes. There were good special effects that added to the excitement of the fight scenes. The acting was mid level but Van Damme is not famous for actin but for his ability to commit combat. That he does very well in this film. This is a good action film that makes for good viewing.

The content of the book is completely lacking, all info is dated and most was never of any use to begin with.I can only guess that this book would be useful to staged backyard WWF style \\"Wrestlers\\" (whom I don't think deserve to use that name, staged is not wrestling, nor is WWF), but what should we expect from someone who's career was nothing, but staged Japanese wrestling...Don't get this book, it is a waste of money and our trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book really appealed to me, as Gene LeBell is a legend in American Judo and early MMA (very early, like 1960s). I expected an encyclopedia that consisted of a variety of submissions with various entries into them shown, from a variety of positions. Instead, it's a cartoonish collection of often completely unrealistic finishes, some of which are almost pro-wrestling-esque. No set-ups, no mentions of how you might actually catch someone in one of these moves, a lot of repetition as well with only slightly different holds being given separate sections. I was really disappointed. I am a black belt in Judo, as well as a former BJJ fighter, and I didn't get a single useful thing from this book. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat reference, but mostly pro wrestling junk","review":"This book is interesting, it's not really an instructional, it's more of a reference for a variety of pro wrestling holds that you don't see much anymore.There are some good techniques that work on live opponents, but there is almost no explanation on how to perform any of them.

There is a seal around the faceplate cover, but the rest of the thing is full of holes, the top and bottom halves have no seal between them, and the wiring/antenna exits in the rear are wide open.

They weren't there. I called Jensen and tried to get them, even offered to buy them, they said they couldn't help me. Suggested I go to my local hardware store & buy them. I live in a rural area, the hardware store didn't have that size screw.

The cover won't stay closed. Kinda renders the idea of waterproofing invalid when the only thing between your stereo and the elements is a cover that just kind of sits closed and will pop open at the slightest bump or torque.Fortunately for me, I am using this in an old truck and not on a boat, so it doesn't cause me a problem. However, if you are considering this for your boat, you may want to save your receipt. I could have just got a bad one, but it seems more a design flaw than a manufacturing flaw.As a general car stereo mount it works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy yet modern","review":"Went back to Corelle several years ago after owning and hating 2 different sets of the popular stoneware. Bought these dishes to replace my white Corelle dishes that I am handing down to my daughter. Searched around and couldn't find another set of dishes that was as user friendly. Dishes are very attractive, lightweight as in all Corelle, yet durable, dishwasher and microwave safe and can even be placed in a warm oven. Other reviewers mentioned the mugs so we stopped by the outlet store to touch them. The mugs are stoneware but the weight is light and the size is great. Far better than the small cups and saucers from my old set. A beautiful set that will last a long time, not so plain as to be boring, yet not so much of a pattern that I will get tired of it.

I took pictures to compare the old size and new. The new bowls are sitting inside the older ones. The only other problem is that instead of the cups being make as Corelle, they're stoneware from china. I see quite a few people have commented about this. You even see quite a few of the cup sets on Ebay, which tells you people generally aren't happy buying Corelleware and getting cups from China not made of Corelleware. But for the price it's a good set. I just don't know why they made changes to an already good set and design."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Corelle Dinnerware","review":"I've had Corelle Dinnerware dating back to sometime in the 1970s and I've loved everything about it. It's everything the descriptions say it is, very lightweight which makes it easy to carry to and from kitchen to Dining Room, or outdoors, and it always looks good. The new designs are interesting, although some are a bit too busy for my tastes, but I really like the Classic Cafe BlackCorelle Livingware 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4, Classic Caf¿ Black. I purchased two sets to have a service for 8 and I'm seriously thinking of purchasing another two sets. I've received many compliments since I got these and am proud to set a formal dinner table as well as a picnic table with these dishes. Thank you Amazon.com for the quick, easy and reliable service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set with a classic design","review":"I bought this set for my son to take to his first college apartment, but I'd love a set myself. I do have other Corelle dishes, but these remind me of the dishes used in the diners my parents used to take me to when I was a child. My son loved the black & white simple line design and the black mugs are beautiful. The cereal bowls are a good size, though smaller than the ones that came with the set that I have at home (perhaps because the rim is a little different). I bought him two each of the luncheon plates (that match this set) and the 28-ounce deep bowls (white with black around the rim) to supplement this set. These dishes stack well and don't take up as much space as some other sets. They're also sturdy and don't break easily. They hold up well in the dishwasher, too, unlike some of the less expensive stoneware that gets pock-marked in the dishwasher or chip when stacking in the cupboard. I'm very pleased with this set, and my son is, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning not your Mother's Corelle","review":"Corelle dishes and Corningwear used to be made with pyrex infused in them, until 25 years ago.A chinese company bought out the dish making lines from corning.They no longer incorporate pyrex into their mix as corning itself still owns that division.Corning wear now has sticking, cracking and staining issues and corelle plates cannot take even light abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"WISH THE CUPS WERE LIKE THW DISHES! ;?/","review":"These are great basic designed dishes and so far have been great,i wouldnt go slamming them on the foor but i have droped in sink roughly and they were fine, The reason i didnt give these 5 stars is because now i only have 3 out of the 4 cups,which is kinda crappy because i no longer have a full set ,and i need 4 cups!

Mr Goodman has done just that. Rather than focus entirely on the intricate details of search marketing, the Adwords interface and Google's forever changing marketplace, Goodman discusses basic concepts, best practices and common mistakes made by search marketers and PPC advertisers alike. I work in the affiliate marketing industry and can tell you first hand many of my own affiliates would benefit greatly from the concepts covered in this book. Goodman will help you build a foundation for success in the PPC market space that can easily be applied to any auction based PPC marketing system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, out of date","review":"This book was well written for its time but Google no longer uses the formulas found in this book. Any book written before August 2005 should be considered out of date at this point. At that time Google introduced the concept of 'Quality Score' and that changed things quite a bit. Google also recently (December, 2007) changed the way it analyzes the associaton of keywords, ads, CPR, and site content. So the basic concepts of this book are fine but the specifics have moved on.

The art work on both the major and minor arcana is absolutely unparalleled. While most of Lo Scarabeo's cards are \\"traditional\\" pre-Waite decks with unillustrated minors, this deck is fully illustrated. My only criticism is that pictorial symbolism is lacking. This deck does not use traditional Waite iconography. The pictures on these cards have little if any association with their meaning, however their beauty far outweighs the lack of symbolism. A perfect deck for reading love and relationship spreads."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exquisite art deck........","review":"The images in this deck are gorgeous, very stunning and colouful! The Devil is one of my all time favourites. The Ace of Swords is just breathtaking! That being said I keep this in my collection for the scrumptious art and style, as a reading deck it falls short for me in many respects.If you do look hard, you can see some meanings take form in the swirls and backgrounds, at times the person/s give little clues as well. But don't look for deep emotion on the faces. As well the images kind of blend together and it's not very deep nor profound in it's symbolism. A disappointment in that respect, this deck could have been an all-time favourite if the artist had just used more evocative imagery for each card meaning.If you love this flowing, magical and enchanting style of art....this deck will deliver a visual feast. You don't want to pass it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely","review":"The illustrations of this deck are so beautiful, with art deco references of twirling vines and plantlike adornment.

This book is the answer, detailing his fascinating family background and upbringing, as well as his impressive struggles with schooling, with family and in the trenches of France in the First World War. Nor did his married life and early career become any easier, the life of a young poet paying as well as you might imagine, particularly a poet with four young children. Still, Graves is truly inspirational in the way he always followed his own path and refused to waver, despite considerable pressures. Tempered by these experiences and never forgetting to work hard, he prepared for the astounded beginnings of success described in the next book in the series, The Years With Laura Riding. That this latter book is not on Amazon is a horrible omission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak vacuum.","review":"This sealer does not use a piston pump like most other sealers use. It removes the air with a fan. There is air left in the bag, it doesn't create a vacuum. The bags are not ribbed and you have to fit them over a hose under the lid.

You cannot use canisters with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough power","review":"This machine looks great, but it doesn't have the power to remove absolutely all the air when sealing a bag.

And I continue to buy his material in the hopes that he'll create that \\"one song\\" that makes it all worth it.Alas, this album has left me cold. Contrary to what people say, I don't believe he means what he sings. I hear him singing about love, but it sounds disinterested and aloof. The richness of his voice is there, but not the connection that I would feel with someone like Patty Griffin.This album is just like his last one. So, if you loved it, you will most likely love this one too. My best wishes to this talented singer. I haven't given up on you yet, Josh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Closer Review","review":"Josh Groban's fantastic, rich voice won me over when I first listened to his first CD, self-titled Josh Groban. Now, two years later, his voice still holds the emotion to bring tears to my eyes. Yet, I still do not feel that Josh is singing with his full ability, possibly held back by producer David Foster. The songs are very similar to his first album, with the transitions from English to Italian, along with Spanish and French. My favorite track, \\"Par Te,\\" is co-written by Groban himself, and truly shows the talent that he posesses. Hopefully, we will hear more of this type in the future and less Euro-pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super best of set from an underappreciated band.","review":"Some of their earlier stuff is catchy punky stuff, while later efforts veer more towards traditional pop tunes. Either way most of these songs are quite good. You've got a traditional ballsy Irish singer with an attitude fronting a rollicking good-time band. Some of the lyrics are a bit juvenile (especially the early stuff), but there are some classic songs as well. My favorites include \\"My Perfect Cousin\\", \\"The Positive Touch\\", \\"Julie Ocean\\", and the incomparable \\"Its going to Happen\\". With 25 songs there's plenty to get excited about.

The cards themselves are nothing but amateur, unfinished sketches. As sketches they look like they show some little bit of promise, but the artist never went beyond the sketches to come up with a finished product.

All of the matches are terrible, with the exception of the Funk/Foley final, which is very entertaining. Except for Funk/Foley, the matches in the King of the Death Match tourney are all about five minutes in length, and are laughable attempts at a death match, and/or hardcore wrestling. The Dan Severn match is passable, but he is a bland personality. The Funk/Foley final is historic (probably because every wrestling fan has seen clips) but the finish is terrible, and you can hear them call spots.

When I saw the movie for the first time, I really enjoyed it, and the music is what did it. Without the music the movie would have been good, but the orchestral score helped emphasize the feelings the viewers got from watching the movie. It was emotional, exciting, and was fun to listen to. I even got goosebumps a few times. I searched a long time for this cd. I bought this score the first time I saw it. I have listened to it for the past 5 years, and I still enjoy it.

Within a very short time, she was running operations out of Rumania, her success being due largley to her personality and chutzpah. Well-written and fast-paced, the book describes in a very personal manner a fascinating story of courage in the face of mounting obstacles and tensions as WW II progressed.Be prepared, however, for an abrupt ending which does not address the ultimate fates of her family and others in whose stories the reader has become invested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Don't buy this.

But, wow, you'd think they would have remastered the content or used a clean source. The picture and sound are really poor-- fuzzy, muted, and muddy. I'd say VHS quality at best. I guess its authentically retro, because it looks and sounds almost exactly like I remember it as a kid over the rabbit ears antenna...I've got dozens of 80's cartoon sets: GI Joe, Transformers, Voltron, He-man, and this is the lowest quality of all. The others show its possible to release a high quality set on DVD but this one feels like a cut-corners money grab. The packaging is cheap (plastic DVD case with sleeve) and the extras are pointless as well.*Note* The reviews for the 2011 and 2005 box sets seem to be merged together.

This story about a young spirited girl who found that life can be very cruel and that even betrayal can come from those that are suppose to protect you always from the dark shadows. This little girl whose only hero was her cousin was forced into an outdated and outlawed tradition. CSI and Law and Order is more detailed in what bad things can happened to children. Every cultural has it's shame hidden among it's beauty. One of the reviews beg to keep this film hidden. I hope that they will reconsider and not hide away this ugly stain but to expose it so that young girls like \\"Maya\\" will not have to endure the enforced rape that is consented by parents as an \\"honorable\\" ritual. As an American, I didn't know about this ritual and actually searched for information on it.

Perhaps sect is the wrong word since I'm using Western term but I'm sure the Hindu religion is more fragmented than Christianity. And I'm sure some Hindus are dismayed by this barbaric practice.It was obvious that the people who made this movie is trying to end this in India.

There was information at the end of the film which stated that these type of rituals still happen in various parts of India. To watch a child be put through it actually made all of the pleasant scenes of the film completely disappear for me. I felt so very bad for her, I cried... It was too terrible and horrible.

As for the music, there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap. The beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope that I have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is.

As seen from the track listing, it contains a diverse, but incongrous, selection of orchestral pieces, mixing Mozart, Vivaldi and Rimsky-Korsakov with more contemporary composers such as Bruckner, Arnold, and Paray. Although the list of selections is tempting and attractive to those who want to expand their musical knowledge, the combination just doesn't work. The jump from Mozart to Paray to Arnold to Vivaldi is unsettling to the ear, although it may be suited to a music education class. If, however, you seek less traditional (less soothing), less harmonic (more tempestuous), orchestral music, this may be the collection for you. The conducting and performances are very good.

It looks so cool and is just the right size. Unfortunately, last night I discovered that it is impossible to watch one channel while recording another, which was so easy to do with my old VCR/TV set up. No where in the owner's manual does it address this--it just says you can't use the VCR while taping a show. (Duh!) Nothing about the rest of your channels. You can watch a DVD while taping something off the TV, but part of the appeal of VCRs is the ability to watch one thing while taping another. It is kind of a minor thing, but if it is important to you, you might want to keep looking. I sort of wish I'd just bought a TV/DVD combo and a like brand VCR--I wanted to get avoid having too many remotes.

The second one suffered from the same damage. Alas, I'll have to pay more money to buy one at my local retailer, since I don't want to risk receiving another defective one and Amazon.com doesn't want to risk this either.

Espana Rhapsody by Chabrier had never sounded livelier than here, the sudden turning point after the first movement is more than surprising, the Spanish sentiment is all there. As far away is the taste of Scandinavia in Sibelius' Finlandia; here are no fjords or dark woods or cold rocks, if you like to here them through the music listen to the interpretation of Ashkenazy with the Pilharmonia Orchestra on Decca (1981-82). Also, Capriccio Italien by Tchaikovsky lacks the military element which is so apparent on Dorati's Mercury Living Presence record with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (recorded in 1955!). The Moldau by Smetana is made exceptable by the lack of romanticism.

Unfortunately, the images she's chosen to populate this book with prove otherwise. This book contains only a few truly Victorian rooms. Most shots are of badly overdecorated Colonial Revival interiors, replete with contemporary furnishings. Worst of all, several of these so called \\"Victorian\\" rooms are in fact Arts and Crafts in style, a direct revolt against Victorianism. This VictorianISH at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Victorian about new decorating in an old house?","review":"This coffee-table book is filled with quality color photos of rooms mostly decorated in modern times in what might be called variations of \\"traditional\\" styling--a decorating style that has remarkably little to do with Victorian interiors, which is, after all, the title of the book.

This book is great for all ages; It is also a great big activity book. All the pages have something to flip up and down.

This show is so great, with just two Cast members, and a small orchestra this show hits a home run. The show centers around John and Jen (go figure) but John her brother dies, and she blames herself partly, so when she has a son she names him John and tries to reincarnate her brother. It is such an amazing show. I strongly suggest getting this show no matter who you are. Listen to it all the way through, and see if you aren't moved. This show is great also in that the music tells the story perfectly. Jen's voice can be a little sharp, but over all its fine. Jon's voice is absolutely lovely. This would get a 4.5 stars if I could give it. And again this isn't just for Broadway lovers, but everyone!

It's extremely brief, the characters are lifeless, the world is poorly described, and it takes itself way too seriously.The protagonist, Paul Formain, is so cold and lifeless that he makes Elric seem emotional by comparison.One expects a sci-fi novel to have lifeless and cliched characters, but there's usually a cool interesting scientific idea to counter the lack of character development and story. Necromancer has neither. In fact, it's more of a fantasy story than true sci-fi. The characters have magical abilities which are never explained in any kind of logical or scientific way.Now I have no problem with fantasy, but as a fantasy novel Necromancer doesn't hold up either. A fantasy story should have interesting characters and a well developed fantasy world. Necromancer has none of this.I really have nothing good to say about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"This is an AMAZING album!I learned about My Latest Novel years ago by following a link on a music blog, and couldn't believe my ears.

It captivates, taking the listener through a range of emotions.Highly recommended to anyone who likes Arcade Fire and Belle and Sebastian."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New and Welcome Musical Experience","review":"This CD, from a Scottish five-piece band, is worth every penny. There isn't a bad song on it, and every single one grows on you as you listen to it.

No recording can replicate the excitement of live music, but you can get pretty close with this disc. This Bruckner 9th isn't plush and nostalgic, but tense, lean and somewhat neurotic. The first two movements are energetic and driven; the haunting final Adagio culminates in an earthquake-like climax that will tear your ears to shreds. A whole world of modern music seems to be struggling, with great anguish, to be born. If you prefer a more orthodox interpretation, Bruno Walter is a perennial favorite; but you won't go wrong with Skrowaczewski, especially if you like a modernistic approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second best Bruckner 9","review":"This is very special, spiritual, music; very well played; superbly recorded.

It's actually not out of print or hard to obtain, perhaps Amazon got that bit wrong, don't know. I found the story entertaining, and Ms. Knights handles her time machine with skill. The characters were well developed and loveable and I've just discovered another book by her, called Starchild, from the same publisher. I particularly liked the idea of the time machine messing with the people's heads, which sometimes became rather embarrassing and funny. If you like Time Travel Romance, you shouldn't miss this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly beautiful","review":"I instantly loved this movie, and its soundtrack is one of the reasons.

The illustrations are all line drawings by an amateur, and poorly illustrate the movements and postures described in the text.

He raised the level of every group he played in (catch him, for instance, in that \\"Pepper Adams Quintet\\" album from 1957), and really deserves to be remembered as a great jazz pianist. He did record quite a bit during his brief life (w/Oscar Moore, Stuff Smith, Jim Hall, the Curtis Counce group among others), and if you love the piano, it's all worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product ever! ---- Don't buy it!","review":"Don't buy it!

Fortunately we figured this out before setting up the TV and saved the necessary effort of extensive repacking before returning it to the store.

Obviously Toshiba has moved to the dark side in this battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"It's not as permanent as a staple, and the limit is 5 pages, but for what it does, it's very well designed.

Not knowing ANYTHING about LotusScript, I got a good foundation of how to do things and what things are, but as far as using the editor, how to add your own subs and functions, etc., it was no help as Lotus Notes is different than WordPro! This did not help you to differentiate between Notes Classes at all, although it did teach you about classes in general. Bottom line: good for a basic background, but won't get you very far with Lotus Notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"My rating is based on this book's usability with Lotus Notes","review":"Do not buy this book if you're trying to learn LotusScript to use in Lotus Notes applications.

This movie has a storyline and is highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An uneven movie","review":"An interesting movie as it has a strong side, and a weak side. The weak side is the uneven drama of Gregory Hines character coming back to the old neighborhood and trying to find himself. While I loved Mr. Hines in many of his roles, this one was a little to shallow for me. The whole story was very uneven.But on the strong side, you must see this movie for the tap performances. Many of the legendary stars had input into the dance scenes. It also shows of Mr. Hines moves, which are wonderful to watch. Finally, we get to see a very young Savion Glover with all these great dancers. It truly is a must see movie just for the dancing. Sammy Davis Jr. really comes out in this movie,not so much through his acting, but the way he moved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tap from Amazon","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this film again.

Gregory Hines is the best, but the \\"challenge\\" number with the old legends is a real show stopper and by far the best part of the movie. Young Savion Glover is adorable.

Gregory Hines proformance proves to be incredibily the best of his entertainment career.

Hubert Sumlin is important as a historical figure because he was the guitar player for 23 years in the Howling Wolf Band. Since Wolf's death in 1976 Sumlin has continued to perform and record but he has been unable to establish much of an artistic identity apart from being Howling Wolf's guitar player. That's why a decent biography of Howling Wolf, such as Segrest and Hoffman's \\"Moanin' At Midnight,\\" covers the historically relevant portion of Hubert Sumlin's career adequately. Alternatively, \\"Rollin' and Tumblin': Postwar Blues Guitarists,\\" edited by Jas Obrect, is a good compilatation of articles covering Hubert Sumlin and many other fine underappreciated blues guitar players as well. Both books are more carefully presented and more informative on the subject than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mystery; watch the English words/French.","review":"This is a most excellent mystery, written by one of Britain's premiere writers.

Conversations go on and on and on to no end.Kellerman seems to have a need to force every social issue into his story regardless of whether it is part of the story or not.Does he always write like this or did I just pick the wrong book to test the waters?I did not find the book thrilling,suspensful or mysterious.

Well, the times I didn't use this product after washing my hair, the 'dandruff' problem disappears. At first, I thought maybe I was using too much, but now I use a very small amount and I still have the 'dandruff' problem.

The poor use of space on the plates is surprising for a book produced by Princeton. To top in all off the maps are all in the back of the book, meaning that you are constantly flipping back and forth.

I found the Jaramillo book better. The bird names are on the plates by the illustration whereas in Birds of Southern South America many more species needed to be illustrated so they are numbered on the plates. Also, Birds of Chile puts the range maps opposite the plates, and in full color. Birds of Southern South America puts the colorless maps at the back of the book. Still, it's a good field guide, but covers a broader area than I needed for Chilean Patagonia and its deficiencies are traceable to the need to include more species."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst amazon experience ever","review":"I love amazon but this was the worst purchase ever.

I feel that such brilliant expalnations of exciting subjects are a very rare thing and I am waiting for his next book to emerge.

Deutsch is an important and original quantum physicist - perhaps someday he'll win a Nobel prize for his work on quantum computation. Unfortuneately he's a horrible writer. He's an arrogant know-it-all with no time to explain his theories or to explain why he dismisses others' theories. For instance, he uses Popper's analysis of scientific justification to dismiss certain (absurd) theories and then doesn't justify his own. His theory of the multiverse, as presented here, would have to be dismissed on the same grounds. Did he have a page limit and have to cut the reasoning piece, or was he simply too impatient to write a good book? In any case, if you want to read a science book, read Feynman or Penrose or pretty much anyone else.

This book brings together four seemingly disparate theories; quantum physics, evolution, computation, and epistemology and shows how they are not disparate at all, but each relates and answers questions about the others, and together form a united structure. The book is both comprehensive and comprehensible. The form and structure of the book, with a glossary, chapter summary, and bridge to the next chapter, as well as Deutsch's skill at writing, ease the absorbtion of complex ideas.

But I didn't like this book. It's good in that it brings up certain issues to make you think of them, but don't passively accept everything he says. He can be quite seductive. Any good examination of his claims will reveal them for what they are. For example, Deutsche certainly did not solve the problem of induction, despite his claims. His dismissal of instrumentalism also disgusted me. It just seems that the whole view is just based on his boyhood fantasy, which he relates as the book opens. So, read his book by all means, but don't think this is THE BOOK with THE ANSWERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre presentation of theoretical physics.","review":"I've read many books on theoretical physics (quantum theory, parallel universes, etc.) and I was thoroughly disappointed with this book.

Science and logic have limitations, of course, and he who has not the intellectual maturity to accept these limitations may well be drawn to some form of mysticism, possibly a culturally entrenched form such as Christianity, possibly a more novel form such as faith in parallel universes.

The mutliple worlds interpretation was created because some physicists were uncomfortable with the philosophical interpretations of the Copenhagen interpretation.

Deutch's version does solve that problem, but it requires us to assume an infinitely large number of parallel universes--in order to preserve the duality between observer and observed, and locality. But which is more parsimonious--to accept Bohr's conclusions, or assume an infinite number of parallel worlds?Second...Deutch is intellectually dishonest.

Not a deal breaker for under $6 for re-living childhood memories, but I would have liked a real case.Can't recommend this set enough if you loved the wacky humor of Pee-Wee and 80's culture! RIP Jim Varney, you are definitely missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Ernest P. Worrell with a story and a moral!","review":"I will never forget the thrill of seeing Jim Varney on his own TV show for the first time. As an 80's child, I was a fan of Ernest, You Can't Do That on Television, and PeeWee's Playhouse--it was only natural that this show was the perfect combination. I am so glad they released this series on DVD! The price is amazing as well. R.I.P. Jim Varney.

It's a 7'6\\" rod bag, and those barely fit. I have not had multiple 7'6\\" rods in there at one time, as I only own one of them, however, I am not sure you could fit 5 in there at one time. The bag is light weight, and the padding to protect your rods and reels is very soft and will cradle your reels. I love the idea behind this, but I do wish that the exterior fabric was a little more durable. This is not a rugged rod bag, but I have purchased multiple of them. I plan on sewing in more durable fabric in order to make it last longer, and possibly fashioning some sort of rigid tip protector to protect rod tips. Tip protector may be out of pvc or something like that. I may deconstruct this bag to learn to make my own if I have the time. I can use much more durable materials. But I'm happy with the bag thus far. Just don't drag it on the ground and don't be rough with it, otherwise I'm sure you will rip the bag or tear the zipper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, compact set.","review":"The dishes came all in one piece (none broken or chipped), and they look simple and nice.

Other than that a fine set with cute coffee mugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me Likey!! (or so I thought)","review":"Exactly what I wanted, stacks nicely, light weight, good size, sturdy, looks nice. The only thing I don't like is the plates are very thin, so the bottom gets very hot to the touch when you put piping hot food on it. For people who don't eat sitting at the table, it might be an issue.Update-I change my mind. I have very few of these dishes left. They are very easy to break if you have children. And when they do break, they EXPLODE! Pieces of the dishes go flying everywhere. Tiny little shards of razor sharp shrapnel. I was cut by the flying pieces, and I wasn't even near where it broke! I won't buy this brand again. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dish set","review":"I bought this item after hearing that the plates would not chip. This is helpful with small children!

I love this set! The bright white and simply blue border is timeless - something that never looks old or dated. Being that we sometimes have young children in our home, I didn't want to have to worry if a plate or bowl accidently ended up on the floor, and Corelle's durability is a given. The price was also fabulous. Cleanup is a breeze, and I like the fact these dishes take up so little space.The only thing I dislike is these dishes get SO hot when heating things up in the microwave! OUCH!!! I usually end up heating things up on paper plates, and tranferring the food to these dishes, if I need to. But that also means I cannot have hot liquids in the bowls - such as soup - otherwise the bowls are way too hot to handle.Other than that, these dishes look great, are durable, and were a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE SET AT A DECENT PRICE.","review":"Excellent for a daily use.

Vincent Price is outstanding and there are some sexy women in here too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morgan, come out!","review":"Based upon the Richard Matheson novel \\"I Am Legend\\". Vincent Price plays Dr. Robert Morgan the only survivor of a devastating world-wide plague that turns people into Vampires. Is He all alone now? It would seem so, but as night falls, plague victims begin to leave their hiding spots, part of a freakish undead mob that's thirsting for his blood! While I found the novel to have a creepier atmosphere then the movie I still enjoyed the film. And Italian Director Ubaldo Ragona depicts the absolute desolation of the Earth well.Vincent Price's acting is a bit over-the-top at times but what horror fan doesn't enjoy a Vincent Price movie. And though people hate remakes I feel that \\"I Am Legend\\" could use a new sreen adaption hopefuly with the book's ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged","review":"It is so hard to find unabridged copies of George MacDonald's work.

This is Ms. Phillips worst book yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much There","review":"Even as light romantic fiction goes this book just doesn't have a lot of juice. The characters are unrealistic and the story line just doesn't work. The author tried to tell too many stories at the same time and didn't satisfy the reader with any of them. I have read this author's previous novels and found them to be exactly what I expected. Light, by-the-pool reading. But this book just didn't gel with me. Unfortunately the story line was boring and extremely predictable, the characters completely unbelievable and the solutions to conflict too easy. I just couldn't buy this one. I like a little mind candy occasionally but this book didn't satisfy my sweet tooth at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fantastic Carly Phillips story!!!","review":"Under the Boardwalk continues to show off the talent of writer Carly Phillips. Ari Costas and Quinn Donovan, both assuming \\"undercover\\" roles, give the book many angles. I thought I was reading 2 books at once sometimes. These characters are extremely well rounded and flawed just like the rest of us. I read this book in a day and a half and enjoyed every word. Thank you, Ms. Phillips for another great story and amazing characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really awful","review":"What I hated most about this book is that the heroine beats herself up for distancing herself from a family of con artists. I think she did the right thing -- who wants to associate with people you can't trust, even if they are family? Really, she goes on and on and on about this throughout the book, and it got really old. Also, how does a psychology professor manage to be so emotionally immature? There is also the problem of the heroine's \\"two sides\\" -- one the uptight professor, the other, a flirty waitress. Which one is she? She spends so much time whining that at this point I didn't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"other review is nuts","review":"Given the prices listed it is cheaper to buy it in this format--two seperate half seasons-- rather than in one whole season.

I do understand that people have different tastes but \\"a must have\\", and \\"slammin\\" and \\"what music has been missing\\".

Im not trying to rip anyone apart but this album bears \\"NOT ONE\\" resemblance of the creativity, the production, and vocals that this group once carried. Ok...so Its different. No big deal.

It just completes Mr. Bernstein's Book a Month Club objectives. It's unfortunate he doesn't write fewer books with more content rather than a multitude of books with no content.

It helps her immensely. The stuff that this company is now calling DGP (ImmPower) isn't DGP, and has nothing to do with DGP, or dogs, or pain. It is a bunch of mushrooms for people. The bottle isn't even what is shown in the picture (which is the real DGP bottle).I ordered some DGP for my dog, and was sent the stuff they are trying to palm off as DGP. Now I must locate another seller and order...in the meantime, I have just run out of DGP and my dog will have nothing to help her until another order can be delivered. Please, if you are trying to get DGP, this company is no longer selling it...but something they are calling AMERICAN BIOSCIENCES (IMMPOWER) DGP. No DGP, not for dogs, not in the bottle that is shown.

The glowing reviews for DGP gave me hope that we could get him off the Rimadyl which of course is not ideal for long-term treatment. I gave this product a good month-long trial but unfortunately it just didn't work for my dog, and after he had clearly gotten worse on it, I had to switch back to the Rimadyl. Still, while it didn't work for me, I still would recommend people try it, the price is a tad high, and it would be nice if they gave some kind of guarantee on it, but if there is even a chance that it might work for your dog versus using NSAIDS, it's worth a shot.

I even bumped it up four tablets a day (two at each meal) and still the same morning pain for the old guy.I decided to try glucosamine after a week of trying DGP and the very next morning he was back to his happy self.

She was happier, more active and playful. I kept her on DGP until she passed away 2 years ago at the age of 16.My other dog Maggie, is now 13. She has some arthritis in her back leg, which causes her to limp and sometimes cry. Once again, I turned to DGP and within a week - she was running around and playing like a youngsterIt is rare that a prodect is everything they say it is, but this is the real deal.

One part of the movie especially annoyed me, and that was the scene where he is having a poker game and Angelina is giving him hand signals to show what cards they have. Does anyone else think it is really stupid that they thought the men wouldn't notice she continually walks around the table over and over and over, and he keeps looking at her? Seriously that must have been one of the dumbest things I have ever seen. As far as the ending, really dumb, she is acting like she is playing both men throughout the whole movie and then all of a sudden she is in love with him.

A better word of course would be \\"made me more discerning.\\" But then I also remember many of the old time films, directors, actors. I have to agree with the negative reviews this movie received. It is so amateurishly directed that I could not stand to view it all the way through but had to turn it off in disgust half the way through. The amateurish direction resulted in poor acting (though Banderas tried his best he was hamstrung by faulty direction). Of course a really good actor would shine through even the worst of films as John Barrymore did.But as long as there is the glamor & glitz of Hollywood, fans will be mesmerized by the stars & will have no discernment as to what is poor & what is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot, Steamy Angelina and Antonio","review":"I have no idea why i rented this movie, except that i am a huge fan of angelina jolie. i think she is an astonishing actress as well as being exceptionally beautiful. this film was strange and fun and very erotic. and i think she was incredibly brave to play this role; she did an outstanding job and held nothing back.

At first I wondered how close this might have been to receiving an X Rating. Their lips seemed like the focal point of the film, and it seemed a finger was always going into the others mouth or into their own. Jarring scene changes, choppy edits, dizzying camera work, and at times, unnecessary tricks, all failed to add purpose to the plot. All this to frenetic cuban music, which was good, as was the scenery, whick mostly consisted of balconies and white curtains blowing in the wind. The low point was a scene that involved spitting, you'll know what I mean when you see it. The high point was watching a person make such a sniveling idiot of himself. The two of them are not hard to look at.

It gives a clear, concise explanation on most important aspects of the United States history and the history of the lands that would eventually become the United States.

In other words, if you looked up Civil Rights, you would find a history of Civil Rights in America from the colonial period to present. All the background information you would need would be in one place, not scattered throughout the book.

The poles were getting noticeably bent with each subsequent use, and for an over $400 purchase I expected more. My screen house met an untimely demise at the hands of 18-20 mph winds, which are not uncommon in the mountain states, and I could only recommend this product for light use in good weather.

There is an issue with a lever in the back of the TV that will randomly shut the TV off. I have bought many TVs in the past, and this has been by far the most aggravating system that I have ever had.

I was really excited as this was our first big-screen TV. When it was set up and ready to go I was not overwhelmed by the picture but could live with that. Fast forward to now (only 2 years later) and now the set spontaneously turns off after about 5 minutes; first the screen goes black and then the sound dies 10 seconds later. After googling this issue I find it's quite a common one and many people are having customer service nightmares trying to get this resolved. There is even a class-action lawsuit against Samsung because of this. I have a 10 year old 32\\" Panasonic that hasn't had a single problem at all. Shame on you, Samsung.

Fast forward five months \\"today.\\" The TV started shutting off after five mins of playing. Called Samsung, unfortunately we moved and didn't have the receipt. A call from the store didn't help Samsung understand that the TV is still covered. Our six month old $1699 TV, is now going to cost us $717 to fix.

I had to have the TV fixed 4 times in 4 years. Now that the service plan is expired the TV continues to shut itself off. I have found out that it is most likely a capacitor issue and that Samsung installed capacitors that are too low for the TV and they get hot or burn out. The cost to replace is about $300 and they will still continue to burn out! I decided to junk the TV and buy another brand. Spent about $2500 on this TV 4 years ago and would expect the TV to last more than 4 years. I see from numerous postings on the web that this is a common problem with Samsung TV's.

I was told that I would need to buy a lamp every 2-3 years. Unfortuantely, Samsung did not tell me this when I purchased it. Samsung is in a lawsuit because of this TV. Worst. TV. EVER.

Her change for a moment toward the end when she tries to help Portman is again a wonderful demonstration of her capacity to portray emotion and understanding in spite of being dumped. We should see more of Kudrow in many more movies ..Portman played, as she did in Black Swan, the perverbial helpless soul, despite personal issues, wanting to please all and suffering throughout. The role portrayed a youngish and immature female ...we have 2011 -- are women still doing that? Whoops.. Cohen's best line was at the end telling her it's too late to fix it...Natalie Portman should be allowed stronger roles... \\"V\\" was still her best to date"},{"rating":"2","title":"Portman gives a powerful performance","review":"Natalie Portman gives a powerful performance as this woman, whose husband was married before and has a stepson with whom she clashes now and then.

However, I feel that Finlay looks too far ahead toward describing Maggot's future adventures as a troll-reared man dealing with the various corruptions of civilization, instead of focusing on this one story. Although each scene is carefully crafted, the book taken as a whole doesn't have much continuity or momentum. It left me asking myself \\"Why do I care?\\" after I finished, particularly after the rather abrupt and slightly cliched ending.With that in mind, I still look forward to Finlay's future stories about Maggot because of Finlay's insight and characterizations of places and people.

A good book to compare it to is Rodney Starks' _For the Glory of God_, which takes Grant's ideas about science a bit too far.Grant provides an all encompassing theory on how science emerged. I don't think the topic could be explained any better without some new archeological find or manipulation of the facts.The most interesting parts in my opinion involve the comparision of Western European culture to that of China, Byzantium, and the Islamic Middle East. Why didn't they develop science first? Find out why inside.For laymen and people without a doctorate in history who want to read this for enjoyment (or for curricular activities), reading the first two and the last chapters will give you a good approximation of Grant's thesis.

Now, I am not suggesting you pay $250 for this box set, especially if you did already fork it over for the Rhino's....BUT! I cannot honestly think of a better way to spend $250.These old Ryko issues hold their own to the recent Rhino's despite the paucity of bonus material. However, until Mocombo is given its proper due, or you are lucky enough to score one somehow, somewhere, DO WHAT YOU MUST to include this disc in your arsenal of rock'n'roll.And it cannot be overstated enough: the screaming OWWWWWWW dude does greatly annoy these nerves of mine.

My head itches every time I use it. My hair is ratty and knots up. The softness,shine, and purity of how my hair used to feel using the original product no longer exists. Even their 5 oz deep conditioning is horrid. I found an older travel bottle in my travel kit and it had some of the original product left. What a difference.

I had such faith in the product, it hadn't dawned on me that Nexxus had cheapened up its product.As for the new smell, it doesn't really bother me and I am fairly sensitive to perfumes.

Using Schenk's book, I have learned how to grow pleasing and pretty plants in the dry shade under it.Probably the best part of Schenk's book is his discussion of trees and shrubs. Many gardeners, even experienced ones, pay the least amount of attention to the trees affecting the ground they are trying to cultivate. Trees do matter. Some trees create more problems than others. Most of us discover too late that Maple trees are not the gardeners' best friend. (Those cute little maple trees from the Japanese hybridists are a possible exception.)

After reading the other books, I wanted to finish it up with Stephan's story. He did not seem to feel so guilty in The Hunger. However, in this book, he seemed weak. Susan Squires has some sick fantasies. I do not consider rape erotic in the least. Raping someone does not make them a warrior. Our heroine Ann Van Helsing is psychic. Just one touch with Stephan and she sees his past. She sees the Daughters committing horrible sexual acts. She sees his love for Beatrix. She sees the cruelty of Asharti. Ann even realizes that he is a vampire. What is really lame is that she accepts it as someone just told her that they had a cold. Ann for being so alone and isolated seemed up on her sexual techniques and even sociable. How does she know so much about the town since she does not mingle with the people? I really thought this book was dumb. It needed more character development and oh yeah, a plot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephan Sincai","review":"Very disturbing --on serveral counts. i had high hopes for Stephan flash back for someone 2000 years old of his life,relationships with other women in his life and most of all understanding his feelings towards Beatrix. i had a hard time following the story line due to the sexual exotic scenes with him and the Daughters. i really did not understand the purpose of it all in holding himself in. i love Stephan and my heart went out to him because there was so much guilt within himself, feeling bad about Asharti and mostly the fact that Beatrix left him. i wanted to cried through it all because i guess the love i wanted for him he could not have and if if he express his love towards Beatrix his idealist ideas held him back."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can Rape The Willing","review":"Very disturbing book--on several counts. The flash backs in her other books orovided insight into the characters--how Beatrix had almost reached the point of no return, how Ian became a vampire, and why the poor guy needed counseling. All the flashbacks in this book provided was the fact that Stephan is a \\"bottom\\" without enough preservation to have a stopping point. I liked Ann, and I liked Stephan--in spite of the fact that he's an idiot. I wish Squires had spent more time on why someone who has lived for over 2000 years is too self-destructive to realize the so-called good guys are doing a head game on him. Ann figured it out and she's been in an isolated area for 25 years. I also wanted more on Stephan's past--she dropped just enough hints to be annoying. On the whole, I thought two potentially good characters were wasted on nasty, destructive rape scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I have read many (too many) historical romances in my time, and I very much enjoy a well written \\"sex\\" scene.

The majority of the book was not about romance but instead was graphically violent, not only in actual fight scenes, but in the vividly described S&M; scenes with the three women vampires. And there is plenty of sex in the book, but instead of being a wonderful thing to be enjoyed, it's brutal and painful.The main male character is confusing as he is supposed to be so powerful and yet he seems wishy-washy to me in too many places. He can't make a decision and can't stand up for himself. Physically strong, mentally weak.The main female character is not much better, though I actually liked her a little more than the male lead.All in all, I wouldn't read this again and would not read any others in the series as this author seems to have a love/hate relationship with sex and little sense of romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure brazilliance","review":"Estamos Ai is pure joy from beginning to end.

I tried another,more expensive brand at one time, but came back to the Bali. I discovered with the other bra, my breasts were always sagging and spilling over. I wear a 34DDD. If I don't have a good bra my back suffers, not to mention the fit of the clothes. The Bali provides both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bra Ever!!","review":"When you are large chested it's nice to get the wider padded straps, the bra fits very well. Love this bra!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very few bras fit me but this one is a keeper.","review":"I'm 56 yrs old. Size 34DD. There are only two bras that I can wear. This is one of them. Amazon is a great place to purchase it as the price is less expensive than stores (Kohls rarely has my size in stock) and it seems to always be in stock. I hope Bali keeps on making this bra. Within the last year I did have an issue with a bra (a piece broke) but I called Bali and they replaced it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good fit","review":"Disappointed with this bra. The fit is not good and the underwire digs into my rib cage which I've neve experienced before. It could be that this bra is just not suitable for my body type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for full figures.","review":"This is my favorite minimizer for several reasons: 1) Straps are soft, strong and wide. They stay in place really well, and support without pain on the shoulders. 2) The back is big enough - 4 hooks - to smooth instead of bulge, under t-shirts. 3) It takes a full inch and a half off and makes the bust look smooth. The only con is that it does not have concealers, so when the weather is cold, well, you know! The underwires are not as comfortable as the padded minimizers, but the rest of the bra is so comfortable that it is a small price to pay for looking great and being able to button your top. This minimizer does not smash to get the effect, and is very true to size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Bra!","review":"im 120 lbs and a 34D and this bra works wonders.... keeps them up and gives a nice shape and is very comfortable. No underwire sticks out and the puckering of the bra shows under only thin tight clothing, but looks great under my scrubs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and enjoyable summary of Gaia theory","review":"Richard Hofstetter is one of those rare delights, a non-scientist who can write clearly and entertainingly about technical matters.

I can't say that I've ever managed to sit through a SyFy produced film all the way through, but the raves for Wyvern had me sold that this was better than the rest. Far from great, I found the acting rather perfunctory, and I just couldn't suspend disbelief on the CGI wyvern. Some of the scenery shots are magnificent, but when I'm more interested in looking at the trees than following the story, that doesn't speak well of the film.Sorry folks, but I thought the current 5 star rating misleading. Fans of SyFy channel films obviously love this one, but as a fan of straight to DVD low budget horror, besides a few unintentional laugh out loud moments (and some lovely scenery shots), I was bored throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really disliked it","review":"I just finished \\"winter garden\\" a few weeks back and was thrilled to find out a new Ashworth book was coming out, but this was not what I was expecting. The entire jaw bone plot was really silly, as other reviewers mentioned it made no sense that Ned would be disgraced by someone stealing the jaw, nor did it make any sense the *revenge* Ned intended. And for me, this plot was boring as sin. What was the urgency? It wasn't like Ned was a spy or a ambassador, we all have our personal career setbacks but the book made it like it was a devistating loss on par with losing a limb.Then I found the romance dull and lifeless as well. I could see little reason for the pair to fall in love. I didn't even make it to the last chapter which, I was shocked to discover, I wasn't too disappointed about. I hate to give a bad review, but this one really should be skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all irresistable","review":"I was disgusted with this book from about page 3 on. I forced myself to read it, since I had already paid for it after all, but it was such a waste of my time that I wish I hadn't bothered. Mimi is a self-centered, scheming little witch. She claims to be sympathetic to poor Nathan who has watched his entire career fall apart, but her actions tell a whole different story. Also, all the characters keep saying Nathan is arrogant. Where did this come from? The fact that the man recognizes that he is very good at his job makes him arrogant? Intelligence are arrogance aren't the same thing. I honestly think Nathan would be so much better off without her, which makes this one [bad] \\"romance\\" novel. My advice is to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed...","review":"with this book ! I have loved Adele Ashworth's previous books, and looked forward to this one. The characters were unsympathetic and I guessed the ending by Chapter Two.

Sorry, Ms. Ashworth - this one was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"How should we then live?","review":"Loaned out, re-read, quoted, and read aloud to youth groups and adults, this is a book that may become a classic. The insights are varied, the sentiment often raw, but the feelings shared by those highlighted in each chapter are obviously real. I was especially moved by the contrast between the husband and wife who's son was shot. They each have their own story and each challenges my desire to sit back and avoid thinking about how I might react if ever in their situation. \\"How should we then live?\\" has been addressed in another book. This might summed up as \\"How should we treat death?\\" Definately food for thought, new insights arise each time I read the very personal accounts.

Those interviewed were mostly aids victims, social activists, Operation Push people, Cook Hospital people, black people who had been discriminated against, gays, lesibans and others of very Liberal persuations. By selecting such a focus and extreme group of people to interview, it is like Terkel wanted to get other messages out. Or he just has a very limited circle of friends. Some parts were interesting but not worth going through the life experiences of these people. Forget this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time.","review":"This bleak book is filled with too many self-important people espousing a depressingly shallow view of life and death. Only some of the very \\"simple\\" and \\"uneducated\\" of those interviewed showed any real depth of faith and understanding of the Scriptural promises of life after death.

I plan on testing it this weekend, and I'm sure it will work great, like all the other features.The only drawback I have with this microsystem is that it's not that micro. I had trouble fitting it in a bookshelf I had in my room and had to put the speakers in a different shelf.

In addition, it contains great explanation of algorithm efficiency, and the analogy that is made of walls and mirrors to data abstraction and recursion helps you understand both concepts better. I would have given this book 5 stars if it had pseudocode (or c++ code) for the balancing algorithm of an AVL tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"no complete code inside, messy descriptions","review":"Before you read this book, I suggest that you have at least 2 years experiences on C++.

What I saw though was a production that resembled something that would be considered old fashioned in the nineteeth century. Tired painted backcloths and bulky clumsy costumes, in some cases ridiculous make up more fit for the circus than on the stage (The Khan for one example).

What a time saver!The stain keeps it's color and works into a deep brown over time. Easy to spray, good consistency, nice color and does it's job well to protect wood siding and cedar trim. Really brings out faded wood characteristics as well.Local price was about $20 higher than what I got off here and that includes the delivery charge; I order in the 5-gallon size; much more cost efficient than the 1-gallon sizes/prices that local merchants may have in stock.

No forced retirement to beekeeping (or in Nero's case, orchid-keeping) for these two. Lucky for us! If you haven't made their acquaintance, this novel is perfectly good place to start and should keep you coming back for more. Indeed, as Wolfe might (and, as Archie tells us, does) say, it's \\"subdolous.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"Rex Stout is a prolific mystery writer and is quite popular. I read one of his books some time ago and decided to read another one. I chose Final Deduction. Maybe just a bad choice, but I found his famous dectective, Nero Wolfe, to be a rude, arrogant jerk.

The 2nd addition did not update any of even the most basic of information. After countless experiences of \\"wrong advise/info\\" I tossed the book.

Worse, the introduction included a mindless rant against genetically engineered crops, how they will \\"cause starvation\\" (I'm still not clear on how disease resistant drought tolerant crop varieties will lead to starvation) and it is all part of a big conspiracy by the big companies. Very unscientific. Some discussion of the topic that included all sides might have been okay, though why this needs to be part of a cookbook is beyond me. This kind of stuff only hurts the image of vegetarians and vegans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Funk Music At It's Best!","review":"A couple of reviewers had some negative responses on the sound quality of the live music on this CD. I think these negative responses are overly exaggerated. I've heard worse live recordings and this isn't one of them and what did you expect anyways, the music was recorded live, this isn't a studio recorded CD! What I like about this CD is that Bootsy and his Rubber band incorporated a hard rock edge to their nasty funk sound with the wailing and screeching guitar sounds. Love to always hear Comic Slop live and love the tribute they paid to Eddie Hazel who was very underrated if you ask me. This CD smokes from beginning to end. Don't let the negative reviews fool you! They don't know what the funk they are talking about! Keep the Funk Alive! A true hardcore funkateer would love this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review Of Bootsy's Keepin' Dah Funk Alive 4-1995","review":"Let me start by saying I love Bootsy to death, he's one of my favorites from the cool funk era. This two-CD, apparently rushed, live recording degeneration really slams down his talent. There are great songs on the CD, but the reproduction seemed extremely poor. Your best bet is to buy the two CDs that precede it - \\"Ahhh ... The Name is Bootsy, Baby and \\"Bootsy? Player of the Year\\" or \\"Back in the Day: The Best of Bootsy\\" and those from Parliament-Funkadelic containing the original hits ... in a nutshell, anything containing the LP or album recordings. Buy this one if you're collecting, not for listening pleasure ... unless you love live recordings of moderate to poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could there be a worse CD out there?","review":"This has to be the worst CD of all time. The recording is tinny and distant, the band cannot be heard for the crowd noise, and what can be heard of the band is atrocious and very amaturish. The quality of the horn section is foretold in the liner notes (the \\"on three days rehearsal horn section\\"). The band sounds like they have only been playing thier instruments for 3 days max! I have heard better bootleg recordings. Don't buy this one!!!!!!! You have been warned!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I bought this product thinking it was for Master Mechanic model 375 type 3, but it wasn't. They sent me one that doesn't even work because it's for different models. This is false advertising, DON'T BUY IT. Don't buy Hobbytoolsupply products. I emailed someone and they still haven't changed their description. The wrong brushes they gave me were the ones you can buy almost anywhere. That is why I bought them online because I thought they were different, but apparently not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Couldn't be happier. Super easy install. Be sure and unplug it before replacing brushes. Much better than spending 65 dollars on a new dremel tool. Super speedy delivery on my order. I use my dremel alot so I ordered 2 sets. Something to consider if you don't like downtime on your tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Transformational","review":"I have practiced meditation for over 20 years, and this book gives a complete explanation of the Kriya yoga meditation technique, as well as lessons on living a life of virtue and the \\"Rainbow Path\\" of right living. There are several reviews stating that this is not the Kriya technique of Self Realization Fellowship, which is true. In his book \\"Christ Consciousness\\", Mr. Paulsen writes about his time living with Yogananda. Mr Paulsen's Kriya technique has been fine-tuned through his own Divine experiences. This book is transformational and has been a great help to me personally and furthered my own spiritual growth and fulfillment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely derivative from the timeless source","review":"I'm sure that Norman means well, as would anyone who spent some time with Yogananda, but this effort is a tame contribution (even a mere distraction) when seen beside Yogananda's own instruction in the SRF Lessons. yogananda-srf dot org will give you a glimpse of the untainted purity, loyalty, and humble service of those who faithfully reproduce the yoga master's timeless titles.If you are unfamiliar with Yogananda - the source from which Norman is derivative - just sample his Autobiography of a Yogi. Other books acclaimed as \\"life changing\\" pale by comparison. Look up on Amazon at ISBN: 0876120796 ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Paramahansa Yogananda's Kriya Yoga","review":"I've seen Norman Paulsen's video and read the book that goes with it, The Sacred Science of Meditation. If you're looking for the Kriya Yoga that ParamahansaYogananda taught then please look into getting the \\"real thing\\" through the organization Yogananda himself founded for disseminating his teachings including Kriya, theSelf Realization Fellowship of Los Angeles, CA. Norman Pausen tries to use Yogananda's name to give his own teaching some clout. Why he would even refer tohimself as a direct disciple of Yogananda and yet change Kriya with his own innovations is beyond me. Loyalty and having a Guru like Yogananda are an essentialpart of the Kriya Yoga path. Norman Paulsen has said in his advertisements that this his own technique is the \\"complete kriya yoga\\". Don't be deceived. If you wantto get the Kriya technique of Yogananda then call Self Realization Fellowship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!","review":"I checked out this video and accompanying book after I saw an advertisement in a Yoga magazine. The packaging is well done and pleasant on the eyes but the information isn't anything new. You can learn this type of mediation through any new agey type yoga book. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable CD","review":"This CD of British stars of the 1950s contains hits from some of the biggest stars of that era. Americans may know many of the titles as being orginated by American performers, but the British cover singers did a very nice job and I'm sure these versions were hits in the UK.As typical of my overseas recordings, this CD contains a total of 25 songs. It is a shame that most collections of music made in the US contain only 13, sometimes 15 songs. This makes the CD an extra good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for technique, but not for proportions.","review":"This is a useful introduction to real Vietnamese and Thai Cooking, but should not be your only guide. Although the narrative and hints (e.g., dry out the noodles 20 minutes before making pad thai) are useful, I find the recipes are often off-flavored. Too strong, too mild, too sweet, too salty, too sour, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious recipes","review":"I'm asian and have always been a huge fan of both Vietnamese and Thai food but felt intimidated by the thought of making it at home. My husband, the foodie, had this book in his collection for years but never really used it. About 6 months ago I picked it up and made a simple curry dish and was completely hooked. The book is fantastic. While there are quite a few ingredients that you don't find in the average American kitchen, it's well worth a trip to your local asian market. There is nothing like using fresh basil, lemongrass, and thai bird chilis in your food. The flavors are simply amazing. I've made about a dozen dishes and everyone turns out incredibly well. Side note: the author is a restaurant owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I always read the user reviews before making a book purchase, and the one major dissappointment that everyone seems to express about this book is the lack of pictures.Maybe it is because I'm Vietnamese and know a little bit about cooking, but at the time, I didn't think the lack of pictures would make a difference. But after making a couple of dishes I wished the book did have picture; there definitely enough room on the pages in the margins for it. This it too bad since the food seems pretty authentic. The lack of pictures makes the book \\"almost perfect\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book, easy to read, great recipes...it's GREAT!","review":"This book is a bargain, especially at 20% off. The author obviously has a true love of cooking and put together a book that is not only attractive and well-organized, but also very charming. We have tried a couple of recipes and both were wonderful; my husband said they were quite authentic. It's a real winner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Authentic Vietnamese Cooking","review":"There are no photographs of food, how am I suppose to know what I'm cooking and am I making it rite.Too Americanized. I want to enjoy authentic Vietnames food not Vietrican food. I bought this book so I can get away from American food but to find myself cooking Vietnamese food American style."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is not about authenticity...all recipes been revised","review":"i could not even use any of her recipes, because its like a mixture of recipes that she has revised for people who aren't asian to cook and eat. i am asian and i know that these are not the real recipes, any wannabe could write a book like this. and she tries to hard to be all fancy and high class with her food. she even makes up these strange names for her recipes, what a waste of money. the worst recipes ever!!!!!!!!! her thai recipes are horrible. i don't think she realize that she is vietnamese. please get back to roots lady!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I bought this book because of the good reviews. I'm vietnamese and since moving away from home, I wanted to replicate the home cooking. Instead, what you're find is that it's not real Vietnamese or Thai but maybe a cross between the two? Requires too much ingredients (like a restaurant) so unless you want to spend up a storm of money to get a mediocre meal, don't bother. I think it's tailored more to American audience then authentic viet/thai. After about 4 recipes, I've basically gave up. The other cookbook I felt was more home/authentic in the vietnamese food dept is written by corinne trang. Hope that helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddaddy's Drill","review":"This is just like the drill your grandfather used! It never needs recharging or a place to plug into. It works great in the garage, the yard, and out camping in the woods. You can even use different bits in it like screwdriver bits. It's a multi-tool that everybody needs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, poor audio quality","review":"Definitely get your hands on this, but find another source. I get light years better results from an old turntable and a USB converter package, and people laugh at such backward things. This is an exceptional recording, very much worth getting your hands on, but the AMZN download is full of skips and distortion. As an AMZN fan I am very disappointed to say this, but it is what it is. Music rating: five stars. OK, ten stars. Just get it elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"great archaeological writing","review":"Wow, what a great book. It turns a potentially boring and poorly researched subject into a very nice synthesis of excavation reports and ethnohistorical documents. So little was and is known about Tula and the Toltecs, yet the author manages to make it a very good read. I could not put it down, and read it in a day. Good work in translating tedious archaeological findings reports into readable prose. Good maps, and great photographs. Its this kind of stuff that archaeologists should produce more often so anybody can understand us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful in clarifying biblical view of major doctrines","review":"Not only has this helped me with questions on the main doctrines of the Christian faith, but when others have questions, I can use this as a helpful tool because of the clarity of presentation, faithulness to Scripture without intellectualizing. This would be useful for group study or personal study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must be a good book...","review":"Well, I have not read this particular book but I have read many other Derek Prince books and I make it an effort to listen to every tape of his.I would like to disagree with a statement from a reader from SIngapore (below) that Derek Prince lacks a deeper understanding of the Bible. Quite Contrary! Every time I listen to Derek I am AMAZED by his understanding of the scripture. He is, according to my oppinion, the best Bible teacher out there. Also consider this: Derek is an outstanding scholar of both Greek and Hebrew, and also he spent many many years in a deditcated service to the Lord.Let me say this: every Derek's tape's or book adds to my spiritual life and understanding of the scriptures immeasurably. That's why I give it five stars without reading it ( well, I know what it is about since Derek refers to it in other studies of his).Make your own oppinions, but give this book a chance! God bless you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really informative book!","review":"I bought this book for my son who is into home recording but had some questions. He said he got some great ideas and saw that he was doing some things wrong. For instance, he had the wrong kind of speakers for recording. I bought him 3 or 4 books on this subject and this one was his favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic but a must have","review":"This book is definately for all levels of Recording. Very straight and to the point. Very clear and concise, and doesnt limit you to having to have a specific piece of gear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed in what it included","review":"My primary purpose for buying this was for the road markings. I foolishly thought it was going to come with some type of road markings I could put down on the road I had already built. Instead the 'kit' only came with two types of paint- sidewalk and road, a ruler/scraper and a 'scribe' to remove the topcoat of paint revealing the bare surface below. Had I known that was all the 'stripping' was going to include I would have been able to do that with stuff I already own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird, It's like an audiobook w/ slides...","review":"I expected a typical documentary when I rented this. Instead, it is a guy that quite often gets tongue-tied because all he is doing is reading what he's written down to read following his slideshow of pictures. I can't say that at a few, very few times, it isn't slightly interesting, reaching, but nevertheless, I still didn't know I was paying $3.00 to listen to a guy ramble on for 1 1/2 hours in not really such a pleasant voice.Absolutely would not recommend to anyone...If I wanted to listen to this guy read parts of his book to me then, I would buy his audiobook.Would give 1/2 star but it wouldn't let me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth shall set you free","review":"This presentation is very interesting. For sometime I have known about the numerology of 9/11. The flight numbers 11, 77, 93, 175 are all highly significant in the occult. It is good to see that this knowledge is finally getting some coverage. The presentation was mostly about Aleister Crowley's life. The discusscion of the occult ritual that was 9/11 is only breifly touched on, but I still found it interesting and well worth the price of admission. The important thing is that this information is getting air play. I'm considering purchasing the book for more details.The truth shall set you free and this video is part of seeking out the truth. The truth of 9/11 is in our faces, but as in the words of Jesus \\"Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear\\"Another Book on the 911 ritual that just was published is below:The Most Dangerous Book in the World: 9/11 as Mass RitualProphet of Evil: Aleister Crowley, 9/11 and the New World Order"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This is a very well done movie.

I enjoyed the sound track so much I purchase it. If you're looking for skin for get it. As I have pointed out it's simple but to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"After watching this film you will likely feel emotionally distraught and exhausted. Mysterious Skin is intense, brutal, and will deepen your understanding of the emotional and mental aftereffect of enduring an experience or several episodes of sexual abuse and how it can influence later behavior.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is excellent as the victim with the only ability to cope is to be emotionally stunted while leading a promiscuous lifestyle. Brady Corbet is spot on as the asexual and delusional victim who is socially awkward. I appreciate the fact that the sexual abuse was shown or explicitly discussed and was not sugarcoated. Some scenes are heart-wrenching and uncomfortable to watch but this is one of the most realistic portrayals of sexual abuse survivors I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIVETING AND MOVING MOVIE ABOUT ABUSE","review":"This movie captures like no other that I have seen the long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse, including the seductiveness of an adult abuser and the varying ways in which children try to cope with an overwhelming experience; an unbelievably riveting and powerful film, and one of the most stunning films I have ever seen; I first saw this film at the Provincetown Film Festival and have watched it many times since then--each time it is as powerful as the first viewing; an amazing film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good writing, good cinematography, and cute guys","review":"Big fan of independent films especially if they are gay oriented. Not only was the story exceptional but it touched nerves and emotions that most movies do not dare to explore. In my eyes it is a learning experience worth the time and money. The characters were well played and they touch your heart each in their own way. I can not forget to mention how cute some of them are both guys and girls(which is always a plus in a really good movie). This movie is not for those with weak stomaches, homophobia, or sensitivity to sexual abuse issues (rape, child molestation, prostitution). There are some scenes that many would find uncomfortable. If you are an independent thinker with a craving for stories that expose the good and bad in life without a sugar coated foundation this movie is definately for you. It's like a cosmo with a splash of truth and a twist of insanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This movie is absolutely wonderful. It is a bit dark and might not be for everyone. However, it deals with real issues that need to be addressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious Skin","review":"Haunting. Engaging. Tough. Great performances on difficult subject matter. Joseph Gordon Levitt demonstrates shows us that he can hold his own in a dramatic role. A great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michelle Trachtenberg Plays Surporting Role---Fantastic!!!","review":"I actually was beating around the bush, wondering if i was going to like it. And i did, I only bought it because of I'm a huge fan of Michelle Trachtenberg, and although she's only in a few scenes. She played the part great. This movie was a lesson to learn, and did it teach us all. Whether your straight or not, it has meaning. As for my review here, 2 little boys abused, 1 big boy making money the wrong way grew up to be gay, the other big boy lost trying to remember his childhood, the 2nd gay guy in love with the first boy... The girl best friend with both gay guys, moves to Nee York and in up trying to reach out to her child hood friend who comes to visit. At the end the first two boys meet once again after so many years, only to dicover how messed up thier child hood was, wish if they could go back and change what had happen to them. Over All--Always use protection no matter what the situration is."},{"rating":"2","title":"I related to this movie....It hit home for me.","review":"I found this movie a bit too realistic.

It will make your brain work and will expand your vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performances, terrible direction","review":"The performances in this movie are very good. However, the actual depictions of some of the events in this movie are far too graphic and verge on parody. Some of the scenes are so over-the-top they come off as insincere and cringe-inducing. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie -- bad DVD!","review":"There is a problem with this batch of DVD's -- the movie is clever (even if the subject is a little deep) but I had problems with the DVD it self - returned it and the replacement was defective as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon needs to wise up","review":"Seeing as this review is for the 'product' and not to review the movie itself I have no issues in rating this a 1 as this is coming from Amazon who really need to reevaluate the way they 'preview' movies. It's an absolute joke. The 'preview' feature shows absolutely nothing other than the studios tag in and the actors names on the screen. What information about the story of the movie can one gather from that? It's utterly pointless. Amazon, either show the movie trailers or don't bother wasting peoples time with these pointless 'previews' that do nothing but waste your customers time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling Trash","review":"I look forward to completely forgetting the horrific, gratuitous brutality in this film. A compelling piece utterly ruined by the unnecessary violent, graphic depiction of the rape of a teenage male hustler and peppered with an unnecessarily graphic and obscene portrayal of child molestation. And that was the version on cable. A movie rife with potential but utterly destroyed by Araki's extreme execution of the content. Sick trash and garbage is the unfortunate review of this movie which could have earned five stars had Araki reined in his bankrupt need to act out what would have best been left to the imagination. The ugliest movie I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor delivery.","review":"The movie itself was actually pretty good. The delivery, however, left much to be desired. When I received the DVD it was visibly damaged. When I opened the DVD box I realized the full extent of the damage to the product.

Discussion of discovery of digital evidence doesn't even come until the 10th chapter. The book tends to deal in generalities of information security and is not technical in nature.If you know nothing about cyber security and crime, then it's not a bad read.

I replaced the batteries and gave it a try. I couldn't see anything either. I then tried to look at the back of my hand and couldn't see it either. There was no light passing through the observation tube! Inside was a plastic tab with a mirrored surface that is supposed direct the light beam down the tube.

And if you look and see something but aren't sure, well that is what the Doctor is for. So again I say this is a great product for what it is and its target users.

I use it for medical missions to Nicaragua. They are lightweight, easy to pack, easy to keep in a pocket, and provide amazing light with good visualization of TM and canal. We also use the bright light to visualize eyes and skin lesions. I own 5 of them and share with whoever needs one. I have had 5 doctors tell me they are very impressed with the otoscope and one told me she would buy one of these rather than spend over $50 on new batteries for her large one. I think the thin line design is less threatening to children. I always show it to them before I use it and they seem fascinated with it rather than scared by it. I had a question about replacement bulbs and their customer service was very prompt and personal. Can't beat this otoscope!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I love looking in ears (I know that is strange) I got this Otoscope to replace an old one I had, this one has a good viewing surface and works great.

And the included instruction sheet has some nice pictures of different types of ear drums to help you figure out what you are looking at.

The edges need to be more rounded to prevent that from happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"The instrument is quality but my issue is not with this product but knowing what to look for.

So getting in to see one is hard. Before the otoscope we were going to the Doctor's office every month. My son has had two sets of tubes. I ordered a otoscope from you and it was amazing. I didn't have to take him in every time he was pulling at his ear. It has saved me hundreds of dollars in doctor's appoinments. When he does have an ear infection I take him and the doctor is always impressed that I knew. Infact I have gotten to the point that if he developes an ear infection after hours I can call the doctor and the medication is ready to pick up without an appointment (We do follow up shortly after the next day or so).

I bought this thinking Amazon was offering a better deal!! boo...I needed a cheap otoscope to look into my husband's and son's ear. I am used to using the Welch Allyn otoscope that I had while on my clinical rotations. This otoscope does not even compare to the quality WA offers, but it will do for now. I 1st used Dr. Mom to look in my husband's ear after he could not hear. The otoscope worked fine for him. I was able to see his eardrum & all. However, since my little one started having a cold, I wanted to make sure he did not have an ear infection.

I'm not in the medical field, so I can't speak on this topic from a professional standpoint, but as a mother who just wants to have a preliminary look in my kiddo's ears before hauling her off to the doc for an ear infection, I was disappointed with this product.

We could easily see a large blockage in his left ear, which we proceeded to rinse out with multiple gently rinses...After each rinse we used the Ototscope to see how much we had left to clear out...Without the Otoscope we would not have been able to completely clear his ear.

You can see about 1cm in front of the specula, but the ear drum for our kids seem to be about 2-3 cm away from the tip of the specula.Consequence? -- I have to shove the specula deep into the kids ear to see anything & that's no way to try & relieve ear pain.If there was just some way to improve or make the magnification variable.

It also beats guessing. Image is very bright and clear and I really like that we'll never have to replace the super bright LED.

No. Very poorly made. Mine was drop-shipped from Pearl. The box was perfect- no impact evident. But, the backrest leans to one side by at least an inch or more. This is supposed to be the top-of-the-line? And on a throne that costs $280, should you see staples on the backrest? No. I called Pearl customer service, and the guy actually said that the backrest misalignment was because it had been \\"tightened down too much- I'm not saying you did this, but\\"... Ridiculous.There is no way to lock the seat to the base and still have the seat swivel. Loosen enough for the seat to swivel, and the seat will come right off if you lift the whole thing by the seat.Great idea, poor execution.

The think is, if you look at how it's made, it looks like they have connected the wrong posts -- the metal connector that works when you touch the wire to it is not attached to the W wire screw. I tried a different thermostat and it worked fine. So either both of the these CT31A thermostats I bought were defective, or the thermostat was mis-manufactured with a flawed design, or it's not designed to work with a 2 wire setup (though the manual does not say so).Would love to hear from Honeywell what the issue is with this thermostat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Project Runway Season Five","review":"If you enjoy watching people be very creative and then produce that creation, this is a fantastic series for you.

Always presenting the topic balanced, not only from one point of view.The work is about the states, which took over territories from Hungary after WWI. Namely Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia and Austria.He describes the history of each area and the peoples living there.Review based on Simon Publications reprint edition August 2001"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cassette fails to fulfill even modest expectations.","review":"Is it reasonable to assume that a one-hour cassette tape entitled 'Elizabeth Bishop' includes poetry read by Bishop herself? Perhaps not. Surely, though, such a tape would include complete Bishop poems adequately read by someone. Guess again. The tape in question is a hodge-podge of comments by UNIDENTIFIED people about Bishop's poetry. Octavio Paz has an accent, so one can identify him, and I think the quavery, crusty voice is Mary McCarthy's -- but who knows for sure? An extremely self-conscious woman (unidentified) reads about half a dozen strangely expurgated poems. There is no indication either on the cassette case or on the tape itself that the poems have been edited. Why edit short poems anyway? You'll have to ask someone at Mystic Fire Audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth Bishop (Voices & Visions (Audio))","review":"This tape is an excellent introduction to the work of Elizabeth Bishop.

The texts gain coherence from Chatwin's ever returning themes, a.o. restlessness and rootlessness (united in his preoccupation with Nomadism), and above all Chatwin's writing style, which is abundantly present in all texts. All texts benefit from a Chatwin flavour.I really enjoyed this book. I can't imagine haven't read the autobiographical sketches \`I always wanted to go to Patagonia' or \`A place to hang your hat', the review \`Abel the nomad' or the three texts gathered in part III \\"The Nomadic Alternative\\".

I think the basis for better is there in, say, the chapter \\"the Morality of Things\\" but published as it is, it is still unformed. The same goes for the Nomad chapters.

I highly reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys this type of real-world, romantic fiction. Why only four stars?

Old faces pop up, and there are many plot twists (but do we expect any less from Herbert's grand work?).

I finished the first three books in the chronicles: when the time allows, I will certainly attempt the fourth one. However, the third book is not what you can expect from the preceding ones. The transformation of Leto II into an existence that I will not divulge here is something to read with a mixture of the pleasure and the sadness because it is a path to restoring an order, which will take quite a long time. Each book until now was a delight to read, but this third one made it more clear to understand where the author is leading the Fremen and us into."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vast improvment over #2","review":"This book lays the groundwork for the rest of the Dune Series.

Unlike Paul Atreidies, who had a human side that the reader could relate to, his son Leto II is distant, pretentious, and completely uninteresting. His immense power and knowledge make it impossible for the reader to care what happens to him.

However the way these books have been published is an insult to the series. The pages have such tiny margins on either side, it is impossible to hold the book without your thumb covering up part of the print. In fact the inner margin is so small that you have to flatten the book's spine in order to read it. The print is smaller than the previous edition, and the whole thing is so cheaply made that I returned it. Part of the enjoyment of reading a book is the actual physical presence of the book on your senses. If that is interrupted by poor publishing methods, it makes it difficult to enter the intangible realms that a book offers. Beware of this edition with this particular cover. Look for the earlier editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good until near the end","review":"There are many strong aspects of this book. Herbert continues to develop the plot and characters as only he can. This has everything that fans love about the first two books. While I consider myself a generous reader (by that I mean that I'm willing to give authors the benefit of the doubt), there is a plot twist near the end that is a stretch in my opinion. Yes, I've read the whole series and I understand the Golden Path and why this plot twist occurs (I'm being careful not to give anything away here if you haven't read it), it is just too far-fetched for me.

I struggled through god emporer, and now can't manage to sit through the remaining two books. My advice, read Dune, and just use your imagination to fill in what happens afterwards, it'll be more rewarding that way"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rounds out the trilogy nicely","review":"Common wisdom states that Herbert created a great world with the first Dune books and then fell from grace with every chapter afterwards. There is some truth to that especially with the last two book that are good in their own right but don't measure up to the rest of the series.This is the last book where we see the main characters from the first novel. Alia and Paul who show so much promise in the original chapter now come to tragic endings with Paul falling from his potential and Alia fulfilling the dark prophecies associated with her. We also see the children of Paul coming into their own with Leto II setting up the epilogue God Emporer.Part of this book will leave you miserable. I think that much of this book was motivated by Herbert being sick of these characters that he had invented instead of wanting to bring them to a tragic conclusion.

I was a little surprised at how certain story arcs and character arcs were completed, but Herbert did what was necessary to set up the next three books within his saga.In summary, a solid effort by one of the greatest visionaries in the field of science fiction.Christopher NewlandAuthor of \\"In Garrison\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear is the Mind killer","review":"Still not as good as Dune was but a little better then Dune Messiah.

Whoever the voice belongs to, I find it impossible to believe that he is either French, or aEuropean, or a writer. The other voices are equally unimpressive.

And why Amazon would not ship the gold filter at the same time they shipped the coffee maker is beyond me. I never got an answer on that.Part 2: After a few months of having this coffee maker it has just become a waste of money. It leaks from the bottom and when making a full pot for some reason it does not use all the water in the container where you put the water in.

The steam attachment on the espresso machine is a bit awkward to control; you turn the same knob as you use to start the espresso machine.

Great Buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's best to keep looking","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for myself. I've used the espresso part a few times and it works great. It's the first I've had, so I've nothing which to compare it. The coffeemaker part - I hate to say this - is the worst I've ever had. The coffee makes slowly, is much too cool, and the carafe has an itty bitty spout so it drips everywhere, no matter how slowly you pour it.After three weeks of use, the coffeemaker side no longer works. There is an internal component inside (I think my brother said it goes to the pump) that MELTED during routine use.When I purchased this unit, I did a little research and I was prepared for the espresso maker to go first, but the coffeemaker last only weeks floored me! I've had it to long to return it for a refund to get something else, so I'm hoping it doesn't cost me a ton to ship it to be replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"Mr Coffee used to be a reliable brand, but this model is/was a total \\"let-down\\". It's poor design is almost a hazard waiting to happen.First - Performance: It's slow to brew, although expresso side works fairly well, the coffee side is slow brewing, leaks at reservoir and internal design is poor and cheaply made.Second - Safety; The expresso side is sturdy and has safety in mind, but the coffee side is hazardous at best. It easily overflows, jams and the decanter leaks while pouring. Tried multiple attempts (how hard can it be to pour a cup of coffee? DUH?) yet it leaks from the pour spout lip down the face of coffee pot.I called & reported this problem to Mr Coffee directly and am waiting for replacement they promised to send over a week ago. I'm extremely disappointed in this product and advise anyone considering to pass on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not always produce steam","review":"I've had this machine for just over 3 months. It does fine making espresso and coffee, although brewing a pot of coffee takes longer then my previous coffee machine, but every month the steam wand seems to work less and less. In fact, the last 5 times I've tried using the steam wand this week it has not worked. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe lid is major problem","review":"I see that other reviewers had the same problem as I did with the leaky carafe lid. It is a real pain....literally. When you lift the lid with your thumb as you pour to prevent spilling, you burn yourself with the steam. It is a design flaw by the manufacturer. I can't help but think that if ONE HUMAN actually tested this thing before it when on the market that this lid problem would have been corrected. I guess that doesn't happen anymore. It makes fine coffee though, and the espresso maker is very good for the money. I have had other Mr. Coffee makers in the past and have been satisfied, but this dumb carafe lid is making me question their quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the evil Mr. Coffee.","review":"We can't return it or we would in a heartbeat. Our kids gave it to my wife and me for our anniversary. We are stuck with it until it has an unfortunate accident and breaks into a million ugly pieces.You can grow coffee faster than it brews a pot. Somehow it loses a cup of water in the process and then, when you finally get a pot brewed the spout on the carafe is designed so poorly, that unless you pour it a dribble at a time, it spills out past both sides of the miserable little lip - hot/lukewarm coffee all over the place first thing in the morning!!!Getting water into the reservoir is easy, but the reservoir will not stand up straight on its own. If you set it down in the sink, it tips over.Whoever at Mr. Coffee designed and approved this piece of garbage should find themselves applying for unemployment, if they haven't already.DO NOT BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I never used it because it would not hold water in the reservoir. I filled it several times but all it did was leak out all over the counter. If they could fix this little flaw it might be a nice coffee maker.

Finally I bought a Saeco and I don't regret a thing. Just a few things to mention:- Drip coffee is warm. It's WARM. You have to microwave it to heat it up.- Boiler cap doesn't close right. Every once in a while it releases seam all over.- This is not an espresso machine because it uses steam power to brew the coffee. Espresso machines use a pump-driven system. No Crema at all.- Frothing system is OK I guess. But it takes forever to heat up.I give it 2 stars only because it's cheap and it works. I mean warm water comes down its nozzles. But I stop here. This is definitely not a espresso machine and not a good coffeemaker.Stay out of it. If you need one, I can send you mine. Otherwise it will go right in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great when it works - but only for 60 days","review":"I gave my wife this coffee maker two months ago, and I actually have never used this unit; my wife is the coffee drinker in the family, so I am only passing along what she has told me. Until last week, the Mr Coffee performed well and my wife had no complaints. Unfortunately, in the last week, the coffee maker no longer provides the steam to foam up the milk, and my wife says that the coffee is coming out \\"differently\\". On the other hand, I do not know if the system is being cleaned as it should be, or if there is any other regular maintenance that needs to be done to it. In any case, the unit has not had heavy use, and I would guess that my wife is representative of an average user, so for this system to fail after 2 months is likely not acceptable. To be honest, I was sceptical of how high the quality could be on an espresso machine for $60, so I am not surprised that it is already providing problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALLS APART FAST!

Thus, the lid opens up while pouring the coffee, causing a serious and consistent spill with every pour.One can minimize spillage to some degree by pouring very, very slowly and by placing pressure on the lid to keep it closed. But, this is way too much effort than should be required to pour oneself a nice cup of coffee. Furthermore, these preventive measures do not always work. And by the time you realize that, the spilled coffee has quietly and invisibly run along the carafe and created a puddle on the counter. It's a real mess.If I had to do it all over again, I would not purchase this machine due to the coffee wasted and the inconvenience caused by the multiple cleanups.Mr. Coffee needs to correct this design error!

The steamer arm provides little steam; instead large amounts of condensation collect under the lid which runs down the back of the unit each time the lid is opened.On the coffee side, the plastic notches on the lid of the pot are flimsy and have already started to bend and tear, making it difficult to reattach.

The coffee side of the machine works better but the decanter leaks and the top of the decanter is difficult to put on and is also cheaply made, which poses a problem because the top is required in order to ensure that coffee comes out of the coffee maker.

This one seems to be constructed better. I like the ease with which the steam vessel is closed, the screw cap is very secure, and easy to tighten. The frother spout swings to the side, which helps keep it out of the way when not in use. On the coffee maker side, the lift out basket makes it easy to remove the grounds.Problems?; only one really, and that is very minor. The decanter: the lid only lifts up a bit unless you take it completely off. It gets in the way when filling and rinsing, also the shape of the spout makes coffee spill out the side slightly, if you pour it too fast.Overall, I'm really happy with this machine...it's easy to use, and so far, seems like it's going to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with basic operation","review":"I'm sorry to say that I didn't heed the warning of other reviewers beforebuying this machine.

Even if you use the thumb lever to lift the lid you still have coffee dripping unless you barely dribble it out of the spout. The espresso part makes a cup of mud, more like Turkish coffee than Italian Espresso. The holes in the coffee holder are too large and let too much of the fine coffee through. There is none of the \\"la crema\\" foam on top of the espresso like you usually get from a decent espresso machine. I don't make latte's or Capuccino so I can't comment on the steaming part of the machine. I guess for $60 you get what you pay for, it does make a decent cup of regular coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine","review":"Got this thing a month ago and I love it. The espresso side of it makes perfect espresso with the right grind. It takes about 3-4 minutes to brew full amount. The steamer/frothing mechanism works great with a little practice. After reading a couple other reviews, I'm a little puzzled about some of the complaints. The trick is to add a little more water than you want to brew so that the pressurized compartment can keep producing steam after the brew. My single complaint goes to the coffeemaker side. It does make a good coffee but, its slow and its not quite hot enough for my taste. I tend to leave it on the burner a couple minutes and it seems to help. For the price, I don't think you can find better than this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"We've only had this machine for a month, so I can't comment on how durable it is, but it does seem to be well constructed. My wife likes decaf, and I like espresso, so this coffeemaker is great for us. Everything functions as it should. Making a full pot of regular coffee is a bit slow on the 5-8 cup setting, but this is designed to ensure proper strength. I could speed things up by using the 1-4 cup setting if I was willing to settle for weaker coffee or add more grounds. The espresso is quite quick and the frother works well.One minor complaint: It didn't come with a permanent filter, but they are easy to find and not expensive.It's a great machine, and for the price, an excellent deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Krups.","review":"I bought this to replace a Krups espresso/coffee maker combo, and I should have listened to the other bad reviews. You get what you pay for. I have other Mr. Coffee products that I really like, but this is not one. Coffee is too slow to brew, tastes bad, and is awkward to set up in the first place. The components don't fit together well - I have to force the carafe into place. It's very cheap, and I wish I had forked over the dough and gotten a better machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic taste and smell","review":"This coffee maker produces a pungent plastic smell that wafted all over the kitchen and living room. I think this may be because Mr Coffee is made of a soft plastic. The good news is though that amazon took it back without problems and refunded the money. I got a delonghi alicia cordless espresso maker instead and love that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing if knowledgable in photography","review":"David Carson is undoubtedly one of the best graphic designers and a revolutionary typographist ... but unless you understand the angles and complexity of photography, I don't think you'd really want to get this book.

Every second collection of contemporary photographs that I look at, and that is marketed as art, shows about this same stuff. I'll just go out and take them myself if I want to own a picture of the three knobs on a washing machine, combined with a pseudo-deep comment.

A Pause feature is always standard, because it is an essential recorder function. But not this RCA unit!Instead, you can only stop the playback - which is like a playback reset - and then you have to hold down the \\"fast-forward\\", (which is only about double normal speed) - in order to get back to where you left off!It is so incredibly frustrating - I felt compelled to write this review about it!Normally, a \\"pause button\\" is standard - it is on EVERY OTHER recorder I have ever owned.

I use mousse to provide volume & body to my fine thin hair.I've used 4 other brands of mousse (Pantene, Dove, Herbal Essences, and Garnier). Nexxus is my favorite. Most of the mousse products I have used have provided that body & volume that I wanted, but some also made my hair feel sticky/crunchy. Nexxus feels very light, well, really, you can't feel it at all. The volume it gives is absolutely amazing, better than any other brand I've used.Yes, it's alcohol free, but it still contains stuff I was trying to avoid in my hair products.

I purchased the Thermaltake Desktop USB Cooling Fan, cut a 3.5\\" square opening on the side of the cabinet, and installed the fan facing out of the openning to draw the warm air out. This solution worked perfectly! I can adjust the Thermaltake fan speed up if I'm running CPU intensive applications - like games or watching a DVD - to draw more air.

With the little TT fan blowing across the keyboard area, the PowerBook seldom reaches 140 degrees, and the internal fans almost never kick in. The TT fan is nearly silent at its lowest levels, very quiet at the level I use (~halfway up), and not terribly loud even at its highest setting. It's definitely got a DIY-geeky look, but at least it's not geek-bling with pulsing LEDs or anything. My one big knock against it is its lack of an off switch.

It's a little bit noisy at high speeds, but I'm sure I could buffer the noise if I really cared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great USB Fans","review":"The fan works great with a Sony PS3 except for when you power off the unit. The fans remain on after turning off the PS3. Therefore, I have to select the power off switch located on the back of the PS3 unit in order to stop the fans. The fans works great for cooling down or keeping a Sony PS3 cool while operating. The adjuster turndial is great for adjusting the fan speed. I would recommend this fan for cooling down game consoles and computers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job for me...........","review":"I have the small one and I like it so well that I bought the big (120mm) for another application.

Except on the very highest setting, they are very quiet. I actually have to look at the blades to see if they are spinning. I use them to provide extra cooling for HD enclosures, and they're great for work because they aren't noisy and, they provide a slight breeze without blowing everything off my desk. Today's computer systems have USB ports just about everywhere (front, back, monitors), so you shouldn't have much of a problem finding a place to plug it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"very loud","review":"I read the reviews saying this was a quiet fan.

Two support spokes in the back of the fan case were broken upon delivery and the metal parts seem to have been mounted incorrectly. Because the fan's case is defective the fan vibrates and its blades strike the sides of the duct. All this shaking and scraping produces \\"nails across a chalkboard\\" noise. Even an attempted fix with cyanoacrylate glue hasn't eliminated the whine from this pesky fan. The roll-up cord hasn't been much help to me either. The speed control works well--I can change the whine from hellish to just annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Fan, A Bit Noisy","review":"Works as advertized, a bit noisy at full speed which you will most likely not need. Low speed is more than adequate for most situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite and strong - bought several","review":"Completely as advertised, but more durable and quieter than expected.I bought several, and placed the extras on my office and home work desks.Mainly purchased to ventilate my desktop tower which sits inside a home desk compartment; there was a cable access hole that I placed the fan into ... now I can run my desktop without keeping the compartment door open for cooling."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quiet cooling device for PS3","review":"During the warmer months my PS3's fans would spin up and become loud after 20 mins of playing games like COD4 and CoD world at war.I decided to try this fan after reading the reviews. My ps3 is not in an enclosed cabinet but is on a 3 level TV stand and sits on the middle shelf. The stand is open on all sides.Putting fan behind PS3 at the exhaust port to help draw hot air out, did not work.What did work was aiming the fan across the right side about 3 inches away, my ps3 is horizontal, and letting the fan blow into the intakes and across the exhaust on the back.The fan is very quiet on medium speed and runs on the USB port so it powers on and off with PS3.I played 45+ mins last night and the fan did not crank up like it has before.Seems to work well.only complaint is it took way too long to get here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Works pretty good. Its sturdy and does the job. Doesn't produce an assload of air, but pretty good. I use this to help cool my stupid PS3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drops A/V cabinet temps by 20","review":"I have an enclosed a/v cabinet and was concerned about internal temps when running a PS3, receiver and other components. I put my outdoor remote temp sensor in the cabinet and routinely saw 110F+ temps, so I purchased this and plugged it in to the PS3 USB port and saw a reduction of ~20. The fan is quiet enough to not be noticed over the sound of other component fans running and the sound is a non-issue when anything is playing. You can plug it in to anything with a USB port but since my PS3 seems to be the big heat generator, I chose to plug it in there. It works very well and is a much cheaper and simpler solution than hard mounting a 120mm exhaust fan and wiring in a thermometer. I'm going to buy another one so I can put a laptop in the cab as well. I recommend 100%."},{"rating":"2","title":"super cool, im a big fan.","review":"The only regret is that I didn't get the bigger one. Other than that, this little fan is a great desktop accessory.Im a smoker, and I cant stand smoke constantly rolling in my face and eyes, so I plug this fella in my powered USB hub, and it really does the trick. Don't expect to be blown away by this fan, but to just move the air a little it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud!","review":"These fans are much too loud. I have them mounted on the back of my FW900 CRT and even on the lowest setting 4 feet from my ears they are really loud. You need a larger, slower spinning fan to lessen noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM USED!!!!","review":"Well, just to put it shortly I am working on a project that I needed a USB fan for. I got this in the mail, extremely excited about it. I opened it to find a small, strangle plastic piece. Not knowing what it is, I plugged the fan in. The fan barely put out ANY air and made a GOD AWFUL noise. Turns out, the plastic piece was one of the four missing to keep the fan in place. It is flying all over the inside of the metal cage, and it wont work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY TOXIC PLASTIC USED","review":"This is a neat little fan and does work, but I had to throw it out, due to the fact that the insidious toxic plastic vapors emitted from it immediately gave me headaches that lasted for hours, every time I went near it.I don't know if it is the fire-retardant, the BPA, plasticizers, the XYZ, or whatever. I am not a chemist. This offending vapor is in many fans and electronics (but certainly not all) and more in the past than it is in the newer stuff, since Europe impose consumer protection restrictions on toxic additives.I did not return it, but threw away the fan, and kept the stand, USB chord, and variable speed switch. I sometimes feel I should have returned it.But if you are the kind of person that craves that new-car smell, you might not have a problem with this fan, but I would not recommend it to cancer patients, Alzheimer's patients, or allergic people, MCS sufferers, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but powerful","review":"Don't let the size fool you, this fan does the job. With a dial to control the speed, and a stand, the fan is built solid and puts out the desired effect. I actually dangle the fan over the exhaust of the internal fan and it does an amazing job to pull the heat out of the tower. With an I7 processor, my room would get uncomfortably hot, but now I point it to the door and it at least gets rid of some of the excess heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"It moves air","review":"My PS3 gets pretty warm in my entertainment center, so I decided to get this to help circulate some air. It does what I intended it to do. I like the fact that it's a USB device. Since I have it plugged into my PS3, it's only on when I have the PS3 turned (I originally plugged it into the powered USB hub that I have hooked up to my PS3, and it stayed on, as there's no power switch.) There is a control knob to adjust the fan speed, which is a nice touch. I noticed several reviews commenting about how quiet this fan is. I suppose it is if you have the power down to 50% or less... When it's cranked up, it makes way more noise than my PS3's fan (which is fairly loud itself!)Over all, it's a nice solid build, and if you're in the market for a USB powered fan, I see no reason why you shouldn't look at this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap-looking, but functional","review":"I bought this because my Xbox 360 slim was turning the top of my dresser into an inferno. The blower on the Xbox just churns out heats, which has a good 8 inches before it hits my wall, but manages to heat the dresser surface and the wall itself.I plugged this little badboy into the service usb port on my TV and it's as if the Xbox weren't producing heat at all.This product is functional, but not really pretty. I guess it might detract from its functionality to put it in a pretty plastic case or something, but it would still be a PC fan with a USB plug, which is all it really needs to be to get the job done.Oh, and the one I got is whisper-quiet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and powerful little fan","review":"Purchased the fan because I've always been happy with ThermalTake products, and I was not disappointed! Variable speed, super quiet, and it really moves the air. I would recommend this fan for anyone needing an easily moveable little fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great. Would recommend.","review":"I purchased three of these to keep my entertainment cabinet with my gaming consoles and HD TV. I was going to purchase three insert fans that would require three holes drilled in the side of my cabinet and would have a temperature control to cut on and off..but at over 3x the price of doing the same thing with these I chose to use this product. I have a usb hub plugged into my HD TV and have two of these fans setup to cool it and have the third plugged into my PS since. By doing this the fans only turn on when my TV or PS3 is turned on...works great and really keeps things cool considering my cabinet is not much bigger than my TV and air ventilation is not that great.If I need any more fans I will be sure and purchase these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud & Weak!","review":"the fan makes noise a minimum speed and really loud at max speed. If it blows out a lot of air, then it's acceptable; however, I hardly feel any air from 13\\" away. It's too noisy to be comfortable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty useful, but a little too loud","review":"I got this fan as additional cooling for my Acer 5672WLMi which gets uncomfortably hot everytime I try to run it. This was my second Thermaltake Mobile Fan II and both work fine at low levels (moves decent amounts of air), but when you turn the speed dial up the fan can become a little noisy. Aside from the noise, the variable speed feature is nice, but there isn't an on/off switch, but that isn't a big deal to me. I'd give this a 4.5/5.0 if I could. Good Product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fan, a little loud","review":"I'm using this to cool my PS3 in an equipment cabinet. The fact that it will run of USB makes it easy to use whenever my PS3 is powered up. My only complaint is that it's a little loud on the highest setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"I was going to build something like this before it occurred to me to look for it here. It's just what it looks like: A standard case fan with a rheostat knob, a usb power adapter, and a bit of wire for a stand. The fan is very quiet, almost silent at a moderate speed while still moving a nice amount of air. Overall it's well-made, not cheap or cheesy. The retractable USB cable is a nice bonus.I use it next to a Macbook Pro. I turn it on when I'm doing resource-intensive things like video rendering, and it can make a 5-10 degree (C) difference in the measured temps of the laptop.And here's a bonus use: When hanging up my camelbak bladder for drying, I set this fan right in front of the filler opening, and it dries really fast! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's see how long it works","review":"I bought this fan to connect to my TiVo in the media closet, which tends to run a little hot since it's enclosed. It's working great and doing the job with a minimum of noise. I like the retractable USB cable and the variable speed dial. Now it just remains to be seen how long it will function running 24/7."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 design flaws","review":"This should have been a nifty little gadget, but two rather obtuse design flaws ruin it. First, there is no Off switch. There is a rheostat, but no way to turn the device off. So when I don't want to use the fan I have to unplug the USB? I can only shake my head at this.Secondly, the wires come off the top of the unit. Consequently you have an ugly display on your desktop. The fan looks like it can be repositioned, but this is ridiculous.The fan itself seems fine, though I do get some whine reverberating on my table top even at low speed.Two bone-headed design flaws that did not have to be ruin what this device could have been. I'm really surprised at Thermaltake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well thought out and effective","review":"This product was exactly what was needed to cool off my home theatre system.

I watched Garbo in ANNA KARENINA with Fredrick March and it was wonderful, but I have to say that while Jennifer Jones was wonderful as MADAME BOVARY, I hated the film, because I hated Madame Bovary. I do not think I have ever despised a character in any film, and that includes, Mildred played by Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage.So, I liked three out of the four films.

I recommend that readers start with Quinn's mature, METES AND BONDS --the Lambda award winning novel-- and REBEL YELL anthology series,and then return to this first published work. Being the big fan, as I am, of Jay Quinn's books, I'm not overcritical when I say that this book is not quite \\"ripe\\"!! I just feel that most people will appreciate it more after they read the more finished books first. That way, you will better appreciate the dominating themes of his body of work. Why are Jay Quinn's books so important? Because Jay Quinn is not afraid to break taboos. That is #1. In the Lambda Book Report he talks openly about the roles of alcohol and in METES AND BOUNDS he writes about drugs affecting the lives of gay men. From Man-Boy love, to incest relations, he writes the truth. Jay Quinn is the most important new Southern writer today."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read!","review":"How great it would be if all young gay men just coming out could have an older person, a Mentor, help guide them through life's trials and experiences.

Through all his troubles with relationships, drugs, and depression, he manages to pull through. All with the help of his dedicated mentor, Joe Riddick.By reading this book other gay men will relive their own similar experiences, and know that they are not alone.

Kaufman's book gave the Nazis a propaganda windfall and even another excuse for eliminating the Jews of Germany. Pointing to Kaufman's writing, the Nazi's message to the German people was a simple one: get them before they get you. Thus, I'm afraid Kaufman's book is an extremely unfortunate example of the \\"law of unintended consequences.\\" Smith's book, by the way, is one of the few I've read that presents the war from inside Germany, and I certainly recommend it.

But if your issues are of a professional or work nature, you will be terribly disappointed, as I was. \\"Play loud music\\" is a recommendation that clearly isn't going to work at the office. \\"Routines for laundry and household cleaning\\" and \\"Routines for general housecleaning\\" are typical sections, as more examples.Getting help from \\"friends and family,\\" which is one of the main solutions, isn't going to work at the office either. I got very little out of this book and felt I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"These people know how ADD brains work","review":"This book addresses the challenges that adults with ADD face every single Day.

Breaking the suggestions into groups (things you can do yourself, things you can do with help from family and friends, things you can do with help from professionals) makes it easy to choose a strategy that best suits you.

There are very simple solutions to everyday storage and home management problems as well as time management, which are directed to those of us with ADD. We no longer have to live in a mess!! There are user friendly ideas in this book. I have had piles of papers cluttering up my tables, my floor and my life. I am in the process of sorting through \\"stuff\\" and simplifying and I am looking forward to seeing all my furniture and floors again. One drawer at a time, one table at a time, one room at a time.

This is a good thing-as an ADHD person, who hasn't tried lots of things and read lots of books on organizing? However, I had mixed feelings on the format and the tone of some of the writing. I do not need a larger-than-normal-print, large format book just because I am ADD. I do not need to have concepts overly simplified. In a few places I felt distinctly patronized. It's unfortunate, because while I find the information useful, I find myself getting a bit irritated if I read it for too long-and I'm the \\"disappear into a book for hours and never notice\\" type.

It has enough maps to get you started and to help you find the routes on a proper road atlas. The text is a quick, easy read.

The movie starts with filming of some landmarks of Budapest, the City. That part is good. It then films the scene at a Budapest Disco. The remaining movie is about two very sexy, attractive young Budapest women, about 19 to 21, who are shown separately in a room by themselves on a bed. For about 25 to 30 minutes each, the women take off their clothes and then pleasures themselves. The producer also has out three other movies of bad girls of the World from Europe.

ID3, support for WMA and MP3 and many other features you would want with a portable. I bought this unit because I thought it was a great deal with all those features. I bought and returned two units because they wouldn't even play a standard, off the shelf, music CD without skipping. I even put the unit down so that it wouldn't move and still got some distortion or skipping. MP3 played a little better but not good enough for me. How did this get to the store shelves? What RCA engineer approved this? RCA needs to go back to the drawing board. I will not buy another RCA portable until I see better reviews over a long period of time just because of my experience with this unit. I'll stick with the better quality units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement","review":"I got this player to play mp3's because i go on long road trips. It works if you don't search through songs. I tried multiple times to search and it would freeze like a computer. I had to take out the batteries to make it stop. And sometimes when you are just listening it will jump to the beggining of the next song and go back to where it was playing. It's just a little clip but you can notice it very clearly (it's annoying). It has some problems playing mp3's and it has some glitches like freezing sometimes when playing and the lens is loud. The headphones hurt after a while but they have good quality. Battery life could be longer. If you just need an mp3 player there is probably a better one somewhere. I don't recommend buying this.

One sone would not play (I did not realize it, but it was recorded at 256kb), but the rest played nicely. One 128 kb song had some blips that did not show up when played under Winamp, but I got a different copy of the song, still at 128kb and it worked fine. 160 and 192kb songs went without a hitch. The rechargeable NiMH batteries I use last about 8.5 hours of constant use, which is pretty good. The sound quality is good, as are the included headphones.

I have made 2 CD's with about 200 songs on each at all different bit rates and out of all those songs it has only failed to read six. It has yet to skip even once (hard to believe but true) - even in the car which has really impressed me. Neither my nephew or I have had any trouble with our players and we have both had them for about six months.The only con is that it doesn't come with an AC adaptor - although usually if I am using this unit I am on the go.

I can skip back to just after the bad section and it will play fine; why did it skip ahead so far? It often plays fine through 'bad' sections on a second retry, so it's obviously a fault in the player: it doesn't know how to retry and read a bad section again.The read errors are such an annoyance that I can't even use this player.

Rocket Boys sends your heart soaring right there with Sonny's rockets and leaves you with a feeling of hope. This book teaches a very valuable lesson: to believe in yourself no matter what. If you want to read a book that grabs at your heart and wont let go then read Rocket Boys.p.s. it was much better than the movie \\"October Sky\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tells the tale of a dreamer & a bygone era of innocence-so??","review":"Although the reviews have been great I just couldn't get excited over Homer Hickam Jr.'s recap of his rocket-blasting days.

It was just too boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Lived Up to All I Had Heard","review":"I had been hearing about this book for about 3-4 years and for one reason or another did not believe it would hold my interest. Then, it was chosen as our book club selection last month. I was so surprised when I started reading it how it held my attention and I could actually picture the characters, the town, the grit of the mine and his relationships. I am so glad I read this book. It brought back all the imagery and excitement of the \\"Space Race\\", a period of time in which I grew up. I remember the Russians beating us in space and how the school system started demanding more math, science and telling the students that we couldn't let America down. It was a trip down memory lane I had long ago forgotten. Glad it came back to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"If you are someone who struggles with reading due to a learning disability then you probably struggle to read. I know I do. Well, this book goes down like a cold glass of water on a hot day. You can't stop. Mr. Hickam is an immensely talented author. This is a worthwhile read for almost any age. I read it when I was 33 and loved it. Books like this are rare do yourself a favor and read it. Very few books make time disappear and this is one of them. As a word of caution, The Coalwood Way, the sequel to October Sky/Rocket Boys, is not half as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and inspiring story","review":"As a school board member living 75 miles from Columbine High, I have been pondering the role of the media in the lives of youth today. This book and movie (I saw the movie first) are a great antidote and contrast to todays popular fare. It is sobering to realize that we have to go back over 40 years to find a story like this. The recreation of Coalwood was so vivid in the book that I could almost taste the coal dust. I rarely get this excited about a book or a movie, but this one is just wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I read this book for my English class as my Non- Fiction book. I picked it because my dad had read it and told me it was very good. After reading it, I realize how much of an understatement that is. This book is indescribably great! It is comparable in quality to all of the other books I read in English class such as Huckelberry Finn and Beloved. This is a must read for anyone from rocket builders to coal miners."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I was inspired to read this book when I saw the preview for the movie October Skies. This was an excellent book about a teenager with a dream who did not want to follow in his father's footsteps. A book about the dawn of the space age, unions, and growing up in the 1950s. This is the first time in a while, that I read over 300 pages in two days. I urge everybody to read this excellent book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old fashioned values in a cynical time","review":"I came to this book via the film and I enjoyed both immensely. I liked the honesty of the relationship with his father and the absolute need to take his own path. It is full of terrific stories and creates a tremendous picture of life in a Coal town, when a young man wants to break the mould of football hero and charts his own course as a rocket scientist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overcoming the Odds","review":"This reminded me why I became an aerospace engineer. Remembering the passions of youth and dreams comes alive in this book as you find yourself becoming one of the boys. Mr. Hickam does a masterful job a revealing what has driven man to take to the skies and reach for more. The problems of real life and the struggle to overcome should be an example to any youth brave enough to dream for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to joint BCMA","review":"It's a wonderful story about how a boy becomes a man and how he fights for his dreams in a miners town that has no future.I loved reading this book and it has a very special ending.

It really gives you an 'anything is possible' kind of feeling.Technically speaking the typeface is easy to read as well. I would highly recommend this book. You certainly won't be disappointed.Ryan Daniel[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is great. It is the story of the movie by the same name, but corrects the literary licence taken by the movie and gives insight into life in Coalwood, WV. I look forward to the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book For Everybody","review":"This book is a great book for anybody and everybody. The story Homer Hickam tells is both profound and entertaining. As your reading along you get so engrossed in the drama that you tend to forget it is a nonfiction story. Or rather it seems to be one of those great fiction stories that almost seem real. It is a great buy and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Buffs","review":"Good novel, but lengthy, to read for history buffs, as well as fans of the movie October Sky. A real piece of American lifeblood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Inspirational!","review":"Anyone you enjoyed the movie October Sky should definately read this book! This is the memoirs of Homer Hickman. It is a tale of the struggle of a boy growing up in a coal mining town in the 1950's and his dreams of becoming a rocket scientist and working for NASA.There are many differences between the movie and the book. Both are brilliant in their own right and form an inspiring message that a person can succeed at making his dreams come true regardless of the odds.One of the best books I have ever read! The fact that it is a true story adds evidence to the fact that truth will always be more compelling than fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coming-of-Age story","review":"I read this book in two days, barely able to put it down to finish grading my final exams. This powerful memoir about a young boy from West Virginia brought back some memories of my own childhood in rural Ohio. This book is much more than a book about the son of a West Virginia miner and his rockets. It's a book that speaks to the power of finding one's passion in life and pursuing it, even in the face of disaster and despair."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book of the year!","review":"I'm just in the middle of the book, but I've seen the movie. If you haven't seen the movie go rent it right away! I love it! The book seems very intelligent and well written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book","review":"Homer H. Hickman, Jr. knew what he wanted to do with his life: build and launch rockets. Homer realized his dream with his friends while he also had to fight his people and other people to keep his dream alive. Homer then became a rocket scientist after leaving his West Virginia home."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is prodigious","review":"I loved the movie, \\"October Sky.\\" However, the book goes into more depth than the movie. The relationship between Homer and his parents is far more interesting than the movie's depiction. The book and the movie had the space race, the coming-of-age theme, science fair competition, and young love. The book is written very well. The characters come alive. The book is prodigious, to use one of the character's favorite adjectives."},{"rating":"2","title":"October Sky is not a children's book","review":"As a teacher of this book in my high school English class, I think I should point out that October Sky (aka Rocket Boys) is not a children's book by any stretch of the imagination. Its themes include father-son relationships, teenage sexuality, and the manner in which dreams can be made into reality through tough, hard choices. Most 12-year old children are not equipped to really understand this book without adult advice. It is an excellent book for a parent to share with his child but the parent should read it first and be prepared to talk about some of the more difficult aspects of it. This book is very, very different than the feel-good Hollywood movie that was made from it. It is a magnificent text that should be respected as part of the genre that gave us To Kill A Mockingbird and, dare I say it, Huckleberry Finn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the movie, the book is even better!","review":"Homer Hickam paints a true and accurate picture of life in small town West Virginia better than anyone I have read prior. The movie takes some creative license with the story and characters. The book however fills in several gaps and gives the reader a less glamorized depiction of his life. Many of the characters (not in the movie) in his book were far more interesting and I'm glad I decided to read this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Middle-class Steinbeck?","review":"Homer Hickam captures both a time and a place, neither of which still exist, and does it with great sensitivity and humor reminiscent of Steinbeck in another era. Everyone who was a high-schooler in the late-50's \\"Sputnik era\\" will undoubtedly identify with the book's \\"Sputnik speech\\" and the era's expectations of and for its youth and the overall quest for achievement and excellence. Mr. Hickam has provided us a realistic, believable, and humorous glimpse into one of our country's finest hours. A rewarding and enjoyable reflection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story of personal triumph","review":"As a reviewer for the San Antonio Express-News, I got the advance copy of this book a few weeks ago. I put it aside in order to finish a few other projects. About a week ago, I picked it up before going to bed after a late evening, intending to read it until I fell asleep. At 7:30 the next morning, I closed the book after finishing it. Oh, I tried to put it down a few times, but I finally gave it up and decided to finish it. I enjoyed it immensely, although I think it could have been a little less pretentious in spots. It almost seemed like \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" in places. However, a very strong story very reminscent of Beverly Cleary's \\"Henry Huggins\\" stories. Should make an interesting movie, provided they concentrate on the personal triumphs and not try to turn it into a \\"90210\\" episode. A keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Rocket Boys/October sky, by Homer H. Hickam (jr), tells about the writer's life when he was a teenager. Set in the mountains of West Virginia, this best-selling book truly expresses what it is like to be traped.

The cover was torn, a corner was missing and it was written in. Very ugly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering","review":"A slow read, but rather charming. Definitely a memoir, not a novel. Would be fascinating to an engineer or rocket scientist -- less so for the average reader. I stopped reading several times, and had to drag myself back to it. Yet in the end, I'm glad I finished it. I think I'd like to read a \\"condensed\\" version of this book. It needs some tightening up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the name change?","review":"I just started the book and agree with the posititive responses. However, is anyone bothered by the fact that later editions of Rocket Boys have had a name change,to October Sky? From a literary point I find it disconcerting that a book's title has been changed in print to fit the movie title. Can anyone think of this happening before? I'd be curious what the author thinks. He does not strike me as the \\"anything for money\\" type.Movies based on books often have a different title than the book, ex. Prayer for Ownen Meany, but changing the book's title to fit the movie is bothersome to me- but then I tend to be a purest about a lot of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"To read & injoys","review":"The book is a good and fun book to read. I read this book then I watched the video and it was also great. The story and the video are easy and sometimes hard to understand what their saying or doing. My mom also enjoyed the book and she hopes that maybe she will get a chance to be able to see the video. I think to the fact that she had enjoyed the book and wants to really see the video so bad that see is looking in stores to be able to see the video that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book from a wonderful friend!","review":"Homer Hickham has done a wonderful thing. He has captured the essence of post-war America and condensed it into a wonderous, and factual tale about his childhood. A REAL story needed to be told, and he has done without question. I firmly believe that Homer Hickham has set a new standard for authors to live up to. I feel honored to know Homer as an author and most importantly as a friend. I suggest this book to everyone looking for a truly moving experience, as it evokes emotions, thoughts and feelings that transcend age and educational boundries! Homer Hickam, I applaud you! Thanks for everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreams Beyond The Coal Mines... A Must Read!","review":"As a decendent of a Big Creek H.S.

He suggested that I read it, knowing that I like this sort of book.. and wow! I loved it. Whomever only saw the movie is missing out on a lot.. and I suggest that they read this book asap. The movie was definatly not as good as the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coal Miners' Look at the Stars","review":"Enjoyed the book, a gift, much more than I thought I would. The story of the boys perseverance was inspirational to be sure - with all the pizzazz that goes with 'rocket science'. But most of all I enjoyed the detailed description of life in a coal mining town - a company town - where the mine, store, homes and meeting hall were all owned by the company that employed all the inhabitants. And just as inspirational as the boys success was the help and encouragement of the teachers and miner/neighbors who cheered and aided their success with the goal of sending them on to a life where they wouldn't need to work in the mines. The movie, incidentally, took fictional liberties with the story to the point of distraction. Nothing compares with the inspiration of this story made more exciting because it's true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly all good.","review":"I would definitely rate the book 5 stars, except in my eyes it has some not too good morals. It is a very magnetic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Telling It Like It Was!","review":"I may not know a rocket nozzle from a water hose nozzle but I do know Appalachian coal mining camps. I grew up in one in Kentucky the same years Mr. Hickman was firing his rockets in Coalwood, WVA. He knows his miners, his town and his mountains. Coal mining camps were pretty much the same, no matter the state. I recognized the people in his book as people I knew in Lynch, (Harlan County) Kentucky --- only the names had changed. We also had company homes, high school football, The Big Store, unforgettable teachers, mine disasters and moonshine --- but we never had the BCMA and we never had a Homer Hickman. Thank goodness Coalwood did have him because his book is a treasure that takes off like the rockets. If you come from the same background as I do, take a few free hours, grab a comfortable chair and plan to read it in one sitting because you really can't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PRODIGIOUS MAN, PRODIGIOUS","review":"I grew up in Coalwood, West Virginia and remember when Sonny Hickam was launching his Rockets.

The relationships are interesting and sometimes surprising. It is amazing what these boys accomplished not only with their rockets but in bringing a community together"},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming and inspiring story!","review":"This endearing memoir of a NASA engineer recalls life in Coalwood, a small West Virginia coal mining town, during the author's high school years of the late 1950's. It captures the essence of youth complete with sibling rivalry, mischief, and the quest for knowledge of how things work--the hallmark of young boys. In addition, the description of Coalwood brings to life the meaning of growing up in a small mining town--its sights, smells, and sounds. It teaches adults a great lesson--that of guiding youth to follow their passions and of encouraging them along the way. Its message is for the average guy--not the most popular or wealthy one--suggesting that ideas can be the key to the path of success in life. This is especially wonderful reading for any high school student with unconventional ideas or for any teacher who hopes to make a difference in a student's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great book","review":"This book was great, I could not put it down untill I was done. I learned a lot about how rockets work and most of all what it was like to live in a coal mining town.

I appreciate Mr. Hickam sharing his story in this memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh is this a good book.","review":"I read a lot of books. Only once in a great while does one come along that ensnares my mind and moves me this much.

This book was like a cold war version of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Having grown up with the space program, although not to the extent the author has, I relived each and every mission from Gemini and Apollo, bought all the models, read every article, and was glued to the television for every adventure. Homer Hickam has captured his youth in words that have played movies in my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasing addition to the sense of Design","review":"A very comprehensive book full of pictures of everything it covers.

I rented this film on a whim (saw it on the shelf having never heard of it and thought, \\"Why not?\\"). It was a very pleasant surprise, alternately funny and sad, always touching.

He was really surprised to see that I found some of our old favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids are happy!","review":"My husband told my kids about the Ernest movies and how we watched them when we were kids and my kids love them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Ernest!","review":"Such excellent movies.

I have only watched \\"Ernest Goes to Camp\\" so far, but I know the rest will be similar and just as funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"So, after spending 2 days trying to track down a DVD player to watch this on, I was COMPLETELY satisfied with these excellent films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ernest Movies","review":"All three of these movies were enjoyable to me and my grandson who I watched them with. He is five years old. He has wanted to watch them repeatedly since the first time. I like Ernest Scared Stupid the best out of all the Ernest movies I've seen. He likes Ernest goes to jail the best. I recommend these fun-loving movies to anyone with a sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ernest Triple Feature","review":"I don't know how shopping from home could get any better than this.Three movies for the price of one.Thank You Amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book So Good You Don't Want It to End","review":"Shapiro's a good writer, and he's able to spell out the implications of all the on-stage and backstage action at this weird Bavarian once-every-ten-years affair. From now on I am giving Obergammerau a wide berth in my travels. I'd rate the book even higher if it didn't feel overly rushed to me, written at white heat in the immediate aftermath of the 2000 Passion Play, so it has the slapdash end of one of those tabloid-isnpired true crime books that hit the supermarket racks a day after the crime takes place. Dr. Shapiro, you are brilliant at analysis, so next time out why not give a little more time for your thoughts to gel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the problem?","review":"I started this book but found it had nothing serious to say. It's more like a trip through the author's troubled expectations and mind. It was pleasant to read something about the famous Passion Play though, if only a weak hatchet job. Put it back on the store shelf"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Trouble is...what?","review":"I'm a little concerned about Shapiro's grasp of the primary source material. Oberammergau is a place where Catholics put on a play about events re-enacted from an exclusively Christian memoir. There are the good guys, that'd be Jesus and His crew, and then there are the bad guys, that'd be the Romans and the Jews, only not the Jews who're Jesus and His crew, some other ones. See. It's a story. They are acting out a story. Perhaps someone needs to write the story in reverse. If it makes a better story we'll probably all be able to look forward to a better play."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was tight","review":"I thought it was worth listening to than some of that other crap. But I think It could have been better. What I really thinks is that Silkks was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What what??????????","review":"Yo, did y'all who wrote in get a different CD than me?? This was by far one of the most whack NL CD's that I've heard! 5 stars??? The beats all sounded the same and Fiend couldn't hold his own amongst the other souljas. I was totally stoked on buyin this. I'm glad I didn't. I borrowed it off my homie and he's ready to put tha smack down at the store he bought it from cuz he cant take the shhhh back. 5 stars??? I was the biggest Fiend fan out there until this wiggidy whack bull came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't do business with this seller again.","review":"Poor customer service. Emailed the seller at least 3x to check on whether or not it had shipped, and was never told a thing. Never got the product and order was never fulfilled. Disappointing experience and will be taking my business elsewhere from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiend is the best.","review":"No Limit is one of the hottest recording labels there is and keeps putting out quality records that the public loves. With Fiend they have another artist that can really get a crowd on their feet. This CD is a great idea for any rap fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best No Limit release","review":"Easily the best of all the No Limit releases, probably the best rap album of '98! A must have for anybody who even mildly likes rap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiend is great but not this time","review":"come on all the people that gave this cd 5 or 4 stars what were you thinkin some songs were ok the only song that i can listen to a lot is the baddest don't get me wrong Fiend is great but this album is wack peace out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst No Limit","review":"Fiend is a dope MC, but this is one of the worst CDs to come out on No Limit. This is when they started to fall off. Most of the beats on this album SUCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the wait","review":"This album is trully off the hook. This a very sick album another no limit hit album. I been waiting for time to get this album because i could'nt find it anywhere. seriously a good addition to one's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD EVER!","review":"The 1st time I listened to this cd I was amazed by it. Fiend can rap to any beat layed down in front of him. He can even sing (These Streets Ain't Safe). This is by far the best cd I own. It's an all around great cd w/appearances by NL's best. If you don't have it go get it NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the realist artist since 2 pac","review":"fiend is the rawest artist on the label. he has the realist lyrics out right about now. his scroggley voice gives you that getto feeling. i listned to his new album and it gives the same getto feel as the first. anytime you get at least 5 tight cuts on a album its cool but both of his got about 8 + . so any fiend album you get can just about bet your life your getting a hell of a bargin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect too much from this book.","review":"As a former youth and children's minister I expected so much more from this book. For the price, it was considerably weak and felt down right cheesy at times. The pre-teen age years are formidable years to begin to develop your kids beyond the, \\"bible story\\" based curriculum we see in so many Sunday school classes. This is the time to start teaching the deeper biblical truths that will form a lasting foundation throughout their teen years and beyond. Include the fact that these years may be the last time your kids hear you for about six years and you have a perfect storm of teach ability as well as understanding.Don't waste your money on this book. We have just started to sit down and are reading through the gospel with our kids. This goes way further than and pre packaged devotional ever will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tides is an Inventive and Intriguing novel!","review":"I've never read this author before, but the excellent cover art caught my attention here at Amazon.com. Also the synopsis sounded different, so I gave it a try.And mostly, it was a success. Tides is a nice mix of sci-fi and fantasy, blending very well here in a saga of first discovery. I liked the hoppers, an evil alien species that were a delight to read about. Scott MacKay's world-building and character development are impressive here. The writer did a solid job of throwing me into the story automatically.I love novels of the sea. And when you toss in alien creatures and create a novel well with sci-fi and fantasy almost seamlessly, then I'm there. If you like well written adventure novels with a blending of both genres, then this one is definately for you.I look forward to reading another MacKay novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A golden mythical land comes to life, where truth rules","review":"Scott MacKay's TIDES tells of a golden land of myth and fantasy which is taught to kids in Paras as a nursery rhyme and accepted by adults as a real world. But a court scientist's discovery challenges a world where truth is a way of life, and sets off a journey of adventure where a mariner's adventure may change his world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both good and bad.","review":"While \\"Tides\\", by Scott Mackay was an intriguing book, I was surprised by the simplicity of the writing. It seemed the author kept repeating the same phrases, for example writing the phrase \\"cache of weapons\\" twice in the same paragraph. I also found it a bit amazing that Hab, the main character, invented submersible ships and handguns, circumnavigated the globe, AND created a democracy from a former monarchy.But, \\"Tides\\" was suspenseful and presented interesting ideas. Finding a balance between all truth and all lies seems relevant to our own world today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon YUK!","review":"The Leapin' Lemon Cookies taste bland.

The box and material it was shipped in looked like they would hold fairly well so Idk what happened. I've already ordered new ones but as I said I was just a little bit disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A teaching tool for counting from 1-15, 20,30,40...100.","review":"I liked this book for various reasons. First, I thought it was neat for representing numbers through numerals, words, and dots. It also incorporated street scenes and common objects for the reader to see a certain number of objects in an everyday situation. I also liked how the cover and some pictures showed children of different races together. The only thing negative comment I have is that the pictures are black and white and not as attractive as more current books. I think the book is appropriate and a great way to practice counting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book.","review":"Haldeman is quickly becoming one of my favorite science fiction authors. This collection of short stories will make you want to burn a sick-day just to be able to stay home and finish it.I feel I can forgive him for writing Forever Peace now. :)Haldeman has the nack for describing a lot with very few words; something I wish more authors would do."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the last Samurai","review":"Master Hirokazu Kanazawa 10th Dan, Shotokan Karate-Do International Federation is (with the addition of a very few) one of the last Samurai.This excellent DVD combines a revealing and open interview with Master Kanazawa, along with footage of him teaching classes, demonstrating various types of Kumite from the Shotokan Karate-Do International Federation syllabus, Tekki 3 and Nijushiho katas. It also includes some VERY rare footage of Master Kanazawa practicing some Tai-Chi forms; an art of which he is also a Master of.Master Kanazawa's humility and dedication to Karate-Do is evident in this excellent DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-built - - - POORLY designed","review":"I would give this 5 stars if you could actually use it and the Sansa together.

Order them from the manufacturer. We ordered for a homeschool program and found pieces missing in several. Of course, Amazon only gives you a finite amount of time to return and the box does not contain a master list of inclusions when you get it, only an experiment by experiment list. You literally have to open EVERYTHING and read through the entire instructions on on ALL three experiments kits' which contain approximately 5-6 experiments each in order to know if you have everything. Bottom line, don't order from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Faith\\" releases true spiritual experience","review":"Jason Upton's \\"Faith\\" is a diverse collection of worship music. From quiet accoustic sounds to full-orchestra, the intimacy of a man communing with the lover of his soul communicates through heart-felt lyrics, delivered with a passion which cannot be synthetic. Inspiring, intoxicating, even vindicating to those of the spirit-filled persuasion, Upton's CD \\"Faith \\" is his finest among an impressive stable of worship music releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This is one of my favorite albums of all time!I work at a Christian crisis pregnancy center where the Executive Director and staff walk by faith. After playing several of the songs during our staff prayer time many others wanted to purchase a copy of it.It has been a great blessing to all and God is using it powerfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Music","review":"This CD has passion written all over it. Jason did'nt write this alone, he was obediant to the Holy Spirit and used his God given talent to the fullest. You will hear the evidence of my previous statement yourself after listening to it. His wife also adds dimension by singing backup vocals. She has a great voice.I also highly recommend \\"Open up the Earth.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid opinions from an expert","review":"Movie reviews are a subjective business. When looking for a night's entertainment it is not unsafe to give a little less weight to a professional reviewer. When a person spends all their time seeing movies something ordinary and pleasant may not rank.When evaluating the greatest of movies however a professional reviewer is the person to read (for basically the same reasons) and Roger Ebert is the professional reviewer most familiar to most Americans.His judgments in THE GREAT MOVIES II are honest, insightful and unforgiving not only of the material but of himself (read the review of THE BIRTH OF A NATION to see what I mean.)From THE PRODUCERS, THE LEOPARD , INDIANA JONES , to MY DINNER WITH ANDRE and more his insight fills the volume confirming what you may know about some movies and informing you on other gems you likely never heard of.I enjoyed this book, I don't know if I'd buy it as my own. If movies are your thing, I'd say yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy","review":"As a die-hard fan of the classic film \\"Jaws,\\" I was pleasantly surprised to see Ebert's take on it in this volume. I realize at the outset that what I'm about to say is nit-picking, but here goes.First off, the quote from Roy Scheider's character Brody is, \\"YOU'RE gonna need a bigger boat,\\" rather than \\"We're\\" as is listed here.Secondly, whoever did the proofreading for this book needs to have their head examined. Ebert quotes Richard Dreyfus' character Hooper as saying -\\"I pulled a tooth the size of a shot glass out of the rectal of a boat out there, and it was the tooth of a Great White.\\"Not WRECKED HULL.Sloppy editing. I tossed the book after reading this. Have no use for someone who doesn't respect cinema enough to have somebody proofread his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"why would one see or not see a movie based upon one man's advice","review":"roger ebert has his own individual tastes and I respect that. I have my my own tastes too. Ebert thought \\"the pillow book\\" was a great film. He didn't like reservoir dogs. Don't adhere to this guy's recommendations. Anyone who does should read a story called the emporor's new clothes and reflect on the moral."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise.","review":"I've been watching Roger Ebert on TV for years and occasionally read his column. I always thought he had his critical head screwed on straight (when it came to American movies in particular -- he's not seduced by the Literary or someone's notion of High Culture) even when I disagreed about this or that movie. However, I never thought of him as anything other than capable, before I read his two books on The Great Movies. Ebert writes beautifully and, for me, re-awakens my experience of the movies he talks about. He clearly knows a lot about film vocabulary (far more than I do) and has read widely beyond his chosen field. These essays, one after another, have knocked me over. In the cases of movies I haven't seen, I now have GOT to see them.I'm putting these next to my Bazins, Agee, and Kaels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I've been watching Roger Ebert on TV for years and occasionally read his column.
