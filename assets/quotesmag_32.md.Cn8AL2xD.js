The lay out makes it easy to use because it is devided into ages.

I found it to be overwhelming to sort out the stuff I wanted from the stuff I didn't want. I found it difficult to really look at this book because there was just so much on each page.Everyone tells me I have an analytical mind and maybe that is my problem. I would have appreciated having a more clean layout- rather than just a jumble of ideas for each age.However, if you have no ideas for dealing with children, this is the book to have.

The amount of detail brings to mind IN COLD BLOOD and THE ULTIMATE EVIL.

I just luckily came upon it in a used book store and thought I would try it out. John Wayne Gacy was one sick, twisted individual. My only complaint was the fact that he wouldnt admit to any recollection of the murders. Complete BS if you ask me. How can you forget the killing of 33 people? He only can recall 5 in bits and pieces. It would have been a better book if Gracy didnt have amnesia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buried Dreams","review":"This book gives the reader a terrifying glimpse into the mind of Gacy. One can't help but wonder just how successful he could have been based it not been for the monster that lived inside of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating read","review":"The way this book is written, using John Wayne Gacy's own words and multiple lies in a conversational form, gets to be both tedious and irritating. I've read over 200 books in this true crime genre and this is only about the third one that I've set aside before I finished it.No doubt Gacy was an interesting character and the book, as much of it I read which was about half, does make that point quite well. But listening to his lies being repeated endlessly (Gacy was a real talker) is disruptive to not only the inner ear but also to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buried Dreams","review":"Is an excellent read. I have read many books on John Gacy. I find that this one goes more into detail of what John Gacy actually felt about his crimes and the manipulation games he played with the police and society in general. It is well written and proceeds in a logical sequence. Although very sad to read about the \\"crime time\\" it does not continously dwell on it, more so on Gacy himself.

I had been looking for a reasonably priced scope for my Ruger 10-22. I own several high power rifles that I have equipped with expensive optics from Leupold, Nikon, and Bushnell. I just couldn't justify spending that kind of money for a plinker gun. After looking at reviews from multiple sources I settled on this scope. The lens is very clear and I like the quick target acquisition feature. I couldn't use the rings that came with it as I needed 1 inch high see-thru rings in order to be able to use the iron sights. Sure this will not compete with a Leupold. But if you need a nice scope for a gun that is only capabable of shooting accurately up to 150 yards and you don't want to pay an additional $120, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reticule broke within 2 months","review":"Read all of the good reviews and liked the scope initially. Seemed like a good value for an inexpensive scope. It was mounted on a Marlin 795 22 but while shooting the bottom reticule broke. Not sure how that could be since I thought they were etched into the glass, but the bottom line is now significantly shifted to the right. It will cost me about half the price of a new one to get it fixed or replaced by Simmons. Too late to send it back to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely clear site picture","review":"Excellent scope, very clear site picture, love the QTA quick target acquisition eyepiece!

There is a focus ring for getting the sharpest view, and it requires adjustment when you go from 3 to 9 power, like most variable power scopes. Sighting it in is precise and requires no tools.The rings that come with it are for a 3/8 inch rail. My 10-22 came with an oddball rail which had a 1 inch groove and something bigger that 3/8, so I bought 1-inch low profile rings and it fits fine. In a pinch I think you you could use this on a high-power rifle since it has a 1 inch tube. The ring that adjusts power is a little stiff but it is still new.I have not seen a scope this good for anywhere near the price I paid for this on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This is a great match for my 10/22.

Nice scope but not what your ad says your selling ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy scope","review":"Mounted this on my Ruger 1022. Using a bench rest, and fore and rear rests, sighting in at 50 yrds, this thing cannot hold a zero. The adjustment turrets have a lot of slop, you can make click adjustments...nothing happens. Then they catch and jump your allignment too far. It was a frustrating act of futility to zero this. I finaly got it close, and settled in to see what kind of groups I could get, and after a few shots the damn thing would start jumping my shots around. A 3\\" group at 50 yrds was the best I could manage. Lest you think I was maybe the problem, I hold a NRA Distinguished Expert Badge for 50 ft smallbore. Also was awarded Master Gunner In the Army where I was a marksmanship instructor. I DO know how to shoot. And a nickle group at 50yrds should be childs play with a 3-9 scope. Very disgusted with this purchase. Spend a little more for a Nikon and save yourself the aggravation. Hell, I bet a Barska would do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO stars","review":"After just over 100 rounds of standard velocity .22LR (Ruger 10/22 carbine), the reticle started to rotate while the scope was firmly mounted in the rings. I mounted it as soon as it arrived and then went on vacation, so I was just past the Amazon return window when I discovered the flaw. The scope did come with standard rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scope, crappy mounts.","review":"Pretty much what the title says. The scope is great, excellent value there. The mounts that it comes with however are junky. They look kind of shoddy to begin with, then when I mounted them to my rifle, I noticed that the scope was visibly off parallel to the gun, by a good 5 degrees. So I look closer, and the two loose pieces of the dovetail mount are machined differently. So when I tighten them down, it puts a twist on the scope. I highly recommend the scope, but do yourself a favor and pick up a set of decent mounts to go along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, inexpensive, rimfire scope.","review":"I rescued a 40 year old, basket-case, Remington Nylon 66 from the trash heap. Cleaned it up, tweaked the internals then hung this scope on it. It shoots and looks as good as new now. This scope works fine from 3x to 6x but gets less clear at higher zoom levels.

I didn't use the rings that came with it because the rings that were on my air rifle had ring stops that fit the rifle already so the scope would not slip backwards. It took me about 30 minutes to sight the scope in and I was shooting 1 inch groups at 50 feet. Even my 9 year old daughter who could barely pick up the air rifle shot the plastic water bottle 5 out of 6 times at 50 feet. Bottom line is the results were better than expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to see through","review":"Based on the reviews i bought this but i find myself constantly adjusting my eye to see through this scope properly.If my eye is not centered just right i cant see anything .I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice at any price","review":"The scope is one of the most economical on the market, but it came right on time, with everything needed to mount it. It mounted easily on a Winchester 94-22XTR, with no special bore sighting equipment. The first group was within 2-3 inches of target center at 25 yards. After windage & elevation adjustment the next was nearly on. After 2 more groups of 5 rounds each with slight adjustment between groups, it is right on. The optics are extremely clear (I've only shot in full daylight). The scope outperforms the accuracy of the rifle, and my ability by far. Great scope for a 22 regardless of price."},{"rating":"1","title":"fair scope","review":"Got scope in june. Have about 2500 rounds down range. Sighted in fine and holds zero on my 10 22 ruger (.22lr). Lately I have noticed one of the crosshairs is falling off recticle. No big deal is the vertical axis. My only big gripe is the + / - focus on the eyepiece keeps changing so you have to reset it every mag or 2 (i.e. 10 -20 rounds). More of an annoyance than anything. Note it is a cheap scope with fairly clear lenses. 2 stars for these reasons 1) failing crosshairs, 2)pain in my a** eyepiece magnifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"This review is based on only short time use. The time is short because after mounting and zeroing on a Ruger 10/22, the reticle rotated inside the scope after a short period. This was a defective scope. Seeing that there is another reviewer who received a defective scope, it might be wise to purchase from a source that offers easy exchange or return (like Amazon).From my short experience, I would say the optical clarity is sufficient for a 22 rifle. Not super crisp, but fine for plinking with a 22. Changing the power requires refocusing. At 9X I had the focus fully backed out at 25 yards. One can focus at closer distances at lower power. Obviously, I can't comment on how well it holds a zero.It comes with a set of budget rings for mounting to a 3/8-inch mount that is used on some air guns and 22 rifles. You'll need to supply rings if you want to mount to a Weaver or Picatinny style rail."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This is the first Simmons scope I have ever ordered. It seemed like it would be ideal for my new full-stocked Ruger 10-22, however, I could not get it to adjust correctly with my laser bore sighter. I gave up on it and replaced it with a $20.00 Barska Colorado 3x9x40 which adjusted perfectly and had clearer optics. I bought another 10-22 as a gift and tried the Simmons again and with quite a bit of effort was able to get it boresighted. The adjustment is very \\"mushy\\" and is tough to set. Time will tell whether it will actually work. Conclusion: No more Simmons scopes for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Description Wrong - not AO","review":"For anyone looking for a scope with an Adjustable Objective (AO), this is not it. The description says this scope is AO and the parallax is adjustable on this model but it's wrong.The AO model with adjustable parallax is Simmons Part #511072, this is Simmons Part #511039. I ordered this scope a couple of days ago and had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Good LOOKING scope, clear optics, but has obvious parallax issues. Mine came without rings, but I called the company and they shipped a set of rings at no charge. I mounted the scope on a 9422M and got 4\\" groups at 50 yards. Thinking it might be the gun, I borrowed a friends scope, also a Simmons 3x9x32, and got similar results. I took the scope off and and shot the gun with the open sights and got a 1\\" group at 50 yards. These scopes would not hold their zero. Take this 50 yard group for example: 2 shots hit 1.5\\" high and 3/4\\" apart, 2 shots 2.5\\" high and 2\\" right, 1\\" apart, followed by one shot 4\\" left at 9:00. This is using a leadsled! There was no consistency between shots.I would exercise the warranty, but it will cost $20 to get a new scope. After trying two of these already, I don't want to sink any more money into a boat anchor. I won't buy another Simmons scope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"The bottom line on this scope it that, it may be well enough made, but the windage adjustment does not work. I give it one star but it does not even rate that. I live in an area where it's not easy to find a place to shoot but the work I've done with this scope so far and after about 50 rounds expended, the windage adjustment does not work. There was a great review in Gun Tests magazine for this product and that is why I bought it for my recently purchased Ruger 10/22. Guess I must have gotten a lemon.

I *have* noticed some unpleasant vibrations or undertones or something that occur when the middle F (in particular) is played in chords. While it's harsh/loud enough to bother me somewhat, it may well be masked in any sort of ensemble. And again, for the price, I'm not complaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatally Out of Tune","review":"I read other reviews and knew that the tuning might be an issue but was surprised at how out of tune it really is.

We were attacked by Islamo-Fascists who have a stated goal to destroy western civilization. Unlike WWII and the Nazis, they do not align themselves with a nation, do not wear a uniform, and do not follow the established rules of war. Instead of sitting around staring at our navels and wondering about how the founding fathers might have responded, George W. Bush responded to the attack on our shores with the right measure of response and has demonstrated real leadership when it is most needed. Typical of liberals, most focus on his speaking abilities (which are not any better or worse than Clinton's) and his overall demeanor as opposed to the real issues.

Miller's brilliant novel deals with a couple who go through the hippie scene together, starting in middle America and ending up in Woodstock and San Francisco. It follows the turbulent events that culminate in the campus turmoil that led to four student deaths at Kent State.

This one's an excellent addition to the series, with some real progress in the April/Mike relationship, and a wonderful twist to help make Skinny Dragon at least a little accepting of it. Very interesting to see how the characters' extensive varieties of cultural differences and ways of thought contribute to this plot. This should have a warning label that it is not to be read the night before your wedding! The book is very intense and suspenseful; if you enjoyed the other April Woo books, you won' t be disappointed with this one, and will be glad to know another is on its way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God, April Woo is back!!!!","review":"As a die-hard April Woo fan I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on 'The Silent Bride', and as usual I wasn't disappointed. Leslie Glass does a superb job of taking the reader inside the expensive world of society weddings, while simultaneously showing the dark, gritty, side of the work necessary to pull off these types of events.When the story opens April quickly gets caught up in an investigation of a bride murdered at the altar of her wedding day, she also has to deal with being a member of her sister-cousin's wedding party. And of course her relationship with Mike Sanchez is rapidly heading toward matrimony. When a second wealthy bride is murdered outside her church, April has to put her personal problems aside and solve the case before her sister-cousin's wedding. All in all this is a very good book, I even thought the villian's motive for murder was beliveable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proofreaders, where are you?","review":"The April Woo series has become a favorite of mine, but The kindle version of The Silent Bride is so filled with typographical errors that it becomes difficult to follow the story line.

The case is flimsy, so if you are going to have it on you while you low crawl and/or combat roll, it will break. Having the mirror is nice but it does not stay in place and gets messed up in paint.Now the most important part: paint itself is easy to apply and provides decent coverage, however it is extremely vulnerable to water and you can wipe it off with your hand. If you plan on actually using it as a camouflage you will have to reapply it every couple hours, because it literally drops from your face with sweat. Also if your face is already sweaty it's much harder to apply it. And if you put the gas mask on, you can say bye-bye to your face paint.Overall, it is useless as a camouflage, but it might be good for kids - easy to apply and clean, 4 colors let you make some cool schemes and it should last for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good face paint","review":"Nice and compact with the mirror.

After reading this book, (MY Potty Activity Book by Tracy Foote)I was impressed by all the information and activities packed within the 63 pages. Each activity is useful in familiarizing toddlers with the \\"potty learning\\" basics. The perforated pages allow for easy removal after completing the activities. Included is a wonderful reference section utilizing 45 ideas to help you transition your child from diapers to \\"big pants\\".

When I popped this movie into the VCR and actually saw it, it was alright for a few minutes. Who can't like the 'I've Had better' part? Unfortunately, the movie doesn't know what it wants to be...a comedy or a family film? So the rest of the film is just a long running gag with Jim's off-the-wall shenanigans. Jim Carrey is way too cartoonish to be considered heartwarming. The film might have worked if Jim's character showed a little emotion, but he's too much of a jerk to really root for. If you are looking for a funny, charming comedy that you can let your kids watch, get Mrs. Doubtfire...and if you're a Carrey fan, stick with Ace Ventura."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premise of movie is a lie.","review":"The idea of a pathological liar having to tell the truth for 24 hours is okay.

In any case, what they missed when a nicely set-up law-type movie with no spectacular courtroom drama (c'mon it's Jim Carrey man!) but a great all around performance of the whole \\"I feel guilty, I've been wrong, I'm gonna change\\" type deal.

Still, this movie was entertaining, and it's very funny. The way he told the other characters in the film what he thought of them was truly hilarious.

This is not reality, but this movie seems to encourage and advocate that even if you live a life of lies, you can make it in this world and everything will be hunky-dory. The fact that Jim Carrey basically destroyed his son's life but then makes everything up to him at the end when he finally keeps his word with him is hardly worth believing. And then, that he is able to get back with his wife in the end, after sleeping with numberous other women, and blatantly degrading her as a human, was to me, the funniest part of the flick. I found myself laughing not at the humor, but at the cold reality of how cruel and corrupt this world can be.

Sacred Science is a guide to the metaphysical world harnessed by the pharaoh. One will quickly agree with the well recorded research and analysis expertly layed out in this work. This book casts shadows on other books released about Egyptain Theocracy. This book traces the origin of Heliocentricity much farther back then Capernicus and sites the Pythagorian understanding behind the Cathlic \\"Heretics\\" of the middle ages. And consequently traces Pythagoros back to his roots, his training by the priests of the temples in Egypt for 15 years!

The Orphan, by Mary Dorcey, is without a doubt the most disturbing thing that I have ever read, and I wept while reading it. Is it possible that such evil could exist? Is it possible that this story is based on fact? This book made me definitely want to read more by these authors, most of whome were unfamiliar to me (with the exception of Maeve Binchy and Mary Gordon).

The Camden County Bookcase with Doors Planked Cherry Finish is a great product. I was surprised that the doors actually worked well when the unit was assembled because so often products like this in this price range end up with the doors misaligned or off kilter when assembled. The unit is sturdy enough for books, a boombox and the doors hide the messiness that cassette tapes, CDs, DVD's, etc. become when they are stored and fall over, or kids go through them and leave them in a clutter. This saves because I did not have to purchase separate storage units for these items. The product was as advertised by the seller.

We filled it with pictures of mom and dad, 2 sets of grandparents, and all the cousins with their families (there are only 6 slots for pics, but we took pictures of entire families - so we have 20 people in all). She loves pointing to the pictures and identifying various people. The pages are made out of thin plastic material and filled with foam, so are pretty soft, but still durable.

Overall it is a good product, but putting songs on the memeory stick was a huge hassle with Sony's check in/check out program. I finally found out how to attach it as a drive to my computer and then you can just copy songs very easily. One month after I purchased this product, Sony came out with two new Clie's, though they seem to be priced to high, I felt cheated. I would recommend getting a Palm m515. First I like the idea of media cards where you can upload a map or whater you want. Also, most other accesories are geared towards a Palm product. I wanted to get a cheap GPS add-on for the Clie and it doesn't exist. Altough I have seen one for a Palm. Once again, I feel cheated out of a cool feature. I think I will sell it on Ebay and get a m515."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it, Could not find accessories for it, Returned it!","review":"I bought this handheld after seeing its impressive screen. I tried to find accessories for it (like a case without messy velcro) and could not find anything.

I found myself wishing that I stayed with the Palm pilots (every where I went they had TONS of neat accessories to pick from). I returned the clie and bought a Palm M505 and now I am happy. I have been able to find everything that I want and need to have (plus some other extra goodies).

However, this is not what I would consider a helpful identification book. Many of the photos are close-ups of just the flowers which gives no sense of scale. The close-ups also mean that the leaves/vegetative parts of the plant remain a mystery. The text is kept to a minimum for each species. There is plenty of room on the page for more information, but the authors have left that space for the reader to make notes. The information that is provided is very sketchy in terms of habitat, identifying characteristics, and so on. Obviously a book of this size can't have everything, so the authors have sacrificed information in favor of visual stimulus. So enjoy the nice color photos, but don't expect to get much more out of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"dont let his live performance turn you away","review":"i saw Pigeon John with Jedi and Living Legends and i hated him. i thought he was funny, but all he did was tell the crowd to put there hands up or do something. he definitly has charisma, but his live act needed alot more lyrics instead of hooks. i picked this up because i saw it at Best Buy and had to check it out, it was alot better than i thought it would be. tracks like \\"Nothing Without You\\" make it worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall","review":"CD was in new condition as advertised.

There is very little explanation about each phrase...just a short paragraph before each one. The phrases are intermediate to advanced. A beginner would be very frustrated. Fast phrases are played in both fast and slow speeds...medium and slow phrases are just played once. If you are already technically proficient, this is a good book. It does have nice phrases that will expand your repertoire. The phrases are called \\"ideas\\" and each uses a different technique. So it gets you to branch out.

The difference, of course, is that we are still unsure about Queeg at the end of Caine, but we know who Patch is by the end of Deare.It's an action movie... not necessarily high art, but entertaining and well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"A disappointing movie based on a pretty good book: a suspense yarn about an abandoned freighter. The book had some suspense, murder, insurance fraud, a down-on-their-luck 2 man salvage company, and an awkward love interest. Unfortunately, in turning the book into a movie the script writers jettisoned everything but the murder/insurance fraud part. The story's gutting leaves way too little to keep viewers interested. Gary Cooper's one millionth wooden, one-dimensional performance kills the story, which would have been better being told in flashback in order to keep viewers interested (ala \\"Breaker Morant\\"). Instead, the too-slim plot is unveiled too quickly and without any suspense. Terrible! What a wasted effort by Charleton Heston and a young Richard Harris. Don't bother seeing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man of mistery","review":"This is really an excellent movie, one of the last great characters played by Gary Cooper, opposite to Charlton Heston.It is amazing to notice how Gary Cooper, towards the end of his movie career was rather involved in very dark and unsympathetic roles like Patch, or Dr Frail in \\" The hanging tree \\", not to mention his final film \\" The naked edge \\" but as he was a great actor, of course, he could play anything.

Again, the viewer is referred to the manual.- the video is rather short and is lacking in essential detail.I gave this video two (2) stars because it does show you how to use the built-in simulator mode fairly well and, during the brief video, they associate the buttons you need to push and the screens you will see with the instructions.

The book felt stilted and lacked the sense of adventure that Foster'sbooks have had in the past. The story was well written, and the situation was plausible and clearly thought out, but I never found myself caring about the people in the book.

The best part was, I didn't have to bundle the baby up in so many garments to travel from indoors to outdoors, and the bundle me doesn't fall off or flap open like blankets would.Unlike some of the other reviewers, we had no problems with the zippers or with the size.

My son is only 4 months old and we already have to get him another bundle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this product","review":"I have the original winter-weight Bundle-me and love it. That's why I bought the summer weight version. What a mistake! The summer-weight version bears no comparison to the original. First, the zipper doesn't unzip from the bottom like the original one does. That means you can't have the bottom open which means your baby always has his/her feet enclosed! This is a problem on warm days, or if your baby is long and feet need to stick out! The material is that of a flannel-lined windbreaker -- ok, but it slides all over the place and is not comfy for the baby. Finally, it's so much smaller than the original! Our baby (6 mos) still fits in the original one, but is already too long for the summer one! What gives?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saavy decorating","review":"This is a great book above any other.

He's a superb actor but altogether too masculine to be convincing in any way to the audience. Again, I realize that it was necessary (i.e., only a person who thought of the East as \\"effeminate\\" could have fallen for that \\"pretty face\\"), but perhaps a little help for the audience would have been nice.

What the Director wants to show is that he is doing a very \\"new angle\\" that history has missed out, and you don't get that unless you watch them very carefully of how each of the most talented individual in their own rights is adding a very subtle \\"new edge\\" about the true story that has happened in the past.

Inverting the premises of this chain of supplementation seems to be the point of the film. Its ambivalence in relation to the colonial discourse is contingent on the promise, and the threat, contained in the letter M: a reference implying Western reference to gender, yet ultimately betraying any claim to the existence of epistemological grounds to understanding gender. Inverting the positions of the subject, and the object, of the colonial discourse, profoundly questioning the relation between race and sex, the drama still maintains its traditional end, but adds a non-traditional twist to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Create for Professional Home Designer","review":"Chief Architect is designed for the professional user.

The pieces were literally stuck to each other, and not just a few of them. Almost every 1 out of 5 pieces was stuck to another one. When I tried separating them, it turned out that they got stuck when the paint was still fresh, so the dots ended up sticking to other pieces, therefore creating additional dots. Also, some of the pieces lost some of their paint in the process of being separated. Needless to say, this was the worst way to teach my children how to count at a glance. In terms of quality, the pieces were too light to stand firmly. The slightest movement around them caused them to collapse. Please don't waste your money on this product. There are much better alternatives out there!

This isn't really for beginners,(advanced and experts can benefit easily) or maybe I should rephrase it as first timers.

The sound quality is great, significantly better then my last pair of similar priced headphones (actually these were cheaper).There are two downsides.One: The asymetrical cords are OVERexxagerated resulting in all the weight being on the short ear and it's more likely to fall out. The long end it too long, but that's not so much an issue (i daisy chained it). The total length of the cord is fine, pretty long- but not too long.Other downside:The \\"muffs\\" on the ears are not very good. They're much more flimsy then my last pair, and do not isolate nearly as much. Worse yet for some,the effect of the poor isolation is much weaker base. Luckily, I switched with the spairs from my old pair of headphones (lost) and benefited from this better sound quality,with the same old muffs.My conclusion:Great Price! Great Sound! Two caveats: take heed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kills me to give a low review, but...","review":"First off, these buds do sound great for the money, but I can't recommend them for two reasons. 1 - My second pair just broke, this is in 4 months, and I'm not abusive with them. 2 - The left ear just won't seat properly.

I also thought there would be games in the book. The title would be much better if it said \\"exercises and drills.\\" Very few of the suggestions in the book are truly games. For example, holding up an item and asking \\"What is it?\\" and answering isn't a game nor a contest. They aren't bad exercises and drills for an ESL class but few would work well in a foreign language classroom. The majority of the ideas are for younger, I would say 3rd grade or under, students.One idea that would work well would be to write an advise column (not really a game or contest though.)

Save your money, buy it in the discount bin at the front of your local bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slight","review":"Jane Mendelsohn's first novel neither warrants the high praise given by other reviewers, nor is it without merit. This admittedly brief book is a series of moods and impressions that wash over one another, like waves on the island beach where Earhart is stranded. This is not a story for those of the action-picture mentality.Mendelsohn writes compact prose in winningly direct images: \\"In the Electra the light is blue. There's a smell of gasoline.\\" But elsewhere, an effective metaphor in the opening pages reappears so often that it loses its power.There just isn't enough material here. Pages given over to epigraphs (Woolf, Defoe, and Bronte) and acknowledgements are too much like padding. In the end, this is an undemanding fantasy that will please many readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"a reader","review":"I had been meaning to read this book for quite a while and finally got around to it while on vacation. I was eager to read others' thoughts ... although I am in no way religious, I found myself fascinated by what I took to be Mendelsohn's vivid exploration of purgatory, heaven and hell, using Earhart and Noonan as her literary vehicles.I was surprised to see that no one else picked up on this and instead mainly focused on the media hype surrounding the book. Talk about boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For success, write about and be endorsed by a celebrity","review":"If this book had been written about a non-celebrity and hadn't been endorsed by Don Imus, it would have gone nowhere.

After all, it is a work of fiction, and a writer can make the South prevail at Gettysburg, for the sake of a good story. The real faults are in the very narration, i.e., the point of view shifts that are pretentious and annoying--and in the descent into romantic hogwash. Perhaps the readers of sappy romances will like the shift in Amelia's character and even believe it possible that such could occur, but it is not very satisfying to a reader who wants more from a book than sap. I just couldn't buy the premise, the point of views, and the denouement.

I liked the author's style and images right away -- I felt pulled into the world of Amelia Earhart. The story was so beautifully and simply written that I tumbled on page after page not wanting to stop. I continued to be haunted by the events that were happening -- were they real, is she dreaming, am I reading about an Amelia that exists on the spiritual plane now? I loved the quality of how much space Amelia needed to finally feel truly happy. I also loved that her solitude made her potential rescue seem like a capture -- how hard to return to the world of society and conventions. Very haunting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book never took off","review":"This was a pick of my book club and that is the only reason I finished it. I must admit I have not read anything about Amelia Earhart but I also don't think I will now. The book was dry from the very start. I never connected with any of her characters. I think Amelia Earhart sounded like a spoiled child who always thought she was right. Her navigator came out looking like a total drunk. I had no emotional attachment so I didn't much care what happened to either of them. I wouldn't waste my time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete trash, poorly written, torrid junk","review":"I bought this book with the great expectation of a good read on Amelia Earhart.

The \\"afterlife\\" of Earhart post-crash is offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"Mendelsohn's book picks up where the known facts of Earhart leave off, answering the question of \\"just what happened to Noonan and Earhart after they left for Howland Island?\\" The plot line is razor thin, the writing style is straight out of a Harlequin romance novel, and the characters are cardboard cut-outs of real human beings. The book was bad. Really bad. Think \\"Blue Lagoon\\" meets \\"Gilligan's Isle\\" as a trashy dime-store novella, and you have a feel for the story.

I did not particularly care for either half, though the first is a bit more lyrical. In the first hald, the prose is a bit surreal and dream-like, so if you are not into that literary style skip this book entirely. The second half consists of a fictional Amelia playing the TV show \\"Lost\\" only with two people and not interesting at all. The prose also goes completely flat. It's a bunch of jagged paragraphs. On top of all this, fans of Amelia are probably not going to like this either, as the fictional Amelia goes through a complete personality change that the author hints was always under the surface (she's not truly happy until she's stranded on a beach, naked with her navigator and drinking coconut juice - in other words, being a pilot didn't make her happy.)

It is a very enjoyable album and those who have not listened to any of her other stuff will be very impressed. The tracks \\"Tradition\\", \\"Wolf\\" and \\"Mirrorball\\" stand out as the best tracks. They are minimalist, tender songs with no pretence and suit her mellow vocal. I dislike \\"No-one takes you home\\" and it seems to me like with this song she is veering towards a commercial audience. In my opinion, her sweet voice is done no favours by a harsh poppy backdrop.Fans of \\"Fell Down Fast\\" will like the \\"Little Black Numbers\\" track on here as it has that same Cello which works so well for her.I have been to see Kathryn live twice and she did a great show both times.

The problem is that the higher the hose, the more softer and flexible it is, the more likely it is to slide between the sidewinder panels when spread out, and fall to the ground in between the panels. That obviously defeats the purpose, because you then have to \\"walk\\" the hose to dump it.But if you use a plastic hose, this will work. Rubber or flexible, likely it won't.

If it doesn't look much like modern descriptions, that's because the religion is evolving.Of real interest was his observation of the administration of Haiti.

EVERY track is top notch. Every song has 5-star production and 5-star lyrics. This album is worth EVERY PENNY. Just pop it in, and listen to it straight, from the first song, you will be amazed.The track produced by Madlib is HOT. As usual, the Legends have their first track featuring every member spitting battle type rhymes. I admit, this first song surpasses \\"What Would You Do?\\" from the CD \\"Almost Famous\\".Throughout the CD, every member's verses are strategically placed through out the tracks so that their voices and styles greatly compliment each other or stands out.I recommend this CD for everyone. If you would like to take a break from commercial rap that's about jibberish, buy this. If you're tired of listening to nerd rap, stuff that makes you say \\"WTF?\\" buy this.

I also recommend Asop's solo album, Headshots Se7en Mixtape, and Murs Rules the World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music","review":"This album isn't exactly a 'Classic' LL release (like 'Almost Famous') or some of the UHB collabos but this is definitely a good pick-up.I realize that artists can't keep making the same music and they have to evolve as 'artists', but I will always like old Eligh (As they Pass, A Story of Two Worlds), old Grouch (Don't Talk to Me, Making Perfect Sense), and old Mystik Journeymen (4001, Worldwide Underground) releases more than the newer ones. It must have something to do with the production: their new beats sound overly synthesized. I don't know if i'm too stuck on Ant and 9th Wonder making good music out of other people's music but I'm leaning less towards the Legends nowadays.

It does not direcly teach you how to use PSPICE, but rather, is designed for a teacher to assign problems, and the students to solve them. Limited instruction is given, but there are problems that contain no written solutions. The major drawback for this is that if you run into difficulty solving a problem, you are stuck. There is no solutions manual, and the description of the book offered by Amazon makes it sound like this is a step-by-step helper. But, being the only book written (that I could find for Version 7/8) on the subject, we are left to use it. The index is also poorly constucted, with less than 100 entries, for a 600+ (both vol) book. In the end though, it has taught me some things I did not know. A solutions manual (or proper representation of the book by amazon) would also be very benefical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the \\"Close-minded\\"!","review":"While Dr. Cytowic's book mainly deals with his investigation of the rare neurological phenomena called \\"synesthesia\\", his resulting insights on emotions, reasoning and consciousness are really what make this book worth reading. He presents \\"The New View of How the Brain Works\\". A view that helps us understand the critical interaction of emotions and reasoning. If you are open-minded and ready to give an alternate point of view a chance, you will find this book to be truly enlightening, absorbing, thought provoking and enjoyable. If you are close-minded and think that science already has all the right answers - don't waste your time - try science fiction instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Tasted a Hint of Soap Box...","review":"I eagerly snatched this book off the shelf when I learned of it -- synesthesia is a fascinating subject with too few works devoted to it -- but Dr. Cytowic's tendency to climb onto his soap box took much of the potential pleasure out of \\"The Man Who Tasted Shapes\\". We are given details about only two people with the condition, and one of those only glancingly. The rest of the book is either written in coy dialogue form (taking scores of pages to relate an incident easily expressed in a paragraph -- padding, anyone?) or else denouncing other scientists' viewpoints. This is no \\"Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat\\" [by Oliver Sacks], as the title seems to imply. I was left hungering to know more about the actual subject: synesthesia. I did not necessarily disagree with Dr. Cytowic's views, but they seemed to have pre-empted another book already in progress.Janet Coleman Sides"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read","review":"This is a truly great book.

Not only that but it criticizes the medical community who tried to hold him back. It puts some insight into the dependents of technology in todays society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cytowic is a egotist","review":"While the book is supposed to focus on synaesthesia, it seems more to focus on Cytowic's views on the medical profession.

At the end of the book, I am left completely baffled by the motives of the main actors. I won't discuss it in any detail, since I don't want to spoil the plot, but they must have been relatively stupid since they could have accomplished their purposes in a simple and straightforward way that would have avoided a lot of grief.

It is an excellent work on Symbolism in many forms. I have been a fan of comics for years and I think this made me even more so. However, I wanted to know if a non-comic reader would get as much enjoyment out of this as I did. I got my father to read it by telling him about some of the fantastic things inside and left it lying on the table. The next day I found him reading it and he loved it too. We discussed it at great length and I think it left him with a lot more respect for Comics as Art.

I have recommended it to many people, bought copies for several of them, and own two copies myself so that I can lend out one. I recommend it VERY strongly to anyone who's involved with designing Internet sites. Although it's not about that subject directly, it has more wisdom about the design of sites than any Web design book I've ever read or seen. Afterall, the Web is basically a 'page' structure, with text and graphics, just like a comic. Also, you'll learn more about art history from this book than you will from most art history classes (I know, I went to art school...). And did I mention that it's funny too! -E"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book about comics!","review":"Not just another book about the History of comics. Not just another book about \\"How to draw comics\\". This book opens your eyes.

I was amazed by colors, quality of paper and last but not least the content. I've never thought about the comics books in the way this one explains. and the form the explanation takes is adding a flavor to the reading experience. i'm enjoyed reading it (i did it already twice). this is a book that you can take from the shelf at any time, open at any page and read. of course, to do it you need first read it once from the first page to the last... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!!","review":"The title may be \\"Understanding Comics,\\" but McCloud's work covers much much more.

It's a comic book about the art of making comic books, but also a terrific statement on art itself, as well as the creative process. I recommend this to anyone who's ever enjoyed a comic book, but also anyone creative or interested in the creative process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just comics but ART","review":"The benefits this book brings to understanding the comic artform is innumerable as aready stated in multiple reviews. What I want to emphasize is that it brings about a whole new appreciation of the visual arts in general. I was particularly reminded by the comic book high art of Roy Lichtenstein. But this book has helped provide me with new apprication of Modern Art which I previously looked at with confusion or disdain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have Book If Any Truly Exist","review":"Scott McCloud has entertained readers with his wonderful comic, _Zot!_ Now he informs his readers in this, one of the greatest books on the psychology of comics ever written.Shunning the usual nostalgic tone of most books written about comics, McCloud uses the comic format to discuss not the history of the X-Men, but rather the method of storytelling in which such characters are presented. He writes on a vast list of subjects, ranging from the meaning of the word \\"Comics\\" to the use of blank space between panels. The art style is simple where it needs to be and complex where it is required. The message comes across in panel after panel of information that is stated simply enough for everybody to understand, if they will only open their minds to these \\"Funny Books.\\"Scott McCloud's book is an invaluable resource. It allows you to stop merely reading comics, and start understanding them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought!!!","review":"If you are an artist involved in cinema/animation/storyboarding/Illustration or any type of creative or communication science, YOU WANT THIS BOOK. This book packs more horsepower under the hood that you might guess by looking at the front cover.

I think I would rather read something written by Todd McFarlane than to read this garbage. I have been reading comics for over 20 years and this is one of the most hyped books I had not read, so I picked it up expecting a revelation and I could barely get through the inane drudgery that Scott McCloud puts you through.

Someone please tell me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unenlightening","review":"this book is an attempt to deconstruct comics. To over analyze them to such a degree as to make you lose sight of what you are really looking at. Scott McCloud spends pages and pages over pointless items like the definition of a comic, and other useless ideas. The Triangle he creates for art seems right out of Dead Poets Society.

The artwork, language, humor or social criticism of comics are obvious to most comics readers, but McCloud delves deeply into the underpinnings of this world--the technical, invisible paradigm that supports the creation and consumption of comics.Understanding Comics is a comic appreciation book. I was impressed with McCloud's grasp of the discipline's history, the psychology of the art and his own creativity when explaining his topic. For me, entering into this paradigm was very much like Thomas Kuhn discovering paradigms, when he said, \\"The scales have fallen from my eyes.\\"Those familiar with comics have recommended a couple of alternatives in their reviews, but still end up suggesting that this book deserves a place among the serious works about comics.

This is a quick easy read that's worth your time. Dan Jenkins is an outstanding author and this book is one of his finest. There is an updated version (since the prize money in the 70s is far lower than today on the PGA Tour) but I recommend the original if you can get one. One warning - the book does contain serious adult language and content. There are a lot of great quotes in this book that any golfer should be able to work into their games.

Now, I don't say that just because I love anything that has to do with Disney, but I truly think that it is very helpful. I own the 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004 editions, and after reading them I have come to one conclusion, they aren't the best guide if this is your first time going to Walt Disney World. The book is published by Disney Enerprises, so it says everything in the park is amazing. If it is you first time, I would suggest a book that is not published by Disney, such as Frommers or the Unofficial Guide, because they rate the rides and attractions. Ohter than that, this book is the one for you. It can tell you some of the inside facts that ones that are not published by Disney can't. This guide is fully illistrated, so children can enjoy it also. That is my book review, I hope I didn't bore you to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for a Trip to Walt Disney World","review":"This is the most informative book on the market for persons about to journey to Walt Disney World. It is absolutely essential if you want to approach your WDW vacation with knowledge enough to make the most of it. My advice is to purchase the most recent edition, as it is updated each year to include new attractions, and there are always new attractions. The book is filled with information about hotels, restaurants, amusement parks, and attractions throughout the entire Disney property. I have made about 25 trips to WDW, and I buy a new one each year I go so that my information is current. Well worth the reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great guide for a first-timer!","review":"This guide is perfect for someone going to WDW for the first time who just wants a general overview of fun things to see and do. It has lots of great pictures, and it's very easy to read.

I only read 50 pages or so before pitching the book, but in that short span it was revealed that not only was St Cyr the greatest Romeo that London had ever seen, and had hearing far exceeding normal humans, but he could control the flight of a pistol ball with exact precision. For everybody else, a round projectile wanders unpredictably, thats why we use rifled barrels and pointed projectiles now - but St Cyr is not subject to the laws of physics.As to personality, he was the type to ignore, twice, his faithful manservant who was trying to tell him something important.

The characterizations have to really draw me in and make me care. St. Cyr does not disappoint! I found myself picking it up at odd times of day to see what would happen next. I thoroughly enjoyed the time period and setting. I will continue reading this author.

I prefer a Victorian, or Regency tale from a famous, or infamous, detective's viewpoint. A detective of uncommon ability, Sherlock Holmes' adventures are more my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"I was quite impressed with the captivating plot and the rich character development of C.S.

Harris is a favourite discovery of late, What Angels Fear was intended as a quick beach read; but I soon found myself falling for the series. I have heard the hero, Sebastian St. Cyr referred to as a hybrid of Mr. Darcy and James Bond and this representation is accurate. Harris writes a gripping and graphic mystery and the first two of the series ( the rest are already checked out of the library ) were wonderfully-paced and chockfull of interesting tidbits from the Regency Era. The inclusion of politics and the seedy underworld of England at that time are well-rendered and I especially love her characterization of the foppish and boorish Prince Regent himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"I really enjoy the rich detail and fast paced action in this book. The whole series is very good. I love historical fiction and this book and series are up there as some of my favorites! I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read, who loves history, and enjoys mystery and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start ....","review":"\\"What Angels Fear\\" is a very good first start to the St. Cyr series. I wouldn't characterize this book as a pure mystery but more of romantic suspence. Given that CS Harris also published romances under the name Candice Proctor, I wasn't surprised by the amount of time spent on the romance as well as the mystery. There are a few gory scenes in the book but there is also a romance that will continue to grow/change as series will grow/change.There are a few things about the main character that are a little too pat for my liking but the author's note at the end, answered some of these questions for me. I would suggest not reading and putting the book down often because some of the characters are forgettable but play a part in the story later on.A good start to a new series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new mystery series - start here, read them all","review":"When Angels Fear introduces us to Sebastian St. Cyr and what an introduction. Yes, for those who have read a Regency romance or two, you'll sense some of the classic characteristics of the \\"hero\\" here, but Harris quickly moves beyond that and creates a protagonist that is believable and compelling for any mystery lover. And unlike many romance novelists before, Harris can actually put together a legitimate mystery plot and pull it off. Yes, I acknowledge what at least one other reviewer brings up, there are definitely some contemporary (21st century) attitudes here, especially regarding the treatment of women. It didn't bother me, I'm a 21st century reader! The character development is outstanding, even the \\"baddies\\" are superb! Treat yourself to the whole set (so far.) You won't be able to stop once you start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Users Beware","review":"Regarding the use of this book on Kindle - it USED to be speech enabled, allowing a Kindle user to play the book in your car so you could hear it while you drove (or any other place, if you wanted to give your eyes a rest). Now, all of a sudden, it's no longer speech enabled (text-to-speech). What gives? Did the publishers suddenly change their minds? Is the support for text-to-speech disappearing from our Kindles? I bought Kindle BECAUSE it had the text-to-speech ability, and now that seems to be getting more and more useless for the books I want to buy. Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average historical murder mystery with quite a few inaccuracies","review":"I found much of the writing of this book to be stilted and dry. It was also obvious this was Ms. Harris' first book as it didn't flow very well. I also found the whole idea of a police force run like modern day British police to be a bit of a laugh. As another reviewer mentioned, the police didn't act like this in England for at least another 50 years. Believe me, I'm British, and grew up with stories of Robert Peel (the founder of the British Bobbies) and the like. Sebastian also needs to learn some new language as \\"Bloody Hell\\" was said at least 30 times during the book and, in many cases, in a way a true Englishman wouldn't say.Having said this though, I did give Ms. Harris' second book a try and it was much better. Flows more, more natural speech patterns and more interesting. I'll definitely buy her third book as it looks like a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"The main characters were interesting enough that I look forward to reading more by the same author. A good read for anyone who enjoys historical fiction and/or mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping from start to finish","review":"This was a truly gripping and well written story. The main characters are well drawn out, and I was hooked into the story from the beginning.

I can highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"I've owned this album for over three years now, and just to clarify its greatness, it is still a great album to me. I have played it on road trips and times when I just want to really focus on music, and this album always delivers. You will not be dissappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Longtime Fan---Fantastic","review":"Most things to be said about this album have already been said, so in the interest of fresh thoughts, I will add what I have to say. I have been a fan of Guster from their very beginnings, and after the lack of success (album sales, airplay, etc...) of Lost&Gone Forever, I was astonished. Said album is one of the 10 albums I would bring with me to a desert island. The attempt at commercial success with 'Keep it Together,' is evident with songs like Amsterdam, Careful, and Homecoming King. I do not mean this to sound negative; they are simply songs with a more focused, 'listenable' song. By listenable, I mean radio airplay. It is a creative, fresh, musically intelligent album which I reccomend to everyone. I have seen them live several times, and hung out with them (!!!) a couple times, and they are even more impressive in person/concert. All in all (I hate to end with such a conclusive cliche), it is a fantastic, diverse, fun, cd. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND it."},{"rating":"2","title":"come strong or don't come at all...","review":"Keep It Together is well worth the three and a half year (!) wait. the album is, i don't know, richer than Guster's previous albums. but the sound is still distinctively Guster. which is a very good thing. \\"Amsterdam\\" is catchy as all hell. and \\"Come Downstairs and Say Hello\\" is highly melodic. i think this trio have really expanded their musicality...also, a highlight is the inclusion of \\"I Hope Tomorrow Is Like Today\\" a track co-written with/featuring Ben Kweller. the verses are different than the live version, but it remains an amazing song.this is a record you can listen to all the way through and not be bored. KIT is, no doubt, fun to listen to--but it has substance to boot. lyrically wry, musically infectious--all in all, a top-notch album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world needs this type of music.","review":"... or at least I do. I'm 36 and still need a 'fix' of good music once and a while. This is it. I listen to many different types of music from Mudvayne to Alan Jackson to Classical Music. Everything in between too. When I hear this music it reminds me more of the pop music I grew up on than 'alternative' music of the 90s. It's not grunge either. It's not punk either. Just real good music to listen to any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-around Guster Goodness","review":"Guster has created one of the best albums I have ever heard. Every song on the album is awesome. If you like one song on the album, you will like them all. I'm not saying that all the songs sound the same, every song is just good. I'm so stoked to seem them when they come to Seattle. Although I haven't heard their other albums, I would probably recomend those, as I can't imagine someone doing so well on one album and only doing so-so on their others. Also, check out their website for some hilarious videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wept","review":"I have been a long time fan of Guster and I wept when I listened to this so-called music. Good job boys, you cracked out of the clutish into the pop world. I hope they're proud of their turn into mediocrity and conformance. It only leaves me wondering whether it was the money, pressure from the label, or insanity that drove them to give up what seemed like a genuine love for the music and just bleed out this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost and gone emo","review":"Musically speaking, \\"Keep it together\\" could be mistaken for a different band. Guster's had an evolving sound throughout all their records, but this is less evolution and more mutation.This album would fit in well on any contemporary radio station, amidst emo, \\"punk,\\" and other pop-friendly genres. While Guster have always been catchy and never been too \\"experimental,\\" This jumps into the pool with the other sickeningly sweet pop music.Perhaps it's what they wanted, but I'm vastly disappointed in this record, longtime fan or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best","review":"After listening a few times, only a couple of the tunes stay with me.

Whoever says this band is maturing hasn't listened to the other stuff. The peak was Goldfly and it's been all down hill from there. They have met the evil of over production. This album sounds like something a bunch of 18 year olds would make. The songwriting is pretty bad. The drummer (bongoer) writes like 4 songs on the album and they are all terrible. He's never written any songs for the other albums. Amsterdam being a perfect example of how bad they are. Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Just like all trash, this belongs in a dumpster. Doesn't even deserve one star. The single...Amsterdam..that song makes me cringe. Atrocious. Brutal on the ears. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop whining about the bongos! The band is evolving!","review":"This is an EXCELLENT Guster release! To those who are lamenting about the drum kit (instead of the bongos) and their more 'pop-ish sound', get a life. Bands evolve, and 'Keep It Together' is proof. I welcome the added 'layers of production', as they add to Guster's detailed sonics and overall professionalism. Guster are incredible songwriters and live performers, and they have become one of my top 5 'alternative' bands. The others being 'The Church', 'Coldplay', 'The Beautiful South', and 'John Wesley Harding'."},{"rating":"2","title":"One awesome CD","review":"Guster is my favorite band and it will be for a long time. This band is better than any other band out there in the commercial spotlight and this album reflects that. Along with Lost and Gone Forever this is my favorite album. I highly recommend it. Just because I'm a little younger than 13(eleven) doesn't mean I don't know what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Join the Red Oyster Cult!!","review":"WOW... is the first thing I must say. K.I.T. really could be the best album Guster has put out, although Goldfly is pretty damn good. The new album is more mainstream acceptable, which I honestly don't mind because they kept some of their original sounds, like the bongos, and great vocal harmony. The album still has Guster written all over it, but unlike past albums mostly limited to the likings of college students, and a few high school crowds, this album could bring Guster into the spotlight. Red Oyster Cult is the best track I think, but Homecoming King is also a favorite. The other songs are all good, and this is an album that you can listen to and sing with in the car the whole way through... way to go guys, ur awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Guster CD So Far","review":"Simply put, this is their best CD so far. If you like Guster, than buying this CD will not be a mistake. Almost every song on this album is top level material, and will be playing on my CD player for a long time to come. On another note, I highly recomend Granian in addition to Guster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly ashamed","review":"I first found Guster while searching for something new and refreshing to listen to. I searched through amazon, and bought Guster's Lost and Gone forever. This is the CD that i still listen to when i get into my car and go for a pointless drive. I saw that Guster was going to release a new CD and bought it emideatley hoping that it would be another awesome music experience. So i got it a few months later when it had finaly been released, and to my horror, it completely lacked. They sound like a new band. They are a completely different music experience and are trying to be like everyone else, when in fact their fans listen because they were unique. So my suggestion, is buy lost and gone forever, listen and enjoy, but Keep it Together is a waste of time and energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite albums from last year","review":"Guster is not normally my type of band at all. They used to play at my college all the time, and I wasn't too impressed with their first few albums (although in hindsight I probably didn't give them a fair chance). This album changed my mind completely. Amsterdam will stick in your head for days, almost painfully so. But songs like Keep it Together, Backyard, Homecoming King, and Jesus on the Radio do the same thing in their own way... a less bothersome way I suppose. They float through your mind in a way that makes you listen to the cd again and again. Really, what more can you ask for from a cd?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is perfect driving music, just pop it in and have a great trip! Very relaxing, upbeat and good, clean music that everyone will take a liking to."},{"rating":"2","title":"These dudes are good","review":"It's a shame that Guster is not more of a household name in the music world. If only there were more bands like them.....just normal guys who simply write and play brilliant music. No gimmicks. No dancing. No pretty hair. Just great tunes.This really is a great album with several standout tracks. My favorites are Ramona, Jesus on the Radio, Amsterdam, and Come downstairs and say hello. These songs alone have provided me with hours of entertainment.Don't let the 4 star rating fool you...I save my 5 star ratings for John, Paul, George and Ringo."},{"rating":"1","title":"An old fan disappointed","review":"As excitedly played the cd in my car on the way home from the record store, I became increasingly impatient...looking for songs with a little bongo drum action. Finally, Backyard had it...but it was not that prevalent. Yes, after about 3-4 listens, the songs grow on you. But Guster's other cd's have never needed a couple listens to before they become catchy. It sounds too poppy, and i miss the crescendos, and especially the intensity of the bongos. An okay cd, but I hope at the concert I go to in a few weeks that they play a lot of old songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I became a Guster fan a few years ago and I enjoy listening to each of their first three albums. I was anticipating the release of their fourth album for over a year and I have to say that I am pretty disappointed. I have listened to the CD about 15 times all the way through over the last month or so and I just can't help but wonder where this album went wrong. The songs are poppy and over-produced. The lyrics are nothing like what we have come to expect from this band. It seems to me that somebody got to these guys and convinced them that if they ever wanted to \\"get big\\" they would have to kill the bongos and \\"dumb down\\" their songs. I am still a Guster fan, but I am a disappointed Guster fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovers are for Guster","review":"Once again Guster has put out another great album and the packaging they've used on this special edition is well worth the extra dip in the pocket. I've never seen anyone else in concert so I might be biased but if you are a big fan you should get this version of the album, you won't be sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Guster","review":"Many bands make the mistake of following up an album even THEY must know is near-perfect by trying to duplicate it. It becomes apparent when listening to Keep it Together that Guster made absolutely certain they weren't rehashing Lost and Gone Forever when they cut this great album. Having said that, when following up a near-perfect album, it is hard not to review one in light of the other.Keep it Together is not as immediately likeable as Lost and Gone simply because the songs aren't quite as hooky. This isn't good or bad, just descriptive. The songs are wonderful, slightly less poppy, and definitely more experimental for these guys. Jesus on the Radio features a raw banjo track, and Red Oyster Cult is the most unGusterlike song I've heard them record yet. That said, both tracks are amazing! If you liked Lost and Gone Forever but aren't looking to spend $15 on buying the same album twice, Keep it Together is a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guster Has Done It","review":"This album is just stellar, if your a Guster fan go out and buy it. Their first single \\"Amsterdam\\" has a nice uprising beat.The old Guster fans may start hating on the band and on this album, saying they've gone too \\"mainstream\\" or for changing the music around too much, but you have to realize no band really wants to stay in the underground level forever, like all others they need to be heard...going mainstream is exactly that and also where they'll get more $. Every band changes their music around, they simply get better or grow up and their lyrics and beats tend to change, if Guster had the same music style as their last album I'll guarantee you there will be fans complaining that it's the same sound and they need a change, why is it that fans always need something to complain about? It's just utterly stupid, stop hating people and you know who you are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guster keeps it together once again","review":"This June, I had the opportunity to hear Guster play in Pittsburgh. Awesome concert! Best of all, they played some tracks from this new album. After listening to the CD, I have to admit most of the songs sounded so much better live. Overall though, I don't think this album is as great as Lost and Gone Forever, but it still rocks and is definitely worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original style that really rocks","review":"Guster is a very talented and original band. They use their own style and make it work. The use of the congas and original style of playing cymbals with hands, accompanies the talented singing and amazing song writing perfectly. I have become a huge Guster fan from listening to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops list for 2003","review":"I am quite disappointed with reviews I've read. I can't say I am a devout follower(though I own the previous album)but the first listen to this album blew me away. I was so reminded of the greatness of R.E.M. back in the day and the diverse nature of going from mellow to rocking so effectively. This is Guster's best work because they are spreading their wings and cranking it up. Amsterdam is as great of a Rock song as you can get! Love the guitar tone. Another fine product from Beantown.

The film has no narration, so unless you are familiar with these folk, you will not have any context or sense of who they are and what made them special. Most Americans would have no idea who these people are and they constitute the largest part of the on screen time.

Very few books that I have come across deal with the folding and wrinkling of cloth and other materials in so meticulous and compendious a manner as does Hogarth. Wirtten less as a 'how-to' and more as a series of well-designed examples, Dynamic Wrinkles and Drapery covers nearly every kind of clothing wrinkles one might think of, and provides exceptionally detailed illustrations to show you how you can apply these lessons to your own work. While other books give short shrift to drawing realistic-looking clothes, this one is simply THE only source you will need on how to give your characters' costumes that extra pop of realism. An indispensible book, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less is More","review":"I realize that Hogarth is up there with the greats of figure drawing royalty however this book regarding the clothed figure is over exaggerated. One doesn't need that many folds, winkles, pulls, etc to say the same thing. It not only looks painful and unnatural but also often looks like the figure just came out of the rinse cycle of their washing machine.

But I was rather disappointed. The folds and wrinkles shown in this book are wildly exaggerated and often wrong. I also had a hard time feeling any 'weight' to the folds. Some of the concepts written about are good advice, but those are so skewed in the drawings that if anyone tried to actually follow them I'm fairly certain their art professors would laugh and promptly down grade the work. In all honesty I have no idea why my school even has this book. Every student I showed it to immediately recognized it's faults. You're better off googling pics of real people (or better yet- getting a live model), then trying to use this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be used for reference, I guess","review":"The teaching is totally confusing, with all the arrows pointing everywhere.

Pasta's so sticky you have to use no-stick spray. The taste is so bad my son, who eats anything wouldn't touch it, and the sauce packet was hard as a rock, so it didn't mix up and left big chunks in the ketchup you have to add. We tried the mac and cheese too, it takes 15 minutes to cook and again says 4 pack, but that's only 2 pastas and 2 cheeses. Very expensive, hardly any food, and pretty nasty to eat.

Another problem for me is that the individual tracks don't always flow smoothly from one to the next. That's often true of film scores, but not always. To me, the strongest part of the score is the main theme, which is stirring in the extreme but which also forms a very small percentage of the music here, which runs on toward about three-quarters of an hour.

I should have just bought more wire and done my own again.PROS- The cable shroud is nice. It's made of some sort of harder plastic so it slips through my entertainment center cabinet more easily than normal cables do. It's braided so it might collect more dust and dirt.- The cables don't kink easily and they lay flat easily.CONS- The banana connectors do not fit tightly at all.

He forgets that he, too, is a reader with an outlook rooted in a specific (our own) time. His own limitations as a reader become apparent when he produces a confused & reductive essay on Virgil's first major work, The Book of Bucolics (also known as eclogues) -- a source for the tradition of pastoral poetry in the West. Other scholars will no doubt find other essays to praise or blame in such a wide range, but no one, I think, will admire the theoretical posturing & self-involvement of the editorial frame.

Here's an example of the most harrowing kind. Human rights abuses were considered a mere 'dark spot', the absence of democracy not particularly troubling in the broader scheme of things, and neither was the existence of a greedy state elite in Tunisia. As long as they were anti-Islamist then these elites were fine, from such a point of view. And now we see that masses of ordinary people have risen up against these supposedly benign, enlightened regimes that were the favourite of the author and her ilk.

You will not regret the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little breed specific information","review":"The fact that this book is mostly made up of generic dog information is only part of the problem. I picked up this book because I wanted more information on Yorkies specifically. Since Yorkies are so small, there's a lot of stuff that may be different when caring for them as compared to, say, a Golden Retriever. Don't get me wrong; much of that kind of information is universal, and it is helpful to know the things that apply to all dogs. But this book is being sold as a book about caring for Yorkies, and that is what I expected. There are many generic dog care books out there, and frankly, many of them are much better than this one.Aside from that, this book is poorly written and edited. I found many grammatical and syntactic errors in the first few chapters.I also have Yorkshire Terriers for Dummies, and I think it is a much better book than this one. Choose that one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of health information.","review":"I found this book to be helpful. I am not yet a Yorkie owner but a Yorkie owner in training. This book has a great deal of health-related information about Yorkies, including the standards tips for raising a puppy vs. an adult dog.

I heard the author's voice most passionately in one of her shorter poems \\"Our Dog\\" and I am sure that many a reader will relate to this lyric rendition of a fundamental experience. As Möller forms her own powerful imagery, she simultaneously formed an equally powerful bond between me and her topics, cast a new light on past experiences, and had me wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you fools the ones smoking crack now?","review":"Talk about revisionist history!

Here is an example of Sessions' logic: at the seminar he presented code samples using COM and CORBA. He made a statement that COM required less coding based on a number of lines in his COM and CORBA samples that were written in different programming languages! Both his seminar and his book give you a lot of words, definitions, but at the same time you don't learn much. The book tries to explain huge amount of complex topics.

On the other hand, if J++ were the only development environment for Java, I might agree with him, but it isn't.The message about Java is contradictory - the author is so obsessed about Java being the best language for COM development that any shortcomings are dismissed as growing pains, while shortcomings in other areas make the language unsuitable for any other purpose... there are a number of technical errors too (just an example: see the example on p. 141 - one wonders what \\"Class.forName\\" in Java is for if not for this purpose).To paraphrase Monty Python: This is not a book for reading - this is a book for lying down and avoiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book sponsored by Microsoft ?","review":"I don't feel like reading books that contains statements like the following [page 151]:\\"...If you try implementing a serious businessoriented component in C++, C, Visual Basic and Java, it will take you no time to conclude that Java is by far the best choice. But if you try implementing a serious client user interface in C++, C, Visual Basic, and Java, it will take you no time to conclude that Java is by far one of the worst choices (followed closely by C++ and C). ...\\"So, I'm thinking about, whether the author really knows something about Java.The last section [page 470] contains a strange comparison between Java/CORBA and Microsoft's DNA.

It tells the band's history, its members, how they write songs and lots of other things. I've always like them because they make great music, and watching this DVD make them even more loveable because I have a little more insight to their ideas, their environments and surroudings. Plus, I did not know they are all so good-looking people! I like the live shows the most so I wish they'd put more live footages in the disc.

I ever purchased, and I've been buying Glen's records (and CDs) ever since. \\"Somebody Like That\\" lives up to all expectations, and there's even a booklet with the lyrics (just in case you are brave enough to sing along!) Unfortunately, on track 9 \\"(If I'd Only Known) It Was The Last Time\\", there are four verses printed, but Glen only sings the first three, repeating the third verse and leaving the fourth out entirely. It's a great song and I almost feel cheated, as I now really want to hear that last verse! Anybody out there got a copy of the entire song? Apart from that, if you're a Glen Campbell fan and don't have this CD, go on out and buy it. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy with this item.","review":"This item worked as promised and was easy to use as well. My problem was that it only worked for 2 months and it developed a short somewhere in the cord. This is rather an expensive cord and I do not beleive it would break so quicklky if quality had gone into its original construction. I am not one that abuses their laptop nor do I even move it very often so I cannot explain how and why his shorted out so quickly. I also think their \\"wall hugging\\" description referes to how short the cord actually is. It is far from a generous length. I would refer you to another brand than Targas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"The first guy to post here messed up and did not see the rating thing and give this a 1 star and then went on to talk about how great this album is.

I cannot believe that anyone with even moderate hearing would give this more than 1 star. KELLY's vocals are nothing short of unlistenable. Her lyrics are on par with her vocals and her guitar playing ( totaly mindless and unrelated notes ) is not even that good. If this was played by a 12 year old with 6 month tuition, one might suspect that there is some talent lurking somewhere. From a seasoned player this is unforgivable. Amongst the many many notes, there is not one interesting one. How anyone can mangle HEY JOE and CROSSROADS into the horrid tunes they become in KELLY's hands is beyond me. Not one redeeming feature. There are 1000's of better ( can't think of a lesser one as a matter of fact ) players out there. Even the fact that she is one of only a handfull of female players can't save this dreadfull effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOLY COW","review":"Saw this disc in a review in Vintage Guitar Magazine Review, and these guys are top notch in reviewing musicians, so I said, it is a purchase!Let me say this, she is by far the most unsung guitarist in the blues/rock genre.

It's cute, well done, and has some funny moments. However, on its own it's not the most exciting movie. The movie doesn't introduce or develop the characters because it relies on the TV show, so if you've never watched it you might find it hard to get into the movie. Selena Gomez as the witch just comes off as annoying - imagine a teenager empowered with magic - and her acting isn't particularly good. Still the supporting characters are fun, especially Max's wisecracks.

Then there are the passages I read over again and still came away wondering what he meant.I'm so glad I picked up this book for free (it's the original edition.)

And of course there is always the music, stupid.This book's achievment is it's first and last quarters - wishing and wasting. Close your eyes after any part of the first quarter and you are in Liverpool, scrambling frantically to learn a chord, fix an amplifier, get a gig, find a drummer, get to Hamburg, cut a record, DO IT NOW.Skim through the middle bits with the numbers getting larger, the crowds louder and the songs less joyous. Go straight to the end where Norman describes Apple Corps falling to pieces even as the best music of all was providing the soundtrack to the end of a love affair. Not ours with them, but theirs with each other.There have only been two truly important bands in rock and roll. Norman provides ample evidence of the Beatles being the best of the two. The other .... you figure it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read THIS book","review":"If you are a Beatles fan like I am, this is a MUST read.

Calling George Harrison 'an average Guitarist' is frankly ignorant, and his love of Lennon creates a totally biased view point. His insinuations of Lennons involvement in Sutcliffes death, and alleged Homosexual activity are best left to the News Of the World. Finally his mistake in saying that Jason Starkey played for the Who, when in fact it was Zak makes you wonder about the whole integrity of the book ! Yes, overall a rather nasty piece of work dressing itself up as a serious insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Load of Rubbish","review":"It's obvious that Philip Norman was cashing in on the glorified aftermath of Lennon's assassination with his biased comments against Paul and George. John was most certainly the leader of The Beatles in the beginning but Paul steered the band through their greatest hour and George became an equal amongst John and Paul as a songwriter. This is outdated, irrelevant, and based on too much 3rd party information.

I advise you not to spend so much on it. The first 106 pages are where the action is and are interesting, if tame. You can then skip from there to about 10 pages from the end, and you will have read the substance of the book.

The only problem was that I was put off by the writing immediately when the word \\"fey\\" or some variation of it was used three times in the first part to describe Carly and Katie. The dialogue, however, was what forced me to stop reading. Do people actually say, \\"I hope that's going to be in the affirmative?\\" or \\"Oh, very nice indeed.\\" I am twenty-five, close to Katie's age, and i never speak like that.

Not to tell an entire story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Triumph of Awful Writing","review":"Disclaimer: I read this book for work, otherwise I would never have wasted even a moment of my time with it.Barbara Taylor Bradford is a wonderful example of a fairly accurate generalization about publishing: If you want to sell millions of books, you've got a great chance if you're a terrible writer. Her simple-minded plots are what most critics rip apart, but the plots seem strong compared to her dialogue. HINT: If your dialogue doesn't sound like natural speech, it's probably bad dialogue. And now, two examples....\\"Oh, get along with you Katie, 'tis not important, and I'm feeling much better today.\\"\\"Try not to worry, Katie, me darlin'.

Toward the end I was reading 1 paragraph on every 4 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I have liked some of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books so I was amazed at just how poorly this book was written.

However, there is nothing good to say about this book, so I will say no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of boring facts about Emily Bronte","review":"The book started off well, with close friends and a tragic event. But then Katie goes to England and more than half of the book is her learning about Emily Bronte. Nothing to do with the plot. Then, the mystery is solved in about 10 pages, and it's no one connected with the plot. Awful book. Not Barbara Taylor Bradford's style at all, try her older stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"I've never read a Barbara Taylor Bradford book before, and read this one on a friend's recommendation. For anyone who has read Valley of the Dolls -- does this not remind you of Anne Well's story, plus a murder and minus pill-popping? Maybe it's just me. I liked Valley of the Dolls. I did not like The Triumph of Katie Byrne.

(Not to diminish the seriousness of the issue) ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Triumph of Katie Byrne","review":"It was suppose to be a mystery but it wandered through England on a totally unconnected line. The conclusion was very weak on the murder, the murderer ( was not connected to the story) and who was the man the victim had been with before the rape. Too many loose ends and a very boring middle.

I strongly recommend not wasting your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the Author or Publisher employ a Proof Reader?","review":"Dollar signs must have been in the eyes of the Author and Publisher of this amateurish attempt at a mystery story. Was it a fourth grade assignment for a young relative of Barbara's?There was no cohesiveness (I don't have a Proofreader either) to this book. The characters were both undeveloped and unbelievable. The only amusing part was when one of the very boring characters in England was described as a double of the author of the book. Thank goodness I took this out of my local library; therefore, costing me nothing but time. Shame on you, Barbara."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mystery? or Boring!","review":"No twist, no turns, actually boring.

I never look at the reviews until I have read the book as I don't want to risk someone throwing me a spoiler but I wish I had with this one...It took me 4 full weeks to read this one, along with some which were better, and I read 6-7 hours a day in my lovely retirement. the small town cop should, I think, have interviewed all the peers of the two victims in an effort to pin down the murderer. Alec Davenport would have. I thought NRK18 hit the nail on the head when she said there were really 2 books here. I admit I enjoyed the information (if true) on the Bronte family.

Obviously not. Not only is the solution to the \\"mystery\\" of who attacked the girls absolutely ridiculous, the characters in this book do not behave anywhere near \\"true-to-life\\".

If you like that, then I suggest \\"Katie Byrne\\" very highly. Taylor-Bradford drags the reader on a long stint of Yorkshire, mercilessly. To me, it seems that there will never be a point.

Luckily for me, I didn't buy the book but got it from the library. I won't go into a rehash of the plot, you can get that above.

As I started reading about Katie Byrne and the rest of the cast, I was intrigued by the events, when Kaite's friends were attacked in the woods, but as soon as we join Katie 10 yrs later, I think that it went downhill from there. This book was extremely boring. It took all I had just to finish. It really could have gone somewhere with the all the characters that she introduced. One of them could have been the killer but it ended being someone completely unknown. Many times I wondered what the point was through the entire book, there was no plot in my opinion.

I closed that bible up and put it on my shelf and went back to my regular bible that has pages that will not bleed.

The size of the Bible (the dimensions) are also much better than the original editions of this Bible. As a result, however, the print size is a bit smaller, but still very readable (and I wear bi-focals). I like the fact that with a reference Bible you get to discover the treasures of the Word for yourself,rather than depending on someone else's comments.

I do however have one reservation: having been a Christian for only 4 years, I lack much information concerning historical background which I get as I read footnotes in a variety of study Bibles I use; also, I read commentaries.

There are pages to list your own personal deductions so that later you have your own notes right where you need them. You are encouraged to title each book as well as the chapters as you study, so that you will have those notes when you go back and wish to remember. This Bible shows you how to study properly and accurately this God-breathed text so that you will understand His ways and directions as were written. It does not promote a particular doctrine, but God's doctrine which is what the Bible is all about. Read it for yourself and be lifted up in your soul!C. Hopler from North Carolina :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent study Bible","review":"There is allot of narrative and cross references.

The final straw was when my e-mail got stuck in an \\"error report\\" loop.Un-installing did no good, hence the re-format. Apparently, others have had better luck.

Existen otros diccionarios y suplementos con términos en copto. Pero sólo en este se encuentra casí todo, Sino aparece, puede ser que no exista. Es una obra clásica, del año 1.934. Se supone que se actualiza con el tiempo, si bien minimamente, cosas de las lenguas muertas. Sólo la aparición de un corpus documental importante haría necesaria una actualización más en profundidad. Pero que eso ocurra es difícil. Así que tenemos diccionario para mucho tiempo, es muy posible que cuando acabe este siglo, continue siendo el diccionario de referencia para el copto y sus dialectos.

Amazon was great with the return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the uninitiated !","review":"Excellent book. Concise, reasoned and learned. The authors' opinions about the opponents of the bibles' authenticity are cogent and his devestating attacks on their agendas are, in my opinion, accurate. The only drawback with this book is that if the reader does not have an extensive background in Biblical history/archeology it is a very hard read. Too bad ! A book like this should be available to the average reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Massive Maximalist Counterattack","review":"K.A. Kitchen is one of the most learned and well-read orientalists in the world today, and his effort in this book shows it. This is the kind of broadside against minimalizing tendencies that many have been waiting for. OROT is thorough and detailed, but covers so much that it leaves you wanting more. Upon finishing it the reader will likely come to the realization that the subjects for nearly every chapter require whole volumes in and of themselves. Sometimes I wish Kitchen had divided the book into separate parts so that he could make space for fleshing out his arguments more. Nonetheless this is an enjoyable and useful read that will bring students of Old Testament/Ancient Near Eastern studies to understand why maximalists can't be dismissed with the wave of a hand as merely ignorant fundamentalists or \\"red state\\" evangelicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative Evangelical Fundamentalist","review":"Mr Kenneth Kitchen is a conservative, evangelical christian fundamentalist. He is also very knowledgable of the subject matter of this book. Unfortunately his brand of christianity appears to lead him to select only evidence that supports his beliefs. This book is about belief rather than objective research.It is religion and rather poor quality history. The result is regratable because the author clearly has the basic knowledge to tackle the subject. Unfortunately his religion constantly obstructs objectivity. A disappointing work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous ending to the \\"Star\\" Trilogy","review":"Jilted Prince Che Vedla decides to go incognito on Earth and meets Ian Hamilton's Twin sister Ilana. Che and Ilana are powerfully attracted from the start, but Che has to convince Ilana that of his sincerity because of political reasons. Ilana is a B'Kah Princess and Che's bethrothed was stolen by B'Kah Prince Ian, her twin. Che and Ilana eventually work it out with the help of family and friends and have their happy ending. This book was not as dramatic or strong as the others in the trilogy, but it was so much fun and wraps up the story of the B'Kah family just nicely. Che has a reformed brother in this book and I wonder if Susan Grant will revisit this universe again with more info and stories on the Vedlas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Series!","review":"This book was EXCELLENT! While I enjoyed The Star King and The Star Prince, with each book getting better and better, this one was the best by far. The chemistry between Ché and Illana was hot right from the start, you knew they would get together, and the fun was in watching how hard they both struggled against fate and the Vash Nadah. The outcome with Klark, Ché's brother, was a surprise, but very fitting. I know this is probably the last book in the series, but I hate to see it end. I will definitely be searching out more titles by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Literary Novel Catalogued as Science Fiction","review":"This is truly a one of its kind story(although translated from French) that you must read to truly appreciate the emotive aspects of love and lust,loss and humanity redeemed.The premise of the narrative is really unigue: an easygoing country squire who abhorred the cruel sport of fox hunting,himself witnessed the transformation of a cornered fox into a beautiful woman.The poignant story depicted vividly in 'John Fowles'style how our man himself transformed,set about determinedly to save, protect,nuture and educate this innocent human vixen,eventually....(Not to spoil your reading pleasure)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best effort","review":"A bit boring.

I believe that you need to read her books in order. I read her 2nd book first so did not get a handle on the characters, which were explained in her first book.

Just as fresh, well written, and hilarious as Laurie's first two. Her writing style continues to mature, even as it retains the unparalleled uniqueness that is Laurie Notaro. Met her at a booksigning for this book. She is beautiful inside and out. She read some items from her fourth book - can hardly wait for it since we devoured this third one in 24 hours. You rock Laurie."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's done it again","review":"Laurie Notaro is back again, delighting me and her other readers with her third book in as many years. Her writing is maturing and her life is just as funny as her stories in \\"Idiot Girls\\". The story about her trip to Disneyland made me put the book away so that I wouldn't embarrass myself on public transportation! I wish that Laurie got the credit she deserved - unlike David Sedaris, Laurie keeps coming up with fresh, new material that allows you to feel like you know her and makes you wish you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny At All","review":"Wow, this is what passes as humour? I love Arrested Development, David Sedaris, Augusten Burroughs so I thought I would find this book funny. The author is annoying and tries to make everything funny when it is not. I feel bad for the people that have to deal with her. Her idea of a punchline/resolution is pathetic. I can't believe she is as popular as she is. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book is terrible. I couldn't finish it because I was wasting my time with her jokes that were not funny. She just seems to hate herself and is a cynic about everything and there is nothing timely or clever about her humor. Skip it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very forced.","review":"I purchased this book on a whim and was thoroughly disappointed (there goes my future spontaneous purchases!). Couldn't even get through it because it's attempts at humor were so flat, they were almost insulting. Thank God for target's return policy; I exchanged the book for Susan Gilman's 'Hypocrite...', which I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this gal!","review":"Laurie Notaro's books are a must-read for the smart-alecks in the crowd. Smart, witty, clever...she fits the bill. Make a note of it...anything by Laurie Notaro is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-read companion to Idiot Girls'","review":"Notaro broke into the essay scene with the amazing Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club. That's a must-read for anyone between the ages of 21 and 40 and should be everyone's intro to Notaro. Notaro's later books, such as this one, focus a bit more on married life, and the appeal according shrinks to the higher side of that age range.This is a great companion to Idiot Girls' because Notaro writes about the days when she wrote that book, got turned down by hundreds of publishers, had a rocky time with her newspaper job, self-published, and then finally got a break. As a fan of her first work, hearing the backstory behind bringing to to market was really amazing.The book is about much than just publishing her first book, of course, and all of Notaro's misadventures entertain the reader, as expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Comparison to Idiot Girls Adventure Club","review":"Trying way to hard to come off as hilarious. Here's a hint Laurie: the harder you try the less humorous you & your stories appear it's that simple. NEXT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale","review":"Nothing in this book is fresh; it's all been done before and I believe it was in a comic strip called \\"Cathy\\". Each chapter is like every rant I've ever read (twice) in an email or on Craigslist, strung together with a few poo poo words for humor. It doesn't even have characters, just recycled and all-too-familiar aspects of a working woman's life: the editor who cannot write, the manager who just had a baby, the struggle between career and family, a crazy mother, a new age friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have read in years","review":"Bought this book based on all the positive reviews, but I have to say that it's terrible. Poorly written, predictable, and outlandish. The author just comes across as if she's trying too hard. Nothing feels authentic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Except for One Chapter","review":"I LOVE this book. I love all of her books. She's HILARIOUS. Makes me laugh so hard that I almost throw up. However, I didn't love the chapter about not having children. I think parts of it are true (I have kids and I don't answer the phone when my friends call anymore, mostly b/c my toddler son will scream about not holding the phone himself so I won't be able to hear one word my friend says), but it didn't make me laugh to think that her wonderful sense of humor is not going to be passed on. So that was sad. Other than that, the book was outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Laugh Out Loud Read","review":"One of the best books I've read in a while. It was wildly entertaining; most likely because I could (unfortunately) relate to much of her antics and thought processes. I found myself laughing out loud on a crowded commuter train while reading the story on \\"The Sims.\\" Because it's a collection of short stories, it's easy to pick up and read. If you're having a rough week dealing with the Real World of relationships and work, I highly recommend reading this to take your mind off of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious!","review":"I bought this book last summer and didn't really get a chance to read it as I had bought a pile of books for summer reading. Having more time lately I jumped at the chance to read more than just the first page. I could barely put it down. This is the first book that I have read by her and I'm buying another. My boyfriend thought I was crazy when he came home and saw me laughing hysterically on the couch. I'd read passages out loud and we agreed that I sound a lot like her on some things. One of my favorite parts was the section on why she shouldn't have children. If you're friends won't buy the book, give it as a gift. They'll thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On par with her first book!","review":"Following up her second set of essays,Autobiography of a Fat Bride: True Tales of a Pretend Adulthood, Notaro has found a nice rhythm for her essay collections. This is a funny collection - with some genuine, burst into loud laughter sections. \\"The Sims\\" essay in particular stands out. This collection, though, touches on some personal issues, giving the collection a more memoir-feel as Notaro discusses her choice to not have children, her first book deal. Her second book, though it does deal with some family issues, stays on a more superficial level. After three collections of essays, some of the jokes begin to border on redundant, too. This is definitely a fun read, but I am hoping that her fourth book will return to a more light-hearted and funny feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"get what you pay for","review":"Purchased for what I would consider a steal. About two compact discs. Looks nice and packs ok. However, there are two non-connected aluminum stays and no frame sheet.

The suspension is very comfortable and fits youths and smaller women but also fits my 6 ft. 2 in., 200 lbs body very well. My torso is actually longer than is recommended by the manufacturer but I still find it comfortable. This purchase was for my second and third Pinnacles, for other family members.

Come along for this expansive journey through the Underground Railroad and be mesmerized by what the people of this era endured to achieve freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A competent introduction for small children: helping kids to empathize with slaves","review":"With a fast-paced narrative and a emphatic tone, this book helps children to see slavery from the perspective of those who experienced it most brutally. For better for for worse it softens the horror considerably, making slavery awful, but hardly the abomination that it was. I suppose for little ones it might be better that way. The illustrations are merely adequate and the text has a fairly casual tone. At times the grammar seems almost childlike. Maybe the language is meant to help draw young ones into the story. The overall effect of the book, though, is to offer small children some sense of what it was like to be a slave and to try to escape its horrors."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what xpected","review":"the straps are unevenly sown (one is higher that the other) making for uneven adjustment points, yes i get technical but this is suppose to be Jansport!

Yes, there is a lot of space, but i find myself digging into the pockets just to get my cell phone or my ipod out for my daily commute. I also love red backpacks, and I loved how vibrant the color was on the Amazon page. I was extremely dissapointed when the bag arrived and it was more orange than red. The straps are also rubbing up against my neck and the plastic clips that hold the straps in place are to easy to adjust. Meaning, if i hit them by accident when taking off the backpack it messes up the settings.

The fourth one is on the top and has a 6.5 inch wide zippered opening that is 6 inches deep. It is perfect size for an Ipod, cellphone and other small items things like chapstick, It also has two small compartments in the medium pouch that are good for a small camera or other items that you want to keep safe. It is made out of a good material that appears strong and lightweight and it rinses out well in case the lid on your lunch isn't as tight as you thought it was when you left the house.

I knew that Arius was one of the first heretics rebuked by \\"The Church\\" and at Arius3D we seemed to be viewed as heretics in the world of 3D graphics so the name was born.It was with great delight that I cam across a book about the original heretic. From cover to cover, the book provides a fascinatring look at the early Chirch and it's gravitation towards dogma and away from the pure Christian message. I was enthralled by the telling of the tale of Arius, the man who stood against the rising tide of the newly founded 'corporate church'. Pre-dating the Cathars, Arius takes us down the road of understanding how the Church began to formulate its approach to creating and maintaining control over the 'Christian message'.Excellent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor teaching book","review":"I purchased this book to learn javascript, but it ispoorly designed and fails to lead you along in aprogressive way.

The product specifications need to include OD (outside diameter) hose information, not just ID (inside diameter) so that you can tell whether it will fit your hose before you order.If the description was accurate(which is not provided even on Stanley website), I would give it 3 stars (it's ok) because of price.

Then he started receiving email notifications in December saying the item was delayed. Next Amazon.com CANCELLED our order with no attempt of appeasement. They just flat cancelled our order and left it at that!!! To add insult to injury, they erased all the order history on the order as if to 'cover their tracks.'

The book seems to have come from the -publish or perish- world of academe. Need solid information to do the real work ahead, don't look for Nirvana.

Categorization into seven steps and further classification of them makes this book very interesting and easy to follow. The case studies and examples are excellent, however it seems that most of them move around some 10-15 companies. Although, this book is targeted to top executives but the language is so easy that any one can comprehend and get benefited. I found the E-volution and E-strategy topics very useful. They provide very good insight on how a company should view and plan e-business initiative.

The metaphors and stories add a pithy touch that make this an entertaining read.

Dr. Barnes was a very wise man. If you have difficulty with your doctor actually diagnosing a thyroid condition, buy this book and give it to him/her. The way thyroid disease is diagnosed now isn't what it used to be. Doctors now rely on lab tests without taking into account a patient's symptoms. Dr. Barnes was around in the old days when doctors relied on patient history, thorough exam and symptoms, and he was around when the TSH test came about. He was in a very good position to determine which is the best way to properly diagnose this condition. The book is reader friendly and has a wealth of information. I disagree with another reviewer that he didn't get into why people develop this condition.

In his early days, the pictures in the book reveal an extremely attractive man and so it is hard to figure out why he basically lets himself become a gigolo to old rich women. There are also a few details I just did NOT want to know... such as him being surprised at enjoying oral stimulation from an 80 year old woman who wore dentures (note - he is about 30 at the time). Yuck! I would be embarassed if I were him but then, he does not seem to embarass easily if it will enrich him.

Having to type this in every time you make a phone call does not make sense.2) When you have received a voice-mail message or missed a call, there needs to be a notification on the main screen.3) A keylock would be nice so you can put the phone in your pocket.4) A simple text only web browser for getting past agreement pages at Internet cafe's and hotels would make the phone useable on the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"it does make skype calls, but pretty cheesy","review":"incoming audio quality is reasonable enough.outgoing audio quality is lousy for most people I've talked to.Most ask me to please please go back to using the computer.My attempts at improving audio quality for people by plugging a headset into the 2.5 headset socket failed, because no sound comes out of the headphone, I've seen several other people about this, not sure if that feature is just dead on all phones or just a number of them.the backlighting for the keypad is really cheesy too, it fails to light both outer rows of keys properly.I have no complaints about battery life so far, nor does it bother me that I can't use hotspots outside of my house, because I use it instead of cordless phone at home.

It does what it claims to do but not very well. First problem is that the battery power is horrible. Maybe 4 or 5 hours max, so you have to leave it plugged in all the time. Then my contacts worked for a day or so but now it hasn't shown anyone in my contact list for 3 months. It must be corrupted but that doesn't keep the phone for preventing me from calling for 5 minutes everytime I start it because it is \\"downloading contacts\\".

I have listed to Winger IV probably around 35 times or so. It grows on you and doesn't get old. IMO, \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" far and away is Kip Winger's best song ever; it's an anthem to our GIs written from their point of view that, had Winger had the popularity it had in the late 80s/early 90s, would have been on heavy MTV rotation and a top 20 hit. \\"Four Leaf Clover\\" features a great rythm guitar riff.

I enjoyed the first three records alot but with this latest attempt they have lost the luster that got them that first record deal.

The album is is amazing, every song is great. You must buy this one. Not only if you are a Winger fan,Buy it, you will experience a sense of fine art work on rock.I'm sure that Winger was not intended to catch the attention of kids under 17 years..not, not the case, 'cause an album like this must be to mature rockers.

It is incredibly imaginative and must have been pretty ground-breaking at the time having combined animation with a level of gore, nudity and an adult-target audience which previously hadn't been seen with animated films. The plot of the movie is hard to explain because it jumps around between seemingly completely different stories, but the underlying theme is a powerful green orb is which is present in each of the stories (sounds stupid I know). Quite simply one of the best movies I have ever seen.

The cab driver was cool, Den was awsome, Captain Stern was just plain funny, B-17 was mysterious, the druggie aliens were hilarious, Taarna probobly broke the world record for most accomplished without making a sound, and the Lost fottage \\"Neverwhere Land\\" gave me a funny feeling that I will never forget.

But more importantly, 'Heavy Metal' is more a visual piece than anything else.I wasn't very impressed with this film. It seems to be more geared to sexually curious 13 year old boys swimming in sweaty jock straps and wet dreams than any real audience. More like an animated issue of Playboy. (Which isn't all that bad) ;-) Let's not forget to mention the varied background tracks from 80's artists like Stevie Nicks or Black Sabbath.

Yet, the stories were each interesting in their own right, and the chance to listen to a little BOC, well, who could resist?The movie, on the whole, held up well. The songs are fun and the stories still bear a stamp of originality that is becoming increasingly rare in modern movies. While I'm sure that, twenty years ago, the large bouncing breasts seemed to be added in just the right measure, there is a bit much of it.

Personally, I believe that meaning 1 applies, but in any case one would need to know more about the history of Mexico. The author's point of view is that of a devout Catholic, but only this point of view can provide an understanding of the subject.In reading this book, one should remember that Miguel Pro was only one of many Mexican martyrs of his time.

It appears that most all Hamilton Beach and Proctor Silex blenders use the same blade base (except one model, per Hamilton Beach's Web site), so this problem is not unique to this particular model. These consumer models are not NSF-certified (per NSF International's certified products database), nor do I expect that they would be certifiable given their odor-absorbing quality.The picture for this particular model is also misleading... there is no way this blender could blend a drink when its pitcher is that full."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked a lot, didn't last!","review":"This blender worked ok. After awhile, it leaked a small amount through the seal. I tried some tricks, like putting butter, or olive oil on the seal, would work for a bit, then would start leaking again.It never made real smooth smoothies, left the ice a bit chunky. Some of the buttons stopped working, so not all speeds were available.It was very sensitive to the liquid to ice proportions or it would just spin and not blend.Recently the motor started to burn out, we ordered one that had mostly good reviews, we'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick but absorbing read","review":"I shot through this book in a few hours but enjoyed it all the same. It is full of Jim Crace's trademark slightly erotic descriptions of otherwise banal objects. I enjoy his ability to describe a situation or scene that would normally be offputting in a manner that renders it strangely alluring. The story itself is relatively simple, a young boy coming of age, but told in this unique backdrop, it stands out from similar tales in its detail and mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book but format of the print is poor","review":"The content is very good but the electronic format was poor in quality and somewhat difficult to read on the iPad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic, a bit disappointing","review":"I had great expectations from the book, but was a bit disappointed when I read it. Although the book covers in great detail the five elements and their characteristics, there is very little information on applying to real cases in terms of identifying the relevant acu points on the body for treatment. This might be an OK book for real beginners, but even for that there are much better books. Overall, a let down for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful!","review":"These folks seem to have cobbled together some VERY basic small business articles and filled in the blanks with the words \\"in Hawaii\\".

I always say its good to own something rather than just having a digital copy. It gives you the sense of ownership and your able to read it over and over again when and where you want. I really enjoyed this manga and hope to acquire the collection in the future. I recommend this manga because like many Shojo it has love as its primary element but it twists it to a humor filled love story that grabs on your emotions and humor like a fat kid for cake. I recommend this to everyone who loves to have a good read and nice time just to pass the time. This manga will make you smile.

A very comprehensive and interesting treatment of what life was like for men and women in Roman colonies during the first century. \\"Life in context\\" and \\"scripture in context\\" are two main objectives. In light of this, some of Paul's troubling statements concerning women have a fresh light shone upon them. The research is in-depth and current. Inscriptons, letters and various other sources were used to verify and validate the cultural context in which Paul lived, moved, and ultimately wrote his epistles. I also liked Dr. Winter's \\"After Paul left Corinth,\\" a somewhat easier read. Both give an excellent glimpse into the lifestyle atmosphere of first century Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Love it!!","review":"I wanted to find a good christian video for my 2yr old.

Still, after getting a strong recommendation, I figured 'what the heck,' so I bought the DVD. What can I say? I was wrong about the series. It's nearly perfect. Afer watching all the episodes, I can say that there's not a dull one in the bunch! I never get tired of looking at Jerri. Classic, classic stuff. Yeah, the DVD needs subtitles and more extras.

Most topics dealt with dealing with peer-pressure or about having an abusive or dysfuncional family member...things that \\"normal\\" people would not find FUNNY!The creators of Strangers With Candy with their warped sense of humor, have obviously been inspired by those humble network specials and have created a witty and politically incorrect comedy sensation. This show has developed a cult following over the past few years, and the release and (successful sales!) of the series on DVD, will further prove that Amy Sedaris, Steven Colbert and friends are some of the true comedic geniuses of their generation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To be young, gifted, and Blank","review":"I have been a fan of this offbeat comedy spin on the ol' after school special since it started in '99. Sadly it is now gone off the air, but at least we have it on dvd. This dvd has the original pilot (elements of which were used for other episodes in the season) and commentary (Amy, Paul, & Steve -- creators/stars) on 4 of the shows, it also has sneak peaks of other Comedy Central shows. The menus and packaging on this two disc set are funny and nicely done. I give it 4 stars and not 5 only b/c I want more extras (behind-the-scenes and commentary on more episodes), but really what more can you ask for when you are getting one of the best shows ever aired? The writing and the acting are superb. Bring on the other 2 seasons Comedy Central!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the Pole and the Hole","review":"I remember catching this strange little show on comedy central quite awhile ago. It starred this old looking lady who was 46 years old and starting her life right where she left off, high school. She was a user, a boozer, and a loser. She was my new hero. Stephen Colbert, before his Daily Show claim to fame, showed that he is a comedic genius. Jerri Blank and company have created some of the best comedic farse and satire that I have seen in a very long time. This DVD is quite a little miracle, never did I think I would be able to rewatch this show again. It's like meeting and old friend after a long time apart. Never has a main character been more repugnant and loveable at the same time. Come join us won't you. Don't be afraid, take candy from strangers.

After all the cheesily formulated, badly scripted, family oriented after-school dramas and sitcoms which has been pumped out year after year - trying to re-educate the impressionable youth (particularly rich white suburban kids) about finding a true sense of direction and morality, etc, whilst also trying to be 'entertaining' for braindead Christian families - this show was just begging to be made. If the style of humour in shows such as South Park and Family Guy appeals to you, chances are you'll probably enjoy this one. If you don't end up loving it you'll at least appreciate the satire, characterization and randomness all in impeccable timing. One episode alone contains enough original and biting material to stay in your head for weeks. Just watch for Jerri's rubber-faced expressions and reactions - a killer!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap as dirt, with nonsensical plot points , like A.S.S.'s","review":"Yes, After School Specials. This is probably one of the shows that is better on VHS because the worn tapes because so much funnier given their low production look and feel. Given that, it's one of the funniest shows ever because, like all sketch comedy, it goes too far, but it's satiric aim is dead on. The only reason this series didn't take off is that it's dramatic effect is so arcane that many who see it for the first time will be shocked, or disgusted by what they see and not watch it again. Well, even those who like the show are sometimes shocked and disgusted, but the show more than makes up for it by being absolutely hysterical and featuring performers who can improvise on a dime and have wits like razors. The same can be said of the writers. When you combine these two elements you get a timeless show and this is the beginning.

I was also lured by some Internet buzz that suggested that this film was a forgotten 80s gem from the days when comedies were not afraid to be unabashedly R-rated. Well, it is kind of interesting to see again how raunchy teen comedies could get away with being back then, but this movie is even worse than I remembered. Scatman Crothers is a bright spot and Baio is likeable, but this is strictly the type of film you watch on cable at 2:00 in the morning for fifteen minutes or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had those powers in high school","review":"First, this is not a very good movie, basically it stinks. The best part of the whole movie is when Baio uses the powers he magically obtained to remove the clothing from Heather Thomas and other chicks. The big prom scene in the end is funny. What high school kid would not like to be able to make the clothes of women magically come off. It is basically a ripoff of Carrie."},{"rating":"2","title":"biggest regret of my life","review":"One of the biggest regrets of my life was being in a video store about 10 years ago and seeing a new copy of Zapped for 12 bucks. I had the money but decided to buy beer with it. It still stings (but not as bad since you can get anything on Amazon now) The hunter doesn't hunt for the kill he hunts for the hunt. The Baio/Ames comedy tandem rivals Akroyd/Belushi in terms of comic timing and hilarity. One of my all-time favorite scenes is in this moving with an under the influence Scattman Crothers and some sort of gun that fires hot dogs or baloney (can't remember)"},{"rating":"2","title":"See that clothing fly off!!","review":"Zapped!, well what can I say. You have to take this movie very lightly and just sit back and enjoy. Sure it's corny, but sometimes, no, most times, you just need to put your brain on hold and just wallow in cheesiness. Scott Baio is pretty impressive as the high school nerd who gains psychic powers. Every boys dreams are fulfilled as he lets loose his powers on school bullies and strips girls at his school, which is handy if the prom queen happens to be Heather Thomas. Speaking of which, yes he strips,splits, and tears at her clothing enough to sustain any guy's interest and during the prom, you just know that her pretty dress is going to end up in pieces.

Burroughs that, in my opinion, comes close to the absolute genius of \\"Naked Lunch.\\" A fragmented novel of strange vignettes, loosely incorporating the theme of the exterminator and his grim trade as its focus, the book reads like a hallucinatory nightmare version of the Sunday comics from an unseen world better left undiscovered. Brilliant, funny, sad and disturbing--everything grteat writing should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational Vietnam War-era literature.","review":"This book is a period piece, but man, what a period piece. Essentially a collection of short stories surrounding the \\"revolution\\" of the 1960s, Burroughs tears into the Military, the Right, the morality police, the War on Drugs, technology, and politics. Each story uses Burroughs's violent fantasy to tell a morality tale and bring each target of his ire into sharp relief before tearing it down utterly. Not as chilling as Naked Lunch or as sweeping as Cities of the Red Night. A good book for someone who is just getting started reading Burroughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a fan of anything Burroughs","review":"William S. Burroughs had some brilliant works. Although some of them are a little too drug induced (Naked Lunch for example), I still found them enjoyable. This is a collection of incomplete stories or sketches & shorts. This includes, The Priest They Called Him which is one of my favorites from Burroughs. If you are a fan of Burroughs works this is a must have. I found this and Junky to be some of Burroughs easier reads. Interestingly enough, Burroughs did a reading of The Priest They Called him with Kurt Cobain supplying basically feedback as a background noise back in the day. I am glad I own that CD as it is one of my favorites from Burroughs and they are both now dead. Just remember one thing going into this, it's not an actual novel. The stories don't connect and not all of them are finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"W.S. Burroughs Exterminator is worth reading","review":"This book is a loosely-related collection of stories by the great William S. Burroughs. In typical Burroughs fashion, the stories are a bit hard to follow, but full of great description and enjoyable, although somewhat depraved, imagery in stories such as The Lemondrop Kid. It seems to reach into Burroughs youth, apparently drawn on from his experiences as an exterminator and also has a story or two with anti-war themes. Generally a good read and a must for the Burroughs fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story \\"Exterminator\\" within the book is magnificent.","review":"The story within the book, \\"Exterminator\\", caused shifts in my consciousness that have not been rivalled to this day. It moved me from one world of thought to another imperceptibly and then back again, almost before I realized any change had occurred at all. Kinda like the channels being changed on a tv, but the thread of the story is continuous throughout, even as the channels are changing! The odd thing is you don't realize you've been \\"watching\\" another channel until the set has been switched back to the original! All via the genius of William S. Burroughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burroughs disconnects","review":"...and in the case of \\"Exterminator!\\" that's not a good thing. Granted, this sloppy collection of short stories stitched together as a novel will appeal to fans of the author's fragmented, \\"Naked Lunch\\" style (run-on sentences, nonsensical incidents, etc.)... but will likely turn anyone else off. The first hundred pages, especially, consist of some of the most alienated, distant, and boring prose I've ever read. For the rest of the novel, however, there are poignant and poetic passages relating to politics, the Vietnam war, and racial and sexual discrimination, among other things, so \\"Exterminator!\\" isn't entirely worthless, but it's a far cry from Burroughs' best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donal Macintyre THE WEATHER","review":"I'm a science teacher in California and have previewed in detail this work. For myself, I found the way Donal Macintyre organized the themes was ingeneous and caused the whole concept of weather to come alive to the point of being able to feel it and experience it in a powerful way.

Fisk played them - as well as the rest of the works on that album - brilliantly. It was inspiring. It was everything you wanted and expected Paganini's music to be. The younger Fisk was definitely a master-guitarist worth watching closely.No one can say what happened since then, except for the evident increase in \\"speed\\" and decrease in quality of interpretation. Mr. Fisk seems to believe \\"wowing\\" his audiences with speed is everything. To the point that no one notices he blurs so many notes it sounds like an amplified bee's buzz in a cathedral. So be it, he also wins the Indianapolis 500 as far as I'm concerned. If that's what you like, go for this CD. If you like intelligent musical interpretations, spend your money elsewhere. One star, because with an artist of Fisk's stature one should expect much better, and because you can't give zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"ordered for my son","review":"this was ordered for my son's project and it was just what we needed. no problems"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying Education","review":"I LOVE geography, and found this film incredibly educational!

This DVD has been, unfortunately, updated. The original, though slower-paced, focused more on Maurice and Katia Kraft. I recall more detail on volcanoes and a more compelling personal story. I especially miss the scenes in the acid lake and Maurice's stories of them surviving longer than their colleagues. It is surprising to see this information cut, especially in light of the Kraft's passing. 4 1/2 stars for the DVD and 5 stars for the VHS.NOVA's documentary on the Mt. Pinatubo eruption and the decision to evacuate and Volcano VHS go wonderfully with Dante's Peak. They look to be the source material for the Hollywood blockbuster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"I bought this for my six year old daughter, who has an interest in Volcanoes.

Actually, it was very small and overpriced. I was very disappointed in the size because it could not hold more than a couple of bottles. I had to keep using the original shelf unit in addition to the this purchase. This two-shelf unit purchase was so small that it easily fit inside the original shelves that hung in the shower. The only reason I ordered a new shelf unit was because the white plastic coating is peeling off the original brackets and shelves.I would not buy any items for sale on your website after this because the ad was deceptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I found this again!!","review":"I found one of these in a Target a couple of years ago and absolutely loved it!

It has worked on all my pimples from whiteheads to blackheads to deep pimples. I basically use it on the pimple (when it first comes up) until the pimple is gone. I have had to replace my tip once during this time (it lasts about 90 uses before it needs to be replaced...you will know because it shows one blue light left to warn you that you have almost used up the tip life...once you use all the tip life, it won't start again until you replace the tip). I am so happy that a product is finally out there for pimples that does not dry out my skin...and it actually works! Zeno is well worth the initial price and the $35 for replacement tips too."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"It doesn't make my pimple go away over night. It might reduce some healing time. The treatment cartridge runs out too quick!! You think 60 count is a lot but it's really not. I bought another one for my friend as a gift. It didn't even wanna turn on. I had to send it back. I called the number on the box. Their customer service sucks, they never picked up the phone or return my phone call ever. I had to send it back to amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"About that price tip...again","review":"Yes, the tip on the $149 version from walgreens is only good for 50 cycles, but you can buy the replacement tip good or 60 cycles for $25 from walgreens. That's still less than the $199 version with 90 cycles. You can even buy the $33 recharge tip with 90 cycles and still come out better by buying at walgreens....Update 10/1 - I ordered and received the zeno from walgreens and it came with the 90 day tip even though the product description on the walgreen site indicated 50. And no, the tip didn't come with half remaining i.e. the tip was a full 90 day cycle tip."},{"rating":"2","title":"When it works it works GREAT!","review":"The first 2 pimples I used Zeno on reduced in size almost immediately. They were the deep cystic variety. I was ecstatic. Unfortunately now that I have used the product for a month it seems like the gadget only works on approx. 40-50% of my total pimples. I believe this is because my acne condition is caused mostly by hormones and not necessarily by bacteria on the skin.That said, I consider the Zeno an important part of my aresenal for clear skin. It's definately not the miracle cure but it definately IS worth purchasing. Frequent light to medium grade peels (like the Cosmedix purity peel and timeless peel) have done wonders for my skin condition. You have to have these peels done at a spa and the price is typically high ($200-300) but the outcome is great. You can also purchase some great glycolic/lactic peels here on amazon from cellbone.Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ginger tea (in a bag)","review":"I can only make better ginger tea by boiling real ginger. this stuff is the bee's knees.

I did this twice over the course of a week, but never received a call back. Thinking they might be having a phone or voice mail problem, I then send an e-mail. Again, I have gotten no response.

The design is wonderful, by the time you've read the book, you've written your resume. One of my favorite parts was the chapter on Resume Eliminators. It steers you clear of mistakes you might never have known you were making. And the Peanut Butter Principle! I never knew I could make myself look so good, and it's completley honest! What I really love about this book is it's not just a bunch of forms that everyone has seen a million times. It's a system, put down in a clear and simple manner that allows a person to write a truly exceptional resume, in a relativley short amount of time. And it's not a long, drawn out, boring, hard to read manual. It's easy, it's GREAT! Good for you Ms. Hill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this series! Only wish could find more to read like this.","review":"I happened upon this series totally by accident. Found the first book at a jumble sale with pb's 25 cents each. Luckily it didn't say anything on the cover about it being a trilogy cause I probably wouldn't have bought it. Did pitch a hissy fit when I reached the end of the 1st book BUT immediately went into \\"find the other books\\"mode and didn't stop till I had the series. Honestly - I usually peter out about half way thru the 2nd book in a fantasy trilogy and finishing either a trilogy or a series in this genre is unusual for me. Knowing every detail of a \\"new\\" world, learning a new language, dealing with names with lots of xx's and pt's, wl's, etc., plus 5 or more familes with 20 or more members each, tends to turn reading into a chore rather than a pleasure imho. This one sucked me in and took me for a wonderful ride. My only negative is I am totally disappointed that Mr. Zicree has not written any more books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Good read. 3rd and final book in a series.

Everything you need whatever your level of garden experience to plan a landscape of any size including native plants. Great ideas for problem sites, too!Clear, easy to understand, divided by geographic region in the front, and by plant type in the plant list section (annual, grass, shrub, etc.)in the back.

Outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"A worthwhile book, because it includes future attractions that have not yet opened. I recently saw the Tower of Terror being built, and heard one of the Winnie the Pooh ride creators talk about its creation, and I can't wait until they're completed, so it was great to read more about them in this book. Like I just learned about a themed resort that is to be built in China (not by Disney) on 2800 acres on three miles of beachfront, now being designed by a leading firm, which will be built around a fictional narrative written by a writer named Craig Furnas.

He has never actually had to live the live of a survivalist. He even states in several parts that the \\"been there, done that\\" crowd, meaning survivors in Beruit and other places say that his ideas are not practical or even feasable.Another disturbing shortcoming is that Rasgnar switches between urban and rural survival when it is convienent or he needs to sidestep a problem.From the standpoint of a homeless veteran who has to live the life of a survivalist everyday, I can say that none of his ideas are practical or even feasable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Times City Survival Guide","review":"In his book, Ragnar Benson outlines specific, and essential, city survival techniques for hard times living. Based upon his personal survival experiences in Germany after World War I, he educates the reader on the necessity of preparing for food, and other supply shortages. He offers a unique perspective, and presents practical ideas for personal, and family preparations. His Rule of 3's is something I had never heard of before; and is worth the price of the book alone.

It's definately worth the purchase, really poppy but also really interestingly produced, with a raw, lo-fi, almost \\"punk rock\\" aesthetic. One of my favorite tracks on here is \\"Yo Yo\\" - a groovy old-school house groove with distorted highs and sing-along, vocoded, Prince-y lyrics. Actually, Prince is like a major influence on this album, which is just bursting with sex and style. Yeah, it's close to Daft Punk, but BJ write actual songs (most tracks on this have full lyrics), as opposed to simple house workouts. It's a fun, diverse LP that takes in Spanish guitar, latin house, overblown outer-space soul, ragga, ska and hip-hop. Also, for DJs, on the vinyl they added bonus beats at the beginning and end of most tracks to make them easier to mix. So there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Overrated","review":"This is not a _bad_ album, it is an OK album. You would think, however, after reading many of the pre-release reviews, that it had been transmitted by god to the ears of us mortals.

Yo-Yo has to be the worst song that I have heard in quite some time. Throughout the album there is an overriding cacophony of blips and bleeps that creates a choppy flow.

Really, it's not nearly as bad as the haters say or quite as good as its fans claim. From \\"Rendez-Vu\\" on through \\"Red Alert\\", the album never once fails to be incredible. The rest of the album isn't as good as that, but it has two great moments (\\"Always Be There\\" and \\"Bingo Bango\\") that make you keep listening. It's not a perfect album, but there are at least five classic moments (\\"Rendez-Vu\\", \\"Yo-Yo\\", \\"Jump N' Shout\\", \\"Red Alert\\", and \\"Bingo Bango\\") with several other good parts as well. If you like house music, this is a good buy - ignore what eveybody else says :-). It's almost as good as Daft Punk's \\"Homework\\", so if you liked that give this a shot.

Having heard the great tracks 'Red Alert' & 'Rendez Vu' on the radio sealed the purchase. But 6 months on and this CD has failed to grow on me as a whole. About the first half of the album is good danceable material but the second half just seems like real filler stuff. Unfortunatly it's terribly over-hyped.

Calling this CD \\"techno\\" is kind of misleading...the style is something that I haven't heard before. Not quite Prodigy, nor Chem Bros, nor Moby, nor FatBoy Slim, nor Orbital. Or anything else.Needless to say, it sucks. Okay, so it's not that bad, but I recommend looking for singles of \\"Rendez-Vu\\" and \\"Red Alert\\".

But there's a hell of a lot else happening on this CD. Of course, the big songs ('Red Alert', 'Rendez-Vu' and 'Jump and Shout') were what made Remedy big in the first place and will probably get you hooked initially, along with 'Always be there', which would have to be one of the most erotic songs of 1999.

After shooting out her TV he chases her upstairs where she locks herself in her bedroom.For the rest of the book Sally and James engage in a battle of wills.

Personally, I wouldn't recommend this novel for someone of similar taste or interest. I questioned why the author chose this odd venue to explore how our childhood experiences form our personality. It held my interest, especially with \\"the novel within a novel\\" approach, but mainly because I wondered where the author was heading and then began hoping the plot would take a different turn at the end. Quite disappointed. It was simply too odd for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good after a little work done to it.","review":"I gave this product 4 stars because When we got this the black part was painted farther up onto the chrome than the picture shows.

There are a few personal stories littered throughout, helping to drive home the points. Quite a handful of graphics are included - filling up a LOT of space in this 96-page book.

This one marks the debut of \\"The Nanny\\" actor Daniel Davis as Moriarty. For those of you who ever read Holmes; Moriarty was his nemesis. Daniel Davis delivers as the episode's villain. There are a few good scenes with Dr. Pulaski. She tells Data that he can't be creative and only solve mysteries that are variations on the ones he's read. She argues that Data is incapable of being creative. Data more than proves that she is wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not elementary.It's not even entertainment!","review":"Based on some prior reviews I bought this.

Great price and value, at least for now, I will update if this changes. The waffle design can trap dirt and if that is a concern just turn them waffle-side up.

It allows students access to primary source material which would otherwise be too voluminous for easy consumption in an introductory setting.

Some text originally written inside gray boxes are now very difficult to read, and the detailed text is blurry.On quality alone, this is not worth the $... they are asking for.

Since the order of the letter in the Russian and English is different, this makes it a pain looking up for words.2. There is no \\"visual aid\\" (like tabs, or cut outs, or such)to speed up search for words -- you need to make your own tabs and stick them to pages3.

I flipped through it before shipping it to him and found the vocabulary quite comprehensive, as compared to the tattered one he had when I visited him and for which this one was intended to replace, as it clearly has. He loves the U.S. so I thought this translation dictionary most appropriate for improving his English vocabulary.

Excellent find!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the price, I expected better","review":"For a dictionary priced in the same vicinity as the Oxford Russian-English, Katzner fails to deliver the quality. Grammatical forms are, as a rule, not provided. Idiomatic examples are paltry. Worst of all, Katzner perpetuates some of the mistranslations from the Soviet-era Smirnitsky, from which he evidently copied uncritically. Katzner is adequate for most students, but if you're willing to settle for a dictionary that will often leave you high and dry and at times mislead you entirely, why not choose one of the much cheaper mass-produced titles? Why pay Oxford prices for Berlitz quality?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Russian-English dictionary I have ever used","review":"This is by far the best dictionary we have ever found.

I have a paperback version and large sections of dictionary fell out in less than 6 months. I have never had a book disintegrate in this way before! It is now a terrible pain to turn the pages which are constantly falling out of the book onto the floor. I then have to reorder a couple hundred pages one by one.

But save your money, or, better yet, use it to buy the Oxford Russian Dictionary. You can easily cope with British spelling (e.g. centre) and you'll find a much more useful dictionary. I find it remarkable that a modern (1994) dictionary purporting to be based on American English completely omits words such as \\"Internet\\", \\"download\\", \\"e-mail\\", to say nothing of all the acronyms associated with computers.

Mine has been in this sorry state for years and I've actually lost a few pages of words beginning with \\"ka\\"! Kak im ne stydno??

It has no signatures, no threaded binding, so the pages that are merely glued in tend to fall out after repeated opening and closing of the book. This type of binding is acceptable on a short cheap paperback novel that you'll read one time, but on a thousand-page dictionary that you want to consult for years?! Language dictionaries are opened and closed thousands of times and must have the best of binding.

Smart business move, as that's what it must take in the world of print media to thrive. Personally, I find all the graphics and margin art to be annoyingly juvenile. Second, it has expanded the scope and tone of coverage to become little more than a media outlet for the DNC. It's added commentary on politics and policy, and has a section called the Bloomberg View that consistently articulates policy arguments from one side of the debate only.

I bought this for my dad last Fathers day and he saw the trailer and said this does not look good and looks corny. I decided to watch it almost a year later and was very dissaponting.

It is worth owning. While it is not the equal of 'Speakeasy', it stands pretty well on its own feet. The fact I am still listening to it five years later should count for something more than just the text of my review. I might also recommend 'How to Live with a Curse', their later release.----I admit to being both annoyed and disappointed enough to write my first online review.In short, I would avoid this album. Lyrically and musically 'Speakeasy' in every way exceeds (staves'a'ker), and should definately be recommended.My chief complaint is definitely lyrical, as no song on (staves'a'ker) seems to contain any great depth of faith or emotion which could be found in their previous albums and overall seems rather diluted and shallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regardless of what some people say, this is an awesome CD...","review":"A lot of people don't like this CD because it's softer than their other ones. While I don't have \\"Speakeasy\\" (yet) I do have \\"Friction\\" and I like this one ten times more than \\"Friction\\" (even tho I'd still give that one a high score too). Mark's voice is amazing and he makes the band. His lyrics are awesome too... deep and thought provoking. While I do admit musically this CD is a little more simplistic than \\"Friction\\" (not much, though), it works for the songs. \\"Blind Hope\\", \\"World To Wait\\" and \\"Yes\\" are lump-in-the-throat worthy. The only track on here that isn't as good as the rest is \\"Night Town\\"... not their best. Other than that, it's a solid, powerful hard rock album. It may not be \\"hardcore\\" or \\"metal\\" or whatever, and it may be different sounding then their other stuff, but maybe they WANTED it that way, artistically. I'm sure they don't care whether or not we like their \\"new sound\\", it's what they wanted to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A longtime Stavesacre fan, but...","review":"I persist in not being enthralled with this album. Not too say I won't listen to it, its just so conventional. Its \\"new rock\\". Lots of preprocessed guitar and the like. The first song reminds me of \\"A Perfect Circle\\" (although thats really a good thing). The rest is also very derivative of just about every mainstream rock act out there. There are a few good tracks, but the album is generally unsatisfying. I feel like Stavesacre has used its \\"coming out\\" album not to distinguish itself from the pack, but to join it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album, yet not as strong as their previous ones","review":"I'm a huge Stavesacre fan and I think that they are one of the most talented bands be it christian or secular, but while I was please with this album, I was also disappointed a bit. It's an awesome album with some really awesome songs like Island and Yes, but it's seems to have lost the edginess and stronger lyrics of their previous albums. Mark's vocals are still awesome and the music is great, but not to the caliber of Speakeasy which is my favorite Stavesacre album. I still recommend it, but any of their previous efforts are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic Death is this","review":"Take the best At the Gates and the best In Flames and you get Sorrow of Tranquillity. This awesome japanese band has made an album full of pure agressive technical riffs mixed with beautiful melodic riffs with no sign of cheesiness or generic simple riffage.This album is just what a Melodic Death album should be. It has a few flaws, of course, like a snare sound which is a little bit off, but overall it's a great piece of work which should be in any MeloDeath fan's collection. Just get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Success!","review":"While books on the subject of reading are few, books on the difficulty of learning to read are even more scarce.

It brings to life the profound spiritual insight of the Cardinal during his long imprisonment by the communist government of Viet Nam: \\"Do I love God or do I love the things of God?\\" If it is God that I love, then it does not matter where I am in order to fulfill my vocation as a Christian. Today, when Christians are increasingly called upon to bear witness to the reality of Christ in their lives regardless of the challenges posed by dramatic changes in their culture, the life of Cardinal Van Thuan will provide not only a strong example, but an occasion for self-examination.

The novel brings to life a woman who was driven to prove her worth to society, her family, and her country; and her pain, as well as her joy, is palpable on every page.

Make sure your generator tailpipe is parallel to the ground and does not exit the vehicle on a down angle. If so, the Gen-Turi will lean way out to the side away from the motorhome.

Which I corrected by adding a bungee cord around the upper half of it going to the luggage rack on the roof of my motor home. I felt with the only support it had being on the lower pipe the wind would have too much leverage on the upper part of it. I solved that with an extra bungee cord. My generator is on the same side as the awning on my coach so it puts a lot of the exhaust right under the awning. Before we would have to shut off the generator if we were sitting under the awning. Now we can have the generator running and sit under the awning and we don't smell any fumes at all. Plus it helps lower the noise of the generator. Some of the noise goes right up the stack with the exhaust. I don't have any complaints at all about the construction of the product and the plastic tubing doesn't get very hot at all.

The pump belt broke the second time I used the machine. The belt was in pieces and some of it was stuck to the shaft. I made the mistake of tossing the box after my first use. The machine is heavy and I don't know how I'll take it to be serviced."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah, 2nd one w/ same problems!!! don't buy","review":"Purchased one several years ago. It did as well as a Hoover steamvac yet this one leaked most of the time. The tank always leaked during use and the selector knob broke making the attachments useless.Got another one, duh!! and again similar problems.This time, upon start up the wand sprayed me in the face and stuck 'on' for several seconds. After some creative banging, it finally shut off. Then when I tried to use the floor suction, it wouldn't spray solution or water. Like the old one, it leaked some during use and the solution never really got any hotter than the tap. Lastly, when shut down, there was always water coming back out of the wand or the floor piece creating another mess.taking this one back and will look at a dirt devil or hoover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used once","review":"The product I received was not very well \\"Reconditioned\\" It stopped working after one use.I contacted Bissell. They are willing to replace the machine. However, I am told it will take 7-10 days to send me a shipping label, 7-10 for them to receive the machine and then 7-10 more to send me a replacement. I don't have the box the cleaner came in. I need to find a box and ship it back. At very least it will be 3-4 weeks before the cleaner is replaced. I know Amazon will make it right but the aggravation with Bissell compels me to reccomend against purchasing this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give up all hope","review":"It's not often I have to give up on a novel so quickly, but Finder: A Novel of the Borderlands has to qualify for one of the worst novels of the year. Nothing about it gripped me. It seems to think you can take fantasy tropes and give them a hard edged urban twist. In the end it just came across as a silly camp idea written with some of the most wooden characters I've come across outside of Pinocchio. I don't know about all the drugs it kept on going on about in a preachy type voice, but I had to reach for some good whiskey to counter writing this bad (and that was only after the first couple of chapters). Couldn't even recommend wasting your time on this is it was available as a free download for your Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"This book is so dated that I am not sure that you could get the examples to compile.

Coming from Sassy, I thought it must be good. Boy, was I disappointed. You pull the string, put in the water and, it just sits there with the string going back in. I thought we had a broken one until I read the other reviews and they all said the same thing. Sassy should be ashamed putting their good name on such a poor product. It really isn't even worth 1 star, but you can't give 0 stars. If I could I would definitely give this loser of a toy 0 stars.

She loves tub toys, but when you pull the tail on this one it just sits in the water.

It was disappointing, to say the least. Sure, the author goes into the history of the secret society, starting with the construction of King Solomon's temple. But none of this is new. I've read books on the Knights Templar that present the same history in a much more interesting way.This book is very dry and uninteresting. At times it became hard to follow, because the author kept moving back and forth chronologically, sometimes repeating the same story in different chapters. And if you're looking for \\"secrets\\" of the Masons, forget it. I feel I know as much now about the Freemasons as I did before I started reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New, Some Mistakes","review":"This book does not contain much that hasn't already been exhausted in previous books. I read this book the day after finishing Jasper Ridley's volume on Freemasonry, and it seems like the author of this book (for the most part) paraphased Ridley. I recommend Ridley's book. Also, there are some incorrect statements- one being that the eligible age of joining DeMolay is 13. The correct age is 12. That was not well researched. A simple visit to demolay.org would have fixed that problem. As a senior DeMolay and Master Mason, I prefer reading books on Masonry by Masons. Among the great authors are S. Brent Morris, W.L. Wilmshurst, and Allen Roberts. Also recommended are the books by John J. Robinson, who became a mason shortly after writing his 3 books on Freemasonry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced and Fair History","review":"Jeffers does a nice job of recounting the history of Freemasonry. Although not a Mason himself, Jeffers presents a fair and balanced study, frequently citing prominent Masonic writers. A must read for any Mason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about a fascinating subject!","review":"I picked up this book because I'd read that Dan Brown's next novel is about the Freemasons and I wanted to get a headstart. I was not disappointed.

The Lisa character is annoying and giggly but the chemistry between her and Joe is so electric,,,they had to have been fooling around in the real world...wow. I had not seen that level of speechless electricity since I saw 'Damage' or such a sexy male lead since Mickey Rourke in 9.5 Weeks. By the way, how interesting that the first dance is to Slave to Love, a great song that was also used in 9.5 Weeks as Mickey pounds Kim Basinger in a clock tower! Really, would the nuns play that song at a dance? That is just one of the many silly things in this movie but Craig Sheffer is just that sexy and the love story so sweet you just can't help it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best romantic movies of the 80's...hopelessly waiting for the DVD","review":"I love this movie!!!!!!!!!

The early scene in which Daniel Sanborn first watches Rebecca Wentworth paint is remarkable. The author conveys both the attraction of genius, of superlative ability, and also the degree to which its originality can be deeply disconcerting.Begiebing's earlier novel, The Adventures of Allegra Fullerton, also featured a woman artist, and the books share a concern with the opportunities afforded women in two different eras of American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but a Goodie","review":"Along with the topography and elevation profile maps that I downloaded for free, this was the only trail book I brought for a solo thru hike in 2006 from Happy Isles to Whitney. The author has a knack for accurately describing the individual trail and terrain features creating a good overall snapshot of what to expect on the next day's hike. Yes some of the info around Red's Meadow and the Postpile have changed but otherwise as far as a solid resource for accurate trail descriptions, this is a great book that really presents the flavor of the different trail sections. Get the elevation profile maps as they are very handy for keeping track of where you are at in the all the ups and downs."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same (which is very good)","review":"If you liked Comprehensive I, you will like Comprehensive II. Interesting, interactive lessons add new vocabulary while reviewing the old. Conversations are at normal speaking speed. This helps your brain learn to cope with real speech, but if you need to pause and review frequently, it can make the lessons take much more than a half hour.This set of lessons covers informal usage, the past tense, the conditional tense (could, would), should and must, and ends with the present progressive (am talking, etc.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Watch I Really Need","review":"After years (even decades) of looking for watches with the highest KPD (Knobs Per Dollar) factor, I finally realized that I never used those fancy features. The only things I really need in a watch are something that keeps track of the time, day, and date for me and displays that information on a big, easily read, digital display (for these aging eyes). With the atomic clock synchronization, this watch does exactly that. Its additional functions of stop watch, alarm, and 50 meter depth protection are fine additions, but nothing that I'll probably ever use. The only things I'd like to see added would be a scratch resistant bezel (nothing wrong with this one, it's just that from experience I know I'll end up scratching it pretty soon) and a slightly fancier look. But, since this watch was one of the very cheapest I could find that did what I really needed it to do, I can't really complain. I rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"This is a well written, easy to read, guide. The authors are knowledgeable and expressive.

I am using it with a Dec. 2007 MacBook, and it works perfectly fine - no power problems like those mentioned with some other laptops. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that I just haven't had it very long and don't know enough about hard drives to say much more than I already have.

It is not has tough and cannot handle on the road travel. I kept it in a padded lap top case and it still didn't hold up with all the moving around of the luggage. The customer service support from Western Digital is poor. The first thing they try to do is get you to buy a \\"power boost\\" cable. After researching the problem of the device not being recognized by Windows, I found out that a whole lot of other people end up with the same problem after using the Passport for a while.

I used a TEAC casing with Seagate drive for years as a portable drive without any issues.Within a week of getting this model, the drive wouldn't spin up. The drive had been carried in a protective case and used on solid surfaces when in use--a desk, in most cases. One reviewer, Brandi, reviewed that the drive has problems when being moved--I'm not sure if the movement caused the issue or not, but if that's the case, then the drive is a failure for a \\"portable hard drive\\".Unfortunately, replacement or not, I'm now leery of the device and see backups going from weekly to daily. :( What a hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic upgrade for any Intel-based Mac notebook","review":"I purchased this drive to install in my MacBook Pro.

I was lost on how to get it to start copying my files.

It took 5 hours to back up 105 GB of files from my G4 12\\" Powerbook.

Any mp3 player that requires you to use Windows Media Player should be avoided!I would highly recommend the iPod to the user who has some extra cash and can pay the extra amount for a superior product.

While you may be able to get 6+ hrs of \\"continuous\\" playback on one full charge, that will hardly be the case in real life. If I mix music listening with file transfer on my iPod, battery life is the sorriest I've seen out of any portable device I've used. On a full charge with an almost brand new ipod, and yes, it was properly discharged during the previous cycle, it would only last about half an hour for file transfers. Apparently, the continous harddisk spin contributed greatly. I purchased my ipod as not only a walkman, but a portable storage device as well. And that's what's worth the extra bucks to make the iPod stand out from the rest of competition. And if the battery won't keep up with the device, I can only give a generous 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 1 year and 8 months.","review":"I used to love my ipod,but the fact that it recently died on me after a year and 8 months of use has left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.

Sure you can play WAV files on an Ipod but it uses up battery so fast (3 HOURS!) that it isn't feasible, especially since you have to pay Apple $100 to replace your batteries every year or two. The future of music will be higher quality with bigger files, but since higher bandwidths require more battery power, Ipod will not have the muscle to compete with other players.

If you are going to write a send up of the two kings of weird fiction, do it right! This book read like a version of \\"Laurel and Hardy Go Cross Country.\\" As I read, I kept thinking of Felix Unger and Oscar Madison, a sort of Weird Tales Odd Couple episode. Better luck next time, guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Covered in goo, without ever gelling.","review":"I picked up this book in keen anticipation. I'm a huge HLP and Smith fan (somewhat less of an REH fan, but no bother...) and thought, \\"What a great idea!\\" Well, it's still a great idea, but this particular book just didn't do it justice. For those interested in Yog-Sothothery (HPL himself never liked the term \\"Cthulhu Mythos\\")there are a number of matters which can be nitpicked. However, the book's most serious flaws are its depictions of the characters. Both are written as buffoons, who could never possibly have been friends, let alone world-savers. To the authors: try this again! The idea is great, but please show the humanity of your heroes as vividly as you have their peculiarities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novel Captures the Southern Mystique","review":"Mr. Tigner, in his first novel, captures the Southern mystique and brings the reader intimately face-to-face with folkways and social values of the deep South at the turn of the century.This \\"period piece\\" gives the reader an insight into gracious Southern living prevailing at that time. The plot intertwines a knowledge of antiques and Southern foods to lend verisimilitude to his captivating story.This is a novel you could give your mother, grandmother or minister to read. It is refreshingly devoid of blood, guts, four letter words and violence. In brief, it is an uplifting breath of fresh air. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly a Nobel Prize winner","review":"While the author does well at writing descriptive prose regarding the details of furniture and antiques, he does not fare as well with characters. Many plot points are disjointed, and some are incomplete. The reader is made to feel quite distant from the story and often wonders if there will be more to it eventually, but there never is. The writing is simple, and could benefit from a going over by a professional editor. The descriptions of people and things are vague; one wonders what makes something \\"most beautiful\\". Better descriptions of what the author is trying to convey would benefit the reader greatly.Great works of literature require development and refining, which this work does not seem to have. The author would do best to keep this in mind for future manuscripts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like a thriller","review":"A concise and compelling account of America's unilateral invasions over the last century and the many unintended consequences that have flowed out of these actions. My guess is that even most educated Americans are not familiar with the details of the events documented here and the book shows us that we can learn a great deal from the mistakes of the past. I'm a lifelong conservative, but would urge readers of every political stripe to read this history. This highly readable book should be required reading for any modern American history or international relations course. This is not a book for isolationists, but rather for those who want to better understand the modern history of a world that is indeed becoming more \\"flat\\" all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book; Quick read; Good writing.","review":"Don't pick up this book if you don't want to read a book written by someone who is more on the left side of the aisle. You'll just get annoyed. If you don't mind, this is a great book. Kinzer explores (quickly) how the US has been involved in the \\"changes\\" in many international movements and governments. This is not a research book. Each chapter gives you little tidbits of important historical moments. Luckily, it seems that Kinzer has written books on many of those in case you wish to do more exploring. This is one of those books that makes you raise an eyebrow and yearn for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A read for all","review":"Whether you agree or not; whether you like history or not, this is a book that is awakening, informative, and gives us each an incredible amount of food for thought. The book is written from the historic perspective, but one has to also assume, regardless of our political views, that we cannot be completely objective in our writings. What have learned from our past; will it play a part in our future dealings with other countries and governments? Add this to \\"The World is Flat\\" as a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Timeline of Alternate American History","review":"Kinzer's book does not contain any new material, and will be well familiar to those who are versed in twentieth century American foreign policy. In addition, the author does have an obvious \\"liberal bias\\". However, this is a nice compendium of all the U.S.'s history of invasions, as opposed to buying several books on each one. On the flip side, if you want in-depth analysis of, say, Diem's assassination, this is not the book for you. You may not agree with the commentary chapters, but the invasions/interventions cannot and should not be ignored with their place in U.S. history. Definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regime Change","review":"The iconoclastic historian A.J.P. Taylor once wrote that all wars are fought for economic reasons, despite what the politicians say. Taylor's axiom is especially apt when considering Kinzer's book. He is right in that most of the United States involvement in \`regime change' operations were done primarily to protect financial interests in that respective state. Kinzer is not the first to point out that when the U.S. gets involved there was a resultant backlash 10 or maybe 30 years after the action. It is clear that Kinzer is not fan of the Bush's cowboy diplomacy, and draws clear parallels between William McKinely invoking God's guidance in the Philliphines to George W.'s insistence on his divine prerogative. Overall, a good survey and intellectually stimulating reading over the holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get past the introduction!","review":"I knew it would have a liberal slant, but I thought I'd read it because there is such a shortage of the liberal perspective (sarcasm) in the media today, but I couldn't get past the introduction. \\"By a quirk of history, the United States rose to great power at the same time multinational corporations were emerging as a decisive force....\\" Or, \\"Strong tribes and nations have been attacking weak ones since the beginning of history\\". \\"They do so..... to get more of whatever is good to have.\\" Can anyone take this book seriously?Did the U.S. claim the moon and all it's resources, which would be \\"good to have\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!!!!","review":"The best book I have read in ages!

Ever since 9/11 I have been searching for the reason, some explanation for why it happened. I have read many books since then and this one above all others explains \\"why?\\". Wow! you may not like what you learn, but the truth sometimes hurts. And, until we know the truth we will never act accordingly. It's too bad that we are so sheltered from reality in the U.S..

It is a wonderful book that puts human faces to all the major American regime change operation in the past century. It is usually a handful of people and their ambitions which spark these events. Most of the time, the outcomes are not good for America and they were even worse for the people in the countries that had a regime change. And for the cases of especially Iran and (possibly) the current regime change in Iraq, the outcome is really bad for the entire world. It is a \\"must read\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for anyone who's ever wondered why they hate us....","review":"This is history they didn't teach you in school and most of it was never in the media.

Not a book for those already familiar with \\"Texas Gulph Suphur\\" or the basics of insider trading.Being the author a university professor and being the price so HIGH, I'd expected something different.MY dissapointment might be due to plaintly false expectations.

I wish that there were some way to get this book out of Amazon.com's database.Many thanks to Cat Rescuer (see below) for being the first to spot this unbelievable incompetence and warn unsuspecting cat owners away from this \\"cookbook\\".

I can leave to onions out! The new edition doesn't have onions in the recipes, so it must be fine!PLEASE reconsider. This book was obviously written by someone who did not know the first thing about feline nutrition. It just as obviously never underwent any kind of editing by anyone who knew anything about feline nutrition.

I got this book in 2005 and have used many of the recipes. Apparently I got the revised edition because there are no onions in the recipes. Not even the one on page 23 quoted by the \\"Abbey is wrong\\" person. A few in the people recipe section do but the author tells you to leave them out of the portion you give the cat. So I suppose if you have the old edition then that might be a problem. But I don't and I really like this book. My cat has been eating these recipes for almost seven years now and is as healthy as a cat can be. Plus he seems to enjoy eating them, and I enjoy making them for him.

I contacted amazon.com and they sent me a replacement. The replacement was even worse! It started stalling in the opening credits. I notified amazon.com again, and they surmised that it would be pointless to send me a third disc, because it would probably be defective too. Both discs have been returned to amazon.com. So, in short, I'm sure that the movie itself is just as great as I dimly remember it, but amazon.com's vendor has apparently supplied a defective batch of discs.

This teenage version of Fatal Attraction is not without merits - the main character, a troubled girl played very convincingly by Molly Ringwald, is very well sketched but for some reasen the action had to be 'spiced up' by a whole array of totally improbable incidents.

The graphics aren't good, the fun you get out of it is extremely limited, and it will do you more good spending your money on a stupid cuddly toy. Personally, i would buy Dawn of War instead. It has better graphics, it's based on warhammer 40k more than Fire Warrior(if you're a 40k fan), you can choose from orks, eldar, space marines and chaos, you can paint your own armies, zoom in to one gretchin's massive nose or his gun which is over half as big as him, or tell your force commander to call an orbital bombardment and the game is just pure fun.

You can expect to get 9+ hours on the story mode. And for all you lucky boys and girls with broadband, the online function will keep you entertained for a while as well. The graphics, while not mind-blowing, aren't too bad either. The sound is also very clear and crisp. One thing I actually liked in this game was that it was quite difficult.

It's particularly disturbing because this one had so much potential, being set in the \\"classic trilogy\\" and featuring Han Solo and Chewbacca.Pocket Studios, the developer, is on my enemies list now. Not only did they ruin this game, they also bungled their rendition of Midway's Arcade Classics (Defender/Robotron/Joust/Sinistar), which Digital Eclipse could have ported in their sleep.

I looked at other brands (i.e. Monster), but the Belkin was so inexpensive I had to try it.I was unsure how much of a difference it would make, but I was very happy when I saw what it can do. It's hard to explain exactly. The picture is crisper and clearer. I also like knowing that the signal and the power are being regulated. I have since recommended this to two friends...one has purchased it. He told me how much better his picture is. I don't think it's a fluke that this device is so highly rated by everyone who has tried it. As for the life span of this device, I think it will last and if it quits in a few years, I will go out and buy another one. It's still cheaper than paying top dollar for another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking unit!","review":"I recently purchased a 46\\" Samsung DLP HDTV as well as a Sony upconverting DVD Player. I decided to buy this Power console to protect my TV from surges as well as condition the power coming in. The unit is sturdy and all metal. Fits in lookswise with my other components. I am really happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper than insurance","review":"A must have in this day and age of expensive home theater. It provides cheap protection from electronic pain. Very simple and intuitive to set up and then leave it to do it's thing. Hopefully you will never have to do anything with it again as it quietly does its thing, just a slight blue glow letting you know it is there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice unit, wrong photo","review":"As another reviewer has mentioned, I can't tell any difference in sound or tv picture with this unit, but I feel better knowing it's there. I give the unit 5 stars, but only 4 stars total because Amazon messed up on the image; the photo of the back of the device is the correct one, but the photo of the front of the unit is NOT correct; that is the pic of the model PF40, a unit with more features and a higher price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best build quality","review":"I have gone through 2 units in less than 5 months. The problem is a failure of the switched power function, which occurred in a short period of usage. Four outlets are unswitched, but four (audio) are switched on/off with the front switch button. The switch button no longer works and the rear reset does not fix the problem. With this failure I am stuck with a four outlet conditioner with four bad switched outlets. Belkin will repair/replace, but I have to pay shipping costs. Hard choice. I would recommend looking for a better quality device."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you value your equipment...","review":"My pockets are not deep so I like to protect my equipment. If you are going to spend a few thousand on a TV and surround sound you better pony up and get one of these. It allows protection of everything from power devices to cable tv and ethernet. Also blends in with other components. Only regret is I wish I bought the battery backup version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Novice Power Console!","review":"If you are just learning and developing a decent home theatre, entertainment center I would recommend this product to you! It will allow the management of up to eight sources for power filtering, it is user friendly with a simplistic display on front so you always feel comfortable it is working properly, instructions are easy to read and follow. Bottom line if you want simple power management to protect your tv, dvd player and other high end electronics without too much fuss its a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice collection of papers","review":"The book is a collection of diverse papers on inverse problems. The papers cover different applications and different techniques applied to inverse problems.For a starter on inverse problems, the book presents the latest work and provides pointers to follow up the content. This will save a lot of boring library work :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written book","review":"This is a very poorly written book; for example, a sentence on page 63 says: \\"Once my opponent's leg is passed, I will shift my body toward my opponent's head in order to secure a better hold.\\" Revising it yields: Once my opponent's leg is passed, I shift my body toward his head securing a better hold. Mr Simco repeatedly uses a passive voice and unnecessarily repeats subject phrases when simple pronouns will work; the cumulative effect of so many dead words is a very cluttered book that would have been much better if well edited. I have the sense reading it that the author knows far more about martial art than the art of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"I really don't understand how this book can get 5 stars.The actual content isn't too bad but what really brings it down is the layout and the photos. Most of the photos are tiny and combined with the poor quality paper they seem faded making it hard to distinguish what is going on.I am waiting on a few other BJJ books I have purchased based on 5 star reviews.I'm now a little bit woried that they will only be as good as this book which I think is very poor.The DVD however isn't too bad. Some good stuff there.I was going to give 2 stars due to the DVD but this is a book review sostuff it just 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book is Good, DVD is Better","review":"I think it's probably the best book out there for people just starting out or people wanting to.Been training for a while and know that the Basics are all you need.For Advanced people, there might be some better choices, but if you are advanced and you teach, you should have this book and tell all of your students to get it.The DVD is a nice sampler of the author's \\"Essential Techniques\\" DVD series at www.jiu-jitsu.net , that I really enjoyed. If you're looking for a good dvd set with excellent instruction of need to know moves, that dvd set is it.Not a bad writer, but better in person IMO. Check out his DVDs as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for better","review":"I've been looking for a goood poodle primer and found this at the local bookstore. It is a near-replica of a number of other cokkie-cutter books by similar titles on other breeds. There was little poodle-specific information ... most of the pages were general dog-related information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book for First Time Poodle People","review":"This is an excellent book about all-around poodle care. There is good information (that I have not seen in any other book) about feeding a natural diet and the aging process, as well as general care and grooming. Though one reviewer felt there was too much \\"caution\\" about adopting a poodle, I feel it is appropriate. Poodles love people and require near constant grooming to look and feel their best, and they need an owner who knows they need a lot of care and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"The authors seemed to spend more time asking you if you really, really, really want to get a poodle, considering all the work and money they take, than on giving valuable information. Not very helpful to those of us who already have a poodle and want to learn more about our dog/puppy, and caring for them. It does have chapters on care and grooming, etc, but for the first several chapters it seemed to be cautioning people away from getting a poodle, at least that was the impression I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Help","review":"Having embarked on the mission of finding the right standard poodle, this book was our first stop. After reading, we felt it gave us great help us in choosing and raising our pet. It covers all areas, and in a most entertaining and readable way. It has become the bible at our house! We recommend it wholeheartedly, especially for someone choosing and raising their first puppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasbara from Yesteryear","review":"This Atlas is the Exodus of mapping.

The maps themselves are very well done and informative but the commentary by the other is incredibly, and sometimes comically, bias. I just finished an extensive university course on the history of the Israel/Palestine conflict that used this book and our class found it to be highly misleading. It is incredibly slanted towards Israel and would be a detriment to someone who is just seeking cursory knowledge about the conflict. There are two sides to this story, but in this book it would seem that there is only one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy To Find","review":"Although I haven't used these yet...they are exactly what I was looking for.

Thank You!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Turquoise\\" No","review":"The little pie plate is a good size, but the color shown is completely wrong. The two-tone color shown is not the color. The turquoise is more of a solid greenishjade like color. I was quite disappointed, but the quality is there and I did get a good price. I would send it back, but would probably get the same thing again. I have never been disappointed with anything from Amazon, so this is the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be better packaged.","review":"I was disappointed to find that my Fiestaware Sea Mist Pie Baker had arrived in about 1,000 different pieces, because more care hadn't gone into the packaging. Perhaps more padding, or at least the word 'Fragile' stamped on the box may have helped. I ended up having to return it and decided not to order a replacement because I wasn't confident that the second one wouldn't arrive in the same state. Also I had imagined the 'sea mist' to be more of a light mint-y green color (like jadeite), but the green was actually a bit darker and more of a light green than a mint green. I'm usually very satisfied with purchases from Amazon.[com.] It was a surprise that it didn't work out this time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful color","review":"I absolutely love the new Scarlet color by Fiestaware. Mine did arrive in one piece which is a miracle as the box looked like it had been used for soccer practice -- sometimes I think those Fragile stickers result in box abuse!I was surprised at how small it was, but it did say 6\\" and 6\\" it is. You won't bake a pie in it (unless you make individual ones) but it will be great for dips and sauces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to small.","review":"I love Fiesta dishes and have a lot! I ordered 2 of these thinking they would be great for a small pie. Well they are the size of a soup bowl and way to small for a pie. I returned both, if I want to make a pie this size I will use my soup bowl for pot pies. The quality was good it was just the size that did not work for what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hillary Scares the Bejesus Out Of Me\\"","review":"In this book, you will find out why? This is easily one of the funniest books that I have read in a long time.Yes, it is very easy to poke fun at our president, no matter who that may be, but President Bush sure makes it simple. In this diary-style book, the president's innermost thoughts are scribbled out in 3rd-grade penmanship.The book is outright hilarious. We get an in-depth look at the president's IRS audit list, his thoughts on making a movie about his \\"poppy,\\" his feelings about Dick Cheney, and his outright fear of Hillary Clinton. The mental notes are also hilarious, and the added illustrations make for a complete funny experience.This book was a really fast read, and it was extremely humorous. It is definately for anyone with a mere pulse of a sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the?","review":"As a fan of bizarre cover or tribute albums, this definitely ranks up there as one of the top ten cover albums of all time. I love the Cure and it is hilarious to hear these new takes on some old favorites. I have to disagree with another reviewer's panning of the version of \\"Why Can't I Be You\\" on this album. I think it is actually my favorite track. Play it at your next party. The look of bewilderment followed by \\"aha\\" on party guests' faces when they realize what they are listening to is so completely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, Pues no...","review":"Pues la verdad, despues de haber escuchado varios covers y en especial el tributo \\"100 Tears\\", realmente me hacen dudar de la calidad de estos grupos. Yo se que las bandas trataron de hacer lo mejor que pudieron, pero la verdad es que no se puede comparar a las versiones originales del grupo. a las demas personas qu aqui han escrito, se emocionan porque en su vida habian escuchado algo así, por los que les recomiedo se integren al movimiento de musica en español, y asi conoceran grupos mas reconocidos y por ende con mas calidad.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book prepared in hurry and difficult to read","review":"The book is written by an academician, maybe with engineering background. It uses unnecessary mathematics symbol systems and cumbersome explanations to narrate simple concepts.It appears that the book was published in a hurry. It contains many typos, for example, on page 5 -figure 1.4(a) (Note the there will .....). Can not believe these types of errors were not caught in the review by AP publisher.The book was given some high ratings from some readers on Amazon.

Not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Facts - A Hundred Myths","review":"I was tempted to think the author had fallen in love with Boulez and wrote this book in an attempt to explain frustrated emotions.As a biography, it is only a little more useless than John Baxters execrable biography of Stanley Kubrick.It contains a few interesting facts though."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent hot sauce.","review":"Totally worth the buy. Very flavorful and hot. This hot sauce isn't nearly the hottest I've had. One reviewer mentioned Blair's 'After Death' and he's right in saying this is milder than that. However, it makes up big time in taste. I am a seasoned hot sauce guy and this is my go-to for just about anything. Big flavor and great heat. Maybe the best all around sauce I've tried so far. Very hot for a beginner, delicious for an expert.

My mind had been forever scared from this visually shocking (shockingly horrible), painful, pointless, corrupt, lame, unecessarily foul-mouthed, idiotic, disgraceful game (if it could actually be called that.......i could go on and on) THE GAME SUCKS!!!!! Dont even consider buying it.One of the worst parts of the title (not worthy of being called a game) is the soundtrack. The developement crew was hyped up because they were going to record songs by....................Marilyn Manson?! No way, i dont think so. Marilyn Manson doesnt deserve to be alive as it is, but to put his crap in a video game. This game is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat....but lacking","review":"If you are a fan of spawn comics or if you are into repetitive mindless button mashing, then this could be the game for you. My frustration with this game is how you had to adjust the camera angles during fight sequences. I am not sure if there is a way that this can be better done, but it made me dizzy watching it at times. I liked some of the cynical humor, especially after you beat the \\"violator\\" and he says \\"your my b**ch\\". I am also a fan of intermediate saves, which this game does not have. I wish more games would do this. Wouldn't buy, but okay as a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best hero games I've ever played.","review":"One of the reasons I like spawn the most is because he is not a wus like superman, and batman.

Rent it first. Itis too late for me i spent my money and have been hosed. This game is a wretched or worse than the Playstation Spawn game. Graphics are marginal at best. it's like the original Devil May Cry with all the fun sucked out. I am a Spawn fan and that didnt even get through the 2nd level before i turned off my Xbox in disgust and it is actually difficult to get me to hate a game. THIS IS NOT A GIFT IDEA FOR ANYONE. DONT FALL FOR THE CHRISTMAS TRAP. i really wish i had something nice to say about but i dont. this game has no redeeming value."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Step Backwards","review":"Through thier first four studio releases the listener can chart musical (and perhaps emotional) growth in the Eels music. Shootenanny makes me wonder if E's songwriting inspirartion has dried up. Maybe it just disappeared with his beard. None of these songs stand out as anything more than standard rock progressions with alternatingly grim or cliche lyrics.I'd come to expect alot from Mr. E. - Maybe he'll take his time with his next record and and put a little more heart into it. Or maybe he's just peaked and will spend his remaining days riding the coat tails of his past accomplishments."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh.","review":"i'm admittedly biased towards eels songs that are quirky (eg-novacaine for the soul, i like birds, etc.) or depressing (just about all of electroshock blues) or both and this album just didn't cut it for me. i really thought that even though souljacker was a little poppier than mr e. had been in the past it still was some of his best stuff and (unfortunately for me) because of this i had expected that he was headed in a very interesting direction. shootenannay is instead corny and way too upbeat. i want my clinically depressed mr. e. back. this album may be well put together but to me it just sounded uninspired. of course, like i said, i am a biased fan and it might have actually been very inspired but, to me, it was only by a bunch of sunny emotions that don't make for good eels music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Fifth Studio Outing For E & Co.","review":"The release of Eels fifth studio album has sparked something of a backlash from the music press here in the UK. The criticism seems to be that E and his collaborators are flogging the last remaining horse in town to death. And yes, it's true to say that some of the songs presented on \\"Shootenanny!\\" would sit well on other Eels outings. But, by the same quarter, it also contains some of Eels strongest work to date. Tracks such as \\"Diry Girl\\", \\"Agony\\", \\"Lone Wolf\\" and \\"Numbered Days\\" are as well crafted as any tune in the Eels canon, presenting, as they do, strong, clean pop music, combined with brooding, introspective lyrics. E's voice is as strong as ever, as is his eye for the attractively bizarre characters of life. The less disonant sound is welcome after 2001's spiky \\"Souljacker\\", and the album is sure to make perfect listening for a thoughtful summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundtrack Fodder","review":"Very disappointing. And I thought there would be momentum building after the brilliant SoulJacker. There's nothing here to latch onto. Every song seems destined for the Shrek II soundtrack. Also, what's with the beatbox? E should realize by now what a secret weapon he has in drummer, Butch - the man grooves.I just couldn't hook into these songs. They sound like parodies of Eels compositions - like someone distilled all E's pain and suffering and found a way to package and market it. E's always had an ear for a good pop hook, but here we've got nothing but candy and sugar - where's the grit?Okay, E - so you did one for Dreamworks. Now can you do one for us again?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eels' most straight forward rock album","review":"The Eels have released several great albums during the past years, but for every radio friendly 'Last Stop: This Town' you got several 'Souljackers'. Don't get me wrong, I love the Eels, no matter if they play straight forward rock or more complex material. So I do not think, that they are selling out at all on this album. In fact, this album shows, what a great songwriter Mark Oliver Everett really is and the CD will hopefully attract an even wider fan base. There are great rock songs (All in a Day's Work, Saturday Morning, Dirty Girl, Wrong about Bobby), beautiful ballads (The good old Days, Rock Hard Times) and also some 'old style' Eels (Love of the Loveless, Agony, Lone Wolf) material on here. If you never bought an Eels album or if you couldn't quite connect to their older material, give this CD a try. It's definitely one of the best releases this year so far. And as the CD says : Everybody knows these are rock hard times...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with every listen","review":"This is a rare artist where it's best not to decide which single album is best. Doing so only helps those unfamiliar with the artist decide which ONE album to buy. Spend the money and buy ALL of the Eeels albums out there - you won't be disappointed. Unless of course you don't enjoy strikingly insightful lyrics wrapped in musical arrangements that defy nearly every other artist working today. Need proof of his lyrical talent? From \\"Somebody Loves You\\":This nagging malaiseIs more than a phaseIt feels like a jobBut no boss ever pays you to lay thereAnd think how you'll dieWhile the tears start to well in your eyesDepressing?

Shootenanny, however, comes as a big disappointment, unfortunately. I have listened to it twice, and far too often, I have the image of a group of teenagers gathered in front of a tv on a Tuesday afternoon...this is the soundtrack to the opening credits of that half-hour rerun...and as for the 4-5 slow tracks, I'm too often reminded of how good, by comparison, Daisies of the Galaxy, is...my advice to E: one day, please move far away from pop...into folk, country, blues...or 'experimental' music...God knows you're a huge talent..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"I actually caught these guys singing live at a small, local bar. Kind of a shame. I mean everything from this album was pretty blah imo. I like Daisies of the Galaxy and Electroshock Blues an awful lot. They played songs from both of these too... and \\"improved\\" them as well.

My children also love this toy as well. The marvel at how just turning the knobs creates a picture. It's one of those toys that can occupy a child for a nice stretch of time.Our previous Etch A Sketch met it's demise when a guest stepped on it and shattered the screen. Thanks to the protective film on the screen, the glass stayed contained within the toy. Prior to the mishap, our Etch A Sketch began to have issues with the silver material that is inside the toy leaking out at the knobs.The newer Etch A Sketches don't seem to be as well made as they were many years ago. Erasing the design seems like a bit of a chore with the amount of tapping and shaking you have to do to eliminate ghost images of the previous sketch. With the older Etch A Sketches this was not an issue.Other than my few grievances with this toy, the Etch a Sketch is still a lot of fun and is a great classic toy that doesn't require batteries, just your creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Plastic Time Machine","review":"I am not a kid. In fact it's been quite a few decades since I last held that title. Five minutes with the Classic Etch A Sketch Magic Screen and I was transported right back to the 1960's with my flat top haircut and Keds sneakers. I spent many a happy hour trying to wrestle an artistic masterpiece out of the two dials on the Etch A Sketch.As far as I can tell, this version is exactly the same as the one I played with so many years ago. The lines are dark and easy to see. Turn the Etch A Sketch upside down and shake a few times and all marks of the screen completely disappear and you are ready for another round of two handed dial induced artistic fun.This is a great toy. It teaches spatial relationships, hand to eye coordination and logical deduction while expressing artistic flair. Every child should own an Etch A Sketch at some point.

As long as the buyer receives a product that works properly. I'm not sure if the quality of the product (we received) has changed since I was a kid (the answer - probably yes), but immediately after opening the toy for my 5 year old (he was celebrating his bday), the thing just didn't perform well. We soon realized that the lines didn't erase from the screen. After shaking the toy like madpeople, we just couldn't get the images to really disappear. Now, with my toy in the 80s, the images could be easily erased with minor, controlled shaking.Which is a shame, since both my kids were looking forward to a really cool toy. A toy that I talked and hyped up quite a bit, reflecting on my own youth where I'd spend hours creating cool images and designs on my Etch A Sketch. I don't think we've quite given up on this toy - we may look for another vendor or store to purchase from in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work :(","review":"I had the same problem with this toy as most others.

My bad. The etching is so thin and faint, you can't see it very well. If you buy this toy, try it out first. I wished I had. Instead, I gave it to my Grandson and let him play with it.

I remember spending hours with mine when I was a kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"Got this for my son. He loves it (of course)but not very durable. Less than a month and the vertical line is not dark anymore. The pad barely erases the previous lines. Maybe they have always been this way, but I don't remember that from when I was a kid.

Back here on Brazil this toy is produced under the rights of Long Jump factory. It was released back again not a long time ago.

Back on the 80's I had one screen from another concession brand ( Reis ) that worked just fine. So Ive figure to buy from US's OHIO factory.But the reviews here had showed me that the quality standart it's the same no more, probably a worldwide thing.Thats funny because the toy has sold out this Christmas here, none to find. I think people just dont remember how it was back on 80's or just dont care as long as it can be given as gift or sad enough, want it just as a souvenier from the past.20 thumbs up for Amazon providing this space though."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old time favorite!","review":"Went to this old stand-by for my grandkids.

His birthday is tomorrow and I just opened the package to wrap it and I'm wishing I had opened it last week! Already I'm disappointed! The screen is much smaller than the version from my childhood. I could live with that. But, the part I'm not liking at all is that the lines don't completely erase. I wrote a large \\"E\\" on the screen and no matter how much I shake it the \\"E\\" is still visible. This toy may be going back. I'm not happy thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Not the Classic in size or quality. Smaller than original, does not erase thoroughly, and the contrast, while using, is not as strong as the true Classic. I read the reviews before purchasing but my grandson really wanted the Classic Etch A Sketch for his birthday. It's not like the original Classic Etch A Sketch. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China, not Ohio","review":"This is a classic toy, however since it is made in China and no longer Ohio (hence Ohio Art), the quality went down the tubes. I had an original one years ago, and although the white knob broke off after many years of play the steel axle still allowed it to be workable. But this version has some cheap aluminum axle, which bent and completely broke off after about 3 weeks. So now all we can do is draw a vertical line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still using original etch-a-sketch!","review":"It's really great to see this toy back again! They were great then... but...I still have my two etch-a-sketches from the 60s. They work great... nice black lines... built like a tank and have my name \\"etched\\" on the back. For some reason the new ones don't hold up to the originals. Lines don't etch dark enough to see, and the lines stay on the glass after erasing them. I wouldn't buy one. You'll be very disappointed with the new ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Deep","review":"I am not analyzing the book here, I just want to balance another review posted about this book. With all due respect, the reviewer that said this is not a good book because of its deepness should rethink and appreciate the book for this very reason. The book is well written with deep, but accessible, historical, theological, and philosophical analysis. It certainly requires some background knowledge about early Christianity, theological and philosophical terms and concepts, and literature devices. In it, you will find quotations and references to Garcia Marquez, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and many others; popular cultures are also used to exemplify the author's ideas. Therefore, if you are looking for an intelligent approach of Jesus' crucifixion get this book and read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cone WRENCH takes care of your bike and your hand","review":"It does the job, no complaints.

It is also scientific to consider the confirmed traditions.It is just reasonable for our prophet (saw) to have miracles like the previous prohets in the sense that he is the seal of the prophethood .His being the seal of it requires to seal the miracles by having comprehensive miracles.

Over the years all kinds of nonsense involving the supposed mystical practices and miracle workings of the Prophet were subscribed to hadith and taken as gospel, despite the many, MANY things Allah said in the Qur'an about the Unseen being quite limited in our lives... even the Prophet's life.I'm glad Haykal put together a real biography of Islam's founder in which he cut out all the very un-Islamic, superstitious nonsense the \\"Hadithians\\" have inserted into the Faith. This is the second-best book in Islam after the Qur'an itself, and does a much better job of showing how Muhammad \\"walked the Qur'an\\" than the whole lot of so-called authenticate mystical hadith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap!","review":"I purchased this for my 9 month old husky.

The official name of this body of water is PERSIAN Gulf. The term Arabian Gulf was invented in 1970s by some Pan Arabists who failed to show up at their geography classes. The author's use of this term shows simply his arrogance and fact that he does not know the region nor its people.

There is an Arabian Sea, and a Gulf of Oman, and the PERSIAN Gulf, but no \\"Arabian Gulf\\" exists. The Persian Gulf is the official name of that body of water, and has been known by that name since ancient times. Even the ancient Greeks referred to it by its correct name.

With each book, I've been increasingly disappointed. I had hoped that, after waiting so long for The Fiery Cross to be finished, it would recapture the essence of the first book. Sadly, it doesn't.This book is written as if everything was an afterthought-- \\"oh, yeah, I almost forgot to include something about ____\\" -- rather than a well-crafted plot.

I loved the first four - could not put them down. However, I had no trouble putting this one down for weeks at a time. I finally finished it hoping that it would get better - it did not. It felt like it was written as an after thought just to fulfill a contract obligation - or to make fans stop clammering for any more books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!","review":"Someone said that a pessimist is never disappointed. I waited for Diana Gabaldon's \\"The Firery Cross\\" with great optimism based on my pleasure in reading all privious \\"Outlander\\" stories. \\"The Firey Cross\\" is a great disappointment. Perhaps if I longed for the sensation of burping a baby or changing diapers I might find some pleasure in this book. Or, if I didn't mind that the main protagonist, Jamie Fraser, is almost a minor character my enjoyment might have escalated some. Basically, the book is about 600 pages too long with a story plot that plods laborously. Gabaldon reports that the writing of this book involved taking chunks of writing, separated by lengthy periods of time, and pasting them together. That is exactly the feel of the book. I will await the next in the Outlander series with a greater degree of pessimism."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Thousand Page Disappointment","review":"I loved the Outlander series, and waited eagerly for this next volume. I was hugely disappointed. The book is laden with excrutiating detail and events that do not contribute to the development of the plot (which was only vaguely present) or the understanding of the people involved.. The first 200 pages describe the events of one afternoon! Frequent references were made to characters introduced in prior books, without the gentle reminders that most authors of series will give you. I was racking my brain to remember these people and how they fit into the story and the lives of the Fraser family. I gave it a valiant try, but I just couldn't finish the book. What a huge disappointment. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review?

I know a few who wrote and their reviews have not shown up, so why bother? I guess only avid, or should I say \\"rabid\\" supporters of Diana Gabaldon are being posted. When an author falls short of her potential, I think it's only kind to let them know. I hope the next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"For this I waited 4+ years???","review":"There are already 37 reviews of this book on this site and they seem to be equally divided into those who love this book and those who, like me, find it disappointing. Ditto on all of the comments of other reviewers about boring references to breast-feeding, Jamie's \\"molten tresses\\" etc. - doesn't bear repeating. But what a shame that an author with Gabaldon's eye for detail and the ability to mingle history and fiction should bollix this up in book 5. The dashing Highland hero is not so dashing when he's 49 and eeking out a living in rural North Carolina. And I am tired of Claire furrowing her brow and worrying about all the American history she \\"just doesn't know.\\" It doesn't parse. Part of what made Gabaldon's earlier books so fascinating was the Scottish setting - please, Diana, if you *must* write book 6, can you take us back to Scotland!?!? As my Scottish friends would say, \\"if it isnae Scottish, it's...\\" well, nevermind.

I have found 'The Fiery Cross' long winded, full of excessive unneccessary detail and quite frankly boring. It is a hard book to stay interested in and basically nothing happens until 2/3rds the way through. Huge detail is put into how people stand/speak, the baby drooling, the baby moving, gazing at the scenery, gazing at Jamie, etc.. very tedious. The characters seem to have lost all depth and come across quite shallow and at times silly. Im not sure if this book is supposed to be more humourous but if it has it has failed dismally.Sorry Diana, this is a real bummer!! Lets just say, I will be very tentative about buying Book 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"After reading Ms. Gabaldon's previous four novels, steeped in rich Scottish history, with the intrigue of Jamie and Clair, this book was a complete waste. I bought it two months ago and just now am completing the last 30 pages. After much anticipated waiting, I am extremely disappointed. It simply does not hold the readers attention. The characters are stagnant, the book is too long [by about 800 pages], and there is little historical value. I do hope Ms. Gabalon gets back on track, it would be a shame for this saga to simply fade away."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"by far her worst book: no real plot, Jamie and Claire worn completely dry, not much John Grey, vurtualy no Ian and when there is its disapointingly predictable; it goes right from the point were he left to the present and nothing happens, all his past actions turn into one big detour. Most scenes, if once good, drag on for way to long and even the scenes between Bree and Roger get really old. the one thing i did enjoy was all of the writing about the babies, which surprised me. I didnt read the last 100 pages, i got bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"So?","review":"Well, this is definitely good storytelling, but why isn't anything happening? I've just finished the book, and I feel rather cheated. This is filler material - here's how life is in the Colonial America, down to the most excruciating detail. I guess I could have read farmer's almanac if I really wanted to know. But 400 pages devoted to one day? Marcel Proust did it, and IMHO, D. Gabaldon is not Proust.

Trying to finish this book is like training for a marathon. Yes, I will be able to brag that I have finally finished it, but not without incredible pain. I am on page 560ish and I feel the book so far has been nothing more than monotonous wedding planning for a blind old aunt and her impotent fiance. Bet this wedding night is going to be exciting...NOT!!! Remember Jamie and Claire's first night together. Come on that is what got you hooked, isn't it? Yes, the historical backdrop gave us an out when asked \\"What is the book was about\\"?, but the passion and fire between these two characters is truly what made this series a success. Where has it gone? Even Claire's gorgeous daughter is a bore! This series, in my opinion, has become a case of \\"bait and switch\\". I hope this book is available on audio. Maybe then I can get through it and give book six a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointed","review":"Frankly, I thought the first 2 chapters could've been left out completely....or the first 200 pages really. I was more pleased w/ the excerpt from the \\"Companion\\" than was I was w/ the book. It was like Diana forgot where she left off. I felt the last 3 chapters of the book seemed to finally hold my interest, instead of droning on & on about a dysfunctional family that really didn't need to be introduced in such great depth to provide adequate info for later on in the story. Very poor editing as far as I'm concerned. I'm hoping the next book will be edited better (and won't take an extra year from the orginally scheduled release date) before hitting the stores. Oh yes. Please, give Roger a break; the poor guy has suffered enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I enjoyed most of the first 4 books, but this one was dreadful. I think we hear at least once a chapter that Brianna is 6 feet tall, gorgeous, and has red hair and looks like her father. She isn't a character as much a temper, self-absorption, and leaky breasts. Gabaldon was hopeless in this one - no plot, no character growth, no interesting new characters. Just endless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\" for every library","review":"Once again, Diana Gabaldon has written a perfect novel! If you haven't already, you need to read the first four books of the series (Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, Voyager and Drums of Autumn). #5, The Fiery Cross, continues a sweeping saga of love, hate, history and most importantly of an undying, unending passion of heart and soul between the two main characters. If you think these novels are the standard \\"Romance\\" type stories, you are greatly mistaken. I would call them Historical Fiction with a great love story entwined. Just like the first four novels, The Fiery Cross will hold you captive for as long as it takes to finish the book. At nearly 1000 pages, it is lengthy but not one page is wasted. I could go on and on...Absolutely, breathtakingly, marvelous!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A colossal disappointment","review":"I'm sad to say I believe Miss Gabaldon has fallen prey to her own success. ... I don't know if this is arrogance and complacency on Miss G.'s part, or genuine lack of enthusiasm and direction. I admit I finally gave up on THE FIERY CROSS after 435 pages, when it became apparent that every \\"lead\\" was destined to conclude in a dead end. (All those cuddly babies, kittens, and goats [!] finally did me in.) Ms. G. needs to think hard about whether or not she really has anything more to say about these characters and, if not, let them (and her readers) off the hook and move on to something else.

I will purchase the next book when Im done with this one, TY Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She still has it.","review":"I have, not more than ten minutes ago, just finished reading The Fiery Cross. As usual she continues her Outlander series with out missing a beat. I didn't realize that the amout of time that went by between books. Befor reading I went back and read some of all her books to refreash my memery. She has a way of telling a story that is so clear that you can see everything that she discribes. I am sorry that the book is over. I don't know If she will be writting another or not but If not I was very satisfited with the ending of her latest book. As usual I didn't want to put it down. I waited until I started my vacation I order to read it. All I can say is that it was time well spent.Hurrah to you Ms.G a great book. Ibought It in hard back I couldn't wait for paper back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"I haven't had a moment to even pick up the book to read but I'm excited to get started! All this series of books are amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"recent order","review":"I was very pleased with the conditon of The Fiery Cross. I was like new. As always, I enjoyed the book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fiery Cross","review":"The entire series of books by Gabaldon are great. The writing is rich and the characters very compelling. Strongly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finished at last","review":"I started this book on November 5th, and finished it today, December 20th, 7 long weeks of forced reading. It's been a long time since I have forced my way through a book this boring, especially for 979 pages. After having devoured the previous 4 books in days, wishing that the story would go on forever, this one did, unfortunately! Although I will still wait eagerly for the next volume, I will drop it like a hot potato unless it is significantly better than this one! What a disappointment to have another formula writer run out of material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Plot?","review":"I was so looking forward to this book, but it is hopelessly boring. Endless descriptions of chores and smelly, dirty diapers. I reached the end of the book and realized that nothing had happened. No new characters, Brianna is annoying, something too awful to be forgiven is done to Roger to liven up the non-existent plot, even Jamie was annoying! But, most annoying of all was too-perfect Claire, who has turned into such a Mary Sue. Don't judge this series on this book! The first four are wonderful, addictive novels. What happened Diana Gabaldon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok","review":"The adventures of Jamie and Claire continue but they are not nearly as exciting and page-turning as her first two books. However, the fondness for the characters makes the book enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading....","review":"This book was far from boring, especially when Jamie was in it; Wow, what a guy! Unfortunately, if you haven't read the previous novels, you'll not get a full understanding about him. He's a great, great man. Claire was pretty wonderful in her own right, and as smart as she was, she never once made Jamie feel inferior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still struggling to get through it ...","review":"Never did I think I would have a negative thing to say about the Outlander series. They have been positively magical ... until the Fiery Cross. It is ponderous, bogged down in too much detail, and impresses me more that the author is pre-occupied with breastfeeding, dirty diapers, and fussing toddlers rather than adventure. I have recommended this series to countless people, but will tell them to stop before the Fiery Cross. Great for insomnia ... puts me to sleep every time I pick it up. I doubt if I'll even bother with the next book. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book bites!","review":"I'm not a fan of romance-type books, but the 1st book in this series was so good, I kept coming back for more. Unfortunately, I read The Fiery Cross, or, as I would rename it, A Year in the Life of the American Pioneer. I can't even tell you what this book is about. It has no plot. It is set in the time leading up to the Revolutionary War, but nothing much happens. Although the author's writing style is very good (and the only reason this book did not get 1 star), and the characters are likeable and familiar, the book is BORING!!! NOTHING HAPPENS!! I mean, NOTHING! It almost comes across as a book written to explain the interim between the previous book and the next book. If this book had a plot, I could not find it. Hopefully the next one will be better, if I can bring myself to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Arrrrrrrrrgh. That's all I have to say about this latest installment of Ms. Gabaldon. I have read the previous novels and thoroughly enjoyed them...in fact, I've read them each twice, but this one; I just couldn't make it. So boring and seemed to go nowhere for the longests time. I was so disappointed, I resold the book. I do hope if she writes additional installments to the Jaimie/Clair adventures, that she returns to the format of the previous ones...this was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"waited 3 years to be bored?","review":"this is so boring i could not stick with it. i read hoping to find the good parts. outlander has some pages that could turn quickly into pleasure and suprise.not to be found in this one. it should not have been released.i LOVE all the others but this time out , jamie and claire were not the couple of old. this book reminded me of the rewriting of gone with the wind.i will know more about the next one out before i buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT ! ! ! !","review":"I was one of many that patiently waited for the next installment of the Outlander series. I loved the previous 4 books and could not waited to read the next one. The book however, ended up being a huge disappointment. The incredible detail and accurate historic references are still there but, I wasn't transported like in her other books. I kept reading ahead waiting for something to happened. Were was the passion and adventure of the previous books? If this is a preview of the books to come I think I'll pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saga Continues . . . .","review":"Honestly, this is my least favorite book in the series. Which is akin to saying this is my least favorite type of chocolate: I love them all - but some I love more than others. I suppose I am still bitter that Gabaldon took away 20 years of youthful adventure from Jamie and Claire and now they are getting older. Which is ok - we all get older. I must admit that in Outlander I saw J&C; as contemporaries, now I see them as my parents' age - and that does put a spin on things. I adore Bree and Roger and they have a good story line, but they will never hold the same spark as Claire & Jamie - glad, so far, that Gabaldon has kept that in check.I am a little surprised that none of the time travelers seem to ache for any of the luxuries they left behind. I suppose it would be more difficult than possible - but I would also be inspired to change history. Perhaps that is the conundrum - no matter what, you really can't change history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised!","review":"I actually skipped this book when I originally read the series, because of the negative reviews that it had received from readers. Then I read something on a fan board about it, and when I picked it up again out of curiousity, I decided to give it a try. I found myself really enjoying the book, and sped through it in about a week. Many of the reviewers said that Brianna was \\"whiny\\", and they complained about the constant diaper-changing and breast feeding scenes. I did not really see Brianna as \\"whiny\\" at all - she was a just a young girl suddenly propelled into a very different way of life. I actually thought that she handled it pretty well, considering. The rest of it was just a realistic look at life in the 18th century North Carolina backcountry. (Perhaps one needs to be a history buff to really appreciate the book.) Jamie and Claire are as romantic as ever in this book, but let's face it, they are not the youngsters that they were in book one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"too much detail, but worth reading if you have the time","review":"I would have to agree with previous reviews that criticize the enormous amount of detail and description in this book. I got tired of reading over and over again about the sound of rain, how the air smelled, how the sky looked, how red/auburn/copper/cinnamon Jaimie's hair is. I like hearing about what life was like in the 1770's, but I could be spared the myriad details. There wasn't really a central theme to the plot. It was more a collection of small adventures, and it seemed that more pages were devoted to the time before and after those adventures than on the action itself. This book was a bit of a disappointment after the suspense and action of the first four books. I'm giving it four stars simply because I was happy to have another installment of Jaimie and Claire's life and for the interesting adventure/suspense sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fiery Cross","review":"Ms. Gabaldon waited 5 years before writing this current novel, she should have waited another 5. The book was slow moving and failed to hold my intrest as the previous 4 had. Rather than going for quality, Ms. Gabaldon went for quantity-another 900+ page book which was as exciting as watching paint dry. A major disappointment after such a long wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot, and not for the lactate-intolerant","review":"I've read the first 4 books in this series one after the other, with no books in-between, and would rate all of them 5 stars. So I was expecting this one to be similarly excellent. Sadly, this huge book can be described in one sentence---at least the 300 pages I waded through: \\"The Frasers lived in 18th century North Carolina.\\" That is the plot. Period. But what really made me put the book back on the shelf was the endless references to Brianna's breastfeeding. Okay, once or twice: I get it. But it's seemingly on every page. So...if you want boring details about 18th century life in North Carolina, go for it. You're interested in all aspects of breastfeeding? Be my guest. Otherwise, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Furthering the saga","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I read several of the negative reviews prior to reading it and was pleasantly surprised. There were enough plot twists to keep things interesting. The last few chapters linked the book to the time travel aspects of the other four, and as usual raised the hair on the back of my neck. I'm sad to see Jamie and Claire growing older, but I enjoyed watching Roger and Brianna growing into stronger characters. I can't wait for the next one, and for Jemmy to grow out of a whiny toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"So easy to put down and not pick back up!","review":"Ok, I'm over 150 pages in and I don't think it's even the afternoon of the first day - 150 pages of mundane, tediousness. I'm putting it down and not picking it back up!I remember when there was a huge todo about her books - I've got to tell you, I've been wondering why.After reading the reviews here, I wonder if I've just started with a lemon, so maybe I will give the first one a go - first I have to recover from the boredom of this one though.And as for romance? In the 155 pages so far, I haven't noticed much of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outlander Series - Diana Gabaldon","review":"I was told about this series of books from a friend and I am now ready to order the 6th book in the Outlander series. This is reading you can't put down. If you are like me, when I find a good author, I like to read all of their books.My daughter gave me a Kindle for Christmas and I love it. These books are many pages and with arthritis in my hands they could be very uncomfortable to hold. However, on my Kindle reading any size book is such a blessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fiery Cross","review":"I am a huge Outlander Series and Diana Gabaldon fan and this book is one of the books in that series. It is not my favorite book of the series and drags on a little here and there but is necessary to read in order to progress with the whole story. I love the series and will read it and re-read it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fiery Cross","review":"Simply put...whenever the story gets interesting, the author cuts off the plot.The description on the dust jacket makes the book appear to be very different than it actually is. If you are looking for a time traveler story line, do not read this book. Very little is about time travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Wow, I don't know what to say, but that I am relieved that I am not the only one who felt this way with this book. I'm also encouraged that the next book got better reviews! I'm reading it now. I almost decided not to, this book was so bad. But I loved the ones prior, so I fought my way through...it only took me two or three months! What a chore. Fortunately, the sixth book is already proving to be more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Is Underrated...","review":"This book is vital to the lives of Jamie and Claire Fraser and the rest of their family and friends. It was NOT boring, but it was long. It's a more subtle tale when compared to the others, especially Outlander, but no less fascinating and intriguing. It's Jamie Fraser! We get to join him and Claire in their lives once again. Can't get much better than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Mark","review":"Please don't get me wrong; I LOVED the first and second books in the Outlander series, but I think they have gotten progressively worse and The Fiery Cross is not a good book. It is agonizingly detailed without any purpose. I really don't need 4 1/2 pages on a stinky diaper.Countless new characters are introduced without any direction or reason. None of them enhance the story or advance the plot....is there a plot? I felt like this was 1,000 pages of set up for the final book. Jamie does still have his adorable moments that remind us why we love him so much. But I would think Claire would have outgrown her tantrums and moments of ridiculous naivety. Roger and Brianna continue to be bland and boring. In fact, that is how I would sum up the entire book, boring. All fans will read it anyway, but don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and ridiculous","review":"I was very tempted to take a red pen to the pages and send the book back with a note requesting a refund, but lucky me, I borrowed it. I enjoyed the four other books and after plodding through this tome found that nothing had really happened of any merit. Diana Gabaldon has played on her past successes to produce this disjointed, uninspired piece of \\"work\\". I will say the book was entertaining, just not in the manner I think it was intended. I wadded through breast feeding, dirty diapers and pustulent wounds to see what the characters might be doing and it seems all they were interested in was rutting like animals in heat. I think the word I'm looking for here is...plot. By the time I had finished reading this \\"piece of work\\", I didn't like the characters and really didn't care what they were doing. I was sorry I had wasted my time and angry at myself for not having seen it coming. .... I think it's time to put this story to rest and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one was a disappointment","review":"What a disappointment this lastest Jaime/Clair saga has been. I generally can finish a book this size in a couple of days, but I can't seem to get through more than few pages of this really boring, trivial material at a time. Do I really care what is in a baby's diapers? Do I really care how messy breast milk can be?What happened to the historical excitement of the previous books that I would spend hours reading? It's gone. This latest book is a ponderous struggle and will be one book I will try to re-sell. Don't waste your money. If you want more of Clair and Jaimie, just re-read the first ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of it all...","review":"The molten tresses, the leaky breasts, Claire's potty-mouth, Roger's mooning and Brianna's whining. ENOUGH. Fiery Cross could not have been a bigger letdown for me. Sloppy, plot-less,repetitive and well...BORING!Does 4 best-selling books really entitle an author to put out 900-plus pages of meandering moanings and historical detail that glare out at you as \\"I researched this, so I have to use it!\\"?And where the heck was the editor and publisher??? Were they just so happy to get the book into there hands after such a long period that they rushed through the publication? I mean, did anyone actually READ this dreck before it went to press??? Obviously not. I wish I hadn't.I wish Diana Gabaldon would move on with the mysteries she wants to write; she's obviously lost her perspective on the whole Jamie/Claire saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latecomer to Outlander series","review":"I originally read Drums of Autumn because my husband bought it in an airport as a travel book and just couldn't get through it. I fell in love with the characters of Jamie and Claire (especially Jamie). I bought the Fiery Cross as soon as I saw it in the bookstore and couldn't wait to find out what happened next. I've only picked up the history of the first three books from references in #4 & #5. I've just ordered the first three and will start all over. I will say the Fiery Cross was a little slow going at first, but I enjoy the reality of the day to day as love and marriage mature. I'll start from the beginning with Outlander and hope that the next book will be complete when I finish reading all five in a row. Please Diana...don't kill Claire and Jamie off in that housefire. Keep them around for awhile..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a nightmare to read","review":"I am reading it in French and it is a nightmare to read. I'm around 500 pages now and I do not know if I will finish reading it.... I cannot believe we have waited so long for a boring book like that. I could not believe it when the first day (in the book) was over and I was at page 300 and nothing happened.... This book doesn't add anything to the story... deceiving.... Sorry Diana"},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggling to get to page 200","review":"I'm so sorry to be disappointed in this book. Like everyone else, I couldn't wait to get it. What I truly don't understand is what has happened to DG's sense of story, dialogue, pacing, and wonderfully imaginative writing. None of it is here.DG, if you took advice from somebody about what to include in this book, get rid of that person! To thy own self be true!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now we really see the Professor's brain","review":"As with most of the reviews, 1,2 and 3 were smashing, I trudged through 4 in anticipation of another smash hit. But I was disappointed with Fiery Cross. Dianna has switched on her University Professor brain, with it necessity for detail lost on us \\"commoners\\". \\"Outlander\\" is no longer a learning exercise, with all it's excitement for her. Dianna has now taken on the novelist job. It's to bad the story is suffering. I will as others, continue to read until Jamie and Claire pass of the scene. But I hope their lives liven up for book 6 and 7. Thank you for the good times, we learned our Scottish history!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana&#65533;s Disgusting Book of Bodily Fluids","review":"A revolting chaos of a manuscript - could the author be thoroughly sick of these books and seek to totally alienate the reader? From Outlander to Outlandish - this 1000 page tome (lots of book for the buck - with very small margins and fonts), the focus is not so much on history, or romance, but bodily secretions. ... nothing is so disgusting that it is overlooked - perhaps it should be renamed The Complete Book of Bodily Fluids? In addition to the penicillin experiments, gangrene, and an unorthodox autopsy, this tale certainly qualifies as an amazingly sick effort. No, I'm not kidding. Tedious to the nth degree I set it aside three different times. I read every blasted page of this revolting book, wanting to unearth some of the magic, mysticism and creativity of the earlier time travel books. I never found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Diana - No More Lactating Women!","review":"The fact that I was disappointed in this book is not going to keep me from reading the next two. However, I definitely won't be re-reading it when I hear the next one is coming out!And please, Diana, enough of full chests (...) And poopy diapers. Every time I thought you were going to give it a rest, there Briana or the baby goes again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Nothing","review":"I read the previous novels and thoroughly enjoyed them. Sorry to say, I gave up on this one after 120 pages or so.............nothing was happening! Very disappointed with Gabaldon's effort. She has extended a good thing too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Books 1-4 were great and I read them in miracle time. However, the fifth one, I can not make myself finish it. It took a week to read each of the other books and it has been 3 months on this last one, I have no interest in the characters boring lives anymore. No action at all or romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"did anyone like this book? there is a good reason if not!!!","review":"...I love historical fiction and all the better that it was over 1000 pages. But after struggling through 250 pages of descriptions of a what people were wearing, of a woman flipping her hair every 10 pages and descriptions of 3 different sorts of rain where no one seems to get wet I decide that this is some sort of woman's book about the hinting scents of love and has a storyline with as much action as watching a puddle dry up..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic!!!!","review":"This was an epic novel, that kept me riveted! I love Clare and Jamie. The history was so interesting. Suggest if u can read, u should have this on ur list."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"for me to dislike a book about history, is almost unheard of. But i can say this book was a dull, boring and to me unlikeable book. I give it a 5 thumbs down, and I have NEVER done that for ANY book I have ever read before. What makes this even worse for me anyway, this is about MY fore-fathers. I hope their lives wern't as dull as this book. I'll stay with my familys personal stories, they are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"The only fault I find in this series (Outlander)is the length of time between books. The last one came out in 2009, the next book in the series won't be out for another year. Four years is pretty awful. The series itself, (that means every book in it) is one of the best series I have ever read. Each book is almost impossible to put down. Having said that I wish I hadn't bought the first one till the whole series was published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immerse Yourself","review":"Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series is one of my all time favorite book series. I have spent the last month rereading the entire series, one right after another, and find myself thinking with an \\"accent\\", using Jamie's words or phrases in my mind! Please do yourself a favor and endulge yourself with the entire series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Finished it only because I like the series","review":"If The Fiery Cross hadn't been in the middle of a series that I really like, with characters that I love, I would have quit reading it. This book was clearly well researched down to the minutest detail, and unfortunately, every bit of that detail is in the book. Much of the book isn't germane to the storyline or the plot, and I am sad to say that I was bored. I skimmed a good bit to keep awake. If the next one is this dull, I'll wait for the movies to find out what happens in the remainder of the series. Sorry, Diana Galbadon. I wanted to like it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst one of the series","review":"I am an avid DG fan, and have read all of the books to this series. This one is the only review I will post, reason being because I waited SOOOO long for it's release after the Drum's book. The writer is a classic for \\"leaving you hanging\\" until the next book. I have to honestly say, that I was really disappointed with this one. It took me forever to get thru it because of all the historical jargon and the story just lagged and lagged. If you are a first time reader of the series, I would go for the abridged version on CD (if available), and move on from there. You will not miss much and the later books are all worth the read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridgment to the extreme","review":"This may be a good book but the Audio Book version does not reflect any proof of it. I've never been a fan of abridged books and this audio further inforces that attitude. Events and story lines seemed to just flitter in and out with out much lead in and a much faster exit. Being a fan of the previous 4 book, which were listened to on tape, I expected a much more continuous story line of the main characters. If you listen to your books via tape or CD, skip this one. Read, or find someone to read the book to you. I would hope the book is better than the Audio version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"I cannot help but wonder where Diana's editor was with this book. I have been a faithful fan and reader for more years than I care to remember and I am disappointed by this latest book.It is a sloppy piece of fiction, ill-thought out and frustrating in its lack of pace. The former spark of magic that wove everything together in her last books is not present and the plot (if you can call it that) is lost in details about penicillian and leaking mammary glands.Brianna is spoiled and tedious, Roger is pointless (THEY are pointless, IMHO),Jemmy and his diapers and cute sayings are anything but cute, and Claire and Jamie are stuck in a large and vacuous rut. I found myself not even caring about Bonnet. His character can only be compared to Jack Randall and there IS no comparison.I just can't believe that THIS is what she spent 5 years on. Gag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the Editor?","review":"I picked this up the first day out, read the first 200 or so pages, but just can't find the motivation to finish. Where was the editor?I've found that if a book doesn't grab me from the beginning, it lingers beside the bed for a few months, until it eventually finds it's way back to my book shelf (where this one will go), or to the used book store. I'll keep this one because I'd like to have a complete set. Well, also complete. I didn't purchase the Companion. When I'd read that there was a star chart or some such nonsense included for Jamie & Claire, well, come on.Maybe I'll have finished Cross by the time the last book is published or at the least, I'll have skimmed through."},{"rating":"1","title":"An effort to get through it","review":"I fell in love with the Outlander series and wouldn't miss one of them. That being said, I almost struggled through \\"The Fiery Cross\\". Way too much description, large sections had nothing to do with anything and weren't even interesting from a reader's standpoint. There were some action sequences in this book, but the book should have been at least half as many pages. The story line would have moved much faster and readers would have been satisfied just as well...even more so. I found myself wondering many times when something would happen.I'm looking forward to reading Book 6 simply because of the more positive reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lumbering but still great","review":"I admit, I have been taking my time with this installment of the Outlander series. Perhaps that is why the slower pace hasn't bothered me. (Or alternatively, maybe my slow pace is due to the dragging story.) In any case, it is noticeable that the plotting isn't as tight in this book as it was in the earlier installments. However, the full realization of the characters and environment more than make up for it. Since I've been reading the book for a couple months, I feel like the characters are really alive in this alternate universe. When I get a chance, I visit with them. It's not a page-turner like the earlier books may have been, but it's brought me great pleasure nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diane Galbadon books Outlander series","review":"Love these books and can't wait to get her new book this fall. I now have the whole collection and highly recommend the series to anyone who likes Adventure, romance, and cliff=hangers.

I DON'T CARE ABOUT FRANK! I'm sooooo irrited by Claire and Bree because of Frank!! PLEASE!! Stop getting me upset!! He's in the past now! I don't feel sorry for him at all!! I don't care about him at all!! So please!! The book would be soooo much better if Frank would just remain DEAD and not mentioned again!!Will continue my other opinion later when I'm done with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fiery Cross","review":"As terrible as the 1st 3 were great. I greatly respect DG as a writer, but this is abuse of her talent, akin to a singer repeating only one line of a song. After the 4th installment I had my doubts, so I read the reviews prior to purchase; I wish the reviewers had been more honest!There is no plot, even though a constant wave of characters and situations are introduced to peak your interest-they do not bear fruit. So sad that such an amazing trilogy was allowed to build to such an anti climatic purgurtory for the fans. One can only hope that there was either a ghost writer hired or DG was paid A LOT to abandon a good story for this meandering purposeless prose.All that being said, I am skipping the last 50 % of the book and going to the next one, if I missed somethimg important, let me know, but Ill take my chances to save myself from this slog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped","review":"My husband and I met over this series of books, and were looking very forward to the next installment......and then it came out and I finished it first. UG! I love Diana Gabaldon, but PULEEZE!!! Brianna needs Midol and some psychosis therapy and needs to MOVE ON past playing Whose Baby Is It Anyways. I will always love Jamie and Claire, but I think Claire is getting a little risque, even for her own character. It dragged, and really, how much hell can we put Roger through and have him (realistically) live? We may have modern times characters, but they aren't superhuman. Let's keep it real, people. I put it down and had to fight to get through it....just to say I'd finished it. I'm sorry, it just wasn't what was promised or anticipated. It struggled to find it's own way, and LOTS could have been cut out.....who edited this thing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?","review":"I've tried, I really have, to get through this book. I loved the previous novels and still carry the torch for Jamie and Claire. However, this book just didn't give me anything to look forward to after the first several chapters and I ended up putting it down (for the third time?). The magical aura that permeates the first Outlander novels evaporates in The Fiery Cross. I hoped it to be a continuation of the previous works, full of magic and passion, especially after waiting so long for it to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"As an avid fan of Jamie & Claire et al., I was greatly disappointed in the Fiery Cross. I am still having trouble getting through it - I think I am into chapter 7 or so after having the book for about two years. Its as if Diana Gabaldon didn't write it because it lacks everything that made her other books successful - interesting adventures, fabulous character build-ups and great plots that tie together. I look forward to her next book and hope that it gets back to what we love about the Outlander series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana, Where was your Editor?","review":"What a disappointment! I loved the first 4 books in this series, and eagerly awaited this one. Too bad! She rambled on and on for over 1000 pages. The plot was almost impossible to find, and the descriptive passages would have been good, had a decent editor gone at them with a red pencil. I know there is another book in the works. I recommend the author focus on plot, character development, and conciseness. She has done better before, and conceivably could do so again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BURN THIS ONE!!!","review":"Ugh, it took me 3 weeks to finish this book. (Travel a lot).I had too many other good ones to get to first. I adored OUTLANDER, even Drums of Autumn; Voyager - so, so. but I was so enthralled with Jamie and Claire it didnt matter. I was with them once again.But that brat Brianna was not worth all the trouble Jaime and Claire went thru to have her! Then we have to put up with her smart mouth, lactation, and and her poor, unhappy, snotty baby. What little there was of Jaime and Claire was pretty good. Hated seeing them get so old so fast, altho a child like Brianna would be the excuse she was an only child.The book was much too long to endure and was anyone watching the editing? I think I will re-read Outlander in preparation for Ms Gabaldon's next. Hopefully, it will be shorter and get to a point. I, too, would like to see them back in Scotland, but alas, it is not to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series wears out!","review":"I could not put down Outlander and found Ms Galbaldon's story line very unique and entertaining. Colorful and exciting as she held my interest in Highland Scotland before the Battle of Culloden, defining historical facts with great characters. I followed through with the next 3 books in the series wondering why I was not as warm to each successive book, but oh my, what has happened to her story in Fiery Cross? It's like she has fizzled in fatigue all that she could say - even about Claire and Jamie. The strength of Jamie's personality is gone. I find the book tedious and lacking suspense, a captivating plot, shallow character and poor development of Brianna and Roger. IF I finish it, I doubt I will go on in to her further books in this series. Even the author appears tired of it all! This seems to happen to many a series when the first book is wonderful and captures a readership, and following books just have little left to add to the personalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My first inclinations on reading this book were wonderful. It takes a skilled storyteller to walk a reader through a protagonist's day, moment by moment, and maintain interest. The minutae in the first chapters were great. But where was the plot?I stopped midway through the book and set it aside.A month later I tried again from the beginning, thinking perhaps I'd lost some thread that would impel the story forward. Again I stopped as the story lagged. The interminable letters wore down my patience to translate the formal language of letters into something that mattered to me. There was no cohesion to the events, no central reason for moving on.It is a real pity. The author has proved over and over that her storytelling skills are topnotch. This book has become a chore, though, and I have enough chores in my life already. I will not buy the next. If it reviews better I will borrow it to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Good","review":"I felt like a had to write a review. So many people are comparing this book to her other books instead of this book on its own. The beginning is a little slow but heats up about a third of the way into the book and keeps going. Diana Gabaldon has a remarkable way of describing her characters and their surroundings that you feel you are there. The amount of reasearch that has gone into this book is amazing and seems historically accurate. I think this is a great book on its own, and another great book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fiery Cross","review":"I waited with much impatience for this book to be published and I enjoyed it tremendously. I must be one of the few who think her works have continued to improve from the less enjoyable Outlander to the latest book. I stayed up 2 nights straight to finish it and even my husband quit pestering me when he realized how much it enthralled me. I especially enjoyed the scenes at Aunt Jocasta's wedding and the descriptions of Claire's medical procedures. I can hardly wait for the next one--and I'm sure it will be a long wait because writing this good takes a long while!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Outlander book","review":"I read all the others and loved them, including the Outlandish Companion. This book was so boring I gave up and still haven't finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for.....","review":"After avidly reading the rest of the Outlander series, I have fallen in love with the characters, the incredible story Gabaldon gives us, and the excellent flow of words. The Fiery Cross stopped me short. After finishing Outlander in 2 days, I barely made The Fiery Cross in a month. I found myself constantly re-reading pages, trying to figure out just what had happened, and reminding myself that I love these books.Please, read Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, and Voyager first, so that you have the stomach to attempt this book. This series is incredible and includes my now favorite books, I just have to remember that everyone has hits and misses. I am finishing A Breath of Snow and Ashes as we speak, and it has picked up the old flavor, making me oh so happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it from the library","review":"This book is not worth the money. I was hopefull this book would be written more in the style of the 1st three and was very disappointed when it was more like the Drums of Autumn. I also don't understand why at least once a chapter Brianna's engorged breasts had to be mentioned. I think the author is trying to push Brianna & Roger and I never really cared for these two characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there an editor in the house?","review":"How far the mighty have fallen. Outlander was an imaginative, unusual historical romance full of fabulous characters and compelling storylines. Unfortunatey, with each novel in the never-ending saga of Claire and Jaimie, Gabaldon seems to stray farther and farther from this marvelous beginning. With The Fiery Cross she has entered free-fall. Because I was disappointed with Drums of Autumn, I did not buy this book, but borrowed it from my library. Thank goodness ... it is unreadable and irritating. Gabaldon, who achieved much notoriety from this series, has obviously made the mistake of believing her own publicity. The book needed a mighty editor wielding an even mightier pen. Look elsewhere, gentle readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"No magic","review":"There is no magic in this book. I don't mean travelling through stones type magic. I mean the magic that hooks you and makes you read the book over and over. I'm half way through, and if I didn't have so much emotion invested in these characters from the previous books, I'd stop reading it right now. I certainly won't be re-reading it.The book is historically accurate. Overall it's well written. The details of life at that time are well explained. Perhaps the small details of life in pre-revolutionary America need to be told. But not in this book. Not in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bree's Book of Breastfeeding","review":"Being an original Gabaldon cultist, it pains me to say this book was a great disappointment. Gabaldon has dipped more into the romance genre and away from historical fiction with this ode to Brianna's Big Breastfeeding Boobies. Geez! After reading about Bree's breasts and Claire and Jamie's stolen intimate moments over and over again I was bored to tears. The Fiery Cross did not advance the storyline, nor create any more of the famous Galbadon clues I so enjoyed discovering in her previous books of THE OUTLANDER series. Let's hope the next and final book of the series lets the characters go out with a bang, not a whimper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fiery Cross","review":"I think the abridged version is better than the full book. But not up her normal standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Back!!!!","review":"I was so excited when Fiery Cross finally came out. Having read it several times, I must say that I truly loved it. I was very disappointed with Drums, but this book has more than made up for it. I absolutly love every book in this series! It cleared up a lot of questions left from previous books, yet left room for several more to come, I can't wait until another one comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiery Cross / A Miss","review":"I was disappointed in how much substance this book had in relations to her previous books in the series. I felt that there were about 120 pages of worthy reading. The other pages were redundencies. I felt that the Briana character could have been developed more. The author did point out that she was a good shooter and therefore a good hunter. It was interesting when she was trying to teach Roger how to shoot. I also liked the fact that she did not hesitate when it came to shooting Bonnet. I tired of Briana breast feeding. Come on Diana, give Roger and Briana so common excitement and let Jamie and Claire spend a little time baby-sitting the grandkid. It's also about time for someone to go through the stones and check on what history they are changing or Claire should take Jamie to the future.I don't want to know that someone else has come through the stones unless it is a colony of people that Claire, Roger and/or Brianna know! THIS BOOK IS NOT A PAGE TURNER."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll re-read Outlander, thanks","review":"I gave up many precious hours of sleep reading Outlander, DIA, Voyager and Drums. I cried. I laughed. I named my rabbits Claire, Jamie, Roger and Bree. Unfortunately, so far the Fiery Cross is failing to keep me awake - in fact, the first 150 pages or so have put me to sleep like nothing since my Accounting textbooks. I've put it away and decided to read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets first - more exciting and no poopie diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOOOOOOOO boring.","review":"I've been trying so hard to finish this book. The other Outlander books have been fantastic. I couldn't get enough of them, and I hear that the next one is better, but this one makes me not want to make it to the next one. Its drawn out and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fiery Cross","review":"Unfortunately, I have to agree with many of the disappointed Diana Galbaldon fans about this one. I spent 2 months breezing through the first three volumes of the Outlander series, finding it impossible to get anything done but read. But I really had a difficult time getting through #4 & #5, in particular. Hang in there though, while this one was not her best effort, it is still worth reading and #6 is great. I can barely wait until the next volume comes out, promised sometime in December of 2008."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to be writing this......................","review":"I love the Outlander series and I'm in love with the characters, but this book is so boring. I am having the hardest time getting through this. The first 4 were great. I couldn't get enough, until I started this one. I haven't even finished it yet. I've gotten to page 647 and still Jamie's aunt is not married yet! The reviews for A Breath of Snow and Ashes are much better, so I've got my fingers crossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so disappointed I cried.","review":"I was caught up in the magic of Jaime and Clair. The first 4 novels moved me through all the ranges of human emotion. I couln't sleep for days because I could not put them down. I waited impatiently for this 5th novel which I find flat, long winded and quite boring. What happen to the passion and fast paced excitement? The only events covered in detail are the battles and they are colorless as well. I miss the passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read the last 100 pages-while standing in a bookstore!","review":"Like everyone else I loved the first 3 books, but this was worthless. Readers can easily stay on top of the main plotline by taking my advise in the title - just skip to the last 100 pages and save yourself 800+ pages of the detailed descriptions of Jemmy's soggy diapers. With all her attention to historical detail and accuracy I was longing for one more detail of 18th century life - High infant mortality rates! Can't this kid fall into a well? I hope Gabaldon's publisher will take note of the criticisms in ... and edit future books more strictly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editor, please!","review":"Having been a huge fan of the first two books of this series, I am sad to find that the ongoing adventures of Jamie and Claire have become torturous reading. The Fiery Cross is ploddingly slow and once again peopled with extraneous characters. Have Diana Gabaldon's editors gone on siesta? The reader is subjected to almost 150 pages of crushing detail at Auntie Jocasta's wedding (and how many times will we be subjected to Jamie running his finger down the nape of Claire's neck?) A far cry from the early books, this one is not worth the money. If you're into characters continually dashing into the woods for a quickie or a recipe for Claire's homemade Penicillan then, by all means, this is the book for you. If not, and you feel compelled to finish the entire saga, visit your local library. I just have one question. Diana, are you ever going to wrap up this story and write something else???"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fiery Cross","review":"This book was a great disappointment, and the author did her characters a disservice. The book has no plot and instead, goes on and on for nearly 1,000 pages. It could have been titled \\"The Daily Life of Jaimie and Claire et al.\\" I loved the previous books and hated this one. A chapter was included on Bree and Roger convincing their baby son to \\"poo\\" in a chamber pot. This is literature? I was surprised the main characters didn't rise up and revolt. I only finished the book because of loyalty to the characters. We can cross our fingers the next will be better. Otherwise, Jaimie and Claire's adventures in the American Revolutionary War will take as long as the actual war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer- Anyone want to e-mail a summary to me?","review":"I, like many others, very much enjoyed the previous 4 books. This one is killing me to get through. I have picked it up a few times over the last 8 months and just can't get through it.I have read past the part where the militia returns home.Anyone out there want to volunteer to summarize what happens in the last part of the book via e-mail so that I can get on with the next one?Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not my favorite","review":"I do love this series...but Firey Cross did not hold me spell bound the way the other books did..but still it's a part of the story..and has it's strong points..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Series!","review":"Another great installment of the Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon. I've been a solid fan of this series since I picked up the first book. The author, with her words, paints a picture so real, that at times it feels as though one could actually see and smell the Scottish Highlands. I've fallen in love with the characters through the Outlander series, and I've fallen in love with Scotland! Enjoy this series, you won't be disappointed. I'm telling everyone I know about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I loved this whole series of books, but I think this series should have been wrapped up a few books ago. It felt like she was just making this book up as she went along. I had to almost force myself to keep reading it in hopes it would get better. I hope this will be the last book in the series, even if it is not I won't be reading any future editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the details others found too slow","review":"This was my first Gabaldon novel. Contrary to what other reviewers have written, I found the medical details very interesting. It is refreshing to read about medical history and herbal treatments/holistic treatments of the times in the context of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiery Cross Needs a Good Editor","review":"After patiently awaiting Diana Gabaldon's newest book I was incredibly disappointed by this large, plotless monster. The writing remains good and the characters true but it doesn't take 1000 pages to tell this particular tale. I kept hoping that something was going to happen but by page 800 I had that sinking feeling that we being led around the countryside with nothing to feel satisfied by, not even the death of a certain evil sailor. I can't believe that a loved one or even a trusted editor couldn't have persuaded Diana that there were too many details and not enough plot to pull this off. I guess she thought that 1000 pages would cover up the fact that there really wasn't a story. I won't be buying the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every one of Diana's books a delight to read.","review":"I started with Outlander many years ago when Diana had just finished writing her first novel and I have followed Jmie and Claire for almost 15 years now and always anxiously await the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"love them all","review":"You are hooked, what a series, can never get enough, just kept reading, can't wait till number eight comes out"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Outlander Series.","review":"I can't get enough of the Outlander books! I don't want these charactors to ever end.Just absolutely the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought it was just me!!!","review":"I purchased \\"The Fiery Cross\\" in November and it's almost January and I haven't gotten to page 150. Oh, I will finish this novel one day but that day is far into the future. I agree totally with the reviewers who described this novel as \\"boring/too slow\\", I just can't get into it.I was one of the many who became hooked on the Outlander series (Claire and Jamie's story was a phenomenal -- one the great love stories of my time) and as others have stated I couldn't wait until the release of The Fiery Cross and to admit how terribly disappointed I am hurts a lot. Ms. Gabaldon was one of the first authors who made me appreciate the concept of time travel. I just wish I could travel through time and get her to do a rewrite to bring life to the characters I have loved for years and miss very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let-down this was!","review":"Wow! After loving all 4 books of this serie, I could not wait to read the fifth! But what a sad, pathetic attempt this was! It would have been better to leave it at four books! The story was already told. Now, I feel it spoiled it to drag all these beautiful characters in this new installment. If you want to read these book, stick with one through 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I have read a few somewhat negative reviews of this book but I just can't see the cause for it. The Fiery Cross was a great book...each of the books in this series were different. They have to be, they span generations and centuries and continents. If every book was set in Scotland, it would be quite boring. Each book in the Outlander series had its own charm, the fifth book was just as good as the rest of them. If anything, I think Dragonfly in Amber had the most complex history to get your mind around. This was a pleasure to read..looking forward to the next one, Diana!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe I Waited For This","review":"I waited in anticipation for the newest of Diana Gabaldon's books to appear. The Fiery Cross, however, was a huge disappointment. Unlike her previous stories of Jamie and Claire full of romance, action and adventure, this one plods on and on yet seems to go nowhere. Even a skirmish with colonial rebels and quests for gold can't help this storyline. The reader is bogged down with descriptions of colonial medicine and cures and treatments for one ailment or another. I kept reading with the hope that the book would get better but was bitterly disappointed. Ms. Gabaldon's previous books captured the imagination of a great romance and a time gone by and had me wishing the story would never end. This book,however, I was happy to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited so long for this???","review":"The first four books in the series were so gripping, so vivid and well written, so wonderfully spun, that I could do little else but read them for the few months it took me to get through them all. Then I sat on the edge of my seat, waiting for The Fiery Cross. I bought the book in November, and have finally given up on it. Put it away. I'm tremendously disappointed. I kept trying to love it. Or even to like it. Or to care about at least one of the characters...Perhaps when the next one is due I will pick it up and drag myself through the last third, just so I'll be able to give Diana Gabaldon and the characters another shot...but maybe I'm done with the series (how sad)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough............","review":"It happened in August, 2001 when I was travelling and saw Diana Gabaldon's books' for the first time. Since that time I have read the first four books twice and just finished The Fiery Cross last night. I am in mourning. These books have become such a part of my life. I felt like I was in the room with the main characters daily. I love the mature relationship of Claire and Jamie and the respect they have for each other. I wasn't bored by this book. I am too caught up in the series. When routine sets in, something usually happens and we are taken down a new path. Diana's writing style has changed through the years, but can she tell a story and bring her characters alive!There are many unresolved questions and I eagerly await Sons of Liberty.I have enjoyed every minute reading this saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused and Disappointed","review":"The Fiery Cross was a great disappointment. I skimmed the book the first time and then went back and read it again. It did not read like a Gabaldon book. The story was disjointed and did not move smoothly. Even the main characters were different. I appreciate that people change as they age, but would Jamie really have whined just because Clair wouldn't kiss him? His actions at Joscasta'a wedding were completely out of character. And what about Clair being worried about burning the clothes when Jamie was perhaps going to die? Then there's Furgus, has he been overlooked by Jamie now that Jamie has a son-in-law? Who by-the-way, is a jerk. The book doesn't fit with what has gone on in the other four books. The book just doesn't ring true.I really got the impression that Ms Gabaldon had to rush to get the book done in a short period of time. I hope she takes as much time as is needed to finish the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Was the Plot?","review":"Having read all of the previous books in this series, I was utterly disappointed with this latest effort. There was no plot, none of the excitement or adventure with which the other books held us captivated. It seemed as if this book was simply used to answer a few questions left from the earlier books and yet never did answer the one repeated in The Fiery Cross. (Who cares who Jemmy's father was?) It was worth reading simply because we care so much for the characters we grew to love in the previuos 4 novels. The Fiery Cross does not stand on it's own or live up to our great expectations. I hope the last in the series is better- I for one, would wait longer for a well planned novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Plot?","review":"I thought Diana Gabaldon was getting tired of the Outlander people in The Drums of Autumn, but after The Fiery Cross, so am I! This book has less plot than the average Seinfeld episode. Unless you count Gabaldon's attempts to see how many horrible things can happen to these people. Please! Brianna is even more unlikable, Jemmy is annoying, Roger is hanged and loses his only talent. Jamie, the red-headed hero, is annoying! If you feel you must read this, please check it out from the library and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is There an Editor in the House??","review":"What a disappointment! I thought that the first three in the series (Outlander, Dragonfly & Voyager) were well-written and innovative fiction, and Drums was fair-to-middling. Unfortunately, Fiery Cross is a saggy, baggy mass of largely extraneous details on life in 18th century North America, with some familiar characters tossed in. I sure am glad I read a library copy, and didn't pay for it. I'll probably read the next one, hoping that in the meantime Ms. Gabaldon will stop with the self-indulgent, unedited prose, and accept the advice (and pruning) of competent editors. Delacorte should be ashamed of themselves for letting this one loose on the public in this state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment!","review":"I devoured the first 3 books in the series, was a little less thrilled with Drums of Autumn (the 4th book), and found this latest effort absolutely awful. I never did finish it - life is just too short to be bored to tears. Brianna and her husband (who is so dull that his name escapes me at the moment) are weak characters who can never fill Claire & Jamie's shoes. In fact, Claire and Jamie no longer fill their own shoes - this is a pale ghost of the brilliant, fiery love story that made this series an obsession with so many of us.The series really should have ended after Voyager, which is the last really good book of the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"the fiery cross","review":"My mother couldn't put it down, I t was exciting,humorous,great fun. interesting plot and authentic historical setting..she has enjoyed the whole series"},{"rating":"1","title":"certainly not a page turner","review":"I loved the first four books but this one is a snooze. No plot. No fleshing out of the story. All but the 4 main characters are just names on a page. I never found myself dieing for my kids to go to bed so I could pick up the Fiery Cross like I did for Outlander and the others. The only enjoyment I really got out of this book was that it freshened the characters and plots of the first four stories in my mind. That's the only reason I gave it two stars. Diana Gabaldon should try for quality and not quantity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I read Outlander in 2 days and the others in 3-4 days. It has been weeks since I purchased this one, and I am yet to finish the book!The book gets needlessly bogged down in day to day details, the grisliest of which was Jamie and Claire stumbling upon this crippled guy and his abused wife in North Carolina. Brianna and Roger are big bores, and the whole Fraser entourage is quite mind numbing.Please Diana, give us back the old magic! Better yet, I recommend you finish this series in the next book (a much slimmer one, I hope) and start a new one!!- A sincere and long time fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened Diana","review":"I honestly can't believe that the reviewer's that gavethis book 5 stars are legit!! (Friends of the editor maybe???)If there was one?? Yes I'm afraid I agree with the 95% ofreviewer's who were disappointed in this book, perhaps someoneelse has written this sequel? there seems no other logical explanation. Maybe Diana will redeem herself with the nextbook??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiery Cross","review":"As a lover of her series with Claire and Jamie, this one was a little slower pace than her others and not one of my favorites. But it does open some new doors, answer questions and lead up to the latest edition. The last 200 pages were probably the best and most exciting. Still highly recommended if you love the series and better the second time you read it if you needed a refresher for ABOSAA. Hang in there, its worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Gone are the adventures that Diana created in her previous stories. The book was way too long, and virtually nothing happened.I quickly grew tired of the lengthy, overly descriptive style of writing Diana used with this book. I still love the characters- Claire and Jaime, but they went nowhere from page 1 on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't even get through it!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely inhaled the other books in this series. Like others, I am bogged down with characters who are going nowhere, and the book just doesn't have the plot to grab the reader like they have in the past.Sorry, but this book is a yawn, no matter how many pages it has. I will persevere and try to finish it-eek, have never said THAT about a DG book before! Usually I ignore my family and just hunker down and read 24/7! I hope this is not going to be the new standard for the rest of her books in the Outlander series. I was very dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful addition to the series","review":"I have no idea why so many of the reviews of this book have been so negative - I found it to be a wonderful read, full of excitement, historical detail and beautiful writing. It is a long book - perhaps some readers are used to a fast fix when looking for good books? If you are a fan of this series, do not hesitate to purchase this book. It deserves a place of honor on your bookshelves, right next to the first four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiery Cross' flames a bit weak.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Diana Gabaldon and all her works, but compared to her other four books, this one didn't have nearly the amount of action the others did. I believe there were supposed to be six books originally, but because this one did much more set-up than the others, I heard she's going to do seven.Her usual attention to detail is fascinating, but I do wish more would have happened throughout the book. Oh, don't worry about me, I'm still hooked for life, and plan to read and re-read these books for a LONG time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I've been an avid fan ever since Outlander, and buy all these books in hardback. I've recommended them to others. So I impatiently awaited Fiery Cross. What a disappointment! Colonial America is an interesting era, and the characters are certainly well known and loved. There was a wealth of material to work with. But this book did little to advance the story line. I could find little in the way of a plot, and don't enjoy reading all the details of \\"bathroom functions\\" and breast feeding. I can see no reason for the entire \\"Aunt Jocasta\\" segment(s), which absorb much of the space, and am really tired of Brianna and Roger's marital problems. Why did they marry at all?? We all know Diana Gabaldon can do much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why so negative?","review":"I have read the negative reviews of Fiery Cross. I will grant some of you your negative comments, but on the whole, I found the book as captivating as the first four. When I acquired the first four, I re-read the Outlander and then went on. I never bogged down and found each as interesting as the one before. This last book, Fiery Cross, I couldn't wait for the paperback, and found Gabaldon's detailed accounts of each day captivating. Maybe I'm just a romantic, but I thoroughly enjoy the detail, because it helps me picture it in my mind. Like other reviewers, I'm wondering how Jamie's ghost came to be looking up at Claire in the window in the first book. I can't wait for the rest of the series to develop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Awaited - and dispointed","review":"I loved the first three books, reading them twice through. I thought books 4 & 5 not as good, however still interesting. I waited so long and was so excited for The Firery Cross to be released. I bought it as soon as it was available. I am very dispointed in the book. Jamie and Claire have lost their spark. The interplay between them is nothing like the first books. I really missed that. They are now boring. The book had entirly too much detail about day to day life and could have had about 300 pages cut and you would not have missed a thing. I hope Diana G.

I occasionally blow the dust off the cover and read a few pages before falling asleep.This book does not deliver the romance, supspense or excite of the earlier books. Had this book been the first in the series I would not have read the second.I am looking forward to Ms.Gabaldon's next novel in the series \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\"...let's hope that it brings a Breath of Life back to the storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"time to go...","review":"...back thru the stones. this had to be the most boring/irritating book in the series. where was the plot?? mildly interesting characters came and went, small hints of plots peaked through... and then faded into exhausting detail about -- gosh, i can't even remember. i slogged through it anyway -- in the last 100 pages things began to develope into a vaguely plot-like situation, but, alas, it was too little, too late. could there be a more annoying character than brianna? and if i read one more word about claire's hair \\"floating about her like a cloud\\" i am going to scream. hopefully wimpy roger will take the perpetually lactating brianna and son jemmy (and his dirty clout) back through the stones. the saddest thing about this book is that you really do stop caring about the characters, and just wish they would go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I could not wait for the next book in the Outlander series. Boy was I disappointed. This reads like a very bad romance novel.I sure hope her next one will be in tune with the original style of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fiery Cross","review":"I liked the book ,but, not as much as the first two. This one is too repetative ,and it left me with to many questions at the end. It seemed as if the writer was in a hurry to finish. What had happened to Ian ? Will there be another book about Claire and Jamie. They have become part of my life and hope to read more of these two. The next, could answer all the questions about Clare and Jaime , Ian and Jenny ,Will Jamie see Scotland again, or his sister and what about William? I ordered the next book about Lord John, But truley hope there will be another about Claire and Jamie..Looking forward to the next book. Thanks Mrs Gabaldon !! An Avid fan....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheesh","review":"IT BLEW. I read the other novels like, four times over. I was so excited to see this new installment in the bookstore, i shrieked with delight (and received several dirty looks from Barnes and Noble patrons). Since others have been so vocal about their disappointment as well, this is moot point, but I had to vent-- it bit. REALLY HARD. Diana Gabaldon owes me almost 30 dollars for this book (when it first came out), and days of my life. OK, i'm done now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Bad","review":"I have nothing to say good about this book. I can not understand how a great writer could even dream of trying to pass this off. It is with out a doubt the longest collection of drivel I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"The first 3 books were really good. This one is just too long and boring. I read it and I can't remember a single thing that would stand out. It's all blah blah blah, life is hard in NC, some stuff happens nobody cares.I think Diana's run out of ideas for Claire's adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gabaldon-A Driving Force","review":"Diana Gabaldon is a driving force in the romance novel business and has so many levels of intellect-YEAH RIGHT!!!!!!!!!I would rather have really bad indigestion than go and buy another one of these boring books.I think people contemplating buying one of these books should go buy a red hot chilli peppers cd,nirvana's nevermind,Pearl Jam's ten,or go buy the movie Looking For Ali Brandy,or if you are still interested in reading pick up a copy of Anthony Kiedis's Bio Scar tissue out next fall,and if it's fiction you are into well go to the Library and pick out a book instead of spending your money on this waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of God, someone find this woman an editor!","review":"Just as I suspected, the fifth book in this juggernaut proves what I've said all along -- Outlander would have been a fabulous trilogy. TRILOGY. That's three books, Diana. With some astute editing, we could have gotten Jamie and Claire to their graves, with page-turning romance, adventure and history packed into each book. I mean, did we really need Mr. Willoughby in Voyager? That's a long way around the block for a little acupuncture. Drums was a snore, and Fiery Cross is ... practically unreadable. I had to grab the new Nora Roberts just to cleanse my palate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Cheat","review":"This book is a perfect example of how our current publishing trends can take advantage of readers' hopes, and how a poorly written behemoth can nevertheless become a bestseller and give a much-loved author the idea that she can get away with cheating her devoted fans out of 25 bucks. If I were more cynical, I'd suspect Diana Gabaldon of now stretching her \\"story\\" (and by the way, where was the story in this installment?) out so that she and her publishers can make more money than either deserve.I sincerely hope that all of the fans disappointed by the Fiery Cross will wait for the library copy of the next one, or borrow a friend's copy. The publishers may get their best seller anyway, but this kind of exploitation should not be encouraged.Virtually nothing is resolved in this book, and the loose ends and strung-out storylines are a poor substitute for true suspense. Readers, revolt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endlessly Slogging","review":"I had lots of trouble getting through this one. It seemed like an interminable collection of endless details. The obsession with leaking breasts and dirty diapers, while tolerable at first, became revolting.I fell in love with Outlander the first time I read it. It was tightly plotted, the characters were fascinating, and there was a sense of movement and plot development. The time travel aspect was superb! But each book in the series became more wordy, with endless, unbelievable, minor characters. Still, the others were satisfying. But this one was pure flab. The plot hardly advanced, the central time-travel element was almost nil, and the tedious baby poop details tried my patience to the utmost.The author is fabulously talented, but she needs to edit, edit, edit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was her editor?","review":"I too have nothing to say that hasn't been said before, I am hoping that Ms. Gabaldon will tune into these reviews and get the point that even the truest of fans can become tired of the same old thing. This book was so boring that I went out and bought the audio book just so I could finish it (I find listening sometimes easier than reading). I am not sure how she made Claire and Jamie so uninteresting - but she did. Ms. Gabaldon, please make the next book half as long as The Fiery Cross and re-read your first book and give us fans what we know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"CONTINUING EXCELLENCE!!!","review":"She does it again! Diana Gabaldon continues her incredible story of Jamie and Claire in the years just before the American Revolution. Rarely is a reader treated to such excellence in any story, but to have an author write a fifth book in a series (with 2 more to come) proves her ability, genius, imagination and love of her craft.Others will give highlights of the book in their reviews. I just want to urge readers to begin, if they haven't started, the adventure of a lifetime. And, I might add, these books do not belong in the \\"Romance\\" genre, although the publishing industry places them so. These books belong in the historical fiction section of all booksellers' stores. So, if you're looking for some bodice-ripper, don't waste your time--these books explore the relationship of two extraordinary people living in precarious times.Read this book. Read all the 'Outlander' books. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the Most Boring Book I've Ever Read","review":"If you're reading this review, I'm assuming you've already read (or at least read reviews of) the rest of Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series. This is the fifth book. You could skip straight from \\"Voyager\\" (the third book) to \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\" (the sixth), avoiding \\"Drums of Autumn\\" and \\"The Fiery Cross\\" entirely without missing a thing. \\"Drums of Autumn\\" is pretty boring. \\"The Fiery Cross\\" is completely boring. Between \\"Voyager\\" and \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\" Jamie and Claire settle in the mountains of North Carolina. That's all you need to know but if you're a glutton for punishment: \\"The Fiery Cross\\" focuses on the obscure \\"War of the Regulation,\\" a precursor to the American Revolution that reflected rumblings of discontent with British rule in the colonies. Bree and Roger have marital difficulties. Jemmy has poopy diapers. Claire performs medical miracles."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Longest Story ever Told","review":"After three weeks I was still reading about the same Day! It took me over two months to read this book because it kept putting me to sleep. I adored the other four books and have read them three times (The only books I have ever re-read). I was disappointed Brianna did not use more of her 20th century MIT education to improve life in the 1770's. I would have expected her to have at least figured out how to provide indoor plumbing to the cabin or how about solar heating? There are so many more interesting things she could have been doing besides breast feeding through an entire book. I don't have to worry about waiting for the next edition to this story. It will take me five years to forget the torture of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this woman a new editor, PLEASE!","review":"This book was at least 500 pages too long. Too much trivial info - at least 25 pages wasted on changing Jemmy's diapers & breast feeding. Has the author forgotten the concept of \\"PLOT\\"??This book has way too much padding. Please make the next one shorter & to the point. I'm sure glad I didn't pay money for this book! Borrow it from your public library if you must read it, is my advice!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Maximus","review":"I am sorry to say that I have to concur with so many other fans of the Outlander series. I have found myself, several times, gritting my teeth with something like bored exasperation. The others were, for the most part, so compelling that I could not put them down, even much of the previous book. I'm going to leave off this one and hope for better with the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word, BORING.","review":"I waited with eager anticipation the arrival of this book on the day of its release, like I've waited for no book previously. I couldn't wait to dig in. After reading Outlander, which could arguably be the best book I've ever read (and I've read tons), then the other 3 which were great in their own right, I had expected nothing short of greatness from The Fiery Cross. Boy, was I sorely disappointed. Was there an editor reviewing this tomb? I really can't believe it was published. It took me 6 weeks to plow thru the 979 pages and until the end I was still waiting for a plot. It had a ton of mini subplots but put together all you get is day-to-day life on Fraser's Ridge. Where's the adventure, the romance, the growth of characterization? I'm giving this 2 stars because it was good to be among the Fraser's & MacKenzie's again, and because Diana is still a creative writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slogging through 979 pages","review":"I love the Outlander series, but this book nearly did me in. I had to force myself to finish it. The story started to be engaging around page 600, but then it got awful again. Gabaldon got so bogged down in the minutiae of 18th century colonial life that I missed the plot points (if they were even there). Also, since there was such a long break between installments, it would have been helpful to have a little backstory included --- but that probably would have entailed another 500 pages! I'll get the next one from the library, but that's her last chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, with too much description, dialogue, and detail","review":"This book is a dissappointment after reading Gabaldon's first four. What I liked about her prievious books was the adventure and fast-paced interesting story line. This book didn't have that, at over 1400 tedious pages would have been better if edited to say, 700 pages.Much of the book is devoted to description, and endless threads of babies, nursing, and domestic life. A little description to support the story is needed, but there is so much in this book that it really couldn't hold my interest.Also, I thought many threads weren't plausable. The whole of the Jemmy thread could have been edited out. The Jamie snake-bite saved by penicillin that Claire made wasn't believable. The book builds to a climax and final confrontation with evil ship captain Stephen Bonnett. But that doesn't quite work and the baby Jemmy is definitely in the way and brought this thread down.I really didn't like this book and would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wait is Over, and Worth It","review":"Once again, I find Diana Gabaldon seamlessly weaving her fictional characters into hisorically accurate settings; I expect to go to the library and find Jamie's name listed a a participant in a battle! Gabaldon's character development is so excellent I find myself forgetting these are fictional characters, something I haven't done since first reading Gone With the Wind in my teens. I was extremely sorry to come to the end of the book, knowing I have a long wait until the next one, but I am very glad there will be at least one more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just finished, and I already miss Jamie!","review":"I just finished the story, and already I miss the thought of escaping into Jamie and Claire's world! I loved this addition to the wonderful books chronicling their adventures and romance. The only disappointment is that the next book isn't out yet. Like the previous reviewer I read slower and slower as I neared the end, and did my best to delay finishing the book. I just wasn't ready to say goodbye to the characters for another few years. In fact, I have owned this book for over a year and restrained myself from reading it until now because I knew how bittersweet it would be to come to the end.I highly recommend this book!!! It's definitely a must-read if you've been following the series. If you haven't, start with Outlander and savor every minute of the experience... soon you'll be waiting impatiently for the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Much-Anticipated 5th Book Fails to Deliver","review":"The long wait between Gabaldon's last book and this one in the Outlander series was definitely NOT worth it. This continuation of the Jaime/Claire and Brianna/Roger story leaves much to be desired. It never really goes anywhere and fails to offer the historical interest that made her other books great reads. The \\"romance\\" has gone out of this one as well -- the protagonists spend more time worrying about the outcome of intimacy than they do actually being intimate. I've always associated Gabaldon with a higher caliber of romance novel -- she's usually much more intellectual than what one normally finds under the \\"romance\\" category -- but this particular book hardly qualifies. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another book to keep on the 'must re-read list'!","review":"I have read this most recent of the long series and found found it to be just as indepth and interesting as all the previous titles. Obviously, alot of historical research is done for each one, and then the author weaves the information into historica fictional character and plots. I've read the entire series twice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a big setup for the next book","review":"Really really disappointing, though still well written.More like a travel guide to life 230 years ago than a novel.some good moments, but I am really not all that interested in Brianna and Roger. They are too durned perfect.Lots of plot threads got started, but this whole book was a big set up for the next book.Not sorry I read it, but an essential element seems to be missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book You Want to Read!","review":"Diana Gabaldon is a fantastic writer. I have enjoyed her books and her tapes. I even got my husband to listen to her books on tape. I have been reading excerpts on her home page and have been waiting this book. It is not disappointing. You feel as if these people are your friends and part of your family. I would recomend the whole series it is great. I have not finshed the Firey Cross yet. Nine hundred and some odd pages, but I am glad it is so big. I don't want to finsh with these people for a while. My Thanks to Mrs Gabaldon for such a fine series! I have enjoyed it very much. I like Clair, Jamie, Bree and Roger. They feel like they are my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud, Dud, Dud, Dud!!","review":"This has got to be one of the most boring books I have ever read. I can't believe that Diana Gabaldon wrote this. It is nothing like her past books. This one is completely predictable and lacks intrigue and imagination. Even the \\"revelation\\" scenes are so boring that you'll find yourself asking \\"That's it?\\" The book can be summarized in 5 sentences and that's being generous. I had absolutely no desire to slog through all 976 pages of this, but I did. Her other books were ones that I could not put down. I finished The Drums of Autumn in two days. I read the first three books all at once in about 5 days. It took me 10 days to finish this one. It is just not interesting. The story is disjointed and jerky. There is no continuity from one scene to the next. It is VERY repetitive. If subsequent books are like this one, I'll never pick up a Diana Gabaldon book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Judge the Series by this Book","review":"I loved the rest of this series, but this one is so boring I tried twice to read it, but both times got so bored with it I couldn't finish. But don't judge the whole series on this book. Read all the others. You'll enjoy those!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited for this???","review":"I couldn't wait to get this book. I preordered it and lept in excitement when it came in the mail. Then I started to read it. It is hopelessly boring, slow, and uninteresting, to say the least. I have read all the other books in the series and this one doesn't compare. What happened, Diana?! I definitely won't be reading the next one if it's anything like this. I want my old Jamie back with a dynamic Claire. Send Brianna through the stones and lose her forever along with Jemmy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fiery Cross","review":"I have loved all of Diana Gabaldon's previous books in this series, however, this book was boooooooooooooring and was almost impossible to finish. I did finish it, though, 'cause I didn't want to have wasted my money. I was completely disappointed in this book and hope that the next in the series is better. I'm glad I'm not alone in my judgement of this latest installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it.","review":"I've been reading the reviews and I can't believe some didn't care for this book! I love all the details--I want to hear them all. I don't know how I will be able to wait for the next book.I have lots of predictions about how things will work out and I can't wait to see if I'm right. I only hope Diana is keeping track of all the loose ends through all the books so she can wrap them up in the last book. And I pray she won't do what Jean Auel has done (make me wait more than 10 years for the next book).Anyway, this is probably my favorite book after the first (Outlander)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait!","review":"I awaited this book for almost 5 years, even rereading the first four in the series this summer to refresh my memory. I am totally disappointed with The Fiery Cross.Claire does nothing but complain about her life for most of the book. Jamie has been made a minor character. I really do not care about the ins and outs of breast feeding and potty training a child. Story lines were also started and dropped, without being taken to there conclusion. We are to assume everything turned out alright because no mention was made of them again.I will read the next one whenever it comes out, hopefully sooner than five years. We can only hope Ms. Gabaldon warms again to the characters, for if not it will not be worth the time or money to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a plot?","review":"I don't think I can finish this book and I'm on page 600 something. *yawn* Is there a plot here? Yes, certain passages have kept me going. Claire describing how she felt with menstrual cramps, wanting to 'run amok and slaughter everyone in sight' was charming and enough to make me want to read on, but I just can't do it.As others have stated, the breastfeeding thing is way overdone. I'm sick and tired of hearing about it, and when Claire jumped on the bandwagon and felt her own breasts 'tingling' with some child howling I slammed the book shut. Enough.The Outlander was my favorite book of all time. I fell in love with Jamie, the man of everyone's dreams, and Claire's courage had me enchanted. Diana, you just didn't have your heart into this one. This series should have stopped two books ago with Jamie and Claire in old age, maybe with a epilogue of Brianna putting flowers on their graves.. whatever. This just didn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed The Boat","review":"I too loved the first 4 books which I read 2 times each. I live with a modern version of Jamie and being the mother of 6 children spread over a 25 year span, I don't need to read about their bodily functions again, and again. Diana, you missed the boat on this book, dropped the ball, slept though most of it. I had to force myself to read until the end and it took nearly a month to just pick it up long enough to finally get interested. Your writing style of not writing in a flowing matter but bits and pieces then put together later, which I have admired until now, shows too much in this book as to why it's not the proper way to write. Will I buy the next book, of course, but if it doesn't get there it will be the last. I'll just read the first ones again and come up with my own version for the next book. Try harder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't heard it yet","review":"I'm listening to unabridged audios of the Outlander Series and even though I haven't heard The Fiery Cross yet, I will be in the next few weeks. I have not been disappointed in any of the books and am glad I'm listening to them. The reader does an excellent job on all the voices and I can picture what everyone looks like and where they are very plainly. I usually read books, but don't think I would enjoy reading these. The \\"visual\\" is much better listening to them. This is a series where you can't wait to get to the end to see what happens, and yet you don't want it to end because it's so good you want it to go on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I eagerly awaited this new novel in the series and bought it sight unseen. That was a mistake. I found it slow, plodding and it didn't hold my interest. The first 150 pages didn't move out of a single location and rehashed the same story line over and over. I'm not sure what happened to the writing. After 200 pages I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"missed the mark","review":"wonderful tale of frontier life, but face it, claire and jamie are old now, bree is a shrew, and there are far too many baby scenes in this book. maybe the last book will have more action, and less wandering around the woods chopping fire wood. what really annoyed me was the action in the last chapter, that should have showed up much earlier in the book, and given us something to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure I'm going to finish this book","review":"After years of anticipation, I am finding that I will have to force myself to finish this book. I am currently on page423 - all of the territory covered by these pages could have (should have) been covered in about 1/4 of that amount. There is no plot to move along, and we are losing Jamie and Claire, who have been reduced to bit players, pale shadows of their former selves. Others who are reading the book keep telling me it gets better - I'm still waiting. Unless there is a significant improvement in the story line over the next 100 pages, I will probably move on to another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Prose - No Plot","review":"What a disappointment! I loved the first 4 books in this series so much, I've read them all at least 3 times and will eventually read them again just for fun. The excitement, adventure and plot twists were topped only by the detailed historical data. While The Fiery Cross had plenty of historical data (although this book seemed to be really hung up on how things smell), it offered absolutely nothing in the form of excitement and adventure, or even plot for that matter. Diana is a wonderful writer, but her talents were completely wasted on this novel. Perhaps it's time to put Jamie and Claire to rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As with the other Gabaldon fans, I could not wait to get her latest book. I had re-read the others in preparation, and boy was I disappointed! Diapers and breastfeeding--page after page after page! I enjoyed her writing style--as always, and I like all the characters, so it was nice to visit them again. But, I just don't see the point of this novel. I truly hope the editing improves, or I will have to say good-bye to Diana. I've seen this problem with other authors--at some point the editors just stop doing their job, resting on the laurels of a \\"sure bet bestseller\\". What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Managed the Impossible - I no longer care! : - (","review":"Sorry to just reiterate what most of the reviewers have already said, but I wanted to cast my vote. I didn't finish this book despite sincere intentions. I just didn't have the heart to slog through any more, and sounds like I didn't miss much. What Gabaldon seems to have lost is that incomparable ability to make you CARE desperately what happens next. Voyager just about killed me, I was so anxious to see Claire return to Jamie. The instant where she finds him again in his printing shop ended the series for me. The circle was complete. Sure, his reunion with his daughter was important but nothing has returned that sense of breakneck urgency. Life isn't like that, but a great story should be. Otherwise it's just \\"Moonlighting\\" after Bruce and Cybil had sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"like Star Wars Episode II","review":"I loved Star Wars as a kid. However, when Episode I came out, I was very disappointed, because it seemed as though the focus was on all the wrong things--the annoying details instead of plot development and character interaction.Well, that's how I felt reading Drums of Autumn, and Fiery Cross is like Episode II--the lameness continues.Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber were wonderful books; Voyager was excellent up until about the middle; then the series began to decline for me. So many useless details that contribute nothing!Fiery Cross was the last blow though; diapers, leaky breasts, forever and ever. The writing has definitely lost its wit too--which was a large part of the joy of these books.I hope A Breath of Snow and Ashes is the redemption--like SW Episode III.PS: Why can't the story go back to Scotland? I hated American History in high school, for heaven's sake! I don't want to read about it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Could Have Been Great","review":"I have read everything that Diana has written (well, almost) and I have to say that I would have preferred to save my money. I love her rich detail and characters, but this book had absolutely no plot. I was half way into the book when I started to scratch my head and say \\"why?\\". It seems as if it is a filler book. 400 some odd pages and Brianna still isn't married and it is still the same darn day! Anyone who has read the first four books knows without a doubt that Clair and Jamie love one another I felt as if I was being hit over the head with it. I thought maybe the reason for the book would be to get Stephen Bonnett, but alas no. Because I am such a fan I will read the other books, but I will not be standing in line to receive the first one they hand out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted: Editor with a Heavy Hand","review":"Is Diana Gabaldon being paid by weight? I enjoyed the early books in this saga very much. She is a talented writer and the story has a lot of intrinsic interest. She has a large group of devoted followers who are hungry to continue with the characters. But we are given a pile of pages with no coherent story, no dramatic energy and far too many words. Get it at the library and skim it, if you have to find out what's going on. You'll find that not much is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"I loved the other books in the series, so I got this one the day it came out in 2001. I've been trying to read it since 2001! There is too much detail and no plot. I don't need to know how they changed diapers for 128 pages or so. The only interesting thing so far was about the Friesian horses, and that didn't last very long.Another thing that gets me is, who wants to read about this cool Scottish guy who is never in Scotland?I'll pass on the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Slow Moving Book","review":"I am commenting on the unabridged audio book....I was dissapointed in this story. In fact I never made it past the 3rd of 6 tapes. The story was slow moving, and by the 3rd tape you were still not sure what the basic plot line was. It was sort of like watching someone's boring life. There was a lot of good description of the area and the medicine of the time but the overall story was too slow for me.In fact if I hadn't re-read the back of the box I wouldn't have understood which people went back through time.I was dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Boring to Be So Long","review":"I am slogging through the latest Jamie/Claire saga.

It should have been a clue that this book read as an audio book was the only one in the series that was abridged. So I dumped the audiobook to read the real book, and what a snooze fest. I think I am going to take someones advice and just read the last few hundred pages. She could have easily condensed this book to be about 200 pages, instead of the 1400 that just described every little detail, down to Jemmy's dirty diapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, but a little slow","review":"I looked forward to this book for more than a year, and was somewhat pleased with the final product. The author seems to be a little bit bored with the \\"adventures\\" of Jamie and Claire, but I still cherish her wry sense of humor and character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantity over Quality","review":"I think Ms. Gabaldon has a gift for writing and storytelling. With that said, I can only assume that she has grown tired of these characters. Afterall, how many years has it been since the first novel was written? People change and their writing changes with time.To sum up my feelings - this book was way too long and boring. I enjoy the way Ms. Gabaldon writes; therefore, I kept reading, all the time hoping the story would improve - unfortunately, for all of us, it did not.I'm sorry - but I doubt if I would buy another book in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm halfway through, and it is SOOOO boring!","review":"I am the biggest fan of Gabaldon and was so excited to get this book. Oh boy, oh boy, is it a snoozer! The writing is good, and the detail is great. However, there is such a thing as WAY too much detail. I even skipped over and read the end, and it wasn't any better!You know how Gabaldon always says that she writes in bits and pieces and then somehow glues it all together? It really shows in this book. Long, descriptive passages with very little action makes for a very, very slow, almost nonexistent story. It's as though she goes from one extremely detailed sequence to another with really NOTHING happening in the story.Where is the action? The romance? The time travel? The visits from characters in previous novels? The tying-together of storylines across the novels? Alas, it is gone.It is as though it is nearly a thousand pages of descriptive, nauseatingly boring detail in preparation for future novels.

Her books are usually very good. I gave it a good try, I read at least 11 chapters. There were too many names, too many words in other languages, too much history, too much cultural references... Just too much. I love the Claire and Jamie story but there was very little of that and I gave up continuing reading it, waiting for those brief moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fiery Cross (Outlander) by Diana Gabaldon","review":"I am very disappointed with this book, 5th in the Outlander series.

Diana's way of writing in details that you just don't see any other author do is amazing!! You really feel like you know what it was like in the 1770's. Don't let anybody with a bad review of this book keep you from reading it! It has plenty going on and no, it doesn't talk about diaper changes constantly. I think it mentions it like maybe four times in the entire 1436 pages. My only criticism, if I were to have one at all, is that she seem to really overuse the word alacrity. Who cares!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I second -wait for the paperback","review":"All good things must end. This book was slow. Characters lacked the humor, warmth & adventure of the first 4 books. Historical background was scarce, intrigue was almost nil. Development of entire plot lacked and the hook for the next one at the end was really lacking. Why did Ian return? Perhaps Ian and his Indian life should be a new focus for the author. I couldn't put the first 4 in the series down. This was hard to pick back up once put down.All they did was slog up and down Fraser's Ridge, speak endearments in Gaelic, change baby diapers and slog up and down the Ridge again. No mystery, no adventure, really no romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will This Ever Get Exciting ???","review":"How could Gabaldon have done this to all of us, her loyal readers? Yes, to be added to Ripley's Believe It Or Not, she has bored me to tears - tears of frustration and disappointment.What would ever make her think that after four marvelous novels we would want to hear again and again and again about her grandson's diapers or her daughter's leaking breasts? For the first time I felt a real lack of concern for what happens to them all. As is often the case, I wanted to jump into the novel to talk to the characters, but this time I wanted to bellow, \\"DO SOMETHING!\\" I will continue to recommend Gabaldon's novels to everyone I know, and I look forward to the next novel. However, I pray that the entire novel to come will be as interesting and exciting as merely a few parts of this novel ever was."},{"rating":"1","title":"beyond dissappointed","review":"This is the first review I have ever done. I was so frustrated and dissappointed with this book, I had to struggle to finish it...just in case there was SOME redeeming bit I might miss. There wasn't. What happened to the basic premise of the series, that of Jamie and Clare?? If D.G. was just using this book as a filler so that she can continue the series and prolong the story, well then she did it. The book drags on and on with MORE than enough informatin about Clare's medical skills and the day to day living of the colonists. This isn't a bad thing, but, almost a 1000 pages of it? It could have been edited into a 300 page book and told the same exact story, with less words. This took 4 years to write? I am still hopeing that her next book in the series will go back to her original style and substance. I also hope it won't take another 4 years. I'd like to see how Jamie and Clare end their story, but not if it takes any more of this BORING filler stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Hate to say it.

I forced myself to finish it, because I kept expecting something to happen. Nothing did. The plot could be summarized in about three paragraphs, and frankly, the only thing that kept me interested is my personal fantasies about Jamie. I expected much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, not much happens.","review":"What a disappointment! Most of this book was written about tedious daily life. The flashes of interesting action are few and far between. It was all I could do to finish the book. And worse, despite the length of this book, not much is resolved or even tied in well! More happened in one chapter in the Outlander than in this entire book. After so many pages, I feel I have learned little more than I knew from the last book, and have only more questions or loose ends. It is annoying. Also, the method of writing it from not only Claire and Brianna's point of view, but also from Roger's, was choppy and not interesting to me. Save your time and money, and have someone sum it up, or mark the few interesting passages for you to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Since I mostly read for enjoyment, I don't like to criticize a book. Whatever it's faults, I usually just go along with it for the fun. But this book--well, I'm not quite half way through it and don't know how much further I can make myself go with this trivia. I'm writing this review when I would normally be reading; I didn't want to read the book, so I came back here to complain. What, should I carry on? Can somebody assure me that the trivia will be justified in the pages to come? Will I think it was all worth the trouble?Elinore"},{"rating":"1","title":"She should have stopped after three","review":"Three is the lucky number, she should have kept to three books. The first two were fantastically written and have been read several times over. The third was good. But the fourth and fifth? Forget it. Don't even bother unless it's to check the book out of the library. It's not even worth a late charge fee at the library. The author had a good thing going and has gone the way of the Rocky IV and Terminator 4 movies. She should have stopped after the first three. If you are looking to interact with wonderful, sexy Jamie again, don't pick up the newest book, go back and read Outlander.Ms. Gabaldon, respectfully, please start a new book with new characters and let us readers imagine the rest of Jamie and Claire's life together ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anxiously Awaited","review":"I have been waiting for The Fiery Cross's release for over a year. I even re-read the previous books so I could be fresh for this newest edition. I was very disappointed. Ms. Gabaldon rambles as she has never rambled before. Her characters did not mature at all and there are too many loose ends. The action is tedious and while I generally enjoy the amount of detail employed in these books, enough is enough! It has taken me several weeks to finish Fiery Cross - when it only took a couple of days for each of the other ones.I agree with some of the other reviewers that the editors need to be less condescending to Ms. Gabaldon and rein her writing in a bit.Hopefully, we'll be back on track with the next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"great innovative game.","review":"this game is a breath of fresh air to the FPS genre. Its actually more fun to punch someone than to shoot them!! and the story and effects are above average too.My only gripe is that the game starts out a little slow and some sections of the game seem unecessarilly tedious. no game is perfect though, even games like halo and grand theft auto have a few imperfections.If you want to try something different this is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money, good game...but","review":"closer to 4 1/2 stars. this is a unique game in the view point and is also close to being a survival horror game. This is also the first game i ever seen use Hallucination sequences that you actually control (like walking in a dream) what has kept me from giving this game a 5 so far (and im still playing it)is the fact that ive play a good chunk of this game and it has mainly been all indoors. It would be nice to get some scenery here and there. Walking the endless buildings and halls can get old after awhile. Other than this, this game is awsome, and at the price you can not go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once Again 1st Person Character Games Are Annoying.","review":"I like the story, nice action packed fast paced the character is actually attractive.

But is in Excellent condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite a classic, but worth your time","review":"Breakdown's graphics have managed to stand the test of time, although the gameplay is a bit dated. The story is pretty straightforward, but the few plot twists made the game quite interesting. It is a bit on the difficult side and requires some skill to beat the harder parts. The real selling point is the cheap price, at 4.99 + shipping it's a steal.This game is playable on both Xbox and Xbox 360."},{"rating":"1","title":"I died","review":"It was too hard on easy mode. It's a first-person shooter with the combat engine geared towards martial arts... but in such a way that guns are still the most lethal, and most logical, option.The concept is interesting, but the playability is close to nil, and winds up having an \\"overdone\\" feeling. Objects are hard to use... you have to stand *just right*, and you have to press once to pick up, once again to accept, and once more to use any object. I'm sure there's a compelling conspiracy story in there somewhere... there almost always is with the Archetypal Amnesiac Adventure Hero made popular in the early 90's by \\"Total Recall,\\" but the white-on-white text makes it very difficult to read what it is.I really wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, but enough people seem to like it that it may be worth a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"How counterintuitive can you get?","review":"The first moment i realized i wasn't going to like this game was the first time i tried to pick up an extra clip of ammo. While i am being shot at, my character calmly picks up the clip and proceeds to stare at it and examine it in his hand, WHILE I AM BEING SHOT AT. Its the general counterintuitive nature of things like that in this game that really bothered me, moreso than anything else. Why would they institute an overly complicated mess of auto targeting with weaponry instead of having your normal point and fire crosshairs? Why why why?!? Yes this game has a few 'immersive' moments, and yes it COULD have been something great, but quite frankly i couldnt get beyond the rank stupidity of the way shooting is done, and the frustration caused when you die because your character seems to be oh so much more interested in looking at an extra clip of ammo than the fact that he is getting shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gonna hate it","review":"Dis game is uuuuuuurting. fin you go play and its over like dat.

Things to like: The T'lan enemies are downright intimidating early in the game (less so later on as your powers expand). It's big (it took me 20 hours just to get through it -- not counting all the replays) and not over when you think it is. And it's a solid story; I always understood what was going on -- in no small part because clipboards and voiceovers fill in details throughout. My one complaint is that the game's too linear -- just one path -- and, apart from the boss battles at the very end, pretty easy for a game with a checkpoint system.(If you fail in a sequence, it reloads with a healthier character.) But, that said, I bought into Breakdown's world and premise quickly an they stuck with me until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereo! (for half)","review":"So the big deal is that this archival footage from 1980. The \\"Ad Lib\\" jazz show. They say on the package that this was the \\"first musical television show recorded in Stereo\\". Well, that is half true. This DVD is comprised of two shows from the Ad Lib series - Show #40 and Show #41. Only #40 is in stereo. #41 is a (bad) mono mix. So while the band is swingin', and the tunes are good, and Freddie is Freddie, the sound just ain't that good on the stereo version and plain stinks on the mono one. So, unless you are die hard gotta have it Freddie fan, I'd say pass on this disc. A very cursory \\"interview\\" is also included where Freddie introduces his band. Bonus features are a terribly produced \\"bio\\" of Freddie which is comprised of VERY slow liner notes rising up the screen a la credits, and advertisements for other discs in the series.

And I'm not saying this game is better than the titles I mentioned above but anyone who gave this game anything lower than 3 stars must not like 3D platform games period. My jaw dropped to the floor when I saw all the 1 star reviews, I thought it was some kinda evil conspiracy. I felt I had to tell the truth. \\"I NINJA\\" is a worthy game for a worthy gamer(s).

Dont let the game name fool you, yes you are a ninja, and yes you swing a sword, but the real game is your ability to run through large platforms and obsticles. If you've played Goemon's great adventure, you might remember getting to pilot the giant robot and fight with him... well its back! That to me made it worth the price.

We never bother comtemplating who Darwin was or where he was coing from.This book explores the life, lifestyle and personality of Charles Darwin and looks at the forces that shaped him and his writings. His love for his children, his grief over the loss of his beloved daughter from a painful chronic disease, his struggle with the idea of faith in God, his doubts about the meaning of life, all come together to introduce us to Darwin like no other books before has done.Anyone at all interested in Charles Darwin, his writings or evolution must read this book. The reader will stop thinking of him as a caricature and start seeing him as a human man.Superbly done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story","review":"I bought this book after seeing the movie \\"Creation.\\" It is a beautiful and intimate portrait of one of the most brilliant minds and gentle souls in modern history. The book tells the story of Darwin as a father and husband against the complex background of his reluctance to publish his \\"dangerous idea\\" that would transform the way we understand the world. It also carefully unfolds the often-oversimplified accusations about Darwin's understanding of god's role in the universe. It is a touching story of a brilliant man and loving father who also happened to discover one of the most transformative ideas ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charles Darwin: Family Man","review":"Currently, there is a lot of talk about as well as charges being hurled at the theory of evolution. There are people who are evolutionists pure and simple. There are the doubters who go along with the theory because nobody has a better explanation. And, there is the intelligent design crowd. \\"Darwin, His Daughter, and Human Evolution\\" written by a descendant of Charles Darwin does a great service to the humanization of the misunderstood gentleman scientist. It also brings to light the social climate of Victorian England. But most of all it shows Darwin as a family man with the fears and self-doubt that all parents experience especially when confronted with illness of a child.

I'll be sure to use it again with my next."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"This toy looks fabulous ! Well, that's why we bought it. However, we found the suction cup base to be too large for many stroller trays, our exercaucer, and the jolly jumper doorway seat. The rubber made on the suction cup is also so stiff that a good vacuum seal does not last and hold the item in place. Another ENORMOUS problem is that the toy itself DETACHES from the suction cup base. This totally defeats the stationary toy idea. My 5 month old had it ripped from the base and tossed across the room 2 minutes into playing with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little ones love this toy! (but I have 2 minor problems)","review":"I bought this toy for my second daughter almost 2 years ago. I loved the colors and all the different rattles, but mostly I bought it to attach to my Exersaucer. Unfortunately, I have one of the VERY early models and the suction cup does not fit, and I've found that it doesn't stick very well to other surfaces either. (Perhaps they have fixed this since other reviews are saying how well it sticks.) Anyway, my daughter loved playing with it so much that I decided to keep it.Today, I just brought it out to show my twins - they were enthralled! The only minor problem is that the cylinder with the little ball has gotten rusty from me washing it (since it is TOOOO attractive for little mouths). I'm going to try putting it in the dishwasher, but I'm not sure that it will come clean.All in all, I would definitely purchase it again as it gave my second daughter and now my new ones so much joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHAKE ~ RATTLE & HOLD","review":"That is right~ SHAKE, RATTLE & HOLD.. BUY THIS ONE ~ it is worth it weight in GOLD! It can be used by your child during ALL stages of their development. It is like a rattle with noise and movements but it can be used in MANY MANY WAYS. You can shake it like normal rattles or put it in the suction cup so it can be attached to a high chair, table top, stroller tray etc. It comes in the Popular Black & White Colors but also has added bright colors and dots to keep your childs interest. It also is STRONG and can be thrown, beat against things and still comes back for more. I have also found it can be washed in the dishwasher (top shelf) so GERMS will go BYE BYE..Perfect for Teething, Long Road Trips, or Just Because. It I could only of had one toy for my son this was it. He is now 13 months and he still LOVES it you can't say that about most toys. So get the most for the $$$ Try this Toy today!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"neato!","review":"i bought this beautie at k mart for 5 bucks. other that the suction cup not really working out well, my 3 month old loves it. hell, my husband and i also enjoy playing with it. it has a variey of colours and shapes that help stimulate the mind. you cant lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Versatile Toy","review":"Our son is 14 months and has been playing with this toy since he was 9 months. It does suction well to our table and to his high chair tray - I just barely moisten the suction cup, too much water and it won't work. Ours was hard for my son to pull off but as he got older, he was able to remove the toy from the base. I don't think this is a failure of the toy - I think it just has a different purpose now that my son can play with it more physically. It was great for the first 4 months when we went out eat. It kept him occupied. Now, I just add some links to the toy and link it to his highchair. Still fun but it doesn't hit the floor. I know everyone wants to use this just as a suction based toy but we found our son loved to crawl after the rattle when we placed it on the floor. Overall, your child will enjoy a versatile toy that can be used in many ways. We really enjoy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Deal!","review":"The perfumes are ok but the quantity is very small. The product information does not contain the quantity details.

The graphics i thought were very well done. The cars look real, as well as the road. My problem was that it took me a total of 2 days to beat this games yes 2 days. It was so easy its not even funny. I thought it was niice that they made a drag racing mode on it but i hate having to hold the brake all the time because if u let it go to quickly you have to start over. I wish that they would have made the game so you may decal the car the way you want it like need for speed but o well. Its a decent game i think for 20$ or less but there are many better games out there. Like Need For Speed underground the best move to do is buy that or be patient and buy need for speed underground 2.

Maybe copied Calvin's notes. This, or maybe Calvin had the other books ghosted by a competent writer. I'm not sure which it is.Calvin's thesis isnt hard to grasp, but he seems to deliberately write jumbled prose with long words to explain simple concepts.

Unfortunately, Erik is into this metal thing lately. This change from a classic, lush symphonic sound to a heavy prog-metal sound doesn't really suit him, in my opinion. He's still a brilliant keyboardist, but all of the loud, crunching guitars and heavy metal vocals (from various guest vocalists)overpower much of his keyboard work on this album. There are some nice moments (mainly the non-vocal tracks), but not enough to raise this to the level of Threshold or his work with Rocket Scientists. In fairness, this album will probably appeal greatly to heavy metal fans. As for traditional symphonic prog lovers...you've been warned: this is not what you'd probably expect from such a talented prog keyboardist as Erik Norlander."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bowling Bag","review":"This bag gets done everything I need it too.

She is accidentally indentified as the man's fiance by a nurse and his family take her in; only for her to fall for his brother The only thing that saves this film from total schmaltz overload is the great casting. Sandra Bullock is perfect as the adorable and confused Lucy, caught up with the dysfunctional family and Bill Pullman is great as the brother who is clearly right for her. The rest of the cast do a great job. If you don't like romantic comedies stay clear as this is as sacharrine as they come.

To my considerable disappointment, this is simply the 6.5 book with search and replace of 6 with 7 and 2K with 8K. The author does not discuss the new optimizer or disk storage structures, but does include material on database devices (not a part of 7.0 storage architecture) and mirroring (not available in 7.0). The discussion of query plans is about 6.x.

One good example is the books description of the physical storage of the TEXT data type as using a linked list of 2K pages. SQL Server 7.0 has many advanced features for storing this data type and uses a B-tree instead of a linked list.

It started off boring, and just got worse. There was nothing scary about it, and the \\"girl scared of cars trapped in a car\\" was annoying as hell. As the other reviewer said, basically all she did was cry and not do much to help herself get out. I wondered why it took her until the end of the movie to realize, she could escape through the back window, if she only broke it. Which I don't even think she broke. If I remember correctly (because I was half out of it during the movie due to boredom) the \\"angel\\" of the dead chick driving the car magically took the glass out so she could get out of the car.

Having already seen 3 other After Dark Films, Dark Ride, The Hamiltons, and Gravedancers, with Dark Ride being my favorite, Penny Dreaful looked very promising from the trailer that was included in these other films. I was wrong. The movie started out good, very creepy with the hitchhiker and being trapped in the woods. Once she becomes trapped in the car, you may as well stop the film. The car is somehow wedged between two trees for the rest of the movie, which leaves the large question as to how it fit in the first place and also, why won't the windows shatter once she strikes them with an umbrella. I can't figure out for the rest of the movie if she is losing it because of her meds, or what is really going on. Bottom line, this movie was ridiculous and wasted an hour and 30 minutes of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well,the title fits...","review":"I've seen 6 of the 8 films to die for, and this was the worst I've seen. It had a chance to be such a good movie, but from the moment the therapist leaves the car, the movie goes downhill fast. Yes, I understood Penny's phobia, but she just carried on and on iin the car for what seemed like forever. Then the random characters they threw in, just to die quickly. And how weird was the killer? I still don't know if it was a man or woman, but I don't really care.

It started out kind of slow and continues to progress slowly. Some things that happened were not explained, but lets face it, most people in Penny's situation would have been totally freaked out by the circumstances. I know I would have been. I'd have been crying like a little girl. The movie took its time building the suspense so if you don't have the patience to stick it out, don't watch it. There is not a lot of action in this movie. Some blood. Some thrills. The ending was kind of weak but, all in all, not a bad movie. Rachel Miner did a good job. Also, you have to love Mickey Jones. Still the same guy after what? 30 or 40 years in the business? I've seen 7 of the 8 movies to die for now.

When it comes to Penny Dreadful, the title says it all. It's a boring film that was much too long, a ridiculous story, with horrible acting, and laughable text. A girl whose parents were killed in a car accident when she was a kid is now afraid of being in cars. To get over this fear she is going on a road trip, with her psychologist, where a creepy man they hit with the car comes after them.

Nothing about this movie was original except the title credits.I was only able to get through it by using subtitles and watching the DVD at 2x speed. It might have worked as a 30 minute act in a trilogy, but 90 minutes of by-the-numbers slasher fare are intolerable in this day and age.

If you like the sound of a movie where a girl who is scared of cars gets stuck inside one for a whole movie while a Jason Voorhees wanna be killer is outside playing mind games with her and killing off everyone but the girl in the car, then this movie is for you.For the 99.9% of people who don't find that scary, this movie is slow, boring, drags on and on, and goes no where. It's stupid, far from scary, and a bore to watch an entire movie set inside of the front seats of a car wedged between 2 trees with nothing but annoying screaming and crying and a bogey man who needs to find a book like 'how to be a scary villain' ... man, Michael Jackson is scarier to think about then this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting ripped off, getting took...","review":"The copy of \\"Jam with AC/DC\\" that I received from Amazon was missing the last two songs. \\"Sin City\\" and \\"Highway to Hell\\" aren't in my copy of the book.

It was frustrating that when I finally received the product, it wasn't as advertised. By this time, I wasn't interested in dealing with it anymore, and I just wrote it off. I did notify the publisher, but got no response from them at all. I later ordered \\"Play Guitar with AC/DC\\" and was much more satisfied with that purchase.I will say that the CD that accompanies \\"Jam with AC/DC\\" is first rate, and that makes it all the more upsetting that I was ripped off with the missing pages of music.

The Corvettes have a nice sound, the cars do not drive realisticly, they handle and feel heavy, the graphics are a little behind compared to there competitors. In comparison to Gran tursimo aspec, the corvette does not look photo realistic. The replays are very nauseating to watch and there is a limited number of tracks per car. I recommend renting the game. The game is not very good, its just good. Thats why the price was reduced.

Even the opening movie is BORING. Two vettes endlessly racing down the highway for what seems an eternity.Take my advice and stay clear of this game. There are better racing titles out there like \\"BURNOUT\\", \\"NEED FOR SPEED UNDERGROUND\\", \\"MIDNIGHT CLUB 2\\", \\"GRAN TURISMO 3\\" and even \\"FORD RACING 2\\".

We have other Tuffy's products that have held up for years but none of them get the attention from our dogs that this toy does. It is by far their favorite toy and the ONLY toy they actually share.

She's bitter, she's funny, she's not perfect and willing to share just how much NOT perfect she is with the rest of us losers so we don't feel quite so bad. I really like her writing.

It was just me trying hard not to pee my pants as I was reading.Some of the essays in the book were a little over done for me. Almost like she was trying too hard to be funny. But there were several that just hit a nerve - that I could relate to - that had me laughing so hard I was crying & couldn't see the page.

And I'd recommend it - in fact, my sister in law has it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, hilarious book","review":"Laurie's books are great to read on the train to and from work--they're hilarious and make the time go by fast. I can relate all too well with the escapades in We Thought....and although the first pieces weren't my favorites, the rest of the book had me rolling. I love the way that Laurie relates not only to her family but to the rest of her world--it often time mirrors my own life with the exception that she says what everybody else feels but never vocalizes. I loved when her mother got a bug in her ear, the guy with the weird hair she stalks at the pet food store and her painting class when she has to paint a naked lady with, well, bosoms that aren't so perky.

The format is the same, a series of short essays, but there was not as much humor in this book. Some of the essays were quite funny and I enjoyed them and some were quite poignant, which I also enjoyed. Unfortunately, many of the essays consist of the author complaining that she is extremely overweight, questioning how that happened, and then whining about how her extreme rudeness gets her in trouble. One chapter on each of these topics could have been entertaining, but the author revisits them too many times and I honestly didn't even want to finish reading this book. It became tiresome and although I'm glad I finished because the last couple of chapters were good, I could have done without a great deal of the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her self-deprecating humor delivers the laughs","review":"Another reviewer once said there should be a 4.5 and she's right! If I'd never read a Laurie Notaro book, this would be a definite 5. But I've read five others and so it came in just under the high-flying scale. She has me totally convinced that she's the dorkiest girl alive until I realize that she's admitted that - so it's a Catch-22. You can't be truly dorky if you know you are...I can so relate to the crazy things that happen to Laurie as she lives out her life in a seemingly haphazard fashion. Much of the stuff she does I do myself. What no one does as well as Laurie Notaro is describe the events so that you are waiting for one outcome and are totally surprised by another. She's got gumption, that gal - and she regularly makes me laugh out loud in this book, like all the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry, Bitter and Not at All Funny","review":"I like a good snark now and then. I'm a firm believer in \\"if you can't say something nice, stand next to me,\\" but Notaro's latest somehow forgets that snarking is supposed to be fun.In this collection she bags on people in 3rd world countries, skinny girls, and most of all, \\"idiots.\\" The last she does without the apparent irony of raking others over the coals while admitting she barely has enough brain power to pilot her SUV. She picks tired targets, such as Camero drivers, to belittle. What's next, mullet jokes?I rarely refuse to finish a book, but I couldn't force myself to read past the halfway point.

I laughed with each page (and sometimes each paragraph). There are pieces that I still laugh when I think about them. The other wonderful thing about this book is that I can relate. Ms. Notaro is talking about things that happen to all of us and shows us the humor in everyday life.

I love how she taps into the 30 something crowd. I could relate to many of thestories in this book. I great, fun read. I can't wait to read more of her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Notaro rocks","review":"In this latest collection of short stories, Laurie Notaro works her comedic yet magic again. From start to finish, I was cracking up with each new page. Laurie Notaro rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A LOL View of the World","review":"Laurie Notaro's newest autobiographical offering is as funny as her others. Laugh outloud moments...caught in a bathroom by a fan, flippy hair guy and a poignant, yet still funny, memory of her grandmother's move... A summer must-read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"and the point is...?","review":"This is my first Laurie Notaro book, and I find her brand of humor to be overly forced and petty. I have to agree with some of the other reviews that she seems to try too hard and confuses \\"snarkiness\\" with scintilating observations. There are authors who can take a non-event, a total mundanity and turn it into an illuminating sketch of universal human nature. (david sedaris comes to mind). Notaro takes pieces of angry have-not snippets and beats it and chews it up like a bulldog, but it still remains that: a gnawed-up rant of a have-not who's angry because she doesn't have thin calves, or fit into a size 8, and just plain thinks everyone's an idiot.Her observations carry the whiff of insecurity and the sad solace of finding fault and misery in others."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Laurie Notaro, please!","review":"In the past few months, I've become a huge fan of Laurie Notaro's work. Sure, the writng could be better, but the stories she tells about her life are so funny that its hard to believe that they're all true! In We Thought You Would Be Prettier, we re-meet the nutty members of Laurie's family: her Nana, her mother, her nephew, and her husband, who patiently puts up with her crazyness. Here, Notaro begins by going on her book tour and being called \\"stupid\\" in New York City, and ends up moving from Arizona to Oregon. For the past four books Laurie's been complaining about the heat; what will she have to complain about in her new hometown/ next book?I love how Laurie Notaro is willing to put her life out there for the world to see. Some of the ways she phrases things are hillarious, and at other times I found myself nodding, thinking, \\"wow, she is so right about that!\\" In all, this book was right on par with all her others. Of course, I'm going right out and buying her next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dates itself quickly","review":"I'm not generally a reader of the \\"modern sassy-girl telling various stories in an episodic format\\" genre. I bought this book about 4 years ago, and then lost it to the black hole that is my parents' storage when they moved while I was away at college.I just found it and decided to restart it.First of all, it seems a main problem with this genre seems to be how quickly the references and jokes become dated. That certainly is true with this book. There are several times where the jokes or references can instantly peg this book as having been written in 2003-2005, and no longer really are that funny.Second of all, though there were many genuinely funny parts, there were several times when it really felt like she was trying way way too hard to be funny, and those times it fell flat.This is not a genre I'll be seeking out at my local book store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it with a girlfriend","review":"This book is an absolute scream. My roommates got so sick of me laughing out loud every time I was reading this that we just had to read it together. As a bunch of 20-somethings, we could totally relate to Notaro's stories and even told a few of our own. We all want to \\"grow-up\\" to be just like Laurie.As a follow-up to her first bookAutobiography of a Fat Bride: True Tales of a Pretend Adulthoodthis book stands alone and stands even funnier. From half-cocked adventures with her husband to a totally out-of-whack mother, any woman can relate. Notaro is far from perfect and not afraid to show it. She uses humor to make herself approachable and her stories enjoyable. It can help any woman see the lighter side of all the mishaps in life.Although some of the jokes run throughout the book, you can easily pick a story at random to read before bed--it will put you in the right mood to have good dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest woman alive","review":"I'm appalled at the reviewers who have the audacity to say Laurie's work isn't hilarious. One clearly has no sense of humor if she fails to make you laugh. Sure Laurie pokes mean spirited fun at Camaros, morons in line at Fedex and kids with stupid hairdos but she also thoroughly makes fun of herself which you've got to respect. And you're kidding yourself if you can't relate to some of her tales - we all lose patience with strangers and do idiotic things.My respect for Laurie doubled when I met her a B&N; book signing. She is a great person - as funny and sarcastic as you'd expect from her writing but also genuinely nice - the kind of person who makes a really fun friend. She clearly cares about her readers and delights in meeting the people she has touched with her stories. She also shared the chocolate Twizzlers someone brought her with everyone at the book signing. You gotta love generosity when it comes to candy! ;o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't even finish it!","review":"I thought I was going to LOVE this book as it appeared to be hysterical and had me oddly intrigued when i read the description and the back of the book. However, I could BARELY get through this book and literally had to force myself to continue reading it sometimes, hoping it got better in the next chapter. It didn't. I admit there are some stories that had me chuckling, but most of it was just boring and stupid. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it just seemed she was trying to hard to be \\"clever\\" and funny. It just didn't happen for me. I finally gave up and tossed the book before I even finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"we thought you would be prettier","review":"this book is just hilarious and the chapters are short so you can read a little, laugh alot, and come back to it again when you need more laughs. something every girl can relate to in this great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"growing up and becoming more normal","review":"\\"We Thought You Would be Prettier\\" by Laurie Notaro, 2005Laurie is growing up and becoming more normal. She is still worried of her size and her social calamities. The spin is still funny, but she has friends who have babies, who move far away, etc. In fact one of the best stories is of an old bar she and her friends frequented. It was closing, mostly due to urban renewal, so there was one last blow out party. All the old friends get there for one last time. Laurie remembers all the good times and some bad times, embarrassing times and the after hours parties, all of it. The times change and she has not been there for years, nor have her friends, but the memories are still there and for one last time they will have some fun, then they will go home and continue their lives. She does not even go to the after hours party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another success for Laurie Notaro.","review":"There's not a self-respecting (okay, self-loathing) writer out there who can't admire Notaro's story. Rejected by dozens of publishers, she finally publishes her book on her own and then almost immediately gets an offer.Amazingly enough, for writing about her own neurotic experiences.When a new Idiot Girls' book comes out, I save it for a day when I need a big laugh and a smile. Prettier proves to be as good as Notaro's previous works.Read it all in one sitting, flip through it over several weeks, whatever. Either way you'll come away happy.I recommend \\"Campaign of Terror\\" and \\"Drive to Survive\\" as required reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Price","review":"This honey is very mild and smooth. But the price is so out of whack with the quality of this honey. This honey is known to everyone in Hawaii as Keawa honey. It is not rare! Keawe is just mesquite from the mesquite trees which flourish in the southwestern United States and Mexico. The jar is so much smaller than I expected from its magnified picture. The price is outrageous and what irritated me more than anything was that no where could I find the amount of honey being offered at this price in ounces, or grams, etc. It was like a hit or miss and I guess it's a miss for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what they eat in Paradise?","review":"What can be said about this honey? That it is unique, but so is, say, Thyme honey. That it is rare, but so are many other things in life. That it is expensive, that goes without saying. Wink, wink, check out some promotion with your local Co-Op or organic food store and chances are you may find it for under $10.As for its nutritive or medical value there is not much one can tell/learn about this honey. However, on a sensory level (taste, and smell), this honey is truly outstanding. It has a way of melting in your mouth that fills you through your senses with joy. Still on a sensory level, I even detect some taste as of beewax--pleasant, in an intriguing way.To make a long (love) story short, if I were to employ a taste/cost type of metric to characterize this opportunity in taste then Hawaiian White Honey would have topped many a food chart; Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware. It Is Too Good","review":"Once you try the Hawaiian White Honey you can never return to grocery store honey. It would be like kissing your sister - the same concept but without the thrill.

The story and humor of this book are severely lacking. It's just not funny. It's an artifact of the 80's, but not a cool one like Ferris Bueller's Day Off or a centerfold from a dusty 1983 Playboy at a garage sale. It's the part of the 80's where maybe everyone was all coked out and you didn't really need to be that funny for people to think you were great. I'm planning on giving this away to a child, and then I will secretly be pretty disappointed in them if they like it very much. On the other hand, every other Macaulay book they read will be much better, so I'm making a positive difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Man's Hollywood Babylon","review":"Of course this book is entertaining; it is filled with gossip about some of the most loved classic movie stars.However, it is completely trashy, false, and disgraceful. A lot of the information in this book like dates and ages are wrong. What makes the reader think that the more controversial information would be true then? Well, it isn't. Most of the information in this book was taken from Hollywood Babylon, a notoriously false book about the sex lives and scandals of famous movie stars. This book is only a cheap version of that book. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Mistake!","review":"Well the only thing I can say about this book is that some of it was shocking and a revalation,especially about Grace Kelly and what a slag she was. But all in all it goes to show what people will do to make it in the movies.I'm pretty sure that it's still the same for both men and women today they have to give head and more to get ahead.But what really shocked me about the book was that NIgel got the date and year of Marilyn's death so wrong if he got that wrong what else did he get wrong in this book. For the record she died on the 4 August 1962 aged 36 and not in 1965 aged 39 jeez what a massive mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh*","review":"I literally threw the book down after reading the first couple pages.First off, after glancing at the pictures, the one labeled Jean Harlow...I am 90% sure that it is not her.

Albee's style of writing is very negative and immoral. He uses many motifs throughout the play, irony, and no symbols to reveal his message. His motifs support the central message of the characters' obsessions with surface appearances. Verbal irony is also significant, because it foreshadows many events in the play. Albee's theme of this work is how the characters in the play are obsessed with the exterior, or physical features, of an object or person and do not pay any attention to the interior. I personally did not enjoy the play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered 2 - both had same flaw","review":"I ordered two of these.

I'm pretty sure HP doesn't charge $43.10 for a *remanufactured* product. I assumed OCProducts had an overstock of geniune HP cartridges which they were liquidating as a gonga deal. Silly moi.The good news is that I've used remanufactured cartridges many times before, without difficulties or complaints. I don't anticipate a problem here either.

And he could write, also.\\"Men of Mathematics\\" is a great book and probably a perennial one. I read it first almost 50 years ago, in a Spanish translation. I was immediately fascinated. It obviously influenced me, as, later, on the brink of entering the university, I decided to change from medicine to mathematical physics. The chapters had charming titles: the one that talked about Cayley and Sylvester was called Invariant Twins (Gemelos Invariantes); the one on Galois, \\"Genius and Tragedy\\". Now I have the last edition, and the titles are all there. At the time of my first reading the men which impressed me more were Gauss (unforgetable chapter), Riemann (very moving), Galois and, of course, Newton. Recently I read some comments on his chapter on Riemann, considered overly romanticized. Who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable and entertaining.","review":"More of a casual book for those who love math, than a text on math history.

They did not have it.....they have a whole bunch of \\"Dummie Books\\", but very few real books.

T. Bell embellished his book, I must say that I found the pervasive anti-Christian sarcasm to be very offensive and tiresome. E. T. Bell seems to reserve a special disliking for Blaise Pascal and Augustin-Louis Cauchy... Pascal is made out to be a mentally ill religious lunatic and Cauchy to be an eccentric and bigoted religious fanatic. Bell sacrifices truth on the altar of propaganda especially in the section on Evariste Galois - here he takes particular pains to portay the great mathematician Cauchy to be a fool and a religious bigot while Galois (a very unstable, self-destructive character if there ever was one) is made out to be the martyred hero!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic on history of math and mathematical physics","review":"I bought this book because it is said that it served as inspiration for a young John Nash to start his career as a mathematician. And I was not disappointed.As a sign of the times it was written in the style is stodgy, but content, prose, and organization are excellent. It tells stories of some 4 dozen or so influential men (and a few women) of mathematics.. It is both an inspiration and a reference of interesting problems (many old ones and some current). Highly recommended for the mathematically inclined.

I took this monitor to the doctor's office as well, and it was 30 units higher than the nurse's and doctor's measurements. My doctor recommended I not use it.

Thinking that it may only be a matter of calibrating it, I checked the manual and Ormond's webpage for this possibility but there was no information whatsoever. The only explanation in the possible differences between the HEM-790IT reading and what the doctor's equipment may provide was based on the fact that this equipment uses blood flow vibration, while the physician would have to listen and note for the systolic and diastolic blood flow characteristics AND that this unit \\"would compensate\\" for this variation.

It required two people. One to hold the cuff in place and the other to wrap it around the arm tight. No one could do it alone. I returned it to Costo and purchased a different model Omron and it's cuff works perfectly. We think the problem is that the stiff part of the cover on the first one was spread too wide so it wouldn't wrap right.

This is true even though I am certain of operating it correctly and taking over 100 readings with it in a 2 week period. Yes, the cuff was correct size. The diastolic reading was correct, though. The reason I bought a monitor is because I know from professional readings that my systolic is too high. But this thing says my BP is very normal. Trusting this thing could kill you. The primary function of a BP monitor is to accurately monitor both systolic and diastolic. So this is fails at functioning and is therefore worthless.

It is easier to put on the right arm for some unknown reason, but that arm still gets more errors than readings and most doctors prefer readings from the left.I don't know how much of the problem is with the unit, and how much of it has to do with the shape of overweight arms (wider at the top of the cuff and narrow at the bottom of the cuff, which makes it hard to get it situated *just right*).

It is very hard for one person to put the cuff on by themselves. Once you get your arm in the cuff and attempt to pull the remainder of the cuff around to completely close the cuff, the cuff will start moving if you keep pulling. I had always been told you needed to keep the tube coming out of the cuff, close to the bend in your arm and it's so hard to do that when you are pulling the remainder of the cuff around your arm.

Also, the cuff is not large enough for a person with large arms, so the reading is done from the forearm. Otherwise, it's nice to have this machine at home. It is trustworthy. Note that they say it has a 5 year waranty, but tht doesnt apply to the cuff, which they recommend be replaced each year...which is why we just bought a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"irratic readings","review":"The readings were very inconsistent, so I had to return the item.

Does not give the same reading in a row and everytime it's wrong. Had blood pressure done by my doctor and it was normal.

Eight times out of ten I get errors and have to reset the darn cuff and start over. I'm totally fed up. I would never buy another BP monitor with such a cuff. It just shouldn't be such a struggle all the time to take my blood pressure. I bought this model because I liked the idea of downloading the data to my computer. Even that isn't as handy as I thought. Hard to get a print out that's meaningful to my doctor. He'd rather I just wrote the numbers down for a couple of weeks and brought those in."},{"rating":"1","title":"This monitor will raise your blood pressure","review":"While the price and features are great on paper, in practice something doesn't work right. 50% of measurements are aborted by an error message, and never reach full cuff inflation.

The only thing I would criticize would be the limitations of the software in regards to printed graphs of blood pressure statistics. You should be able to make them larger. Omron needs to update this software and make it available to current users. Other than that, it is easy to use, (when you put the cuff on correctly), and provides easy to read information about your blood pressure. My favorite feature on this monitor is the \\"true read\\" mode where you obtain an average of three readings without having to restart the monitor between readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood Pressure Machine","review":"The machine arrived in excellent, new condition.

The entire book is black and white, with a spiral binding. Ugh. The photos didn't print out so great in some of the chapters, and it looks far cheaper than the $25+ it lists for.

At first, the idea of a remake bothered me. Then, I saw the trailer and thought it could be a good urban twist on the familiar story, and I decided to give it a chance. Good casting saves the lackluster script, which really brings nothing new to the story, journeying into familiar territory where we have gotten lost countless times before. Christina Millian, Nick Cannon, and Steve Harvey are all terrific, but the film is slow moving and often boring. A rushed ending does nothing to help it and tops the pizza with an unneeded extra slice of cheese. This could be fun for anyone who hasn't seen the original, but take my advice and rent that one instead. I only recommend this to die-hard Christina, Nick, or Steve fans. Others are better spending the evening with Patrick Demsey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I thought this movie was pretty bad. Firstly, because I do not have an appreciation for Nick Cannon's work. I think he is a very corny actor, rapper, whatever. I don't know any remakes that are as good as the original, but this one was bad. I only went to see it b/c I was outnumbered by my friends (I'm mad about my $6). Anyways, the 80s version is multiple times better.I'm so glad that the original is on Oxygen's favorite movie list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Stupid","review":"This movie looked good, since Nick Cannon was in it, from Drumline. However, after watching it, I felt I had wasted the time on it. It was too contrived, used too much slang, and just unbelievable. The chemistry between the actors was good, but that was it. I think the people in the movie, especially Steve Harvey, needed a paycheck. Otherwise, they would have stayed away from this drivel. I mean, the Hope Chest just perpetuated the stereotype of oversexed teens, and there was no evidence of proper parenting in the movie.I'm just glad it was borrowed from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"grand larceny","review":"a pox on the producers and director for \\"making\\" this film.it's a scene for scene rip-off of Can't Buy Me Love.

That is plain ignorant.The story was unbelievable, the acting was below par. I didn't see any redeeming values of this movie. All it does is once again portray young teenage blacks as vain, shallow, overly sexed hedonists. Even I can appreciate a movie where the dialect is \\"from the streets\\", but even the so-called hip-hop dialect used in this movie is grossly over-exaggerated.This was a horrible movie and not worth the time it takes to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Love may not cost a thing, but this movie does and its not worth it.

This game suxs and is a waiste of money................ DO NOT BY THIS GAME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing game!","review":"I loved this game. It was truely amazing. The gameplay was at its best, of any other game. The characters very very well done, alot of wrestlers really looked like them.The story line (revenge) took some skill to beat. Of course the first couple of levels were easy. But after a few levels it got really challenging. They were fun, to play each level and to watch me go through the scenario.By far the best part of this game was the create-a-superstar. I've probably spent more time making various characters, then actually playing. With so much unique attairs, hair styles, etc., it made it almost endless for creating anyone you wanted.This game is always fun and exciting to play, even after beating the revenge mode and buying out everything in the shop, down to the last ability points (out of 999), I still play this game, over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"WRESTLEMANIA 19","review":"YESTERDAY ME AND MY COUSIN BRIAN WENT TO THE MALL.

This has to be the the best wrestiling game ever. The wrestiling is way faster than in Raw 2. Its sort of like Smackdown 5. Only this game has a way better storymode than smackdown 5. Theres a revenge mode where you can unleash some range. You can get revenge beat up police officers. Heck thers a place where you can freeken throw then off a construction toewer. The story mode is just awesome. Sure its not like other storymodes but I give high scores for creatiivity. Unlike Raw 2 thers Blood. Yeah you can bust open youre opponents with weapons. Theres lots of wrestelers and ,atch types. The graphics are really Good too. So get the game. But of you dont get the game which is your mistake. Dont get Raw 2 withrer.

The reason why the game sucks so bad is because of the revenge mode. It's just like that crappy-lil gb game betrayal. It's got absolutely nothing to do w/ wrestling. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who isn't a WWE fan. If you're a fan of WWE, it might be worth a rental.

Rather than buying the book simply repeat that 10,000 times and you get the exact same experience. Sure the book points out that 20% of your customers produce 80% of your sales and probably your problems but the book comes up very short on practical ways of using the 20/80 principle.

By focusing on the 20% that produces 80% (give or take) of the rewards in our lives, we can reduce and eliminate much of the marginally productive busy work that occurs in so much of our lives. Koch has many good points to make about how to live simpler with more satisfaction. While the points he makes are excellent, he becomes repetitious.

In particular, his examples about how to analyze your current product units were insightful and non-trivial. He doesn't just recommend the obvious thing (cut 80% of your work), but integrates 80/20 with future value and market potential analyses.Similar to the other reviewers, I found the example set rather limited, his statistics and tables motivating but unconvincing, and his prose less than compelling.

Sometimes the novel is very alive and engrossing, mostly it is bleak and unrewarding.

It lacks many of the qualities of other Simalerly priced games (Socom 1, Splinter Cell... etc).Had I paid only $25-$30, I wouldn't be so upset. The Phrase 'you get what you pay for', has nothing to do with kill switch. True it has a few nice function features like fairly decent ability to use objects as cover, and the ability to pick up other guns and rounds. But thats where the quality seams to let off. Innovative features are only a good idea if all/most other things are at least comparible to what is allready availible. The game leaves me feeling like i've been had.$50+ games are suppoosed to be of a higher quality the games that you might find for $20-30 range.

Do yourself a favor, spend your money at Starbucks instead, believe it or not it is cheaper..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a durable machine","review":"While this machine does have some operational flaws and lacks flexibility, I have had it for about two years. However, a series of cascading failures, most likely due to the various leaks in the machine damaging the motherboard, have caused it to become non-functional. After only two years, I am going to have to spend a lot of money and get another system. This super automatic is not designed for durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This is my fourth (and worst) fully automatic Saeco machine. I was curious to see how others faired with the V-spresso and read the reviews. It appears that 50% have had problems and needed customer service. In my case the machine has been schizophrenic from the start and has needed to be serviced twice. As someone else wrote, the thing makes great coffee when it works, but its a crap shoot if you're getting a reliable machine. The worst part is the service from Saeco. They are very polite, but very inefficient. They don't get the fact that this is a luxury toy and their average customer is someone who expects service commensurate with the high price. I'm afraid that with a 50/50 shot at getting a good machine and a corporation with little regard for their clients, my next purchase will not be Saeco."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"lets just say the problems keep mounting. now the screen is half blank so i can't even read the error messages. not cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"HVAC in line booster fan.","review":"Almost Noiseless and is vibration free. HAD to install this on a rotatable bend in the ductwork that came off a rectanular feeder which attached immediately to an enclosed 6\\" round. The attachment panel trimmed easily and the motor bracket even had addtitional holes to center the fan for blade clearance. Even on the bend it pumps out prodigous amounts or air at the flush mount floor grill. I now have two of these in parallel on a variable speed control adding much needed boost to an A\\\\V equipment room. At full speed it can be distracting but I run both fans at 3/4s and hardly notice them in an otherwise silent room. With the A\\\\V gear in full operation, even run together the fans are unobtrusive and forgotten. You could wire them into your HVAC system I but then they would only run when the HVAC system comes on and would operate at full speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Game","review":"This is by far one of the best games I have EVER played. I have three different game consoles and a pretty extensive library in each, and this IS STILL one of my all- time favorites. Beautiful graphics, cool storyline, and being able to change between Sphinx (the lion demi-god) and the mummy is awesome. Each has totally different abilities, and gameplay feels so different with each one. Captivating and addictive - you can't say that about many games!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Egyptian fun","review":"If you like the Zeldatype games then you will love this game. There is so much to see and lots of puzzles to solve. There is plenty of fighting monsters that range from very easy to OH MY GOD that's tough! There are plenty of mazes to get lost in, lots of jumping and running. The graphics are, to say the least, awesome! The only drawbacks to the game are the lack of save points and the awful camera views. Sometimes it seems as if the camera is working against you and leaves you quite frustrated. There are many places where you must position the camera manually. That said I still recommend this game. It is very fun and absorbing. At first I didn't like the fact that the action switches from Sphinx to the Mummy and back again, but you get used to that and it is necessary to advance the game. If the camera views and save points were better I would give this game 5 stars. It is worth the money, especially at only $20!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game.....But........","review":"This is an overall great game! The game starts off pretty slowly, but once you get the hang of it, it will move along much faster. The graphics are great, the charaacters are great, but there stlill is a down-side. The characters do not talk, only little subtitled words come out at the bottom, saying what the characters are trying to say. The other bad part about this game, is that there are these statues where you are supost to save your game. And, lets say you are in a very important part, and only have one life left, and you didnt go to one of those statues, you have to go all the back to where you firts saved. But, overall, I give this game two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not like this book?","review":"I love Mr. Marcinko, what SEAL phanatic wouldn't?

Its an exciting read for anyone who wants the feel of the modern warrior spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A damaged individual.","review":"Richard Marcinko's extensive military knowledge is only surpassed by his unfillable ego.

I am sure Marcinko stretches the truth in the book a bit, that's why you write an AUTObiography. The things that go on at times seem larger than life, but it sure is a fun read. He's been in combat, been awarded medals, and served our country proud. I just want to thank him for his sacrifices and sharing his stories. I definately recomend this book for a pretty quick fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed view","review":"I now have complete and total respect for Mr. Marconi. True hero. Awesome read.

Yes, the language is crazy rough...but it's honestly rough...so what?! I'm glad this guy was/is on our side. Just about everything was interesting. I was constantly shaking my head and laughing at this man's exploits...both verbal and physical. I'm OK with reading about a \\"rogue\\" as well as a \\"saint\\" i.e. \\"Fearless\\" Adam Brown. Both men are two sides of the same coin. I respect them both and appreciate their warrior hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ragu Warrior?","review":"I started reading this book and it barely held my interest. I kept going hoping it would get better. Then I got to the part when Marcinko starts bragging about his Viet Nam days. He goes out on patrol at night, swims in the dark and kills 4 or 5 Viet Kong. Big [...] deal! A few dead bodies here, a few there... How in the [...] did that make one bit of difference in a war that was a mistake to begin with! This book is a \\"me...me...me\\" story; I guess if you can get by this Marcinko's ego it is not a \\"bad\\" read. But there are so many other great books out there, I'd recommend a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"After the recent success experienced by Navy Seals Six, I was eager to learn more about them. Unfortunately, I chose the wrong book! This was one of the worst books I have read in recent memory. First, he is by no means a decent author. Second, his foul and abusive language is unneccessary to the telling of the story, even if it is just for \\"shock value.\\" He authors a terribly boring and drawn-out story that should have been told in one-fourth the space. Don't waste your time. I have already done that for so many of you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An arrogant man","review":"Mr. Marcinko was much to arrogant to make this the book what it could've been. He tells great stories about the original SEAL team but the little things he \\"brags\\" about just don't impress the reader. He talks too much about his inability to be faithful to his wife, his absence from his childs life and the people that were out to get him. I hold great respect for this man but his book was a disappointment. He spends too much time explaining to the reader how much of a \\"bad ass\\" he really was. His writing style is very childish. In the end he claims to be driven by bon fires on the beach and long nights at the bars chasing women over the responsiblities of a raising a family in the military.Don't get me wrong...the few stories he told about the military and what his seal teams went through were great, but just too much arrogance involved to keep you reading. In the end he blames the \\"pencil pushers\\" for his troubles instead of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe any of this is true; this guy is an idiot!","review":"Sorry Richard, but based on reading your book, you are far too stupid to be a military officer, and far too irresponsible and immature to be a SEAL team commander. SOME of the book may be true, but what parts? Certainly the vast majority of the text is pure fiction. So without a litmus test to gauge the truth from adolescent male fantasy, I just have to assume all of it is bogus. I can't help but think about the fact that there are real American military specialists, operatives, soldiers and sailors who get the job done and do it with dignity for the military salary, and then there's the goofball who writes a fantasy and sells it as non-fiction and in the process, cheapens the sacrifices of real American military heroes. Shame on you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! This sucked!","review":"Although I truly appreciate Mr. Marcinko's patriotism and his service to our country, I have to say that this book sucked. I am in the military myself and I was very bored with the over explaination of processes, acronyms, tactics and weaponry. I was also bored with the breaks in the middle of action sequences to explain a character's history. To me, little things like that could have been done differently, it was very wordy. The most annoying thing about this book though, is the fact that Mr. Marcinko is afraid that someone will think that he's NOT a bad ass. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure he is a bad ass, but Iv'e read several non fiction military books and authors like Andy McNab, Billy Waugh and Nick Rowe tell their stories and the stories of their comrades with great humility. This could have been a really good book, but Mr. Marcinko was too focused on strutting his machismo, when he should have focused on the story itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a nutshell....100% TRUTH!","review":"Not only have I read this book and believe it, I LIVED it. The names were changed for a good reason...To protect those of us that are disabled from the very system that screwed us as they did my former Commander. Believe EVERYTHING in this book, it is all true."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARCINKO","review":"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK! I BELIEVE IT GOES TO SHOW WHAT A DEDICATED PERSON CAN ACCOMPLISH WHEN THEY SET GOALS, BEING EX-MILITARY MYSELF, THE BOOK MADE ME WANT TO RE-ENLIST! OK, ITS A BOOK ABOUT THE NAVY SEALS, SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE BAD LANGUAGE OR BAD THOUGHTS DON'T GET IT! BUT, IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH THE WAY A COMMANDER EXPLAINS IT, THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE! I WISH THE MILITARY HAD MORE MARCINKOS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought SpecOps to the common man.","review":"I enjoyed this book because it brought, for the first time, to the attention of the public, who was watching out for us. Marcinko had his faults, we all do, but who could have done a better job? If the Navy was so mad at him and hated him, whay did't they get rid of him long before they did? For another interesting side of the Marcinko story, I would say to read \\"Combat Swimmer\\", by Robert Gormly. All in all, Rogue Warrior is a good read and an interesting look into the SEAL teams form one man's point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, by a hero in the Armed Forces.","review":"Richard Marcinko does an excellent job in showing the trials that he went through that made him the \\"animal\\" that he became in the SpecWar field. Being in the military and training for SpecOps myself, I found this book not only a good read, but also a guide to help me physically, and mentally prepare myself for what is ahead. Marcinko goes into great detail about the opposition he confronted full force when SeALs came into the world. He made his point when it came to the misunderstanding of what a SeAL needs to do, and is meant to do. When opposition reared its ugly head he knocked it down by going out of his own authority, and told higher ranking officers to **** off. To keep himself free and clear of any UCMJ punishment, he produced results. With numerous adventure settings, and a large amount of can't-put-it-down pages, this book is a definite must read for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too much.","review":"Where the book dealt with life in the battle zone, it was fascinating. There was less narration of this sort than I expected though, and most of the book dealt with Marcinko's rise through the Navy ranks and his dealings with the Navy bureaucracy. The main trouble I had with enjoying this book were the repeated, overbearing, egotistical remarks Marcinko makes chapter after chapter, page after page. I appreciate that to be a man in his shoes, one needs a huge ego to be successful or even survive, but the constant braggadocio really grated on my nerves. Marcinko is a rare breed and one deserving appreciation from every generation of American. His book though, is one part entertainment and one part irritation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"You're in Vietnam, one of my favorite instance is after a huge group kill deep in Vietcong country, a viper that a SEAL buddy slices, and offers as a snack, after a very calm \\"Viper-there\\".

It shows the daring deeds of some of america's bravest fighting men. It was a shame what the Navy did to Dick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - but self justifying","review":"I have much first hand knowledge of some of CDR Marcinko's exploits and heard many stories while in the Navy, working with various SEAL Teams as an intelligence officer. In short, he was a warrior's warrior and a gutsy guy, but his ego got the best of him. He was sent to jail because he turned into a crook, not just because he torqued off a few folks (which he did with relish). The money he wasted and misappropriated makes $1000 toilet seats look tame. Too bad he had to spoil a great story and life with so much B.S. Still, a good read if you can get past some factual errors and self-aggrandizing drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much more.","review":"The author has an amazing story to tell of the time he served in the Vietnam War. However, certain parts of the book, like the part dealing with him verbally thrashing a superior officer, are very much in doubt.That one incident caused some stir, as other books written by members of the SEAL community refute this author's telling of the events that day.With his integrity under question, the rest of the book must be taken with a pinch of salt.But even with that pinch of salt, the book has an amazing story to tell of a dedicated warrior, one of America's truly devoted warriors. Hats off to Mr. Marcinko's service to this country!"},{"rating":"2","title":"richard marcinko rogue warrior","review":"A good book for military buffs.

Thanks Dick."},{"rating":"2","title":"This man should run for president!","review":"Having read this book many times now i feel compeled to add a few words of my own. This book should be read by every military officer in the army, if only more people would listen to the views of men like Marcinko then the world would be a far safer place. Yes Marcinko spends a lot of time talking about himself, but once you have read this book you will understand why.This man is a true HERO and today there are far too many people who like to think that they are the real article, well if you want to read a book about a real hero by a real hero then buy this book and turn off the phone, you will not wish to be disturbed. I can only hope that one day i will get a chance to meet this great man and speak to him about his theories of life which he explains so easily in his books. If you haven't read this book, strong message follows, BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Dick's new book","review":"Dick Marcinko, despite his racism, egocentrism, and coldheartedness, has written a wartime masterpiece for our century.

Don't worry if you don't speak the SEAL lingo, Dick's vernacular makes it easy to follow his progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"An autobiography from a real American character","review":"This is a great read. Marcinko's style is both literate and rambunctious, and his personality comes through strong; it's almost like he's there telling you these stories in person.You also learn a lot about SpecWar, as Marcinko addresses some of the standard misconceptions about Navy SEALs and describes the reasoning behind the strategies his men use.\\"Rogue Warrior\\" offers a fresh if somewhat romanticized view of this important facet of modern warfare, and I this book is a must for anyone with an interest in the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"First and best","review":"Here it is, the first and best from the Rogue Warrior. The story of Demo Dick and his rise and fall from grace is a compelling, well told story that everyone should be reading. I bought into the whole Rogue Warrior series and have every one of his books (yes, every one) and this by far is the best because it is the most real (at least most real in the sense of looking at the other books). If you like action, get this one. You want more action, get Red Cell, but then after tha, they all start to look the same........sorry Dickie. I still gave you 5 stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredibly truthful novel, Being A SEAL I recommend it.","review":"This book caught my attention because of the fact that Richard Marcinko is the former Commanding Officer of the SEAL Team I am a Part of.

He showed up drunk and kept drinking at the podium. His stories were quite boring, exaggerated and I'm surprised the company paid this man as a \\"professional\\" speaker. Needless to say, I took the free books, had the author sign them and promptly put them on a high shelf. Save yourself the hassle and don't buy this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at least","review":"I doubt Marcinko's version of what he experienced. But his version is, afterall, best for his book (complete with his pretty mug on the cover). Sorry, sailor, but you're a braggart. No wonder you didn't survive the military.Reader's beware.

Not a novel. This is a manuscript in search of an editor. She can't just throw this together and call it a novel. The tenses shift, the point of view is awry...what was she thinking? She's got a great eye and a great ear but this is a failure of a novel. The good reviews show the respect Bloom has in the literary community, and it is well-deserved, but they pulled their punches on this one.

Then it turned out that Amy Bloom didn't mean it at all. Instead of love inventing anyone, the characters just let love ruin their lives for no good reason at all. Charming Elizabeth has one sordid affair and one high-school romance that doesn't quite work out and then she just gives up completely and sinks in to a slough of despond so boring the novel won't even talk about it. This book turned out to be a disappointment and a cop-out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is the best part...","review":"The title of this book, Love Invents Us, leads you to believe you will be reading a passionate love story, one with obstacles to overcome and triumphs to behold. What I read was pure drivel! I had no sympathy for Elizabeth, who never stepped out of the cycle, who loved the unloveable and continued to exercise meaningless, false relationships throughout her life. Elizabeth was very unhealthy and used, and I had no room to find goodness or sincerity in her. I could barely make it to the end of the 205 pages. Although there were some allusions to the human body that were very well written, there weren't enough of them to redeem this book for me. I'm sorry, but this book belongs in Bad Book Hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"The short stories are better","review":"I read this novel since I liked the short stories of Bloom.This book is disappointing when compared with the powerful prose of Bloom.The love stories are mildly interesting, the characters develop only partially and overall it leaves one wanting..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile read.","review":"Amy Bloom certainly has an interesting slant on growing up.

However, according to Time Magazine, when I spoke to them today, the order was processed on Nov. 13, but Time was told to start the subscription with the Dec. 17 issue. They are not permitted to start it earlier. Why? The woman I spoke to certainly did not think it made any sense. I am now going to miss several issues and buying them on the newstand at $4.99 each negates this great offer.

I did hunt and own dogs decades ago but feel ambivalent about both these days. I loved this book though.The author's descriptions of how hunting birds with his dog connects him to life's great continuum is the books great strength. As in all peak life experiences Rick Bass and Colter seem to be fully and intensely present as they hunt- the past and present are irrelevant at such times. I envy the ability they had to experience nature and life that way and understand what a loss the author suffered.It also didn't hurt that Bass is a great writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I honor the dog, not the hunter","review":"Bass is an engaging stylist in the Annie Dillard vein and his love for his dog will touch anyone \\"owned\\" by one of the four-legged rascals. But one thing that consistently interfered with my enjoyment of the book - though it may not bother you in the least - is the importance Bass places on Colter's skills as a hunting dog. For one thing, I have never been convinced (even by a writer as formidable as William Faulkner) that there is anything noble or poetic about killing animals for fun, no matter how much the dog may enjoy helping us do it. And what if Colter had been just a dumb sweet mutt with housebreaking lapses? Would he have been any less deserving of tribute? My whippet Reggie is an oddly-proportioned fellow (reminiscent, in his youth, of a pot-bellied pig) with a goofy grin whose most conspicuous talent is carrying my slippers into the backyard.

Instead of a book about a man loving his dog, it was more about man loving himself and not really being a great owner. Not the ending that made me feel this way but just overall the whole story itself. Unless you are a hunter who wants to hear about different hunting trips this guys made then I say skip it. Not really a book for animal/dog lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed me","review":"I was disappointed in the book because it failed to convey the delight of living with and training a dog like Colter. The author captures the wonder of the basic genetic heritage of his dog: bottomless energy, enthusiasm, natural obsession with birds.

It seems to me to be a story of wasted potential when it could have been a story about pride and bonding based on mutual accomplishments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book for Hunters","review":"This is a book for hunters, specifically bird hunters.

And as a person owned by a dog and a dog lover, I really saw little interaction between man and dog other than while hunting. I'm sure this is a binding experience, but no play wrestling with the dog, no pretending you know what the dog is saying (telepathicaly) when he barks or leads you?And a lost opportunity to excoriate losers who shoot dogs because they hate them, or for fun, or out of jealousy, or because they're drunk and want to take out their aggression.Sorry, I really don't understand why this book received such favorable reviews.

And a few times it all comes together. But the majority of times you wonder when he'll get to the GOOD stuff. Tell us why he thinks Colter is the best. HE screws up and Colter screws up. Page after page. And THIS was the greatest dog alive? Better a story about Maddie! Clearly an author with too much money and time on his hands. Cradled in environmentalist claptrap.

I can't understand why a company would want to redefine a product that was already great to begin with.I'll be switching to nestle carnation instant breakfast shakes (dark chocolate flavor to be specific).

Midway through the book I found myself apologizing to Walt Russell for my previous attitude and utter ignorance and told him how much this book has helped me correctly read, understand and apply the Bible in my life. He received my confession with great amusement and humility. This book will help you understand how we all mis-read and mis-apply scripture in ingnorance.

It's an excellent, funny, satirical look into the world of professional boxing where athletes, who risk their physical health and financial future, are treated like commodities for the gain of promoters, who risk nothing and always get the big payoff. The flamboyant promoter (Samuel L. Jackson) deftly uses white America's obsession/anger with African-American dominance in sports to produce a payday as the media plays a willing pawn in the game. All of the performances in this movie are excellent but Peter Berg deserves a special mention."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most underrated sports films ever","review":"The amazon.com review for this film includes the line \\"While sharp and funny, it's never quite clear what the point of it all is.\\" If this is all a GREAT WHITE HYPE viewer gets out of this movie, i'm afraid he/she just wasn't paying attention. While providing a nice satirical look at egomaniacal athletes and hustling boxing promoters (Sam Jackson is as brilliantly watchable as always here) throughout, the movie is all about how hype can make a non-event an event and the film's last ten minutes is the key. What, you were expecting a ROCKY denouement? In the end, this movie shows how sports fans -- and the entertainment-junkie public in general -- can be manipulated by loudness and money. Combined with Shelton's ever-sharp and fearless takes on America's racial tension (also see the brilliant WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP), THE GREAT WHITE HYPE is well worth a watch. And a think thereafter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"Okay the DVD itself isn't so great with only minimal features but why I give this 4 stars is because I waited FOREVER for this thing to finally be released.

Sultan, decides something new is needed to boost the marketability of the boxing matches, he searches and finds the only man to ever beat the champ. The problem is that he isn't a boxer anymore and he's white. However, once Rev. Sultan convinces him to fight, he goes into heavy training while the confident champ takes it easy and falls out of shape. A very funny movie that also has a rather keen insight into the current state of boxing. Even if you are not a boxing fan, you will enjoy this movie. Very funny movie and great acting performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda funny but pretty racist","review":"There were some funny moments in the movie but if the roles were reversed the black community would be in uproar. If it was making fun of black kids taking the SAT instead of white people boxing it would be deemed racist. I guess it's not even so much the boxing angle but how white people are portrayed. You have Corbin Bernson (whatever) doing his sissy act from Major League 2, Jeff Goldblum as the nerd, the boxer is just a clueless foolio, and Jon Lovitz is well, Jon Lovitz. The thing is I wouldn't even care if there wasn't such a double standard. It's just the fact that racism is okay if it's against whites that bothers me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great White Hype","review":"Quick service, great product, exceptional price.

It mocks political correctness. The \\"Irish\\" boxer,Robert Conklin,refuses to wear white gloves... because it would be racist! The \\"champion\\" (Damon Wayans) watches the blaxploitation movie \\"Dolemite\\" before the pivotal fight. \\"Great White Hype\\" is more about celebrity cameos (Cheech Marin, Jeff Goldblum, Corbin Bernsen, Jamie Foxx, Jonathan Rhys-Davies) than a script with any substance.

A small girl follows her elderly grandfather out into the desert of the soul in search of a gathering of dervishes, and what a gathering it is! But getting there, like life itself, is the transformative part, without which the arriving itself can never happen. This tale within a tale within a tale is sure to delight fans of Sufism, mysticism, great epic tales, and really good music. I saw this film four times the first week it was in theaters.

I love the basic story of the blind grandfather and his granddaughter and the teaching of faith and the beauty of death. The poem...or song...\\"Arise O day, the atoms are dancing in molecular esctasy. Come my love-let us go join with them. \\" is worth watching the movie.

He is wise and at one with the world. And he must make this pilgrimage. We all do. As we will learn at the end.Like \\"The Arabian Nights\\", this incorporates other stories within the main one -- of people on private quests. While the stories are very dramatic, they are subtly explored in vague and dreamlike ways -- like a Sufi tale.This movie is more than that, however. It's also a sensory experience. This is an unbelievably beautiful film. Of desertscape. Of buildings and vibrant artifacts. Of haunting music and poetry.While the Tunisia-born writer/director Nacer Khemi may be a lost soul, torn between his present life in France and his Arabic background, and anguished by the present-day turmoil of the Islamic world, he has sublimated his painful, personal quest into a film of great beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting idea falls short","review":"I felt the \\"Sermon\\" was a great idea.. the Gospel according to Rickie Lee.

This album allows Rickie Lee to express musically the social conscience of the common people in the Los Angeles.

Maybe it's the obnoxious music that is obscuring the usual beauty of her voice and poetry... I don't know. It is harder to find the moments of beauty and cohesion in this album than to sit through drunken kareoke. Even amazon's attempt at offering soundbytes with selling points is rough. I guess I'll just do as another reviewer is, stash this unpleasantness and await her next recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave It To RLJ","review":"I've been listening to Rickie Lee Jones since about 1979- '80. She has never steered me wrong. She always released music that went along with my life. Well, maybe not GHOSTYHEAD but that is my favorite RLJ CD. Until Now, with SERMON ON EXPOSITION BOULEVARD, this one just might become my favorite. Without getting all into religeon and spirituality, I will only say, once again, RLJ has found me struggling and has helped to provide some answers/suggestions.

The unexpected surprise was the history lesson concerning the lands history and the Government's role in it's development.I was most surprised that of all the bits and pieces I'd heard about the Dust Bowl, I'd never clearly heard much about the cause of it before so that was enlightening. I understand it may be touchy to even suggest Humanity may be responsible for it's own trials sometimes but it was what it was and Timothy told it well.I'm glad a learning experience came out of it for not only those who had to suffer through this but for those of us who get to read it about it as well!

Her tales of using a rope to feel her way from home to school and placing damp rags around windows and doors to keep down the dust in the house were not the exaggerations I had thought them to be. Timothy Egan recounts the stories of those who lived through this time with vivid detail. He also explains the reasons for this disaster. Many of the factors which brought about the dust bowl are present today so I hope Mr. Egan's journalism will bring greater awareness to us while we can still avoid repeating this tragedy. I finally bought a copy for my Kindle because I had given a friend my copy to read three different times and even at Amazon prices this could not continue. This is a book that you will find yourself thinking about long after you have finished it and you will want to reread it, maybe more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big government, Anti-regulation protesters should read!

However, no mention was made about the 25+ lead in years that created this debacle in terms of federal policies and commercial (railroad) interests and how families \\"survived\\", in situ. Although, the book is a bit disjointed, I believe it is a must read of unintended consequences to advance policy. The devastation can still be seen today in the dust devils of west TX, OK and KS and the impotence of the elected panels of Soil and Water Conservation Districts.

It is certainly not a light, happy read and I would have appreciated a little broader scope to the reporting, but by concentrating on the Texas & Oklahoma panhandles at the epicenter of the disaster Egan has provided a human-scale description of real life in real hard times.

Then the vulgarity and profanity turned me off. Has Mr. Egan ever heard of TMI (too much information?) We can all assume that many of the cowboys around Dalhart looked for loose women, but who wants to read about the baser nature when they think they're picking up a good history book?

The story documents how government and business--even with the best of intentions--can facilitate the destruction of an entire region. Using actual stories of hearty survivors who persevered dust storms, drought and depression, Egan accurately recounts historical events with flair and drama. He makes history come alive by managing a rare accomplishment; educating while entertaining the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good writting quick read.","review":"I really enjoyed this book! It paints a vivid picture of what life was like in 1930's Oklahoma. My grandparents came out to California from Oklahoma and this book really helped me to understand why they would go through the trouble. I have heard many a family story about life in California when they got here, living in chicken coops and immigrant labor camps, picking apricots all day for half a buck, discrimination, deprivation and racism.But stories about why they left Oklahoma, and what life was like there, were not told much."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The OTHER Great Depression\\"","review":"I was born in 1935 in South Dakota, sort of a northern border of the Dust Bowl. The economic effects of the Depression and the Dust Bowl were part of my childhood.

I've awakened to a new realization of background of my early years on the prairie."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful story","review":"This was no quick read, but it was definitely worth the effort. It's amazing to realize exactly what people went through, and how they survived the Great Depression in the Dust Bowl.Egan brings these people's stories to life. You start to understand why they moved out to what must have seemed like the middle of nowhere, and you really get a sense of the family bonds that kept them going. Certainly, the government wasn't much help. So they had no choice but to rely on each other.It's a sad story, no two ways about it. The suffering was tremendous. But it's a very moving book. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Americans need to know","review":"I read this from the public library and knew I had to own it.I want all my family to read it.We Americans need to know our history and what shapes our times.In this case specifically the Midwest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This book is extremely well written. Although it is a history of the Dust Bowl, the story flows like a great historical fiction novel. It is impossible not to become completely absorbed in the accounts of those who survived, and died during this period in American history. I loved the back story; the author paints in vivid detail a picture of the events leading up to the Dust Bowl, and how it could have been prevented. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is that it ends quite abruptly, and I would have liked more detail in the epilogue. Other than that minor detail this book is most definitely worth the time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"They really were the worst of hard times","review":"This was a great read for someone that wants more insight into the 1930's. I learned so much about a large part of the country. Story can jump around from time to time but a very good book, especially after the dry summer of 2012."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worst Hard Time, the best read!","review":"Very well written.

They never talked about it, but this book does. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Important American history.","review":"A subject about which I knew very little, came to life. These tough and determined Americans were subjected to continual dust storms, causing them to lose so much. What a life!Should be required reading for high school students."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Worst Hard Time","review":"Timothy Egan has a way of involving the reader in his stories. By the time he has introduced you to all of the key players you find that you can identify with one or more in that you could see yourself in their shoes. In this case we are drawn to the potential for great wealth in the rich,until then,unfarmed areas of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. We feel the joys of the boom times and the unbelievable loss as the Great American Dust Bowl literally blows away their dreams. And you find yourself asking \\"what would I do next\\". It's a gripping true story of human grit.It's a very good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, history made accessible","review":"Absolutely stunning--this book takes a fascinating subject about which you may think you knew a great deal (as I did), and then proves that you only knew a tiny bit, and much of that untrue. This is a must-read for anyone interested in not only American history, but our history as human beings, perpetually struggling with the vagaries of Mother Nature and the forces of greed and ignorance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but actually pretty boring","review":"Wow, I love American history and I love farming. But this is one of the most boring books I have muddled through in a long time. He developed the setting very well and built the characters so that the reader would know them personally. But as he recounted storm after storm, the book dragged on and on much like the Dust Bowl and Depression themselves. Honestly, the storms weren't much differnt from one another, so giving us a detailed account of each one was monotonous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grateful","review":"I am grateful to have discovered and read this book and even more grateful I have not had to suffer through anything like the Dust Bowl as brought to life by Egan.I have ancestors who lived on the fringe of this world in the 30's, I grew up in western Oklahoma, but I never knew the story of the Dust Bowl as told like this. His approach brings the frustration, despair and utter hopelesness of these people to life. It was almost frustrating at time to read on as he paints the suffering at an individual, town, and regional level.For people who believe this country has never experienced natural disaster on the scale of Katrina before...this is an enlightening and powerful historical perspective. It is also a tremendous testimony to the American spirit and the ability of our nation to overcome.Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wind blows as you read","review":"Just finished this great book. It is well worth the read for anyone wishing to learn more about American's great midlands, the pioneers who ventured onto the plains, and the land that responded in a loud roar.A native of West Texas, I find something of my past in this book even though I was not yet born. I spent my early years in the \\"Dust Bowl\\" of the 1950 (not near as bad, but a struggle for my farmer family). Wind and heat are some how embedded in my spirit.This book brought out memories of old timers that were hardened by the land and lived on in an unexplained hope.This book is worth every minute I spent with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every chapter starts sounding like the previous.","review":"Liked: Great writing style, interesting informationDisliked: All the stories sound the same after you read 2 or 3 accounts, and then it keeps going on.I wanted to like this book, and found the first 60 or so pages very interesting, but then the next chapter seemed to be quite the same, and now 1/2 way though the book, every chapter is the same. It has different people, but then its more of the same.I will say I learned a lot in the 1/2 of the book (never knew the dust spread all the way to New York and that the digging up of native grass caused much of the problem) and feel for those that lived through it, but I stopped when the stories all began to run together. I think it might have worked better for me had he just chosen 2 or 3 accounts. I'll probably finish it, but every chapter I hope to see it going somewhere, but its just another similar story about a family stuck in the dust bowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can Almost Taste the Dust","review":"Egan's technique of interweaving the stories of families and towns that stayed in the regions hardest hit by the Dust Bowl--particularly Texas and Oklahoma--puts the reader so close to the drama you can almost taste the dust. The horrors of the dust bowl make most Hollywood enviro-disaster films look like nursery school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human nature is survival.","review":"My parents spoke of the dust bowl days as well as the great depression. Their stories most often emphasized how people helped their relatives and friends through very hard times by taking care of one another during illness, and sharing the few resources (i.e. food, clothing and shelter) that they had. During the current economic mess, the skills these folks used could serve us well. There is a lot to be learned about the good and the not so good of human nature and the will to survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely could not put this down!","review":"Love this book.

It's interesting to note: those who lived through it never call either \\"great\\". After talking to several while living well North of the area discussed (Southern Minnesota) I'd say this book describes the experience accurately. I'm looking forward to Timothy Egan's other book on the great fire!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Great period piece. The true story of an era many of us don't know much about. Unbelievable fortitude exhibited by those who lived it. My heart broke for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Worst Hard Time","review":"I am entranced by this book. It is a piece of history that I was almost totally unaware of and gives me a different outlook on the Great Depression.

I am also now watching the Ken Burns movie \\"The Dust Bowl\\" because it is so interesting and painful a topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"history","review":"A great history of a time I knew little about.

I struggled with the use of contemporary language/slang on occasion with the story, phrasing out of place and not yet in use during the historical timeline covered. There is endless jumping around of stories and undeveloped detail with each of them. It simply became frustrating. I will not recommend the book, not on behalf of the author but on the fact that a National Book Award was granted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lessons We can Learn","review":"A great read about the dust bowl and the hardness of survival of those who endured, plus the compassion exhibited by people who were involved. Worth reading and was a selection of our local book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"Though this book is a tough read--a tough subject, not readability--I'm so glad I chose this book. Great story that fills in the gaps behind Grapes of Wrath and our current Farm Bills. My 91 year old great aunt has also thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. She grew up in West Texas during the Dust Bowl and has told me this book has brought about many memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Grit","review":"This is a true story about real people. They say history repeats itself. Parts of this story look very similar to what is happening in our country now. It's just manifested in a different form. I have a greater appreciation for my parent's (who grew up in the plains of New Mexico) and now understand the extent of what they experienced during the Depression along with the rest of the people of our great country. I have learned so much about the people who wanted to live the American dream, lived in despair and continued to hang on during the worst of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story I didn't know","review":"I was surprised at how interesting this book became as I read it.

Hard to imaging people living that way but the author described their lives in vivid detail, and introduced us to a kind of bravery rarely necessary or seen in decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening","review":"This was really a better read than I had imagined....the struggles of the people who lived and barely survived their struggles (and those who lost their lives trying to survive) was heartbreaking as well as inspirational and humbling. I appreciated the thorough historical perspective I gained along with the insight of each faction of groups involved (cowboys, nesters, farmers and pioneers). A very worthwhile read that shows the resilience of the dust bowl population...both the survivors and those who lost their desparate battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book is very well written - it brings this time in our history alive. It should be required reading in the public schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"The worst hard times.","review":"I purchased 'The worst of hard times\\" for my Kindle from Amazon.I love history and this was a part of American history that I was unfamiliar with except for the \\"GRAPES OF WRATH\\".

I also bought a copy of the book for a friend who lived in Dalhart Texas during the dust storms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a history buff","review":"I've never been a big history buff but this was an interesting read. The author makes this period in our history so much more relevant by giving us insight into the personal lives of real people who survived this difficult time.

The fact that the charactors in the book were real and the events were true made it more interesting. The descriptions of the living conditions were so graphic that it made me thirsty just reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible story - very well told","review":"It took me next to no time at all to read this book, and I was sorry when it ran out of pages. Before reading this book I frankly had no idea whatsoever what people in the Dust Bowl went through - what an unbelievably harsh and cruel time it was to be alive under those circumstances. The fact that global economics and simple human greed conspired to play such a large part in the creation of this immense social and ecological disaster should be an eye-opener to those observing similar trends in our own world. Sadly, history is too little studied and even less understood in our world to serve as the warning signal it should. This book is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like a novel","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. This is a can't-put-it-down non-fiction book that is so gripping and emotionally charged that it reads like a novel. The suffering and endurance of the plains settlers who lived through and endured the Dust Bowl was Biblical. The \\"wheat boom\\" and then bust which led directly to the Dust Bowl has warnings for us today. If you grew up hearing stories about the Dust Bowl this book will complete your education. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read!!!","review":"We are now going through tough economic times but we are so far from anything that is described in this book.

That last person must have the wrongheating bulb. Also to get goop in tight places it is best to usea pin point to spread it into those spots. You can do a lot of detail that way. We have even been able to use our Molds from the1960's without any problem. Keep making that goop and coming outwith some more molds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The making of bugs","review":"My 8 year old loves having creepy bugs to play with and once we lessened the cooking time (after talking with the products customer service department, which was very helpful) we got the bugs to look very colorful. However, it is very difficult for him to squeeze the bottles by himself - smaller holes help with making better details, which he also has trouble doing - so I tend to do all the work, with his input. We are also dispointed that the FX Goop that is thicker and supposed to be used for filling in the legs and all the detailing like lines, spots, eyes, etc. does not come in many colors (we got pink, yes - PINK! Not a favorite of boys!). It also can not be purchased seperately like the Plastic Goop, the only way to get more FX Goop is to purchase the bug machine or the mold packs - each which only include one small tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the Goop?","review":"We have searched all over for refills for the Goop.

She thought it was the coolest toy. When we brought the toy home and opened it...there was no bulb, and nowhere open on Christmas to buy one. When we were finally able to get a bulb for the toy the next day, much to her disappointment, it takes approximately 10-12 minutes to \\"cook\\" the bugs and another 12-15 minutes for the machine to cool down so the door can be opened (safety feature). She was not very happy with having to wait almost a half an hour for one spider to be made. Needless to say, she dosen't play with that toy much now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lesson in Patience","review":"My 5 year old wanted this toy very much. Nobody told me about the flimsy base for the bulb. It took about 15 mins. just to get the lightbulb working. He enjoyed using the goop. Then we had to cook each mold about three times to get it to a somewhat solid form. Then only at the END of the instructions did we read to use only the FX in the legs and arms. Next time we're putting it in the oven. \\"Mommy, I'm tired of waiting,\\" says Michael over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks fun, but who would know without the lightbulb","review":"O.K. I read all the reviews before buying this toy for my son for xmas; it sounded cool and lots of fun. He was thrilled when he opened the present....but we still have not successfully used it. At this moment there is uncooked goop sitting in a tray because we didn't have the right wattage (or size)light bulb in our house. Every xmas I stock up on AA, AAA, C, D batteries in preparation for xmas, but never did I think about getting a lightbulb that would work in this toy. Why didn't anyone write about this in their reviews, I at least could have been prepared xmas morning. So I don't know how great this toy is until I get the lightbulb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and outdated","review":"I bought this album in Germany based on the strength of the reviews of previous work (and the fact that none of the previous work was available in the stores I visited).I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed, not by the quality of the musicianship, which is generally good (and features Vinnie Appice - he of black Sabbath fame), but more by the the lack of any real dynamism or drive in the tracks.I can only describe the overall feel as if the album were written for a mid-80's audience as the song structures are somewhat uncomplex and the production rather thin. Lana Lane is captured within the genre progressive, however, the description is in my view way off the mark. This is nothing more than poor pop metal.In summary, what we have here is is musical fast food. Pleasing enough during consumption but instantly forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"cold feet","review":"don't know if the movie will play or not . i haven't gotten around to try it. i am waiting for the right time and mood. i remember the scene where tom waits is being the prick in the bar and loudly orders a round of drinks for a group of tough looking cowboys by saying \\" get a round for the homosexuls down at the end of the bar\\" i cant remember if he got his ass kicked or not? gotta watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat Who Played Brahms","review":"I enjoyed this book because it was light reading.

However he does bring to light some of the political and predatory aspects of the SRF and similar organisations - worth reading just so that Kriya practitioners don't just accept everything blindly!!!

My son has chewed on the tassle a few times at the height of a teething episode (and then decided it wasn't even satisfactory for that), but he has completely ignored the key aspect. I ended up waiting until he was a year old and giving him a set of real blanks on a wrist coil key chain. THEY are one of the first toys he asks for every morning -- and the Sassy keys remained untouched in the toy box. My niece was the same way -- they were actually HER keys first, and we \\"inherited\\" them because she never played with them. You win some, you lose some. But inexpensive as these are, I wouldn't buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but flawed study","review":"Heather Hendershot does a wonderful job of reviewing Christian conservative media culture and some of what propels it. Her survey of Christian entertainment feels plausible enough that her conclusions are not unreasonable. However, I found her discussion of Evengelical attitudes toward sex incomplete and biased. The chapter, Holy Homosexuals, while interesting hardly belonged with the rest of the book. The other chapter dealing with sexuality only surveyed Focus on the Family publications. It ignored denominational publications - there must be some. I am still not convinced Focus on the Family is representative. These chapters felt like Evengelical books reviewing the beliefs of other religions: here are their beliefs and why they are wrong. Unfourtunately, the editor didn't strongly recommend removing or rewriting these chapters. It would have improved the insight and power of this book. Still, I enjoyed the book, and recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magellan GPS carrying case","review":"The Magellan leather carrying case is well made and fits the unit like a glove.It is a little harder to push the buttons on the GPS when it is in the case, but for the added protection from damaging or scratching the GPS if accidently dropped,I definitely think it is worth it to have the added security this GPS case offers.All GPS units no matter what brand are sensitive pieces of equipment and any kind of padded protection you can get will ensure long trouble-free hours of operation.The attached belt clip is also a big plus.

It was magical and enthralling. I'm sure the movie would have been too. Unfortunately when I rented it, I picked up the english dubbed one. The voice actors sounds unnatural and like village idiots.

Was taken by the muting of the voices of young women by culture.

I even tried to watch the movie a second time in case I had missed something first time around. However, that made me even more disgusted with myself for having spent money on this film. I realize that I may very well be alone in my reaction to this movie, but nonetheless my disappointment compelled me to write this review.If you are reading this and are considering this film, I would advise two alternatives: 1 - rent it if you must see it and 2 - skip this movie and watch Chocolat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I love this movie it was well writen.

I am still trying to figure out why so many people say it was so great. Maybe i just didn't understand it completely, or maybe it lost something in the translation that i didn't pick out, but overall, it was not even close to being as good as i though it would be. Yes it was a romantic movie, (which has always been my favorite kind) but i never found it to be that sweet or anything close to that. Above all, it was more of a tradigy. Maybe you will like it more than i did, so i guess if you want to, its worth a shot as watching. Remember it is in subtitles, so be prepared!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the strangest movies that I've ever seen","review":"I first watched this movie with my roommate who absolutely loves it. The whole time though, I sat there hoping that it would get better. The entire plot is very strange, it seemed interesting at first, especially considering the fact that she was able to put her emotions into what she cooked, but then it just got more and more obscure. The way that the sister ran off and the mother's haunting of the girl and then setting the man on fire was odd enough, but then you get to the end where she eats matches to kill herself and then the building bursts into flames. The only possible reason that I can see for buying this movie is to sit there and make fun of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is \\"erotic and delectable\\"?","review":"The story opens on a Mexican rancho in 1910, as Tita is being born.

When she grows up, Tita falls in love with handsome Pedro; he cannot marry her so he marries her sister just to be close to his beloved, who is now the family cook.I know this was a favorite of the critics when it came out, so I can only assume that something was lost in the translation for me, because I don't see the appeal or the greatness of this movie at all. To me, the actors seemed bland and amateurish, the scenes were choppy and poorly photographed, and story couldn't decide if it was a real love story or a magical fantasy. The meaning of the title was never explained and the last scene was just bizarre.I really expected to like this movie, but found it a low-budget, art house-wannabe.

The cinematography is gorgeous.I wanted to give this 5 stars because I love this story so much, but the DVD has a lot of artifacts from what appears to be a fairly battered copy of the film. The most salient artifacts are the reel cues (which appear as ragged circles along the right edge, centered vertically.)

I would love to see it done totally differently, but I could not sit through this one again.Me fascinó esta historia. Pero no me podía relacionar con los personajes. Me sentí tan desconectada de la historia que fue difícil terminar de ver esta película.

The way of the old traditions are swept away by the Mexican Revolution of 1910 at a hacienda sited next to Texas. Long term care for old age was not provided by insurance, but by the youngest child. Love and war and refuge across the Rio Grande challenge the old assumption. Love triumphs at the end but with cost of family. Those of us who have lived along this border all our lives can appreciate the complexity of life where very different cultures co-exist and struggle to retain a sense of identity. Those who have not experienced this phenomena may gain an understanding not just of culture, but of the stories behind the headlines of today. This is a beautiful story well told by the magic of film. The only complaint is the lack of sync between dubbed English and the spoken Spanish."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective DVDs - beware","review":"This DVD that Amazon is selling is defective. It won't play past the intro and just freezes in place. I had them replace the 1st one and the 2nd did the exact same thing, My guess is that they have aa defective lot. Amazon really needs to clean this up before they sell any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad, Tragic Movie","review":"In this classical Romeo and Juliet tale, Tita (Lumi Cavazos) and Pedro (Hunky-Marco Leonardi) seem destined to marry until her evil-hearted mother Elena (Regina Torne), forbids it because of some silly family tradition. Tita, the youngest, is to take care of Elena until she dies. So, she marries Pedro off to her daughter Rosaura(Yareli Arizmendi). Pedro's reasoning is that he can be near Tita but it presents a host of problems. Tragedies beset this family as well. The lovers though, overcome all of it and after Rosaura's death--finally have the chance to express their love for each other. But, how tragic--so enters FATE. This is a foreign film with English subtitles. And, this review refers to the 105 minute DVD. At first I gave it two stars, but it's perhaps a four star movie for drama and effects. But, Beware of Nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"It was great. I received my product with two weeks in good conditions.

The book is great. I use it in my Hispanic Lit. in Translation class"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Tita and Pedro's love for each other winds its way through this lovely movie, being expressed through Tita's improving gourmet abilities. The effect of her food on each of its recipients expresses itself in different ways, for Tita it expresses her love for Pedro and in others it creats passion,desire or pain. Pedro marries her sister so her can remain near Tita without raising the ire of her protective mother and cultural taboos. A beautifully shot film deserving a 4 star rating. Definitely a \\"chick flick\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An endorsement with a caveat","review":"Note: Although I've only seen this DVD release, and quite enjoyed it, I also hesitate torecommend it, as I know it has substantial cuts from the original. I haven't been ableto find any more complete versions on video.That said, I still found this a warm, funny, bittersweet, moving fable about threesisters, their horrific mother and their lives and loves in early 20th century Mexico.Feels epic in scope, despite only being 1:45 long. That does mean a few things get rushed,and there are moments that edge into too cute. Perhaps that is the effect of the above mentionedcuts.But for the most part, this mix of romance, cooking, melodrama, gentle satireand magical realism works wonderfully well, and the constant use of food as ametaphor for sex, and for life feels original and creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected","review":"This is not the color i expected, I always got Chanels Naturel and this was much darker.I have been using Chanels Pro Lumier for years and was SO upset when i heard they discontinued it.

Must have been a thin year. Fascinating step-grandmother goes to colonial India in the 20s with her husband, meets charming yet mysterious prince, gets knocked up, has an abortion, runs off with him. Not-so-fascinating step-granddaughter goes to independent India in the 70s alone, meets not charming and unmysterious clerk, gets knocked up, doesn't have an abortion, runs off alone. Told in parallel plot lines because, well, I'm not sure. The writing is unexceptional, the characterization even less so. Pat. Very pat.Why sacrifice all drama, suspense, and interest in the plot? To seem more \\"literary\\"? To illustrate how deep the feeling and dilemmas of their characters are? Why characters of such thin merit, so thinly explored? Who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for finishing","review":"I only finished this dreadful book because I had to read it for a book club. What does it tell you when the person who suggested the book does not show up for the discussion???No one in the group liked it.

The plot was thin at best, based on a frail premise which was of little interest.My advice: skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A success","review":"I've read this book twice, and each time I had the same feeling about it. Very satisfied.one could feel the heat and dust coming from the story as if he were living with the characters.Ruth Jhabvala is very talented in describing every little detail and makes you live inside the scene, especially when she comes to describe the state of India and the crowed, disgust, infections, and poverty.I really felt disgusted reading some lines that I had to stop for a moment thinking of what I've just read.What I liked the most is having two parallel stories separated by two generations.The first woman is the narrator who travels to India to discover more about the scandal of Olivia, and unconsciously she follows the same pathclaiming that India changes whoever lives there and finally the two characters experience the same end.The language of the book is simple and fascinating I think everyone would enjoy it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"The narrator is a young woman travelling to India to research and reconnect with a long lost member of her family, Olivia, who lived there during the 1920's.

The internal power source failed after 4 months. I signed up for the ProCare service so that we could take the computer into the local Apple store for repairs. The Genius bar is a joke. The only thing the technician did was to plug the computer into a socket and tell me that it needed to be repaired and it would take 7 to 10 days (for something that could be fixed in 30 minutes for they were willing to do it). I explained that my son had typed an important assignment typed into the computer and needed it in 2 days. The store manager was not able to offer any other solutions.

I have found the book useful in my work, and worth the price, but of limited help when I started using ADO. There is a good, detailed example of hooking up an ADO control to an Access database (I had to download the sample database from the internet, because I could not find it on the CD where it was supposed to be, and I had to convert the downloaded table to the latest version of Access before the program would recognize it), but it didn't go into how to hook up any other kind of database, nor did the author give much by way of clues to help me connect to an Oracle database."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written book","review":"I learned by myself VisualBasic 6, and C++.

I am an AS/400 programmer with 11 years experience and want to become more familiar with Windows programming. I started off with a Sam's Teach Yourself Visual C++ in 21 days (which I also liked) and followed up with this one. The authors presented the material in an easy to read and follow format. I only had two issues with the book. One, the authors would occasionally pull a function out of nowhere and use it with little or no explanation as to why. And two, I thought they dragged out the examples on drawing too long. I would have preferred more time spent on the database chapter rather than the drawing examples. But, overall an excellent book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd like to be nice, but it blows","review":"Unless you have the IQ of a chimp this book just won't move quickly enough. I honestly can't figure out who this book is for, if you are just learning programming/C++ the book assumes too much knowledge but if you are moving on from another language or sharpening your skills the book takes soooo long to teach a point that you'll end up wanting to shoot yourself.

There are lots of really useful tips in here on how to plan for an unassisted birth, great practical stuff you can actually use.

Remarque is one of the most gifted mainstream Europaen novelists to emerge from the first half of the twentieth century.

It draws back and pops up somewhere else. But it didn't move. It's here, there, it has a network that stretches across the world.\\" OK, so if this is true, then why live? What are the characters in this book doing besides killing, mutilating bodies and having doped-up or drunken sex? Are we actually supposed to believe a love story develops in this sordid mess? But what really threw me is the kingpin behind it all's justification for causing these rivers of blood and semen, lame to the extreme.

Bailey never had the manual dexterity required for a surgeon. Early in his career, he got abscess of the hand which led to the amputation of his left index finger (as was the treatment in the pre-antibiotic era). He was poor at socialising and he was never welcome by patients and colleagues. He even had intractable manic-depressive illness and had a close shave from leucotomy.

Of course more twists in the plot soon developed after that conversation but i think that the plot doesnt really drive this book. Our hero is someone I have no interest in meeting and I dont know anyone who resembles him. often when i read about charachters that are withdrawn and uncomfortable in the world i become frustrated with them, wanting them to grow and to break out of their shell or stand up to those who keep them down but with Stoner i did not have my usual response. The writing is excellent, you feel a part of everything and although one could come away from this book saying that not a lot happened it is hard to put down since you want to know what will happen next, i plan to introduce this work to my book club and i assume they will enjoy it as much as i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"emotonally crippled people","review":"If you think a book must be depressing, hopeless, and about unhealthy people who don't really want to change, than this is the choice for you.

There are no good guys. The main character watches as his little girl's life is destroyed by his wife, and doesn't stop it! Or even try to stop it.

There is no reason to read this book unless you are looking for an example of How Not To Live Your Life.

A review on the back cover calls it a \\"perfect novel.\\" While it is not badly-written and uses vocabulary well, nothing is described using any of the five senses. Reading the book, I don't know what anything looks like, smells like, tactilely feels like, etc. My main complaint is that every character lacks the expression of emotion of any kind. The story covers decades, yet, every character is flat of emotion and either doesn't fulfill any purpose in life or doesn't attain any joy from the fulfillment. The author is clearly intelligent; it is the story I do not consider worth reading, as it does not provide enjoyment or lesson learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious!","review":"I just laughed like crazy at the pictures in this book.

It's nothing but a grocery list of men's faults and an insinuation that women, in contrast, are perfect. Even violence against men is joked about: suggestions of women shooting men and even severing their private parts.If there were a similar book about WOMEN being awful, NOW would have sent death threats to the publishing house. Ridiculing men for about a hundred pages is no different.This piece of sexist garbage is for the woman who says how much she hates men -- and then wonders aloud why no one will go out with her.

The plot was very poorly put together, and the murder mystery was barely a mystery at all! The whole book is extremely predictable; I figured out the \\"who dunnit\\" at the 50th page of the 250 page book. I suspect the whole book takes places on the border of Canada and the U.S., but the author didn't really specify exactly where, so you couldn't really get a clear idea of the culture and landscape. I personally don't think the author is very creative and probably romance stories would best fit her, not murder mysteries.

But if you do love cats, the Cat Who books are a delight. The mystery story, while part of the fun, is really a sidebar to the story of Mr. Q and his two cats, their travels and their adventures. Jorge Luis Borges said he wasn't sure he believed in the Hound of the Baskervilles, but he believed in Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. That is the way the Cat Who books are.

The character was flawed and very likeable. However, as the story turned I had a hard time buying her love interest. It began to twist into a soap opera and I wan't buying it. I did enjoy the character and I liked the premise of the book but it became too sappy for me. I look forward to reading more this author's realistic characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, LOUD, very very loud, and ultimately a source of infection!?","review":"I've had this unit for two years now, and while it does cool well and is feature rich (sleep timer, 0-100 fan speed settings, filter cleaning light), it was so loud we had to watch TV with headphones or have phone conversations in the other room. It would wake us up at night when it cycled up to full power to keep the room temp consistent with the thermostat setting.Additionally, it somehow (and I've never had this happen before) became an incubator for some sort of incredibly gross black mold, which has coated the entire interior of the unit (especially the air path), making it a spewing spore dispenser. I currently have a major respiratory infection which began the morning after running this unit for 6 hours overnight for the first time since last summer; my wife had a nasty cough all morning as well.I'm dumping it and getting a Kenmore 76081 - $200, much quieter, same specs, much better review record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Grief Is It Noisy","review":"I bought this here at Amazon after seeing that it was given the number two spot as a top performer by a major testing lab. They mentioned it was a tiny bit \\"loud.\\" Yes it does cool ok but my god it had a schreeching loud whistle (!) due to the way the air outlets were shaped. I tore the unit apart and stuffed some styrofoam in the outlet hole to change the shape just to bear having it around. When I say loud I mean like a police whistle!!! Now it puts out 30% less air but the whistle got shut up thank god. You could hear it outside in the garage!!!Yeah I could have sent it back, hassled with it, etc but we were talking about selling the house so why get too excited.The blower now is only loud enough to drown out my stereo (!) my TV (!) and can clearly be heard as a very loud noise downstairs on another floor.And guess what, we aren't selling. Damn it I hate it when that happens.If you pay for one of these don't say I didn't warn you about the noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's very noisy!","review":"Bought this unit to replace an old A/C in the bedroom, and I can't believe how noisy it is.Even at the lowest fan speed it is extremely loud. Using the energy saver feature the unit is bound to wake you up every time it comes on. And I am not spoiled...I live on a noisy street in Manhattan.This one is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free ear plugs should be provided","review":"This unit is the loudest a/c I've been around in my life. We are returning it as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly loud","review":"Like others have said, this unit is unbelieveably loud, negating other good features it has (ability to cool quickly, not too hard to install, etc). I returned it and purchased a Kenmore, and they are night and day."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really is as loud as everyone says...","review":"This air conditioner sounds like a jet engine, just as everyone else says. It does a pretty solid job cooling and has a digital thermostat, but that still doesn't make up for the noise. If you're buying a window AC to help you sleep when its hot, this unit will make you cooler, but it's tough to actually get more sleep with it on.Bottom line: If you're a REALLY heavy sleeper or cooling a room that you don't actually spend time in, give it a try...lots of good features and cost, but be prepared for some noise. Alternatively, it sounds like some of the lower BTU Frigidare models are quieter this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cools the room, but so loud","review":"I can sleep through anything so it doesnt bother me, but it is tremendously loud (sounds like you are sitting near a wing of a plane) But it does cool my large bedroom with high ceilings.So if noise doesnt bother you and its on sale get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loudest air conditioner I've ever had","review":"This is the worst air conditioner we've ever had. It sounds like 3 hair dryers going at once. I can't even stand to be in the room for more than 15 minutes, and here we are in the middle of a heat wave! The cooling part isn't up to par either. It cools more like a 5000 btu unit. It's going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY LOUD","review":"This has to be one of the LOUDEST air conditioning units I've ever come across. All 3 settings are noisy and difficult to ignore. If you're trying to watch tv or a movie while its on, you have to blast your tv. I'm actually a heavy sleeper and not really affected by noise when I sleep but I could NOT sleep with this AC unit on.It also takes a really long time to cool the room. I honestly gave this product a chance but the noise was unbearable and I'm returning it today. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Never Buy anything from Frigidaire again!!","review":"My brand new Frigidaire unit broke down in one month. Actually I only used it for three times, which added up to 10 hours. For the 10 hours' experience,the A/C makes horrible noise, and didn't cool at all, even if I set the temp to 60 and sat just in front of it. However b/c it was installed exactly five weeks ago,the 30-day return policy from the dealer expires.Then I went through an extremely painful process to talk with the dealer, the manufacturer-Frigidaire and their referral service providers.There will be ABSOLUTELY NO Return/refund nor the replacement is guaranteed. You will have to wait for at least a WHOLE week in your sweats and tears for the techinian to come in. In addition, I don't think their customer service is help at all.I won't buy anything from Frigidaire again for the rest of my life!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, it's loud.","review":"These people aren't lying to you. This thing is unreasonably loud. It's between 10-20 dB louder than its competitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read these reviews...","review":"I'm on my way back to Lowes right now - I wouldn't even dream of trying to sleep with this thing on. I will never buy another Frigidaire product. This is frankly an insult - I can't imagine how any reasonable person working at Frigidaire would listen to this thing for a minute and decide that it was good for the home Market. It makes my bedroom sound like a meat storage facility. I'm going to splurge and buy a Sharp. Live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it would cool as much noise it generates","review":"There are Air Conditioners out there and there are Noise machines.This unit is a very loud noise machine with the looks of an air conditioner.I purchased this to replace an older Frigidaire 6000 BTU that was top rated in Consumer Reports a few years ago. I felt a need for a higher BTU and was sure this model would be a fine replacement as it looks pretty much identical, only more BTU. Major disappointment. Turns out this 8000 BTU does not come close in cooling to the older 6,000 BTU model. Had to return it. Loads of water was pouring out when pulled unit from window.Pros:Compact SizeLoud White Noise (for folks who may need it)Fan PowerRemote controlConsLoud NoiseAlmost no cooling"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this air conditioner!","review":"This air conditioner is so ridiculously loud it makes you want to kill yourself!

I hate this thing!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loudest air conditioner ever!!! Stay away!!!","review":"This is the loudest AC we have ever had!! Stay a mile away.

This card is amazing! The 256MB/128bit DDR make this card blazingly fast for the price. Video and DVD playback is also crystal clear. The card is prone to some slowdown when you're playing a graphics-intensive game like Doom 3, but it still holds it's own against any card and even rivals some of the \\"high-end\\" ones like the FX6800.*A note to those who want a card for graphics-intensive animation programs: You'll want to get a diffrent card. This one was designed for multimedia use (gaming, movies etc . . .) and I experienced major slowdown when using Flash MX 2004. But that is my only real complaint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"With my 450D","review":"Pros:* Very sharp* Auto-focus is smooth and responsive* F2 helps a lot with low-light (but see cons)* Not a white lens so you're not as noticeableCons:* On a crop frame like my 450D, you're effectively at about 218mm. Without any IS, it can be difficult to hold steady in low-light situations, even at F2.EDIT (2012-12-13): Three and a half years later, and now on a 7D, this is still one of my favorite lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon's sharpest prime is better than any 70-200 for a number of reasons","review":"The 135 f2 is probably Canon's sharpest prime. And you know that most of Canon's prime lenses are quite sharp so this speaks to the great quality of the 135.The 135 is better than any of the 70-200 zooms for the following reasons:-It's less conspicuous: it's black instead of white, it's lighter and shorter. This makes it the perfect lens for those people 'grab' shots at the mall or street fair. The people will not be taken aback by you pointing a large lens at them. Instead, they may not know you are taking a closeup/semi closeup of them at all since this lens looks like a wider lens.-It's faster.-It has better bokeh.-It's cheaper than the slower f2.8 70-200.As a semi-pro published photographer, I can recommend this lens. I originally purchased it (and still use it) for headshots (it's great for that) but found that there are a lot of other applications under which this lens excels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Lens","review":"I was expecting a great deal from this lens, and it exceeded all of my expectations.The build quality is top-notch; everything feels rock-solid and the focus ring is very smooth.Image quality is out-of-this-world. This is definitely one of the best-performing lenses in Canon's line-up, period. Color rendition is superb, contrast is excellent, and the sharpness is simply stunning. I don't think there is a sharper Canon lens under $6000.I would list downsides of this lens, but I really can't find any. If you need a high-quality fast telephoto, this is one of the best options available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bokehlicious","review":"This is by far my favorite portrait lens, the colors, the bokeh, the sharpness, the bokeh. I am not a pro and I cannot afford 85L so this lens did the job for my ridiculously expensive hobby. The focal range maybe a bit odd to get used to but the IQ blew everything out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun to shoot wide open","review":"I sold an excellent 70-200 f4IS to buy this lens. I loved that lens for the sharpness and versatility, but I have no regrets with this one. So far I have shot this lens exclusively wide open at f2. The photos I get with it just have a little extra magic dust sprinkled on them by this legendary lens. It truly is one of canons finest lenses.The auto-focus is fast and accurate. The short minimum focus distance allows for close-up head shots. The smaller black body attracts less attention than the big white 70-200, which helps me get easier candid shots. The large f2 aperture blurs the background nicely which helps draw attention to the subject and makes for cleaner, more pleasing snap shots, where you don't have your choice of backgrounds. Thank you Canon for making one of your best L lenses also one of your more affordable L lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lens to get","review":"This lens is exceptionally versatile - from f/2 to f/32. So far its been my main weapon out of my 3 primes. Getting great results on a T2i and cannot wait to upgrade once the 7d/5d refresh is complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great lens!!!","review":"This is the sharpest lens of my 5 \\"L\\" lens collection. Light, smaller than I expected it to be, fast-focusing, and perfect image quality even when I shoot it wide open. The lens is also very forgiving of challenging lighting conditions, such as a strong backlight that my 70-200 2.8 IS lens can't handle. Get one if you can, you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply AMAZING!","review":"Ok I have taken about 2k pictures with this lens now and the only limit is my abilities. I am using the lens with a 5dM2 and the results are breathtaking. The contrast is unbelievable, the sharpness is excellent wide open and only gets slightly better stopped down. The colors are unmistakeable. The bokeh is probably the best I have ever seen.If you are doing portraits, this lens is superb. It requires additional working space, espcially for full-body shots. Thsi lens will allow you to get background seperation that will blow you away.Since purchasing this lens, I have trouble taking it off of the camera. I find myself adapting myself to make this lens work, instead of taking the lens off of the camera.Comparisons:Sharpness: 100mm f/2.8 Macro...but it is a macroContrast: 70-200 f/4 IS is the closest, but I think the 135mm is slightly betterBokeh: NOTHINGYou will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF 135mm f2/L USM Lens Is Sweet","review":"I don't really have much to say other than I really enjoy this lens. It's super sharp and great for low light conditions. You can read all sorts of fantastic reviews regarding this lens pretty much everywhere online. It's also very reasonably priced for a Canon 'L' lens. If you have the spare change, go out and buy one. You won't be disappointed :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, fast, sharp.","review":"The Canon 135L is a lightweight, very fast, super sharp prime portrait lens.

Crystal clear and ultra fast focusing with my 5D3. The boken is fantastic!!! Details are absolutely amazing. My 24mm to 105mm just dropped to second place in my line-up of lenses. When shooting at f2.0, I don't even need a flash in most cases. Well worth the price. The lense is built like a tank. It would be nice if it had image stabilization but I'm not complaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 3 best lenses I own","review":"This is the Canon L Prime that got me started buying a lot of prime lenses. I rate this equal in quality to the 85mm f/1.2 and the 50mm f/1.2. I bought this one first because it was cheaper than either of those and it got me hooked.For many photographers, myself included, 85mm is the perfect portrait length. However, I would argue this is equally good for portraits, and is an equally special lens. Not nearly as fast as either the 85mm or the 50mm, but definitely gives that special quality of tack sharp, perfect, extra vibrant color and high contrast that they have. The three lenses complement each other very nicely.This is consistently one of the most highly rated lenses you will find anywhere and is a perfect fixed focal, short telephoto length.If you're leaning toward buying, just click \\"Add to Cart.\\" LOL. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious content","review":"I'm a public school teacher not familiar with this publisher and author. As it contains references to the Bible and asks children to look up Bible passages, this won't work \\"as is\\" in my classroom, but there are many questions and thought-provoking prompts that I can incorporate into worksheets I've created. Many non-religious questions and prompts are not useful as I find them presumptuous and to be leading kids down one path of thought, not as an exploration of one way of thinking of an aspect of the story, but as *the* way of thinking about it -- not what I'm aiming to teach.Overall, since it's already here, I'll put out some pieces, but if I'd been able to peruse it before buying, I'd pass as there are other guides that are more thoughtful."},{"rating":"2","title":"glassmaster pro combo","review":"Like others, I thought I was buying a mostly-metal product, by virtue of the color of the handle.

The bonnets seem to be of slightly higher quality than the Walmart version (easier to stretch and fit over the head), but it works the same way the Walmart version did. All in all, it does do a great job for someone whose shoulders aren't what they were 40 years ago.

This was because he got it right with the golf while the mystical, metaphysical elements of the story added an extra angle of interest despite being a wee bit hokey in places.This time out, with the sequel \\"The Kingdom of Shivas Irons\\", the golf seems to take a back seat to the metaphysical, New Age stuff, while his portrayal of the Scots comes across as patronising and ridiculous. Indeed, by halfway through the novel one begins to wonder whether Murphy has ever even been to Scotland and experienced anything of the people and culture besides spending time on the country's spectacular golf links.Buy \\"Golf In The Kingdom\\" and enjoy. But beware of the sequel, \\"The Kingdom of Shivas Irons\\", which is unfortunately second-rate and adds nothing worthwhile to Murphy's original vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golf as Integral Practice","review":"This book has everything I could ever want in a book: an engaging story, a shamanic quest, metaphysical speculation and Bill Murray.
