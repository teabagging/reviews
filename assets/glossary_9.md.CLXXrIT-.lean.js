We were afraid to let our feet touch the floor, and we could hear the woman in the next room coughing all night.The section on Paris was definitely lacking in the map department.

In several cities, the book inexplicably listed dumpy places where there were much better options in the same price range. The maps are TERRIBLE, and I would say thet not a single one of the restaurant recommendations was really worth it. Also, there is an attempt at, but no result of, a useful phrasebook in the back, as I have seen in other guidebooks. The book misses several great things, such as markets, walks, and synagogues, among others.

As far as the season goes- Season 7 of \\"24\\" tries to hold interest, by doing changes in characters(namely, Jack and Tony) and also by bringing new character on board. However, every single new character is generic and boring to the ears and the eyes. This also sums up season 7. It tries with a decent opener, but the rest of the season is a snooze-fest. \\"24\\" had a great run, but it has passed its time of death, by two seasons. It needs to end, or I need to quit watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"torture editorial","review":"season 7 is little more than a 24 hour editorial in favor of torture. its proponents (mainly jack bauer of course) are portrayed as strong and wordly, and its opponents weak and out of touch with reality. if one can suspend one's dismay at this very pervasive propaganda, the episode is undoubtedly exciting and much better than season six. hence the two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"24 season 7","review":"The item that I purchased was not what it was advertised.

But since they were able to finish, I was very excited to see the writers tied in the Redemption story with the Season 6-7 storyline, but I was very disappointed that the CTU was dismantled, it was moved to Washington where Jack joined the FBI. However, the only thing that kept 24 interested is seeing Kim coming back from seasons 1-3 and season 5. But the consistency is all messed up this season. Jack Bauer is great as saving evil from hitting the US, the writers have unfortunately repeat the killing random people over and over from about season 6 onward. But towards the end, the story comes out straight and IMO, it's a decent way to close out a season filled with too many inconsistencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick a fork in it . . .","review":". . .

Season 1 was a compelling conceptual start. Season 2 saw the show at its peak, then a slow gradual decline through Season 5, but it was still very good. And then the cliff.

I personally didn't believe it could get any worse than season 6, when I found out that Papa Bauer and Graeme were actually controlling the world. I wanted Jack to repeatedly suffocate the writers with a plastic bag. But in season 7 a dozen African frogmen infiltrate the White House through the basement and slap the female president around. I was speechless. The final blow, however, is Evil Tony. When Larry Craig was suffocated I vowed never again to waste my time with this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Season","review":"Very good season and good looking on Blu-Ray. I had heard many comments that it was like the first couple seasons, in a good way, but I was skeptical. Besides just a few slow spots, this season did not disappoint.We see a maturing Jack who still is a top patriot. Things aren't always what they seem and this season reinforces that to good effect.

Why would I want to buy this season after I just watched it?! I understand that people who want to buy it that don't watch the show on television but for people that do watch it, they won't want to buy this the day it comes out. There is a reason that most season dvds come out in fall, because it has been 4 months or so since you last saw an episode. I've always bought my 24 dvds the month they came out because it has been so long since I watched the show but not this time. I'm going to wait until there is a sale on it for like $20 a year from now. Dumbest marketing move that Fox could have done, imo.

Admittedly some plot points were predictable, but you come to expect that from any TV show.The cover was also far better than season 6 (WTF?) with a long shot of Jack - and the box!Excellent performances by major cast members Sutherland, Bernard, Cherry Jones and Annie Wersching add to the astounding season.Bring on season 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken and not working","review":"I have stated before that when the product arrived the holder for the DVD's was broken.

If germans had lost 1.5 million (half of the their original total strength that attacked russia)men in stalingrad they would not have left much to fight with. It could have been called 'Destruction of Army Group South' but we all know that all the South group was not totally destoyed in Stalingrad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Embarrassingly wonderful","review":"I have been unable to get thru the real Left Behind series. I have tried and TRIED, but the painfully cliched writing is only part of the problem. The events are so ludicrous and bizarre, and what's worse: unbiblical.I've read the Bible cover to cover a few times and have studied eschatology (end times) extensively. Trust me when I say the Bible says NOTHING about babies disappearing from wombs, Tribulation Forces, a Russian war on Israel...omigosh, I could go on and on (how do they come up with this stuff??). For a real examination of end times, read Steve Gregg's Revelation: Four Views. He lets the reader decide through a dissemination of the four main views of eschatology...because yes, Virginia, there is more than ONE view!Anyway, Right behind was a blast to read. It's laugh out loud funny and right on the mark. My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough. Maybe if more characters cried themselves to sleep?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Critique of End Times Loonyness","review":"I am into systematic theology. I own 3 books which delve into the subject matter. I can honestly say that the 'Left Behind' series, while entertaining, certainly does not desearve the hallowed place which it currently resides within American Evangelical Christianity. End times prophecy is simply too symbolic and imprecise to draw any extraordinary conclusions.This book is a breath of fresh air. Right behind accurately hits on all of the fallacies commited by its famous namesake. Not only does 'Right Behind' point out the theological problems in 'Left Behind' but it also points out how poorly written 'Left Behind' actually is.This book had me going back and forth between it and my copy of 'Left Behind'. I checked out corresponding events between the two books and was flabbergasted at how accurate 'Right Behind' pointed out the problems with 'Left Behind'.A great read with some serious theological points, all wrapped up in a hilarious package!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY!","review":"Okay, I admit it, I read the first book in the Left Behind series. It was moderately interesting, but I can't say I was dying to read the second one. This parody is relatively short, and there were about three scenes that just made me roll on the floor! The one in the Christian bookstore was *priceless*, and the author truly captured our crazy Christian culture. There were some cute suprises in the dialogues, things that make you giggle to yourself.Here you find an excellent and thoughtful critique of modern pop-Christianity all wrapped up in goofiness. You will find yourself laughing and thinking at the same time. There was so much potential in this project that I feel it didn't quite live up to. But overall, it was a joy to read, and I even read a few of the scenes out to my husband, who laughed as loud as I did. Those scenes earned this book four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus would have laughed, if this were funny.","review":"Let me set the record straight on two things. One, I am a Christian. Two, I am a Christian who believes that Jesus has a sense of humor.\\"Right Behind\\" pokes fun at the \\"Left Behind\\" series, and the jabs aren't totally unwarranted. Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins should not win any major prizes for a series of books that, despite the compelling subject matter, are written at a sixth-grade level and can be devoured fairly quickly. But \\"Right Behind\\" simply isn't funny. In fact, the writing is even worse than in \\"Left Behind\\", if you can believe it.Had this been a funny book, what a royally funny coup de grace it would've been! Instead, it is flat, lifeless and boring. Not even Jesus would laugh at this dreck, and I'm sure He laughs when something strikes Him funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor...make sure this book is left behind","review":"With all the humor of the *last skit* of the evening on \\"Saturday Night Live\\", this book seems like it will never end. You'll be wishing for the End Times to come soon! There are about 6 pages of excellent humor, packed around pages and pages of repetitive boredom. One bit of humor was the naming of Buff. Unfortunately, it was remarkably similar to a scene from the television series \\"Seinfeld\\" involving George. The actual Great Tribulation itself can't be much worse than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Behind: A Parody","review":"There is a fine line between satire and sneering, and Wilson has crossed it.

This book deserves a -5. If you want to read something worth your time, you'd be better off reading a dictionary. These books are written by men who have no understanding of Biblical prophecy whatsoever and are absolutely clueless to what the end times will be like. The Left Behind series has done so much for spreading Christianity and no Christian has any business reading this filth. I'm sorry if i come off harsh, but mess with my God and ridicule an outreach the He's using, and you'll have to hear the truth. The Bible says that in the last days men will turn away from truth, and wanting to have their ears tickled, will turn to doctrines taught by deamons. This is precisely what we have here. This is heresy in it's purest form, and my advise is to avoid it all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOGWASH","review":"This book ridicules the very series of books that God has given us to use as a tool to help lead others to Christianity. This book is something that I have found useful in helping to bring a number of friends to Christ.

If you read it as literature, it fails at every point. Clearly, its intention is that it be pure genre, but does genre necessitate badness? From the minute you read the protagonist's name, which is right out of soap operas or romance novels, and follow her mannered, mechanical thoughts, you feel that you're reading about purely manufactured people. Even if the ending is a surprise, there is no suspense, because the story and characters are completely contrived, and the writing has all the style of a High School creative writing contest runner-up. If you like this sort of thing, then the real question isn't whether this book is \\"good\\" or not, but are you cheating yourself by allowing the regular ingestion of cardboard?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of the movie!","review":"All in all I really liked this book and have to admit I read it in a day sitting. It was involving and well paced with characters that were well drawn and a plot that moved swiftly. I sorta figured out who did it but Savage has a way of throwing red herrings at you so I was fooled. But I must warn those of you who think the movie is going to be the same. I have read numerous reviews as well as directors interviews and the movie is going to be nothing like the book.

I always wanted to learn how to draw and paint clouds, so when I saw this book I was really excited. I am a novice in the field of Art and this book was no help whatsoever. It instructs you to perform certain drawing and painting techniques, but it doesn't tell you HOW to do them.

Still, a fine work of apologetics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracles by C.S. Lewis","review":"C. S. Lewis is an easy read. This book is not about every day miracles, in fact Lewis would make a case against such things. This is a book about the miracle of the life, death, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. While I do not agree with what Lewis sets out in the book, I suggest that everyone read it because it helped formulate and put words to what I do believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"it seemed circular","review":"Lewis warns about arguments that presume their conclusion in the first few pages. Then -- at least to my reading -- he rejects Naturalism (as he defines it) because it is obvious to him that reason is not \\"natural\\".I also think he was too slick about the \\"Naturalism\\" vs \\"Supernaturalism\\" split that he sets up. At first he admits that \\"Supernaturalism\\" could mean any number of things (say polytheism). Later he basically assumes it to mean/imply his concept of the Christian God. So almost through misdirection, he gets from showing (what he believes are) inconsistencies with one ontology to using that as support for a different ontology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, right title and quantity","review":"I was disappointed that I ordered directly from Amazon and received books that had a different cover than was pictured, were made of poor quality \\"pulpy\\" material and one of the books actually had ~25 pages folded over and glued into the binding!

There are just so many feel-good books available, based only on the sensational and imagined, that it is so refreshing to see a fellow christian author who remains true to scripture and God by taking the unpopular road of truth on topics such as this. C. S. Lewis's works remain faithful and trustworthy for anyone truly looking for truth. In fact, my own writings were in a way inspired by some of the things he wrote merely in passing. I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Argument","review":"The greatness of Lewis' books on theology/God/religion/faith/etc. is that even the most hardcore atheist will come out of these books with something. *Miracles* is full of intelligent thought, brilliant philosophy, witty remarks, and everything that makes a classic Lewis book. This one is no exception.*Miracles* is subtitled *A Preliminary Study* and indeed it does the groundwork one must do before tackling actual miracles; so do not expect this book to be an enquiry into specific miracles with historical details and such: this is more of a philosophical enquiry into the possibility and nature of miracles, what they are, what they imply if they exist, and how they could exist.*Miracles*, as any other book by Lewis I read, is a delicious read. Not one page is dull, not one empty moment. This is one of the few philosophers that I really feel like are bringing something true and important to my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"i-Dog Chill Set","review":"very cute on the dog... but it bogs her down and she has troble moving her head/ears. i love it but i wish it wouldn't interfere with her movents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MX Movie to get you through the long cold winter","review":"All of The Great Outdoors MX movies are well written, have great narration of the racing action, and show some behind the scenes stories that you otherwise would never see.

I thought maybe it was just me, and had some friends try it, covering up the label, and asking them what it was - all four said lemon-lime soda.

In \\"The Nightmare Chronicles\\" he brings thirteen short stories to life in one of the most clever ways I've ever seen. The book begins with what you think is the first story, but it's actually a framework story that continues around each of the mini-thrillers contained here. It's a good story by itself and you find yourself waiting to see what happens next in the \\"frame\\" story as well. This is probably one of the best collections I've read in a long time. There's a lot of variety in style, setting, time periods, subjects and, of course, horror factor. The stories are graphic in ways you don't expect, which takes them out of the \\"wallow in blood and guts\\" type of horror, but the shock value is WAY up there. This book is a great way to get a fast intro to an author who dares to stray from formulaic horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I bought this book after reading some of the reviews here. What a mistake. This book was not at all scary, and it wasn't even that interesting! I only could read about 3/4 of it, not one of the stories ever really caught my attention (in a good way, the one about the child molester was just disturbing) Don't waste your money on this one. I'd rather read the phone book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FRIGHTENINGLY GOOD","review":"What can I say? How do I describe this nasty, brutal collection of short stories? hmmm. Clive Barker dropped acid and became Stephen King. These stories represent a clever imagination at work here.

Mr. Clegg, I am a devoted fan now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, Compelling, Powerful, Hypnotic, Sublime","review":"A book for lovers of stories long or short. A book that is as unorthodox structurally as the plots of these stories. There are no boundaries to Douglas Clegg's horrific imagination, and as far as authors writing books that actually scare, Douglas Clegg is primo. Just wonderful. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven at best","review":"The first thing to note is that whoever wrote the jacket copy obviously DID NOT read the book, so right off the back the reader is mislead. The stories stand alone, and the tie-in to the kidnapped child only serves to disappoint the reader because it is only used as a framework for the stories and is not a crucial plot device, as is hinted at on the back cover. The stories themselves are hit-or-miss, either capturing the reader and keeping them on the edge of their seats, or boring them to tears.Having read THE HALLOWEEN MAN, which I thouroughly enjoyed, I was disappointed with this work by Clegg, and I would not recommend this collection of stories if you are reading Clegg for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weird for me","review":"I chose to read this book for a project in one of my classes. I normally like weird, bizarre books with unexpected things happening, but this one was horrible. My professor read parts of it and told me I did not have to finish the book or do a major presentation like everyone else was expected to do. I guess I am glad I chose it due to the fact I was exempt from the project. I admit, it had me wondering what was going to happen, but it was a sick, sick novel.

After reading all the positive responses, I expected so much more and this book did not deliver. I give Mr. Clegg two stars because of his writing style. Every story has a nice build-up, only to be ruined by confusing and poor conclusions. It's ironic because Mr. Clegg demonstrates a vivid writing style and many of his characters are very interesting. Because of his descriptive ability, I'm willing to give Douglas Clegg a second chance with Halloween Man.

While the writing style is not bad and I do think that the writer has talent the content of this book was just too gross, too bizarre and just plain too weird to be believed. Some of the scenes described in the book were so naseautingly graphic that I just could not continue.Not all of the stories within the story are sickening, a few of them were profound in a macabre sort of way and makes you think but I just think Douglas Clegg went overboard.Think-the feverish, shifting kaledeiscope of your most bizarre dreams.

I may get one of Clegg's novels to see if I like it. If you must read this book, go to the library and get it for free. Then again, this is just my opinion.

The plots are mediocre, standard stuff, bordering on uncompelling. The tone is always hopeless.

I held out hope that I would enjoy this book as much as those - wrong! While there were a couple of good stories (my favorite was \\"I Am Infinite; I Contain Multitudes\\") most of them left me shaking my head. The stories seemed incomplete. Little was explained and I had no idea what was going on. It infuriated me and made the usual joy of reading an absolute chore! Thanks for nothing Mr. Clegg!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"I could not even finish this book. I felt like it was all over the place. I was confused with most of the charactors.

But what did she say?So did you get anything out of that. Exactly: all over the place!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unputdownable!","review":"Clegg cuts to the chase. This collection of short stories is an emotional roller coaster which actually managed to frighten this long-time horror addict.From the very beginning Clegg introduces so many twists and eerie images that it is impossible to put the book down. Clegg introduces us to a kidnapped boy who turns out to be anything but as he shares his vision stories with his abductors. Each story weaves an incredible picture of disturbing images of human behavior (er..mostly human).If you read any horror anthologies, you've likely run across Clegg before, especially the story White Chapel. This collection then is sure to make you a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Bugbug","review":"I am so sorry that I wasted money on this book. I love Dean Koontz, Chandler McGrew, the earlier stories of Bentley Little, Steven King so when I heard Douglas Clegg was as great as them, I thought great a whole new author of books to enjoy. If the rest of his are like this one, I would never read another of his books. They aren't scary, they are nasty. I will not finish this book. I skipped the one about child molester when I found that out and thought I would give him another chance. Then you read about the \\"flower\\". This one is going in the trash. I am not a prude by any means. I loved Desperation by Steven King and that had sexual content but this one is gross. Unless that doesn't bother you, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"creepy and unsettling","review":"Clegg's short stories are a cut above (sorry) most because they rely on atmosphere and twisted psychology rather than blood and gore (though there is a fair share of that here).

I can not offer much of an endorsement for his book. For the times surrounding the turn of the era, Roth depends upon the traditional sources and usually interprets them uncritically. However what concerns me is that for other time periods, specifically the Middle Ages, Roth writes little more than about Jewish persecutions. A history of George Washington or the Civil War or whatever should paint more than one side of the story. Yes, there were persecutions, but there is more to the history of the Jews than that.By omission Roth's book comes across agenda driven."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible read","review":"I am heading to Israel around December and am looking for a book to sharpen my knowledge beforehand.

If you like british comedy or \\"witty\\" humor then this is the collection to get, even if your not big into sci-fi. Earlier episodes can be compared to the \\"Odd Couple\\", in a spaceship though, because the episodes center around Dave and Lister, who are complete opposites, who are also lost in space. If your not a fan of british comedy, than I suggest you rent Red Dwarf first (Netflix has the entire series). I like it a lot better than other british comedies I have seen before.Although I enjoyed the entire series, literally every episode, I do like the earlier seasons (or volumes, or whatever they're called) better. The first season is my favorite. The earlier seasons are really low budget, but that really adds to it all. It makes it funnier!

So, in order to get my Red Dwarf \\"fix\\", I purchased this set. It was offered at a reasonably price, arrived in perfect condition, and will provide us with hours of enjoyment.

There's not one bad episode. The 7th and 8th seasons are (lets be honest) not up to the same standard as the previous six, but even they have moments -in every episode- that crack me up.

Honestly, it's not worth the risk to buy this. The one star reviews range from 2008 all the way to 2011, and I just recently bought it. Most copies are damaged if that is the case (If not all) my guess is that people who have bought it and have reviewed positively they haven't gotten to season VI yet. So buyer beware.

Its contents relate to the wants/desires/lusts of some hillbilly-type folks, and was certainly considered quite steamy when first published, and was still considered fairly raunchy when the sorta-sexy movie was released. The book is an easy read, a glimpse into an arena unfamiliar to many readers, but with characters fleshed out enough so that one could recognize acquaintances in some of them.This edition contains several movie stills that help the mind recall the movie, which certainly wasn't great, but had a good cast and was entertaining in a potboiler sort of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"electromagnetism from continuum mechanics point of view","review":"This is a good book on classical electrodynamics. It is on about the same level as Jackson or the fine recent book by Schwinger et al. even if it perhaps attempts to be more elementary.In stark contrast to Schwinger (and Jackson) it takes a continuum mechanics point of view as fundamental. There are no atoms and no averageing is used to find macroscopic fields from microscopic. This has some advantages but, in my opinion, hides the fact that in vacuum there are only two fields while in media two polarization fields must be added.Many things are very pedagogical and clear in Kovetz book and it is probably a good book to learn from. The book uses SI-units and is unusual in that it discusses thermodynamics and continua more thourougly than its competitors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apparently you're not to say the mass while inebriated!","review":"This book goes through the roles and duties of the priest, from saying mass to hearing confessions and giving spiritual direction and all things in between. Father Garrigou-Lagrange discusses proper and improper dispositions of the priest when celebrating the mass, the proper form of a homily, how to be a good confessor, and how to give spiritual direction amongst many other things. Although I am married (so the priesthood is out for me), I learned a lot from this book and gained a new and deeper appreciation for not only the priest and what he does, but also the mass and the sacraments. Of course, this is a MUST READ for anyone discerning a call to the priesthood and probably anyone who is a priest.

We have other CDs that we've purchased, but this is by far the VERY BEST one of them all. Accordingly, she (and we) enjoy listening nearly 100% of the time.

When we were losing our minds at 6 months after about 5.5 months of terrible nights, we bought this and started establishing a good bedtime routine. It took about a month or so to take hold, but this CD became a part of our nightly ritual. He finally slept through at 7.5 months old and has been a great sleeper ever since.He is FIVE years old now, nearly six. And we still play the CD every night. I love this CD. When he was a baby we kept a copy in the car too to play when he was having some trouble on long trips. It worked like a charm then. We would joke that we would play it when he was 18, and it's kind of looking like that might be true! I have a 8 month old now and I'm going to play it for him as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"As much as she LOVES all things \\"Disney\\", our granddaughter just will NOT listen to this CD (we bought this when she was 18 months, and she is now 26 months old).It does NOT provide relaxing lullabies for a tired, active little girl to take her naps, and is very much not to her taste:Our granddaughter has a strong preference for 'old-fashioned' music/stories, and likes vocals.However, several cuts on this CD mix modern songs with pieces of the musical classics (in the same piece), it is totally instrumental, and has a lot of non-lullabies.Her favorite relaxation IS listening to music: \\"her\\" CDs by Eva Cassidy (\\"Over the Rainbow\\", of course, and \\"Wade in the Water\\"), Elizabeth Mitchell (\\"You Are My Sunshine\\"), and Kenny Loggins (\\"All the Little Ponies\\" and \\"Pooh Corner\\") ...all her listening, of course, must be shared with her favorite blanket (\\"It has WRINKLES\\")BTW, Kenny Loggins worked best for naptime/bedtime music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, My wife and son likes the second album much better.","review":"After having listened to the Second Volume of Disney Lullaby Album (I gave it 5 stars) every night for the past month, I thought it would be nice to give Volume 1 a try to throw in to the mix. This way, we don't listen to the same 14 tracks every night in to the early morning throughout our sleep. It was received quickly as usual, but it was shipped via USPS and the jewel case a slightly cracked. No big deal. The music is slightly different than Volume 2, but it is pure musical lullaby bliss with this and volume 2 combined together. My son kicks away in my wife's womb when the music is played.

And with a baby monitor in our bedroom and living room, we literally hear the faint whispers of this CD constantly. And I still love it. It's perfect for going to sleep. I've even noticed that when a power outage turns the CD player off, she doesn't sleep as well and wakes up more frequently.

I am SO glad I ordered them anyway and I was not disappointed in the least. I would sit rocking my son who was sound asleep with these CDs on just to sit and look at him and love him. I just ordered both of them for a friend who just found out she is pregnant and just hearing the samples made me tear up a little. Now that my son in 16 months old, he reaches over the edge of the crib and pushes \\"Play\\" himself!!! We still sit and cuddle to this music sometimes and he loves it just as much as I do. I HIGHLY recommend both of these CDs to anyone with a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blessing...","review":"I got this CD not really knowing if this would help my (2 yr) daughter sleep. The only thing she is used to listening to in order to get to sleep is her \\"seahorse\\" that plays music for approx. 5 mins. so I was a little unsure. This CD plays almost for 40 mins. and it seems to help her sleep.

Well-written, with many color and b&w illustrations cleverly chosen to enhance the contents. There are the too-often reproduced \\"masterpieces\\", but also several objects of interest not easily accesible to general public. Highly recommended also for lovers of the History of Arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distinguished author, but why?","review":"Upon a recommendation from a professor of Egyptian art, I bought this book in hopes of gaining a basis of knowledge (being completely ignorant of the subject). I must admit I find Aldred utterly unreadable. He inserts commas all sorts of places they should not be, altering the meaning I intuit he is trying to convey and forcing me to reread every other sentence. I think books should introduce concepts inspiring reflection, not writing demanding deciphering. The last straw came when Aldred called a statuary material \\"graywacke (schist)\\"-a laughable conflation of geology. Please, if you want a beautifully illustrated book of Egyptian art basics, read _The Illustrated Guide to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo_: it has a lovely history lesson for each period and object, as well as inspiring photos (lacking in Aldred)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pictures but...","review":"I was disappointed in it mainly because the pictures (which are great) are not well intergrated with the text.

The cons? Very few. The Egypt and Waterloo sequences were much too brief, considering how important they are historically. I saw the complete series on DVD back to back, which is something I rarely do. It was compulsively watchable: thoroughly enjoyable and involving. The Abel Gance silent movie may be more \\"cinematic\\", but this one, by being straightforward, conveys more and is less distracting visually. The minisieries is not a work of art, but it is great entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film neglects meaningful history","review":"This film is more like a soap opera than a history movie. It heavily focuses on a few relationships but badly neglects why the countries were fighting, what reforms Napoleon was making, and why Napoleon was such a great commander.You will learn far more watching the one hour documentary about Napoleon in the History Channel DVD *The Conquerors.* It shows how much this film leaves out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers the \\"E\\" of the A&E","review":"It will keep you thoroughly involved. I felt the strongest performance was Malkovich, even though I do not particularly like him in any role. He made this story carry the tension and suspense that another actor could not have generated. He was ideal for the part.I enjoyed the story and felt it was quite entertaining. I have been concerned that many reviewers have stated it is not a factual account. I do look to A&E for honest productions and have come to trust them. I would hate to learn that they breached that trust in honest film production.If what you want is a strong story that provides all the elements: love, war, action, drama, suspense, and several unexpected twists, then you cannot go wrong with this one. It does deliver the \\"E\\" portion of A&E."},{"rating":"1","title":"A look at His Love Life, and a Dead Tallyrand","review":"I've tried a couple of times to watch this, but always have put it away in complete boredom. The productions seems to be a chronicle of Napoleon's love life rather than a good look at his history; and the re-enactments were good demonstrations of slow-motion technique, but not much else. The Talleyrand character was one of the most wooden performances I have ever seen. He seems to have died before filming even began.Although the bonus features tried valiantly to save this production, the movie was not really worth the discounted price I paid for it. This movie will be one that definitely goes to the library. I can only hope they will forgive me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to look at but no substance","review":"I really looked forward to this. However it left me disappointed. The problem is the person who plays Napoleon.

Lovely to look at but no soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"A distaster !","review":"I'm french and i like history, especially Napoleon's history and i saw this miniserie in France. It's very bad and has a very low budgect felling...the dialogs are poor, they're history mistakes and it seem the more important is the lovestories around Napoleon. Huges evenements like Austerlitz war are just represented by 3 or 4 soldiers riding horses and looking verrrrry bad...!

The acting was almost laughable and the historical facts seemed exagerated or in some cases, outright silly. I have a large collection of DVD's but did not want to put this one on the shelf because it was so bad. I thought I would give it away to a friend, but I thought it was so bad I don't know any friends who would might have liked it- it bordered on the offensive, especially for people who appreciate real non-fiction.I am not sure what made it so bad, but the direction, acting, and questionable historical accuracy could certainly use a lot of improvement. This was originally made for American television, so like much of American TV I believe it was made as cheaply as possible and made to appeal to the lowest common denominator."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FRENCHIES FRIENDS CHRISTIAN CLAVIER and","review":"Gérard DEPARDIEU and THE SPLENDID OTHER FRIEND FOR MYSELF WHO'S JOHN MALKOVITCH (AN OTHER GENIOUS) !!!

By selecting four Nazis who slipped through the cracks of the overwhelming post-war immigration, Howard Blum skillfully details their stories, and the efforts to expose them for living the good life here in America. The detail with which their horrific actions are recounted is ample evidence of Blum's thorough nature and regard for history while keeping the reader mesmorized.

Also, the frame is huge - way bigger than it needs to be - and looks unsightly on a nice paneled door.

It took two people, an hour, and a lot of duct tape just to get this into the door.You're expected to cut down the 'tunnel' plastic (in two poorly-fitting pieces) to the width of your door, however this destroys the lip that catches in the plastic adapter pieces, meaning it won't hold nicely without tape. The adapter pieces don't catch on the door pieces at all, and pop right off without constant pressure. Once you've got it sufficiently secured with duct tape to actually put the bolts through, there is no room even with needle-nose pliers, to hold the nuts in place while tightening... which I suppose is a blessing because if you overtighten it, it'll compress the tunnel and prevent the door from opening.... and the last figure in the instructions shows you taking a hacksaw to the overlength bolts to make it flush. No joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Piece of Crap. Worst Design ever. Buy something else. Anything else, really.

I felt so guilty as I watched him repeatedly try to attach this flap to the door. In all the years that I've known him, this was the first time I've ever heard him swear.

As soon as he heard the food outside the room, he started head butting the locked cat flap. I watched and was happy the flap was holding, however after 30 secs, he started to back up and ram the cat flap with a running start. At this point it appeared the cat flap would break.

Now use 5 minute epoxy to permanently attach them to the outside trims. Now push the small tunnel plastic into one side after trimming about a 3/16 inch piece off of small flat side so it won't pop out.Now nest the whole assembled half into door and measure it so you can cut the tunnel to size.

The plastic brackets *barely* fit, and once I got them on, the slightest bump would cause them to fall off. With the help of another adult, I finally finessed all the pieces together.Then you get to work with the screws. The package comes with 3 lengths, but trying to get the proper length for your door is a challenge. In addition, the nuts are supposed to sit inside a hexagonal recess on one side of the door, while you are trying to push and turn the screws from the other side.

I actually softened one of the inner rings by placing it in boiling water for a few minutes so we could finally force it into place, and we resorted to gluing the inner pieces to hold them in place to lessen the juggling act. Once we started screwing the outside pieces together they cracked - yet it still is not snug against the door in other spots. I guess it does serve its purpose, because now that it is somewhat securely in place the cat can walk through it.

Why would anyone want to cut screws to length glue unfitting plastic to the frames tape pieces together and cut plastic strip to the proper width just to put a cat door together that when you do get it together it still doesn't fit right. I too should have listened to the reviews because every thing said about this piece of junk are true. I bought the regular cat one yesterday and had it together in under an hour but decided I needed the bigger one this took 3-4 hrs of frustration trying to engineer out all there screw ups.

After taping the hell out of it to keep it together and spending a good hour just trying to get that fit, the one white piece doesn't even fit right on one side. SO...unless we keep the flap out, it won't serve the purpose.This is AWFUL construction. And a waste of money we didn't really have to spend but needed to keep the litter boxes away from our living space. Now we need to find an alternative to fit the gaping hole in our door.

Perhaps because of the poor dubbing, this was little better than the many \\"spaghetti\\" war films I have in my collection. While there appears to be a great effort on the producers' part to craft an epic war movie, there is an abysmal lack of contiuity and context. The technical aspects are pretty well executed, with proper uniforms and weapons. Also there are \\"Tiger\\" tank mock-ups based on T-34 chassis as seen in Kelly's Heroes. And those attacking planes(Sokos maybe?) do resemble FW 190s at first glance, all of which make this film all the more disappointing. Some great actors seem wasted, and even the legendary Bernard Herman was off his game with his uncharacteristically bland musical score.

If you love wolves, or animals you'll love this. It has its really touching parts, and teaches a lot about wolves. Unlike normal shows that'll teach to you about animals, this one does it in an entertaining way by teaching it in a story, talking about Lobo's life and all the challenges he has to go through, as a lot of wolves, probably, do to.

I saw this flick as a very young child, and I cried after the movie was over for the death of Lobo's parents even though these deaths took place early in the movie. But the heroics and loyalty of the Lobo and his pack stuck with me for many years and it is one of my favorite childhood movies.these days, the wolves would talk and there would probably be no deaths at all, which I think does a disservice to the dignity of animals: they do NOT talk and they do sometimes die tragic deaths.Lobo's young life is Disney-fied, with cute scenes with other animals which makes it easier to get over the loss of the parent wolves. the story itself and the animals' training is very intriguing.A very interesting film -- bounty hunting for particular animal, ranchers concerned with wolf population, and wolf pack loyalty.The music/lyrics are hauntingly beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lobo, a childhood favorite","review":"I first saw Lobo at the Highland Movie Theater on Central Street (The old and storied Route 66) in Albuquerque, NM when it first came out, I was in the fifth grade.

I'm pretty sure it's all for liability purposes, the pillow itself does not seem very suspicious. Obviously, don't put it on top of the dryer, but how a baby could NOT sleep on this pillow is beyond me. My preemie son loves to sleep, rest, digest and chill on his pillow (he's now 6.5 pounds) and it supports his little body well.

He is a spitter, and has recently been diagnosed with reflux at just three weeks. A recommendation for reflux babies is to allow them to be at an incline after feedings. This serves that purpose perfectly. It keeps the baby warm and snuggly and helps to stop the spitting up! Only word of warning- make sure the baby is centered in the cushion if sleeping.

It was the only way to set him down in the living room with us in a way where he could look around, sleep, etc. as he was too little for a bouncy seat and even the infant seat was awkward for his little head.

Baby fits perfectly nuzzled, but no chance of the pillow covering the baby's face until the baby is old enough to roll over, when unfortunatly you have to retire the lounger.

Truly one of the worst animated series of all time, Filmation's Ghostbusters demands to be relegated to the dustbin of history, not preserved on DVD.Avoid this tripe, and order DVDs of The Real Ghostbusters instead.

The one feature I may miss is the feedback notch filter but I don't think my new acoustic duo will get that loud.

Digital pornography is no more appealing than analog pornography, and no one can look at Ms. Merritt's body for more than fifteen pages max without becoming bored speechless. The end result of Ms. Merritt's efforts is a lame and pretentious collection of photographs that only her mother would be interested in.

There's lots of dated-sounding text that breathlessly uses words such as 'downloading' and 'logging-in', as if they were extraordinarily cool, and although it's not quite as bad as anything by David Hamilton, it's essentially a glorified 'Penthouse' shoot, or an Eric Kroll book but with a digital camera.

I wish that I had read this book before my recent foot injury as I would have known how to better handle my medical care. In fact at the time of injury, I didn't know what to do when I injured myself. Since I didn't know that I was allowed to make choices on my behalf or choose specific doctors I wound up getting inferior care.The best part about this book is the simplicity whith which complicated matters are explained. The infusion of real world examples not only exemplifies the topic that is being described, but also allows you to grasp how situations that are not properly monitered can go wrong. You know that if this can happen to a doctor or someone in their family, it can happen to anyone. I got this book from a friend and feel that the future of my health is better and safer for having read this as I will know what to do when there is a problem.This book is a must for one and all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Survive Your Doctor's Care by Dr. Pamela F.

His knowledge of American history, politics, literature and culture is so slim as to be laughable. Those very conservatives who feather his nest are the very same people who fought tooth-and-nail against the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, which eliminated racial and ethnic discrimination in U.S. immigration policies - and without which, D'Souza himself probably would have been denied the right to be here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect emetic","review":"What a disappointment. I picked this book up because I remember seeing this young man on CSPAN once and thinking he sounded articulate. I was obviously flipping channels at great speed, because I did not have a clue about any of his views. Hence my feeling of revulsion when I picked this book up at a store and perused it. This obviously gifted young man is either completely soulless or else seriously deluded. Apparently there are others like him too. I guess I am naive, as this was something of a revelation to me.I mean I know about the Ku Klux Klan and Dr. Laura but did not realize that such extreme ideology also exists in academia.Last but not the least, my disappointment stems from the fact that I am of Indian origin myself and am ashamed that a young man of foreign descent, who clearly had a privileged upbringing, is so lacking in empathy toward other minority groups who are not so lucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one original thought","review":"Same old sausage, new casing. If you go in for this kind ofwriting, then read any of Ann Coulter's books. At least she's more entertaining in her wrong-headed way. As it is, this book should never have been written, let alone published - at a great waste of trees. Nearly 400 years of American history had transpired before D'Souza stepped off the boat in 1979. Unfortunately, his ignorance of that history and its significance literally leaps off every page. One previous reviewer absolutely nailed it: But for the liberals and civil rights groups who forced an end to racist US immigration policies by the passage of the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, D'Souza probably wouldn't be in this country. And let the record clearly show that those conservatives he so slavishly serves fought this law to the bitter end. This is but one example of his ignorance; this book puts it on full display."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Chris\\"? Why not Adam, Bob, Lisa, Beth?","review":"This book transformed me into a \\"former admirer\\" of D'Souza. D'Souza could have addressed his letters to Bob, Gregg, Lisa, Beth, Adam or any of the hundreds of names that are less divisive and more helpful to the cause that he is attempting to advance in this book. His choice to address the letters to \\"Chris,\\" make a stronger point than the letters themselved do. This undermines the book, the author and the cause itself and has certainly turned me off. I am sympathetic to the cause he is promoting, but much less so after this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Round Arguments","review":"This book doesn't focus on one issue, but tackles a bunch of relevant topics that most everyone can relate to. It provides sound arguments mixed with humor that keep the reader involved. Most importantly, it articulates arguments clearly and provides someone new to conservatism the basic premise of what it means to be a conservative. This is basically a conservative hand book, and it does an excellent job of defining conservative viewpoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"This book is nothing new! It is just the same garbage in a different package. Is this truly what America is about: Conservative vs. Liberal? Anyone who is truly in the mainstream of America knows that the majority of Americans share both conservative and liberal ideas, they are not mutally exclusive. We need less of this either or garbage, and more reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but lacking something...","review":"I was expecting a bit more from Dinesh D'Souza, while the book touches several themes at the core of American Conservatism it was dissapointing in that it somewhat pandered to a style of writing similar to Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter. Basically, it could have had more depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good guide for young conservatives","review":"While reading this I have to admit that I wish D'Souza had written it ten years ago when I was just starting university. It would have saved me reinventing the wheel as a campus activist and learning the hard way some of the lessons he teaches in Letters to a Young Conservative. It's almost a given that the higher the amount of vitriol leveled at a conservative the more spot on they are about the issues and D'Souza takes a lot of flack over what he writes. This book shows you why. His essential points: use the truth, be fearless and never stop fighting. A worthy guide for campus conservatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done, but incomplete","review":"A wonderfully readable summary of many of the key elements of conservatism.

The movie is surprisingly frank about the complexities of these relationships, including sexual complexities, and the end is MOST unusual when you are used to Hollywood endings.Worth seeing for excellent dialogue, performances, etc., but not least the unusual details of the plot, and also seeing (very young) Myrna Loy in a less-than-sympathetic role."},{"rating":"2","title":"A neglected classic","review":"This almost forgotten film is a must-see for the wonderful and subtle performances of Leslie Howard (one of his best ever) and the underrated Ann Harding (she has top billing!) -- and Myrna Loy shows that she can be convincing in an unsympathetic role. Leni Stengel is so good in a small role that I wanted to see more of her, and Ilka Chase is hilarious as a hanger-on.The screenplay is written by and for adults -- little is stated outright, much is implied. I've seen this several times on late night TV, and I've never tired of it. I'm glad I now own the Alpha DVD, which is very good for a 1932 film.Note: the check Leslie Howard receives from his father is for $100,000 -- you can just make out the amount when Howard puts it on the mantel. That's equivalent to more than $1.5 million in today's money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back when talkies had dialogue...","review":"Nice one. Leslie Howard is a lot more interesting in this than he ever was as Ashley Wilkes. Perenially sympathetic Myrna Loy is sexy and not so nice. Ann Harding and William Gargan are quite solid. The dialogue is snappy and great. The acting is first rate. The conflict itself doesn't have so much merit. This is rather a shallow and quickly told story about a man choosing depth over surface. But still the movie is a lot more vibrant than some of today's fare, at once a little bit thoughtful and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story","review":"...but viewing this DVD is horrible. I bought this with some trepidation since it an Alpha studio copy and they are not exactly known for their high quality transfers (IMO) but unfortunately they seem like the only game in town when trying to get these older movies on DVD. Going by some of the other reviews in here saying it is the best Alpha transfer they'd seen, I bought this DVD. The story is top notch. No problem. But I expected more quality than what's on this DVD. Highlights were very washed out to the point where you could hardly distinguish the faces so don't expect even a good transfer with this DVD. Mediocre maybe. Unless I happened to get a really poorly manufactured DVD i couldn't rate this any higher (and that's only due to the story)."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD QUALITY COPY!","review":"VERY BAD QUALITY copy, by Alpha Video of this wonderful movie. Alpha Video should have made it clear that the buyer would have to accept the poor condition issues, to enjoy this product. Extremely washed out contrast, with ghosted images around the faces of the key actors throughout the movie. My DVD player has no evidence of this during similar era black & white movies. Very jittery on-screen display. Looks like they played a film copy, and setup a digital camera to record the image from the film movie screen.

The, supposedly, tragicomic story of the decline of the Wapshot family--father Leander, a ferry boat captain, & his sons Coverly and Moses--left me totally unmoved and uninterested.N.B.--I'm writing this two years later (May 2000) and I've figured it out. Cheever was a master of the short story (see Orrin's review of The Stories of John Cheever) and the Modern Library panel simply rewarded a bad novel in an attempt to acknowledge him as a writer. The book's still dreck, but it makes a little more sense that it made the list.GRADE: D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some interesting characters but way too slow","review":"I'm sorry to say but I just couldn't get through this book. Read about half of it, but I'm not into long meandering descriptions. If you want a plot that will carry you along, this is not the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"often overwhelming","review":"I've got a thing for John Cheever. Surely one of the best American authors of the 20th century, Cheever has written several books that I've never stopped raving about (see the following for confimation . . .)The Wapshot Chronicle is essentially more of the same, more of the short story magic that established Cheever as what he was (and at least to me shall always remain): a magnificent story-teller and stylist who weaved brutal honesty into his poetic tales of tragedy and disillusion. There were passages--pages--of this book that I turned back to and reread not out of confusion or misunderstanding of identity, but simply for their beauty, for the firm, strong images that glimmered in the splitting of the waves crashing in my brain. I couldn't get it out of my mind for a while after reading which caused the next thing I read to suffer in comparison.Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A writer's writer","review":"Cheever is a goldsmith of words, and, if you love language, the sheer pleasure of how he puts them together is enough to carry you though this picaresque family novel. The eccentric Wapshots are as unpredictable and plotless as life, and if they have dull days the author never lets us see them. In this loose, richly inventive account of Leander and Sarah and their sons, Moses and Coverly, Cheever ambles through marriage, lust, loyalty, death, and the eternal pleasures of place. Even the house has a personality: \\"The heart of the Wapshot house had been built before the War of Independence, but many additions had been made since then, giving the house the height and breadth of that recurrent dream in which you open a closet door and find that in your absence a corridor and a staircase have bloomed there.\\" Reading the novel is like constantly discovering such surprises in the lives of seemingly ordinary people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique story, quick read","review":"This is one of those books that follows the lives of a limited number of idiosyncratic people (otherwise known as a \\"character study\\").

Buy it used for a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept waiting for it to start","review":"Let it be known that I listened to this book on cassettes. It may read differently. About 2/3 of the way through, I realized that all the character and place descriptions were there for their own sake. Up to that point, it led me to falsely think we needed to know the information for future reference. This book is not \\"about\\" anything. It follows the lives of a few fairly ordinary people and generally covers ground many other works have covered, but does so with Cheever's style. But when a book is about little other than the writing style of the author, it smacks of self-indulgence. I can recommend Cheever's great short stories, but this novel takes a long time to go nowhere and say things many other writers have also said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Novel from Masterful Short Story Writer","review":"John Cheever ranks as one of the leading American writers of the later half of the 20th Century--but while his short stories are still recognized and read, his novels remain less popular. \\"The Wapshot Chronicle,\\" Cheever's first novel, offers some clues as to why the author remains more known for his stories than his novels. Offering a look at a New England family that declines in prominence and stature as the 20th Century unfolds, \\"The Wapshot Chronicle\\" contains some funny scenes, memorable characters and solid and often lyrical writing. But the parts of this book are more memorable than sum of its plot. Cheever is, as always, a graceful writer. Still, \\"The Wapshot Chronicle\\" shows that Cheever was a better short story writer than novelist though this is still a solid--if not great--work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fine","review":"John Cheever's fine, woven prose is the perfect fit for this novel about an eccentric family living in along the coast of Massachusetts. St. Boltophs is a fictional town, where the Wapshots, a declining though still respected east-coast family reside. At its heart, this novel is about a contrasting pair of brothers, Moses and Coverly as they live under the fading light of their father Leander. Moses is the ambitious brother who marries into money, and Coverly is the sensitive, if a bit timid brother who also falls into a tragic marriage. There are fine moments of writing in this novel-Cheever's attention to voice and detail is among the strongest of American writers. Though this is far from a great book, it is clearly a fine achievement and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you want to read the 'Wapshot Scandal'","review":"Check this book out!

Dicks' classic novel) misses the mark by a large margin. The ludicrous way in which two characters who quite obviously died previously (J. F.

The characterisations of Dave Holden and Deckard are as wooden as Keanu Reeves and the whole thing moves along as though its feet are stuck in concrete.

That isn't frugal, it is fanaticism. I also had a real problem with the writer. In at least half of the comments from people who had written in with tips, she put a blurb beneath them either contradicting their tip or \\"trumping\\" them with a tip of her own.

They said that since their formula is proprietary, they can't tell which pill is which except for the caffeine. I tried one pack but the not-knowing bugged (and frankly scared) me to the point where I sent it back.

I know there are some that shy away from supplements such as this because of concern, as it is not recommended for those who have heart complications, but if you are generally healthy, and accompany this supplement with intense weight training/cardio and a good diet, you will most definitely see results as i have.

There is no increased energy, no increased strength, and let me be on record as saying there isn't even a placebo affect from taking this supplement. The only thing it does do is give me severe heartburn.To the company's credit they do offer a money back guarantee but like anything in life I think it's wrong to consume 2/3's of a product and then demand a refund.

I'm not a big caffeine person, so this is probably why. It did give me extra energy for my workouts, and I never had any problems sleeping (I also made sure not to take it near bed time). I still have the rest and am considering trying it again for a week or two to see how it goes. The amount of pills you have to take was kind of annoying, especially since I have problems swallowing pills sometimes, but it really is a small thing to put up with for the results.It really does seem like a great product, but I guess it depends on how many potential side effects you can deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far only giving me HEARTBURN.

I usually don't recommend another competitors product in a review because it will be perceived as if a the competitor is posting a fake review just to drum up sales - with that said, I am not in any way affiliated with USP Labs, but I highly recommend OxyElite Pro. It works, hands down. You will feel the energy, it kills your appetite, and you will see a difference on the scale and in the mirror.

My wife uses her bike to commute in New York City, usually locking it to a traffic sign pole outdoors while at work. In the one year plus she has had it, the lock casing is falling apart. Rain and the usual drops and knocks of life have caused the round metal housing that surrounds the key slot to fall apart. The lock mechanism itself is no longer in great shape, and I fear it will stop functioning altogether when she inserts the key, leaving her bike locked somewhere unpleasant. Her previous lock was a Kryptonite U-lock, which she had for years until she lost all the keys. As good as the lock is, it doesn't work well without a key. The Kryptonite is more expensive than this, and given her experience, apparently worth it. The extra cable here is a nice extra, but I would prefer a better lock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good so far, but untested","review":"So far, the lock has worked flawlessly. This is my first u-lock so I can't compare. I didn't bother with the mounting bracket since I don't know where it would fit with my water bottle cages. Lock is VERY heavy, shipping weight was 5 lbs. Only gripe I have with it is the cylinder, which I can pull by hand and a small 2mm gap appears between the black padded parts and the silver keyhole cover part.

In the long run this camera will save you so much money, for instence no trips to develope film no batteries if you get the charger and easy to e-mail pictures. The only really bad thing about this camera is the idea of you not getting it. This camera ROCKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money","review":"Bought this camera two weeks later the flash wasn't working. Office max was nice enough to replace it, but now three months later and this one is not turning on. So I call costumer service and find out there is no place to bring it in, I have to pay to ship it out to be fixed. This means waiting an extended period. Do not recommend at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"I use a Olympus D-360 at work and love it. When the D-390 came out, I was first in line to buy one. This camera is horrible. I prefer my daughters $15.00 Barbie camera. It's easier to use and takes better pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS CAMERA!!","review":"I started out with an HP 635, but after a month, decided it was to complicated for me. I found this camera to be very easy to work with- (read the instruction booklet!!). Takes great pictures-even flew over the ocean in a small plane and took great pictures, which I had developed without editing and they were great. Don't need the software, I find Kodak Easyshare the best to work with, and free to download on the Kodak sight.I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants an easy to use, small, lightweight camera that is not looking for PRO pictures. Also, the battery life is great with rechargable batts."},{"rating":"1","title":"life expectancy = ~ a year","review":"I bought this camera about a year and a half ago. For the first few months it was great, some pictures had some color/grainy issues, but the camera did it's job. After it hit the one year mark, i noticed a decrease in the quality of the photos it was taking. more and more were coming out looking overexposed or 'whited-out'. I just took a trip, and 5 out of 18 pictures came out viewable. Not sure how log these are supposed to last for, but this one is heading for the scrap heap."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased","review":"I enjoyed very much the older version , the Olympus D-380. This camera (d-390) does not seem to produce the same beautiful colors that the older version produced. also the quality of the picture shown in the LCD was much sharper in the older version."},{"rating":"1","title":"good while it lasted","review":"I was given this camera as a gift and loved it at first. Easy to use, took nice pictures. However, I agree with other reviewers--the batteries drain in days and the lag between shots was very long. Now (1 1/2 years later), even with brand new batteries, I cannot get the camera to stay on to take one picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly a very good camera except for minor glitches...","review":"Bought this to take photos for my business. Since I don't need anything but small photos and web photos, this seemed like the right price with right amount of functionality. Only things I don't like are: a) setting the resolution to anything besides the default (which is HQ), is reset back to the default after turning the camera off and back on. The manual and menus on the camera do not mention how to make the setting stay after turning off the camera. Noticed another reviewer found an \\"obscure\\" method of making it stick, but I haven't found it. b) the zoom is virtually unusable because the resulting image is significantly degraded from the non-zoomed image. I bought an upgrade memory card (64MB) and got four NIMH rechargable batteries and I'm happy. If you really need a zoom, buy another camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am totally surprised BEST QUALITY! and so less price","review":"I bought this camera with wishes of quite good quality and I didn't know anything more but possibility of doing 2.0mpixels photos, some movies and I've been informed about the outputs only, The price made me ready to buy.And what? When I opened the box and took first photos I was totally shocked of extremely easy and proof photo system. Quality of pictures is very good. The colors are professional, nice and true, flash brights good and ppl look naturally (i had kodak cx4200 which took horrible pictures, ppl's skin looked so artificial)Also ISO is nice, with very bright lens and ISO to 200 is enough and pictures are clear and there is no noise.Everything automatic, and fast shot makes this camera very useful.Very good for ppl who need to have cam on standby, to shot fast pictures, family cam or cam for kids.Very good also for pictures in home. I haven't tried this cam to landscapes, but in home it works just perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange,funny and wonderful.","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed White Palace, Glen Savan's earlier book that was made into a mediocre movie, I was looking for anything else that he had written. I was not disappointed with Goldman's Anatomy. It's funny, poignant and is so well written that many passages deserved to be read aloud. My only complaint is I can't find anything else written by Glen Savan. That's a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"so glad I FOUND IT!","review":"This is the children's album we've been looking for. \\"I Found It\\" is a pretty apt title. The kids adore Brady's tunes and-- incredibly-- so do we. Nothing against Raffi or baby belugas, but a lot of music aimed at kids is pretty hard to take. Some of Brady's stuff, on the other hand, stands up to the best of adult rock. If your own idea of great music is Neal Young or Dave Mathews, you are in for a treat. We stumbled upon this, then went and bought the other albums by Brady. All are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for kids and parents!","review":"We got this CD for our 3 year old son for his birthday and he loves it! He will sing and dance along to the songs and so does my 8 month old daughter. As a parent, it is also easy to listen to this over and over because the music is great and the songs are catchy. Definitely a must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A blind experience","review":"I don't typically write reviews for products, but I just couldn't hold myself back from commenting on this worthless piece of crap. I regret not reading the few reviews prior to my purchase which warned about the video quality. If you are hoping for close-ups of Yngwie's playing, you will be sorely disappointed since all you see is a silhouette washed out by many lights. There are some incredible solos in typical Mamsteen fashion; however Mark's voice is terrible. I absolutely loved him on Trilogy, but his high pitched screams throughout the show are revolting. Other's have said they would transfer the concert to mp3, but I'd have to find a way to remove the vocals in order to sit through the experience again. The only reason why I am forcing myself to kill a small part of my life is because I want to at least feel my few dollars didn't completely go to waste. I ordered Live in Brazil and the Budokan concert before watching this and only hope it won't turn out as crappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome dvd","review":"this live was released unofficialy on the net and am so glad its now on dvdi bought this one cuz i wanted to see it in good qualitythis is a gr8 live with gr8 songs from wteaw...its a must have for every yngwie fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"really good","review":"It's really big and heavy, but very beautiful and unique.Cause it's size, it can't fit in the dishwasher.But except that, it's very gorgeous and practical item for kichen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight into SE History","review":"John Battelle brilliantly lays out the history of search engines in his book The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture.

It has a lot off lessons of how to be an entrepreneur.Second, from the historic stand point i tells very easy haw the internet and the search technology have grow and evolve and hand by hand, because both are the reason why we have an intenet like we have now.Third, the book is a lot of fun and very easy to read, it has a lot of inspiring little story like the story of Altavista or the great Bill Gross, what an enterpreneur.Great book you won't be disapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic","review":"A truly incredible book. I could not put this book down throughout the entire read. John Battelle does a fantastic job explaning the dynamics of the Search Industry and its impact on our lives.He also gives us a good glimpse into Google Culture, the dynamics of the company, its owners, their power and responsibility in shaping up the net and its usage. If you have ever wondered what the big deal is behind Google and the impact search has on internet usage pattern, wait no more to buy this.What are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and well written","review":"A great book about how Search is changing our mindset toward \\"global knowledge\\". The only minor drawback is the apologetic tone of the book when talking about Google as an achievement. Different search systems will appear, thus making this book a thing of the past. But right now, The Search is captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting book but ...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was well written and provided enough information to keep me glued to it. However, I was really hoping to find out more about Google than what would be possible from Google's own PR machine. The early search engine history and the development of that technology is probably the more fascinating part of the book. Which is ironic, since the book is supposed to be primarily about Google. My guess is that the author sacrificed the ability to write about more intriguing and behind the scenes happenings at Google for the almost unlimited access to the founders and the top managers.Overall, this is a pretty good book, but a hard-nosed investigative reporter would probably have come up with more intriguing content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent books about SE industry","review":"i have just begun my career in a big search engine company and bought this book to learn more about the industry. It does not make me disappointed. John described the history of search engine industry comprehensively and you understood what happened to those famous names like Yahoo, Overture (Goto.com), Altavista and Google. Althrough the book was written in 2005, you can visit the author's blog site to continue your research on the new trends of those SE companies. Best choice for everyone who has a interest in SE industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid.

Can only recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It -- Seriously","review":"We are very disappointed with the Google book.We'll skip the exegesis and cut to the chase: the book doesn't tell us things we couldn't \\"Google\\" and find ourselves.The book runs through the company's founding, survival through the tech downturn, and the IPO.The highlight of the book is an anectdote relating the time Page and Brin out-negotiated Sun Micro's Vinod Koshla, who desperately wanted Google to sell out to Excite.Whoopee.If someone other than Batelle wrote it, it'd be a knockout business biography.But in relation to what he is capable of, \\"The Search\\" comes off as a generic, light read.This will be a hot seller for 12-18 months, but that's it.Save your twenty dollars and instead go Google Google.Take our word for it -- you won't be reading this one in business school 5, 10, or 15 years from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant story telling....","review":"I did found some interesting pages..! However major part of the book (to me) is irrelevant story telling. Neither commercial nor technical nor informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, detailed, account on the foundation of how search became what it is","review":"This book provides a great review and account of the history on how the foundation of 'search' became what it is.From original information retrieval technology, to modern day search the reader is taken on a journey from dorm-room technology to startup company with all the situations and decisions that search pioneers faced, in the early days of search to what is now the status quo.As someone who has grown up with search, this is a great read of how search evolved and provides a great backbone for understanding the relationships of the various companies involved. This is a must read for those in the SEO/SEM industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret to Google's success","review":"I have always wondered how Google made so much money from Advertising alone. This book helped me answer that question. BTW, I have recently changed the job from being a moribund corporate IT developer to being an engineer at Google. Reading this book was my first attempt at understanding my employer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction to Search Engine Technology and Potential","review":"You probably use search engines to find information. If you already understand how one search engine varies from the next, this book will be much too simple and limited for you. Avoid the book.If, however, you choose which search engine based on how cool the url is for that engine, you should read this book. It will tell you a lot that can help you find better information . . . and what you may be able to look for in future search engine improvements. If that's your main reason for reading the book, you'll find it too long and involved for that purpose. There's an awful lot about the history of Google . . . which is essentially ancient history by now. I graded the book down from this perspective mainly because it takes Mr. Battelle a long time to get the simplest ideas across."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Search Is Over - The Common Man Can Understand The Search - Bravo Battelle!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Thank you John Battelle for writing this book! An excellent read that is not only inciteful and revealing enough for the die hard techie but also interesting and understandable enough for the barely computer literate. It is obvious that knowledge and detail that Battelle brings to this work could only have been gleaned by an insider. He lays out the story of Search and Google in such a clarity of detail and thoughtfullness that it draws in even those who would otherwise have no real interest in computers or the internet. A truly wonderful first work."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Do Search Engines Work?","review":"I had long been intrigued by the ability of search engines to quickly lay the world's knowledge at our fingertips and wanted to know how they worked. This book well explained the intricacies of search as well as the economics, ethics and future of the field. Certain computer terminolgy is never explained for the uninitiated--a glossary would have been useful. However, these do not detract from an excellent coverage of the main subject. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Relevant Today","review":"So, maybe reading this book 5 years ago would have been very informative. By now, we all know Google well and also the story of how it came into being.

I have long benefited from the hardback version of Dabney's Systematic Theology and highly recommend it, I can not recommend the Kindle version. The formatting is horrible, random different fonts sizes, HTML links in the text, no linked table of contents so the navigation is difficult, it is painful to use. Get the hardback version, it will enrich your understanding of the Christian religion but avoid the Kindle version."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Height of Western Scholasticism","review":"Dr. R. L. Dabney's Systematic Theology represents the height of western scholastic theology, the logical conclusion of the theology of Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas. The arguments are remarkable, the logic is impeccable, and theology is hideous. Dabney was influenced by extreme reductionism and the essesental denial of any Mystical Attribute in our Pre-Eternal Creator. If one wants a complete, accurate, and unbiased Christian Theology uninfluenced by medieval Catholic theology, may I recommend An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith written by St. John Damascene in the Eighth Century, which is available freely online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book In more ways than one","review":"This book was a true inspiration to me as a beginner. I am inspired to better my skills to do justice to some of the more complex patterns. My only problem with this book was the lack of directions for larger sizes. Most of the patterns gave directions only for sizes up to medium. Unfortunately I am not good enough yet to adapt patterns for smaller sizes to fit my L/XL body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on Mysticism - A Favorite!","review":"This book by Father Carter is an amazing book! It gives a great view and much insight into mysticism and the mystical state. It does focus primarily on ordinary mysticism, but in many of the same ways ordinary mysticism is like classical mysticism (visions, etc...)Great overview and insight into Mysticism. Would strongly reccommend it to anyone looking into Mysticism etc. Father Carter himself was a mystic with a doctorate in Theology I believe. He was a Jesuit Priest and recieved many messages from Jesus and Mary. He was a very holy Priest.To view some of his other writings and the Ministry Jesus had him start, go to SofC.org . It is a ministry very devoted to Spreading Consecration to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, helping the fulfillment of the Fatima message, and praying for/helping the Priests, the Church and the World."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring piece of work","review":"Although I could discuss their definition of Knowledge Management (KM) and therefore the distinction they make between KM and benchlearning, I found this book very, very inspiring! It provides the background to support the theories and offers a process organisations can use to incorporate learning through examples on their culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing and Entertaining!","review":"One of the rare gifts of good writing is an honest voice. In Alex Wellen's \\"Barman\\", you can hear his raw voice as he struggles through young adulthood and the modern rite of passage for law professionals, the bar exam. I laughed out loud, sat horrified at the inner workings of the male mind, and cheered his successes. I'm not a law student, I'm not connected to the legal profession, but none of that matters. I adored it and bought one for my brother who struggled through law school and then he sent his fellow law school grads Wellen's book. They all adored it, laughed and winced through it. I don't take the time to write reviews, but this one merits it. You'll enjoy Wellen's tales and cheer on the victories of the every-man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SERIOUSLY, HOW CAN YOU GIVE MORE THAN 1 STAR?","review":"I just finished 3 years at a reputable 3rd tier.For those of you thinking of purchasing this book, let me just tell you something quickly:Mr. Wellen uses names for his Mommy and his Daddy in his autobiography. He calls his Mommy \\"the Oracle\\" and his Daddy \\"the Optimist.\\" These names occur in his book about as often as the words 'the' 'and' i.e. alot. Now imagine switching these names back to their original meaning i.e. 'Mommy' and 'Daddy'Now further imagine, someone complaining, whining and crying that they came in 2nd place instead of 1st (out of a rat race of hundreds of thousands).What you are left with: Alex Wellen complaining to mommy and daddy that he isn't at harvard. (If a 3rd tier wrote a book, it would be more compelling and accurate of law school.)Sorry Alex, better luck next lifetime, for now you will have to just settle for $300,000 a year instead of $310,000. And read a real story like 1L"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read if anywhere near taking the bar!","review":"If you are a neurotic 3L fast approaching the bar like me, this is NOT a good choice for leisurely reading! Heck, if you are at any stage in law school, pre-bar experience, this is probably not a good choice. It will freak you out. Like crippling, must hide the book out of my sight NOW fear! There are detailed descriptions of how many hours a day he spent between BarBri and individual studying. There are detailed descriptions of the actual essay questions and how he approached them. We all know the bar will be tough and I found out that reading pages and pages of someone else's experience was not a healthy choice for my mental well-being. Maybe when I have passed the bar, I can pick this book up and chuckle about that rough patch in my life, but right now... I'm not mentally stable enough to handle that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Me too!","review":"Alex Wellen wrote an inspirational, educational and very funny book. I'm glad I bought it. More? I laughed out loud (rare) and cried (not quite as rare since starting law school). I found validation (everyone is afraid of the Bar) and community (Alex lived through Madison's beating and so will I, dammit!). With a family as supportive/beautiful as his we would all come to the understanding that becoming an attorney CANNOT dictate our \\"place in the universe\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riotously Funny and Oh, SO True!","review":"I finished this hysterical offering from Alex Wellen in one splendid, heartwarming, cringe-inducing, riotously funny afternoon that left my sides hurting from all the laughter. What makes this book so wonderful is that the humor is so organic to the story; as probably any lawyer could tell you, it is representative of a seemingly universal experience for all members of the bar - the initiation ritual known as the Bar Exam. Wellen's recounting of his early experiences preparing for that endurance test, nervously awaiting the results, and anxiously attempting to please his new bosses in private practice is told with an easy, graceful familiarity that doesn't presume too much, and an achingly honest tone that makes you cringe right along with him, even as you realize you're laughing aloud (but *with* him, not *at* him!). Simply a fantastic read. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"the way organizations should be run","review":"This is an excellent book detailing a system that is philosophically, theoretically, and methodologically sound. It details common problems in organizations, examines the practices that maintain these problems, and offers a system by which they may be addressed. The only trouble with it is that it wasn't proofread that well and, as a result, may at times cause confustion with the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVDs!","review":"I highly recommend watching these DVDs!

Even if you've used this before, READ the directions! Now they say to apply to DRY hair. I didn't read first, so I wet mine. That's probably why-- the one time I used this-- it seemed thinner and dripped more. Also, color was still coming out when I wet my hair the next morning, so you may need more water to rinse this out. I'll have to see if that happens again. The color is dark, with a little hint of some reddish brown. Maybe over time, that lightens; right now there's nothing \\"golden\\" about it. On the plus side, the enclosed conditioner is still very nice; and now you get a second packet of conditioner to use two weeks later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good Covering gray","review":"This didn't cover hardly any gray and I don't have a lot but they are all in front and this didn't cover them.

Bright, intense brass. Nothing like the old version. It turns out that the new instructions were misleading. Do NOT use on DRY hair. Use ONLY ON DAMP HAIR. If you use on dry hair, your hair will absorb too much pigment, and it will be even worse if your hair is previously processed or has chlorine damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not wash out of your hair!","review":"This color is great if you don't like using harsh hair dyes, I'll give it that, but when it comes to washing out, it DOESN'T. Even when you're only doing the \\"root touch ups\\" like they suggest IT WON'T WASH OUT EVER. I have dark brown hair and my hair has been stained black. Since it's not like the ammonia hair dyes, it doesn't come out with Loreal color fix and bleach...well bleach is horrible, but it's what I'm going to try next to get this out of my hair, because I refuse to pay someone at a salon $300 to fix it. I know I may end up with no hair if I do that, so please don't lecture me.

They don't irritate my scalp as long as I don't wash my hair right before, they don't seem to damage my hair, the smell isn't bad at all, and there isn't an obvious line when it grows out.As for the color . . . I'm naturally dark blond so I wanted something to darken and deepen my color a bit so my hair color isn't so completely neutral. This color really means GOLDEN light brown. It's not to dark but with my already blond hair it made the color an unnaturally golden/coppery brown. It's not offal so I still ran around with it for a few days but it's not what I wanted either. For natural blonds I would recommend sticking with the other 2 light brown colors Tweed or Suede. If I were a natural brunette I WOULD give this a TRY if I wanted to ad some golden radiance to my color. I bet on a brunette this color would ad some beautiful depth and shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Washed Out","review":"I absolutely love the color however it washed out in a weeks time.

Worst hair color product we have ever bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect color!","review":"I have a very pale complexion (\\"cool blue\\") and this is the perfect hair color for me. I've tried other medium brown shades from Clairol, and this one is by far my favorite. It does make my hair a dark and cool brunette but it does not turn it *black* as I've heard others say. Use it if you have a \\"cool\\" complexion but don't if you have a \\"warm\\" one; there are better browns suited for warm skin tones. The color itself has faded a little bit after about three weeks, but that's about the amount of time it is advertised to stay so I can't really complain. Overall one of the favorite self-coloring brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why change something that was wonderful!","review":"Why did you change your formula!!

I don't think I'm even going to use the booster because my hair is basically black using LIGHT golden brown, and it didn't cover my greys at all. The only reason this stuff gets 1 star is because the conditioner is nice, but they don't give you enough (I had to use the whole bottle for my hair, and it says use 1/3) I have long hair and one box of Herbashine is plenty to do all of my hair, I could have used a second bottle because this did not cover all of it thoroughly. Needless to say I'll be switching back in hopefully less than 28 shampoos."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"This is NOT the same product as it used to be. Now, turns hair dry and frizzy.

Simply the best!","review":"My story: A disastrous coloring job by a \\"professional\\" hairstylist, turned my light brown highlighted hair into a muddy, oversaturated, and dull mess. To spare myself more stress, I choose to to damage control myself. After using Color Oops, which removed all of the dark color, but left my hair bright orange, I applied protein filler for 20 min. and then used Sandalwood. It turned my hair into a shiny, healthy, non-brassy or warm, light-brown, hazelnut color. My highlights are also still visible. I feel really pretty again and received many complements reassuring the coloring success! Thanx to Clairol Natural Instincts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Find Shade","review":"Thank goodness for Amazon! I am hooked on this non-permanent shade (ebony mocha), perfect for my darkest-brown-not-quite-black mane. Dark browns usually end up red on my roots, and soft black looks too gothic for my light to medium skin. Non permanent is perfect for covering up greys without damaging your natural hair. I hated the effect of permanent dyes, which tend to grown out spotty, and leave the dreaded roots look. This product blends seemlessly into your natural hair and lasts for about 4 weeks, but I stretch it to 5. CVS and other popular drugstores don't carry Ebony Mocha, so I've resorted to buying the three-pack on Amazon. I pray that Clairol doesn't discontinue it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Washed out way too fast","review":"I used this product to color my daughter's hair, she had never colored her hair before, and we didn't want to use permanent color.

I loved the original formula. The color was excellent and the conditioner was the best (wish I could have bought it separate it was so good). I bought the new 10 min formula to cover my gray with Black and my roots are brown! It is too ugly. I now have Brown roots and the rest of my hair is black. I don't like it at all. I don't understand why the formula changed. Why won't Clairol tell us the reason? Was the original formula hazardous to our health? If so, does this mean the new formula is even worse? The 10 min formula is deceptive. It does not color my hair to color I expect. I will not use this formula ever again. As a matter of fact I think I may be afraid to use even the original formula if I ever find it again. So long Clairol and thanks for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color refresh ruins the product","review":"I am not willing to pay the extra money for the product's change to include the color fresh packet.

I also found the instructions for the color boost to be confusing, since I had no idea what it was or how it worked. It didn't seem to be any better than any other coloring I had used before, and, maybe, not as good. Lastly, it LEFT STAINS ON MY PILLOWCASE! There is now a section of my pillowcase that is stained with a brownish (Lighter than the color in my hair, thank God) area where my head had rested during sleep (and, yes, I rinsed it VERY well). I have NEVER had a hair color leave color on my pillowcase before. I was shocked to see it, and VERY annoyed. I HAD a subscription for regular deliveries of this product, but I cancelled it. I won't use it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the color but Amazon sent OLD version","review":"Love the toasted almond color of natural instincts! I always get compliments on my hair color. But I ordered this from Amazon specifically because the new version was listed with the 2-week color refresher included in each box. I was sent the OLD version though. Just a head's up to others who might be ordering hoping to get the new version."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Formula is Lacking!!","review":"I agree with those who say the new formula is horrible. I have been using this color Cinnaberry for at least 15 years. It was my go to color if I was feeling like a change. The most recent application left my hair clown red and horribly dry. Dont even touch the refresher packet becasue that is a joke. It totally changes the color and makes it even more orange! It used to last me a few weeks before fading. It lasted a week and started to fade. I dont know why they have to change formulas. If it isnt broke Clairol, dont fix it. I did my research and found a color that is exactly like the old Cinnaberry.

The impression offered is that Cagney is really just a victim of his environment and circumstances, that he's a good guy at heart. He falls in love with a girl from Mineola, though of course the match can never work. Bogie's role is very straight-forward: he's a sadistic killer. Cagney, as always, brings more to his role as Eddie Bartlett than expected - the bad guy with the good heart who finally does the right thing at the end. The bright, tough-guy dialogue is sparkling. The movie is very good; even the nightclub singing by Priscilla Lane, Cagney's flame, is good - MELANCHOLY BABY and IT HAD TO BE YOU in particular. Gladys George gets to say the classic end-line over Cagney's dead body lying on the church steps in the snow: \\"He used to be a big shot.\\" Definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Roaring Twenties","review":"I'm a James Cagney Fan and this movie was one of my favorites.If you like ganster movies or James Cagney,I strongly suggest you see this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Table of contents","review":"How can I buy this book online, when you don't display the table of contents?

If you do get the grease pumping under no pressure situation (through an open zerk) it will stop when you push the bleeder valve.

AIR POD can tell the exact second you leave the top of the kicker and measure your airtime until you land. Me and a friend of mine had a little comp to see who was going bigger off the same kicker and the most air I was able to get was 3.45 seconds. Even when we didn't totally stomp the landing or washed out a little bit, the AIR POD still recorded our air time perfectly. The strap was a lot more comfortable than I thought it would be and the light made it easy to check my air even when it started to get dark out. The last couple of seasons all I did was hit the rails and boxes, but those get old. Getting an AIR POD really makes getting air fun again.

I only have to assemble once, I vacuum weekly. I would put the attachments higher for convenience and would make it quieter.

I have tried repeatedly to purchase extra filters for the upper tank since it clogs up so quickly and was told today that they are unavailable and to try making my own using foam! The vacuum is out of commission as long as this filter is drying and if you use heat to dry it faster it will fuse the filtering components and become ineffective, the belt just broke on my vacuum and it is difficult to remove the bottom of the vacuum to replace it once you manage to find one to purchase.

Trust me I researched for a week or so before I decided. I got the vacuum within 2 to 3 times vacuuming the belt broke. Called Bissell and got a replacement. After only about 20 - 25 times of vacuuming a 700 square foot apartment the brush melted inside of the vacuum. When this vacuum is in the upright position the brush still spins; which makes it impossible to use the hose and attachments, because it heats up and then melts.

I have only used it for a couple of months and the red light is stuck on all the time. It picks up very little dirt. I vacuum several times a week because I like a room to be clean with vacuum marks in the carpet and this doesn't even make a dent in the carpet. Save your money. I am hoping I can get my money back.

If you decide to use the hose get ready for a wrestling match because its so hard to pull out and put back, and I cant tell you how many times the hose have fallen off during vacuming due to the fact that the slot thats suposed to hold it up on the vacume is not tight enough and their is no way short of duct tape to tighten it.

Suction wand deploys easily and will reach my ceiling for cobwebs. Vacuum will balance on the stairs. Noticably more quiet than a Windtunnel. Works well on bare floors as well as carpet. And that transparent dirt container is just fabulous, esp. for those of us who like to see our work product.:-)I used the turbo brush on hand hooked rugs and to delint clothes.

It turns green when the floor is completely clean. No more bags!!! It's super easy to empty the dirt and clean the filters. There are three filters instead of the typical two, allowing the hepa filter to last a longer period of time before replacement is needed - another plus! The turbo brush is my favorite part of this vaccuum. The turbo brush has a self spinner, making vaccuuming the couches and drapes a breeze. The only down side to this vaccuum is that the turbo brush clogs easily, and you have to take the brush apart to remove any pet hair that clogs it. This is the best vaccuum I have ever owned.

Its heavy and cumbersome and does not last long belt wise. I have to replace the belt every two months or so.All in all not a very low maintenance vacumn. if you just have light vacumning and not dogs that require daily vacumning of the house then its ok.

I purchased this vacuum after going through a Hoover and a Eureka before that. I was so amazed at how much dirt was in the cup when I used it the first time. I empty the cup every time I vacuum now just so I can see how much dirt it picks up and this is coming from someone who would wait until a vacuum no longer had suction before I would empty the bag. I noticed one reviewer complaining about emptying it and I have to say that this vacuum is by far is the easiest to empty and like I said, I empty the cup every time. I also want to mention that I have a toddler and two dogs that I am constantly picking up after. The only con I can see is that it doesn't clean hardwood floors very well but I've never owned a vacuum that did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use/Works Well","review":"I've only recently purchased this vacuum and so far I am very pleased with it. The suction power is great and the machine is very easy to use and was easy to assemble. The dusting tools work extremely well also. It is true, as some other reviewers have mentioned, that the body of the vacuum collects dust. However, I also find that the filters on this machine work well in terms of minimizing allergic reactions while vacuuming. Another plus is the very long cord, which means that you can easily vacuum several rooms without changing outlets. I'll update this review to reflect how the vacuum holds up but, so far, I would highly recommend it.

Would not recommend at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever","review":"Well, I just finished the first pass of my home with this new Bissell. All I can say is I was AMAZED at what this machine pulled out of my carpets. Now, granted the fact that my Kenmore died about a month ago and I have been just getting by with an old Hoover Canister; however, this thing would suck the kernels off an ear of corn. Fantastic power & relatively quiet for all it does. Yes, be prepared to empty the collection canister frequently, but just looking in it will give you an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. It may also convince you that you are not going to make the cover of Good Housekeeping. Does a number on pet hair and my carpets almost look like they were shampooed. The Red/Green light is actually a cool gadget and pretty effective. I assume that my next pass around the house will not yield the same amount of dirt now that I am in \\"Green Light\\" status.Bottom-line: You cannot beat the quality & performance of this vacuum for this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"First sucks...then stinks!","review":"This vacuum worked well at first, but there is something wrong with Bissell's belt system (we've experienced the same problem TWICE). After a few uses the belt slips and starts to burn through it's own housing. Once it's burned through, it can't stay where it's supposed to and continues to smoke and burn in other places. We've stunk up our house enough and will not be buying another Bissell vacuum. Your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people with pets or kids","review":"I bought this vacuum cleaner for my vacation home. I only use this vacuum cleaner once a month but after two years, it started to lose suction. Pet hair and small pieces of paper (my kids love to cut little pieces of paper) would clog up the corrugated pipe so I took it apart to clean it all out. Even after the cleaning, the suction is not strong enough to dislodge the pet hair or the paper from the bottom of the pipe into the dust bin. This was not a good vacuum cleaner for people with pets or kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, i guess","review":"sounds like a great concept, that's why I bought it. It's the darn canister that has to be emptied all the time. Then you have to wash out all the parts... and wait for them to air dry.... I'm sure I get more dust in the air with this thing than the old fashioned bags.oh well..... live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this vacuum!!","review":"I have had this vacuum for approximately 4 months and it has been nothing but trouble. It does have excellent suction however, I spend more time replacing the belt or taking the entire thing apart to dislodge a clog in the tubes that consists of nothing larger than lint and hair. When the tubes get clogged (which is very often) the only way you can tell is that instead of sucking the dirt into the canister it blows it all over the room. This is the worst experience with an appliance I have ever had. I will NEVER buy another Bissell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"EXTREMELY LOUD, doesn't suck all the dirt up, quite heavy and has a burning smell every time we use it. I would NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This vacuum is a cheap piece of garbage. I loved it when I first bought it until it broke 1 month after purchasing. Bissell did send me another machine, however this one broke too about 6 months later. So in less than two years time I am on my third machine and guess what - IT'S BROKEN AGAIN!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bissell Failure","review":"I got about 20 house sweepings out of this thing before it broke down. I also previously got a bissell steam cleaner and I got 2 cleanings out of it before it broke down. Both products did fine while they were still working, but if you plan to live more than 6 months - DON'T BUY BISSELL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two years and still going...","review":"I love this vaccum. The suction remains and it really does a good job. One of my problems was I would run out of vacuum bags and wait until they arrived, or I went out to buy more. This vacuum is excellent for rugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance for the Cost","review":"I was ready to buy a Hoover Windtunnel vacuum and read the reviews on Amazon and they were not very good. I saw this vacuum and the reviews were so positive and it was quite a bit less expensive so I decided to try it. I have never owned a bagless vacuum before and I think this one has definitely reduced the dust in my house quite a bit. I love the turbo brush for vacuumming my stairs and I love how all the attachments are right on the vacuum and the extension hose is already attached. It makes it very quick and easy to switch from normal vacuumming to using the attachments.The only petty negative things I have noticed is that the vacuum puts out quite a bit of heat as you use it and the cord is attached on the right side. I am right handed and like the cord to be on the left so I can hold the cord w/ my left hand and push the vacuum w/ my right."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Miracle Worker","review":"This is a great vacuum cleaner for the price. After almost five years of using an old Hoover, this vacuum cleaner came as salvation. I never thought that a single vacuum cleaner can come close to performing the feats this one so easily does. My old vacuum cleaner struggled to pick up dust. It was completely useless when it came to pet dander. Since we have a golden retriever, our rugs were constantly filled with an over layer of pet dander. We thought that no vacuum cleaner could fight off a shedding dog. Though the odds were stacked up high against this vacuum cleaner, it proved itself within minutes. First, it was incredibly simple to assemble. More importantly however, it did miracles in our rugs and I'm sure it can do so with carpet floors. It's also bag less, which is so a huge plus. It's definitely a marvel of modern technology. Two thumbs up to Bissell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible waste of my money.","review":"I purchased this vacuum back in January and was at first quite impressed with its cleaning abilities. It picks up dirt and hair very well. My carpet looked much improved after vacuuming for the first time with the Bissell. Two to three months after purchase, the brush rolls began to sieze up and stop spinning on a regular basis, causing them to break. I became diligent about cleaning the hairs off of the brush roll after each use, which is very inconvenient but I wanted to make the vacuum last. Even so, the brush rolls continue to break. I have gone through four rolls in a seven month period. I have spent on brush rolls nearly what I spent on the vacuum purchase itself.A woman at the local vacuum store told me that Bissells don't handle long hair well. I wish I had known! So, long story short: Yes, this vacuum picks up wonderfully, but if anyone in your home has shoulder length hair or longer, or pets, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to see and follow.","review":"I am 6 months pregnant and trying to do this yoga workout and the problem is this: The beginner position gets a full screen of the instructor doing the moves, but the advanced gets a tiny little square in the corner of the tv. I am not a beginner to yoga but it was difficult for me to follow. Also they kept going back and forth with fast shots and only showing the beginner in cycles of many different moves. Adding is the fact that my balance is already off bcs I am pregnant it was annoying to keep looking in the bottom corner of the tv, it kind of threw me off balance. Also she keeps saying left leg even in cycles when she is using her right leg. It's very difficult to hear her as it is, her voice is barely a whisper and it has an accent so this added to the constantly moving screen shots and tiny advanced square made it very difficult to follow. And the last thing I need when I am 6months pregnant is to be annoyed. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"She goes way too fast on this DVD. Not only does it make it difficult to follow her, but you don't get to enjoy the poses or the stretches. It's difficult to understand her directions--so you have to watch her rather than listen. You can't do the poses and watch her at the same time, making this DVD completely worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too long!!!","review":"Have been doing intensive yoga now for several years. Was looking for a more moderate version during my pregnancy. This yoga flow is nearly 2 hours long - way too long for me when I am tired! And very repetetive. I now just go to the last 20 minutes and complete some of the stretches good for pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped for better","review":"I really don't want to give a bad review, but unfortunately have to.I am now 20 weeks into my pregnancy, and still work out regularly (jogging, swimming, pilates, yoga, dance...all of which I did previously). I bought this DVD in conjunction with The Perfect Pregnancy Workout 1. Considering the fitness experience of the instructor (former acrobat for Cirque) I hoped that it would be a challenging workout that adhered to the safety needs of a pregnant woman. I was disappointed.While safety is definitely addressed (in the intro), the workout is lacking. Instruction during the workout is poor and the yoga moves lack flow and organization. Beginners would have trouble following the workout, while advanced exercises will fail to find this much of a workout.Unfortunately, I would not recommend this dvd. If you are wanting to try out one of the Perfect Pregnancy series, Volume 1 is a better purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more","review":"I bought this workout because of the great reviews for Vol. 1, but I was very disappointed. The actual workout is only 17 minutes long. The yoga poses are rushed. There is no time to breath into the stretches. There are many modified poses so that you can choose your level. It is amazing what this woman can do with her pregnant body. There are some unique poses that I haven't seen in other pregnancy yoga workouts. But, I was disappointed with this purchase. I do not want to have to pause every pose so that I can get a good stretch, and at least 30 minutes of a workout. I don't recommend this yoga workout to anyone. Save you money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much for 3rd Trimester","review":"I was looking for a more relaxed workout to ease my sore joints. This DVD was way to much for my 3rd trimester body. She moves so quickly that your body just can't adjust. It left me lightheaded and disappointed that I couldn't keep up. I prefer Shiva Rea's yoga DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fan","review":"When you put this yoga DVD in, you better know what you're doing without looking and be ready to rush. The instruction is lacking and the split screen view for beginner and advanced makes for some tough viewing. I've been doing yoga for years, and this is one of the least energizing/relaxing videos I've done--and those are two things that should be a GIVEN for prenatal yoga!!For a feel good parental workout I prefer the Prenantal/Postnatal Workout (from Element) and Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with Perfect Pregnancy Yoga","review":"I am very happy with my purchase of Perfect Pregnancy yoga. I've been doing yoga for about 1.5 years 1-2 times per week. I stopped going to my regular class at about 4 months. Within a few weeks, I could begin to feel the aching in my lower back. I purchased this video and it really helps. I do a mix of the beginner and advanced moves and I get a good workout. They don't call out the positions by the yoga names so it took me a few times to get the sequence down but now I have no problems. I will definitely keep doing this video after the baby comes when I can't make it to class.In other reviews, people complained about the video quality. It's not as good as regular tv shows but takes nothing away from the actual workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised how much I didn't like it","review":"I loved the Vol. 1 DVD, so I thought that I would love this one as well. Not at all! This DVD moved WAY too quickly, and it didn't feel like yoga at all. I honestly put it on for less than 5 minutes before I said \\"forget it,\\" and stopped. I'm in good shape, I generally like workout DVDs and have no problem following along, even when they move quickly, but this one wasn't even enjoyable. Stick with volume 1!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick w/ vol 1. Sara is not a yoga instructor and she goes way too fast","review":"I did this video maybe five times. The things I liked were the plank work for core. The set is really nice and relaxing. However even though in another part of the video menu, she goes over the yoga sequence she will be following, Sara just rushes through these sequences leaving no time to stretch the muscles. The benefit of yoga is to lengthen the muscles by holding some poses. She does these salutations really quickly. I did this with nonpregnant friends and they weren't feeling it. She just rushes too quickly through it. One particular section she does this weird downward dog to back bend thing and where you lift a leg and arm. It just doesn't feel very stable or safe and she doesn't give you time to do the exercise safely. The video overall isn't bad but I found myself tending to do other videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Pregnancy Workout","review":"This DVD had good reviews, I wanted something that would stretch and relax and do some work too, however, I found this video to be very difficult to follow and I've practiced Yoga for years. I am just beginning my second trimester with my first child. I feel that the instructor moves way to quickly between positions, and it's constantly bouncing back and forth between modifications. I couldn't keep up and was very disappointed. The moves and poses look wonderful, but she doesn't give you the chance to move thru them and keep up. I found Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rae to be wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic musical from the good old days of MGM","review":"They don't make them like this anymore. Gene Kelly exudes star quality in his forst film role and Judy Garland is up to the challenge of appearing on screen with him. Nominal co-star George Murphy can't compete with the charm of these two although he is a pretty good singer in his own right. The film is set during the Great War but was made during the Second World War so there are elements of propaganda. Gene Kelly doesn't want to join the Army because he is due to get married and appear on a prestigious stage and this makes Judy Garland think he is a coward. Of course he isn't and later proves this to him. The classic songs and Busby Berkeley's direction make this a vital part of the MGM musicals story and a must have for collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Gene Kelly/Judy Garland Movie!","review":"One of the most romantic movies there is!

Sadly, this one did NOT stand the test of time. It was a good \\"teaching moment\\" for discussing World War II propaganda, but otherwise had no redeemable value. Aside from the first twenty minutes or so, the rest is unwatchable. Please check out the sweet title tune on youtube, but don't waste your time or money watching the rest.

Step by Step methodology leaves very little to chance. The content is hugely informative and very helpful because of it's linear design. The sheer volume of guidance in this Kaizen Standard is head and shoulders above anything else I've ever gotten my hands on. The job aids and checklists really provide that extra bit of consistency I desire in an implementation. The format of the Standard is easy to follow and understand because it is not loaded up with gobs of mumbo-jumbo jargon. I truly find that the steps laid out in the...\\"Getting Ready\\"...\\"Doing\\"....and \\"Follow-up\\" format is enormously helpful and would be especially helpful to someone newly exposed to the Kaizen tool.Bottom line....I wish I had this book seven years ago !

I felt like the author has trivialized such a serious subject. The riddle filled poetry only hints at suspicions, implying that the author herself is only grasping at straws for many facts. If someone wants to know about Anna Mae they will be let down by reading \\"Who would unbraid her hair....

You bet she can. Really, isn't it time these people were held accountable?How can we have an honest debate about the AIM legacy when the argument is reduced to how many dispensations should be granted to proven falsifiers of history? How many times must mock journalists be proven wrong before their defenders stop defending them? And why must their challengers always come up with new examples of their lies, as if the old ones don't count. Where is the integrity in defending them? I speak of the Harvey Ardens and Antoinette Claypooles and Ward Churchills of the world and of how easily they are exposed as shameless charlatans in books such as American Indian Mafia, and in court records that somehow never make it to the footnotes section of their nakedly political rant-rags."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my style","review":"I'm not sure why this book appeals to so many people. It's clear from the beginning that the author is working really hard to be lyrical & passionate, & is in love with her own writing. It makes it impossible to enjoy the story, because the author's desperate effort is so obvious. Near the end she confirmed my suspicions when she writes, \\"When a writer writes, it's as if she holds the sides of her chest apart, exposes her beating heart. And even though everything wants to heal, to close over and protect the heart, the writer must keep it bare, exposed. And in doing this, all of life is kept back, all the petty demands of the day-to-day. The heart is a river. The act of writing is the moving water that holds the banks apart, keeps the muscle of words flexing so that the reader can be carried along by this movement\\".Blech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"Bob Weinstein has built a career on advising you about yours.

No podría entender mucha de las discusiones por que los caracteres eran obviamente españoles y pensé que hablaron demasiado rápido. La buena cosa es ellos actuaba bastante buena que podría entender todo que se occuró. La película está sobre un estudiante del cine, Angela, que se esté siguiendo como cinco hombres. Pienso que ella mata a tres de ellos. La película tenía muchas imágenes asustadizas de personás muriendo. Mi parte favríto de la película era cuando el psycho tenía su cara en la entrepierna de Angela y entonces él puso un cuchillo en ella pero era justo un sueño. Eso me asustó. Tengo gusto de los dos actores que jugaron Chema y el psycho porque eran los mismos actores en \\"Abre Los Ojos\\" y ellos eran buenos en ése también.

Tambien, fue impresivo que Amenábar creio la composición de musica que fue muy importante en la creación de este nivel. Pensó que la pelicula empezó un poco lento, pero al final, la estructura de que fue posible para las carácteres esta completamente cambiado, y este experiencia es importante para la audiencia. En general, Tesis fue como un misteria de asasino, pero la parte de la victima repongo la parte de la detective. Al final de la pelicula, fue obvioso que Amenábar estuvó enamorado con los detalles que crearon la experiencia para todos las personas. En general, me guste Tesis, que es raro porque es de una género que usualmente no me gusto.- Tony (on Luke's account)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy bien","review":"La primera película del director Alejandro Amenábar, Tesis es un gran ejemplo de cinema horror. Normalmente, no me gusta estas películas pero Amenábar utiliza un método extraordinario para esconder los momentos de más terror. Por ejemplo, en la primera escena Amenábar introduce un suicidio pero no nos permita a ver el cuerpo en el minuto final. Después, él usa este método muchas más tiempos en la película para hacer un humor muy serio. Me gusto mucha el cuento de la película también porque hay muchas personas complicadas que pueden ser buenas y malas a mismo tiempo. Es imposible saber quién está encargado de las películas de \\"snuff\\" hasta que el final. Cuando la veo con mis compañeros, nos experimentamos muchas emociones...felicidad, terror, tristeza y sorpresa. Amenábar es el maestro de la cinematografía y planeo a ver más películas suyas. En conjunto, recomiendo esta película y puedo ver por que ganó siete Goya Awards en 1997. ¡Diviértete!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sangre y suspenso","review":"Tesis es una buena pelicula de horror con mucho accion y buenos actores.

I had run one pot through with clean water as directed and then filled it for the next morning when I went to move the pot there was a ton of water on the countertop. the reservior which had been filled to 10 cups now read less than 8 cups in about 10 minutes. The pot was packaged really well and the box was not damaged, I think it was a defect. I will try again. My mistake was not buying from amazon because I found it 10 less elswhere with free shipping.I hope they treat their customers like amazon does. I will re review after I receive second one....

It floods the filter and there are grinds and water in the pot and all over the counter top. Also the plastic prong on the top cover broke within the first week and it is a slow pourer.I had to swing the arm back into the water chamber when making 10 cups when it reached about 8 cups as the filter was full to overflowing and wait until it had filtered down enough to resume.

Oh, and the quality? Incredible, it is lightweight enough to be made out of papier-mché. Is it?So, on goes my quest for a decent coffee maker. One that is apparently glass with a big opening for EASY cleaning, quality no object since they're mostly all junk today, probably a Mr. Coffee since a higher price doesn't guarantee a really good product, one that permits a permanent filter since I don't DO paper filters, and, MOST OF ALL, one that doesn't REQUIRE WATER FILTERS.

It's easy to use, cleans up easily, and makes a hot cup of coffee. I particularly was pleased with the Thermal Carafe, which was a feature I was looking for while shopping.My problems arose from the coffee itself. After trying different beans and varied amounts, I could not make a strong cup of coffee. In fact, my wife and I agreed that the coffee had very little flavor at all.

I haven't used a carafe to dump water in any coffee maker I've had in the last decade. Kinda glad my hand doesn't fit on the inside of the carafe for cleaning as it will only tempt me to use a scrubby.

God knows why. I has a red ball that indicates the amount of water you have added. It is almost invisible because there is minimal contrast to the black background.

The thermal carafe really doesn't keep the coffee warm for very long. The screw top on the carafe is very difficult to remove and gets stuck easily. There is always water or coffee on the stand underneath the carafe so when you set it down on any surface, be prepared to wipe up after you've set it down. I believe these are made and apparently designed in China. They don't know anything about coffee makers. I've heard that Cuisinart makes a good coffee maker. I'm going to buy one of those.

The temperature and speed of brewing seemed great for a full-bodied but not bitter coffee, and the thermal retention of the carafe was off-the-charts. I could finish a pot twelve hours after brewing and it was still passably hot.I recommended it to a neighbor, and they loved until it died. Then, when mine died, I ordered another exactly like it. Then IT died.The problem is clearly that the heating element/tube is sensitive to scale. Despite a semi-regular cycle of vinegar, my last one still gave up the ghost with no warning.If you don't mind replacing your coffee maker every 1-3 years then I can genuinely recommend the Zojirushi. Other than being VERY tall for a coffeemaker, it is perfect. Until it dies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed... Don't Buy","review":"The Carafe on this unit is a big disappointment. The vacuum seal on the carafe has failed. Both water and air are seeping into the internal walls of the unit. This is preventing the carafe from functioning properly and maintaining coffee at a hot temperature for any long length of time.I called the customer service department at Zojirushi to report this issue. Boy, was that a big waste of time!I would strongly recommend getting a different product due to the fact that a replacement carafe will set up back about $38.00.

Some comments, said water temp was a problem, so I set up the coffee the evening before, so the water comes to room tempreture, which I don't really think is an issue, but it sure makes life easier waking to a fresh pot of coffee.

I bought # 4 Melita paper filters and they fit ok, but one does need to press the filter down in the basket well.

There is only one problem and it is significant. If we make more than 7 cups (it is a 10-cup pot) it overflows during the brewing process filling the coffee with grinds and flooding our countertop. Even with 7 cups this has been a problem.

I sent it back to the manufacturer who tested it and found that the temperature was too low and the carafe \\"no good\\" as the return slip said.

I lived with it and would have tolerated it longer but it died on me on its 14th month of minimal usage (I brew coffee at home just once or twice a week, usually weekends).For something that's just 'good enough', $80-some dollars is too much to pay! Hence, the 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"MandC","review":"I chose this model because of the great reviews on Amazon. The clincher was that it made good tasting coffee and that comment was not seen on reviews of other makers. Unfortunately i can't comment on how good the coffee tastes. I brewed the first time with only water. I thought I had a universal gold coffee filter, but not universal to Zoji. Now that it has brewed and because I wanted to test it, I let it sit for a few hours. I cannot for the life of me get the thing opened. So back in its box it goes, water and all, back to Amazon. They better nor charge me for the weight of the water since I can't get it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Coffemaker","review":"We're sorry for the bad luck a few other purchasers had with this model. We've had ours for a couple weeks now and it's as wonderful as we thought it would be. The thermal carafe aspect is of the utmost importance to us and ours works great. There aren't many thermal carafe units to pick from and the less plastic the better. We feel that we couldn't have made a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even a Single Cup","review":"I was very disappointed with the Fresh Brew. The first time I ran water through the unit, to flush it as recommended, the water leaked and permeated the electronics. The end. I sent the unit back and purchased a Krups Thermal Carafe which is a much more solidly constructed machine than the Zojirushi, and has lots of great features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our coffee often ends up all over the counter.","review":"It does it often enough that we cannot use the automatic settings, and have to stand over it to make sure that it's flowing into the carafe, repeatedly checking water level, and trying to figure out if it's actually going into the carafe. This is an absolute PAIN, and we might as well be making coffee the old fashioned way, pouring hot water into a cone manually (which by the way, makes absolutely better coffee). We tried different coffee grounds, making sure everything is absolutely clean and it still does it! I want to love the coffee maker as so many other people do, but there are just too many problems...the coffee tastes great...when it's not running all over the counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in build quality and performance","review":"I'm new to reviewing...I bought this coffee maker to replace a Bodum Santos electric vacuum pot... and I had high hopes.My out-of-the-box reaction was, quite simply: \\"this is a really flimsy product\\".When I plugged it in, my reaction to the red LED display was: \\"old design\\".Where the rubber meets the road:- Filling it is easy assuming you don't use the carafe. (Don't! It's really slow and awkward)- It makes \\"just OK\\" coffee - it's no different from any number of other percolation/drip machines. Not consistently hot - no idea why.- \\"Pause\\" doesn't really work - always let's some coffee drip.- Pouring from the carafe is a chore - super slow - and the screw top is thin so making it tight or loosening it is uncomfortable.It's going back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a mess","review":"Apparently the rate at which the water heats and pours over the coffee grounds is faster than the water can drain through the coffee grounds. Regardless of the ground consistency I use there is always overflow. A huge mess.This is the only product I have purchased from Amazon.com that I was not 100% satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressed","review":"It's hard to rate this on its own merits. I had a cuisinart for three years and keep comparing this coffee maker to that one.The Zojirushi's thermal carafe is smaller than I would have liked and its very cumbersome to open- maybe once its broken in a little more it will be easier. There is this weird little \\"cap\\" that I assume goes in the top to help keep the coffee warm- it doesn't work very well because the coffee wasn't as hot as my Cuisinart (that stayed scalding hot almost all day). I'm not crazy about having another \\"thing\\" to wash and store and otherwise keep track of. It didn't come with a manual...warranty info...just the coffee maker. And the box was torn open inside the Amazom shipping box. Not just a little tear- the whole side was torn from the top to the bottom (didn't anybody notice when they packed it?). It does look nice and is apparently easy to program and use- I did it without the benefit of an instruction manual. Will buy another Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I bought this and it worked for about eight weeks and then broke. It is under warranty, but the shipping costs to send it to an authorized service dealer is not covered. The coffee maker itself is unbalanced once you fill it with water and seems like it will tip over very easily. The lid is very difficult to screw on and off. Overall, this is a very poor quality product and not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wished I had not tried this coffee machine...","review":"I bought this coffee maker after my Cuisinart finally bit the dust because I thought it might be good to try something new... Boy was a wrong! 1) The brewed coffee if NOT nearly hot enough when it hits the carafe. 2) The top is AWFUL! Chews your hands as you both screw it on & unscrew it. 3) There is a very annoying second top that you put on top of the first top to keep the coffee hot - too easy to put on when brewing causing a HUGE mess & pretty easy to lose. 4) The auto-program start needs to be turned reset to the ON position EVERY NIGHT - too easy to forget!! My Cuisinart was in the \\"on\\" position until I turned it off so I never forgot it! -- I am either returning this one (if possible) or shelving it as a backup & buying another Cuisinart!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One for work, one for home","review":"This coffee maker makes delicious, hot coffee.

She is beautiful and can be programmed for coffee to be done on time. There ends the good points. The thermal carafe does not keep the temperature for a long time and worst of all is the bottle cover. To open it when the coffee is ready, you must be Hercules. The cover is fine with bosses, who hurt his hand while doing to try to force it open. When making coffee, the vacuum is created even more difficult to open. If you want a good Thermal Carafe Coffe, look for a Rowenta. Note 1000!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Experience","review":"Made one mug of coffee, which was fine and the next time I used it water leaked profusely from the measuring gauge. Thus I cannot recommend this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with quality!","review":"I bought this coffee maker 8 months ago after reading the reviews. Well, it didn't live up to the hype. The base of the carafe just fell off. I can get it to stay on while it's brewing but it just falls off again. Also, I don't like the way you have to twist the top to pour the coffee. Sometimes it gets stuck and I have a hard time opening it. Not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to give it a 1 because","review":"I got a thermal caraf because I wanted my coffee to stay hot. Cuisinart, it stayed warm when I put it in the fridge, until the next morning! So 6 hours later the coffee was hot enough to add milk. This one-NOT. The end - I want my coffee hot. My mistake for trying something new..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Brew","review":"This coffe maker was bought to replace a 15 yr old Mr. Coffee. From the first cup I could tell this machine was inferior. The extra cover designed to keep the coffee warm in the carafe broke the first time I used it. After about 3 months the bottom started falling off of the carafe. The biggest disappointment is the bitter flavor of the coffee. I haven't had a good cup from this machine and am going to replace it after using it for only 5 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fussy Coffee Maker","review":"If you like to fuss around making coffee, then this is the maker for you. Step #1 is to cut 1/2\\" off the#4 cone filter. Then after the coffee is made, you need to put the little cap on top of the carafe, if you haven't lost it or you cat thought it was his toy. Make the thing so it will take the #4 filter and out a place on it to store the cap and maybe it would be useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad design","review":"I sent this back before i pluged it in. who cares if it makes good coffee if the is no bucket to fill up water at the sink. You have to put the machine unter the tap or have a spare bucket. The coffee cone is under a fixed water return making it reaaly hard to fill,empty and clean. And no stainless steel cone, and it is not a standard size cone so you hunt down filters or cut them. This is much to incovienent to use every day. Clearly the designer never used this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the greatest for convenience","review":"I thought I was going to love this product but didn't. You can't just brew and pour. The design was great but once I read the instructions I discovered that it wasn't worth the effort because I was using this to replace a much cheaper and easier to use product. I did return it and found a different one at the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problems with Swiss gold filter","review":"Even ground coarse with a full pot I can still get an overflow. An extra rim came for the Swiss filter but it does not fit tight - no matter how I try to spigot is too low to swing back over the grounds. So I have a good six cup coffee maker!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another!","review":"I bought this coffee maker for the office. It worked well and the coffee actually tasted really good. About one month into using it, the machine croaked. It would turn on, but did not want to brew anything. After taking it apart, we found that the heating coil had stopped working. It isn't worth sending it back to the manufacturer as you are responsible to pay shipping and handling both ways!We should have read the reviews before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!","review":"This is a great machine which produces HOT coffee, very quickly. One tip I learned the hard way: After setting the timer, don't forget to remove the stopper on the carafe. If you do forget, you will find coffee all over the floor the next morning. bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Maker","review":"***2 RATING****AFTER I RATED THIS PRODUCT THE VERY NEXT DAY MY COFFEE MAKER BROKE. IT HAS ONLY BEEN USED FOR ABOUT A MONTH. I AM NOW SENDING IT BACK TO BE FIXED BUT IT WILL TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS.I have owned this for about a month now and I am really happy with it. The coffee tastes great and it brews in a couple of minutes and stays hot in the carafe for a minimum of an hour. The #4 filters dont fit perfectly so you have to cut them or fold them at the seam which is an easy fix and well worth it for the quality of coffee it produces. Also, the tablespoon to cup ratio is almost spot on, which I also really like. Overall, a great coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems, makes GREAT coffee","review":"Several months ago, I read the reviews and decided to take a chance on this coffeemaker. I'm thrilled with it. A couple of issues being discussed when I bought the coffeemaker included temperature of water and filter size.First, a caveat: I am not a fan of scaldingly hot coffee. Reviewers mentioned that using ice cold water made coffee that was not hot enough but using cold tap water left a muddied flavor. I, too, found that ice cold water seemed to overwhelm the machine's heater mechanism, but haven't had any problems with muddy flavored coffee using tap water. So tap water has suited me fine.I also found that #4 size filters fit provided you fold the edges of the filter along the seam and then make sure the bottom of the filter is puched down into the bottom of the basket.I haven't had any problems with leakage from the lid onto the counter.I'm very happy with this coffee maker and have no regrets about buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good coffee","review":"A well built,good looking coffee maker,and it makes excellent coffee. The #4 filters work ok,so I wouldn't let that deter you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee, but a poor design","review":"I bought this coffee maker about three weeks ago. It brewed a good cup of coffee and the coffee stayed warm in the carafe for a long time. However, I returned the coffee maker because the carafe lid was just too hard to open and close. Opening and closing the carafe was like struggling with a difficult jar lid. There were two other design flaws that annoyed me as well, but were not necesserily \\"deal breakers\\". (1)There is an arm on the coffee maker that must be moved into position before brewing. This arm extends over the coffee basket. Because the #4 filters are slightly larger than the coffee basket it requires a little extra effort to move the arm into place and keep the filter positioned properly. (2)The controls were inconviently placed on the side of the machine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Coffee","review":"There are a lot of things I like about this coffee maker. It looks good, it brews coffee really fast, it's easy to clean. Unfortunately the thing I don't like about it is that it makes weak coffee, which is a show stopper for me and my wife.I have tried things like using two filters, using more coffee than normal, pouring the coffee through the grounds a second time. I have to say that the results really aren't worth the effort.I have never had this sort of problem with a coffee maker before, and honestly I didn't think that it would be possible to not get a strong cup of coffee out of one. I bought this coffee maker mainly on the reviews I read about it, but I can't recommend it at all. There have to be better machines out there, especially for 80 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"I was very disappointed with this. The top is very difficult to open, it is VERY loud when brewing, and there are too many steps in preparing to brew compared to my old coffee maker (the Starbucks model which was recalled). I actually liked the Starbucks model MUCH better. Also, the gold filter basket recommended to purchace with this item does not fit! I returned both items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee maker","review":"I bought the Zojirushi from Amazon for my company approximately five years ago. It is still going strong after all these years and, trust me, it gets plenty of use! I love that there's no hotplate to give the coffee that old, burnt taste and since it goes off automatically when it's finished brewing, there's no worry about leaving it on when we go home at night. It's a great coffee maker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total mess","review":"I received this unit as a christmas gift, and unfortunately it was broken out of the box: Pouring any water into the unit would result in a giant leak onto the counter top. Calling Zojirushi resulted in them telling us to return the unit to Amazon for an exchange, as \\"A hose probably came loose in shipping or something\\". We received the replacement machine from amazon, and unfortunately it had the same exact problem. Perhaps it was a bad batch off the line, but in the end we decided to go with a different manufacturer. It was a bit disappointing, because we've read so many great things about this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure junk","review":"Unless you like cold coffee do not buy!

In July of that year it stopped working, sent it in for repair (which took a month). As of Aug 2012 it failed again. Unit is out of 1 year warranty so I'm sunk. Can't say I've been real happy with the coffee maker.Pros- Makes a good cup of joe, plenty hot and the jets spray the grounds in a good pattern. Carafe is excellent at holding heat.Cons- 1.5 years old, already repaired once and it's given up the ghost. Coffee maker before this one worked 7 years before the carafe cracked. Also, the #4 filters that this uses don't fit perfectly in the brew area, never seemed to matter but a minor annoyance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine","review":"I was surprised at the improvement in the taste of the same bag of coffee from the new machine vs. the old one.It is a good looking machine and simply functions as you'd expect. It was more than others in this category, but seems to be good price/performance ratio.Very minor comments/complaints:1. The carafe is a bit thinner than our old Cusinart (worst performer ever), so it doesn't keep coffee hot too long2. The red LED lights are a dated look (I would have expected black) and stands out at night when lights are off3. There is a removable cap that plugs the top cover -- it is the same diameter as our sink drain and easy to lose track of (especially with 2 and 4-year boys). Since the cap is a two-piece design, it is possible to brew a pot with the cap in place, which will result in coffee all over the counter!I sure would love an all-steel constuction machine at the $100 price point that works this good..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful coffee maker","review":"My wife and I were forced into finding a new thermal coffee maker after our 5+-year-old Krupps turned into a fire hazard by not shutting itself off. We ordered a Cuisinart DCC-1150BK and were disappointed by the taste and smell of burnt plastic in every cup of coffee. Fortunately, the Amazon.com return procedure makes it easy to return items -- which we did. We then decided to spend an additional $15.00 and ordered the Zojirushi EC-BD15 thermal coffee maker, and what a delight it has turned out to be. You do have to fold over (or trim off) the Number 4 filters to get them to fit properly. Other than that little issue this machine makes great tasting coffee. The thermal carafe keeps the coffee piping hot for hours. We can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice coffee maker","review":"Been using this for 'bout 10 days now. Works just fine. Brews quickly. Like the indicator on the number of cups within.My only concern, like my prior one, is the care one needs to take making sure the carafe sits directly under the basket. Put it in there off kilter and you have a mess. They should make the base deeper to hold the carafe more securely, or some way to force the customer to snap the carafe in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it brewed a little hotter","review":"I think it looks great and is easy to clean. I have not had any problems lining it up like some of the reviews have said. The only think I wish it did was brew at a hotter temperature. We got in, in part, because the reviews said it did have a hot temp., unfortunately, I throw a little milk in there and I have to microwave it. On the other hand, it does stay warm for a long time, and everything is cool to the touch so you can take it with you and enjoy the coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well - makes good coffee","review":"This coffee maker does a very good job.

I loved the idea of brewing directly into a thermal carafe. Brew temperature was excellent. Carafe kept coffee hot for 6 to 8 hours. Then one day 18 months later, it did not brew anymore. I tried everything. Lights and digital clock all work. I can program to come on or start it manually to no avail. At the appointed time, the ON light signals brewing, but it never heats the water and never starts to brew coffee. I am starting to lose confidence in the consumer ratings company also.

So I take it apart, re-verify and do it all again. Guess what? Coffee spills out all over as it brews. Now this is just plain stupid - I don't care how hot it's supposed to keep coffee.

It seemed to be made of mostly thin, flimsy black plastic towering up 15 inches. Except for the nice thermal carafe, I didn't see anything exceptional about this unit. It just didn't seem very solid.So if I'm going to use a flimsy coffee maker that can pour the right temperature hot water over coffee grounds making flavorful coffee, I'll go back to my simple $7.99 white Walgreens Kitchen Gourmet, which probably makes just as good tasting coffee but looks less fancy. It's also less complicated without things that can go wrong. I can probably live without the thermal carafe, and I don't like black anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Maker -- Works for Me","review":"I've had this coffee maker for about a month now.

The size 4 paper coffee filters do not fit well, you must jam them in or cut them down. Placement of the controls around the side of the coffee maker is a disadvantage as you either have to fumble without seeing the controls or move the coffee maker to see the controls.

First, it is very tall so plan on having the vertical space available. More importantly, however, was that it just plain stopped working.

The support staff at Zoji was very nice and repaired the product quickly and for a nominal fee.Unfortunately we did not have spare Zoji, so we quickly ran to the store to find a temporary replacement. After trying three times to find something that could compare, we gave up.

It is made of the cheapest, flimsiest plastic, does NOT take a #4 filter (hence the reference to the non-existent #3), does not have an integrated insultaion system, but needs a seal to be inserted, and is a total lack of value. The cheapest Mr. Coffee maker would work as well and be better value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent build quality and brilliant design - Still Works Great!","review":"I bought this one from Amazon in December 2004! Makes a perfect pot of coffee every single morning. Everything works unfailingly. We've been using the same SwissGold filter for nearly FIVE years with no problem as well.Do not waste your time or money on that $30 piece of junk machine you may be considering. Just don't do it. You will thank yourself in five years for spending the extra $60.**April 2011 Update**I can't believe I bought this coffee maker in 2004. It has seen almost daily use for 7 years and still works like it did on day one. Wonderful job Zojirushi!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This coffee brewing system is not very good at all. I am very disappointed with it. The carafe is one of the worst I have ever seen. The lid does not loosen without a fight, you have to rotate the entire carafe, and it cannot be done without a lot of pressure.This is not an ergonomically designed system, either. Everything is turned 90 degrees, and makes for awkward handling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Carafe Maker","review":"Really pleased with this coffee maker overall. Good sized carafe keeps brew warm and fresh. Fairly quick brew and easy to set up. A bit plasticky up top and controls/programming are primitive but simple and effective. Miles better than our old Aroma non-carafe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overflows frequently and not reliable","review":"The first one we ordered stopped working within a year. Since it made a decent cup of coffee, we ordered a replacement thinking that we'd have better luck with durability the second time around. Well, the second one stopped working within six months. An expensive piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good While It Lasted","review":"Bought this machine to replace the Cuisinart Thermal Coffee Maker that died on us after a year. The Cuisinart heating element went and the coffee suddenly started tasting plastic. When I read reviews I found out that that was typical of Cuisinart (and several people reported fires). So when the same thing began happening on the Zojirushi (funny plastic taste) after only 3 weeks, I decided to return it immediately and not risk any further problems. It's a shame because I am a big fan of the thermal pot makers for their ability to keep the coffee fresh and hot without a burner, but I can't seem to find one that will last. Trying the Militta thermal pot next, which got amazing reviews, time will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zojirushi EC-BD15 Stainless Steel Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker","review":"I purchased my first Zojirushi coffee maker from Amazon in April 2008. After receiving it, it worked great, but for only two weeks and then the heating element just stopped. I contacted the business that sent it to me from Amazon and was advised to contact the company directly. I was sent a replacement within a month and I enjoyed the replacement unit from May 2008 until now, December 2009. Again, the same as the first unit, the heating element just stopped working. It's very frustrating because I love the thermal carafe in that it keeps the coffee hot for hours and I don't have to worry about a \\"hot plate\\" that the pot sits on to keep the coffee hot. For the expense of this coffee maker to last for only 19 months, I could have bought two to three cheaper brands and they would have lasted two to three times longer than this brand. I'm very disappointed. Save your money-avoid on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"zojirushi makes good coffee","review":"I got my Zojirushi about a month ago and it has been a pretty good coffee maker. The thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot for a couple of hours and I would say warm for another 4 hrs. The coffee tastes great and the Zojirushi makes the coffee a lot faster then my old coffee maker. There are a couple of things that could be better but not deal breakers. The ball on the side that shows the amount of water you put in is slow at first so you have to pour the water in slower, which is really not a big deal. The other thing is that the filter size is a little smaller then the #4 filter so if you are looking for a medal filter basket to use instead of the paper filters all the time,the #4 size doesn't fit and the smaller size is kinda hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed -- coffee goes cold fast","review":"It's true that the coffee is kept hot in the pot as others claim, but the problem is once it's out of the pot. Even coffee poured right after brewing quickly gets cold. I can't explain it, but it's true, and it makes this purchase very disappointing. Also, the lid for the carafe is uncomfortable and difficult to turn every time you want a refill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Our experience with the Zojirushi EC-BD15 Coffee Maker was quite disappointing. The first time we used it, water leaked from the reservoir onto our counter. We notified the Amazon vendor (Chefs Corner), who made it easy for us to return the defective machine and soon sent a replacement. Actually, Chefs Corner mistakenly sent us two replacements, and we immediately returned one. Unfortunately, the replacement machine that we kept was missing a part and, consequently, became clogged with coffee grounds and slopped coffee onto our counter. Furthermore, the carafe did a poor job keeping the coffee hot. Zojirushi clearly has quality-control problems, so we did not bother requesting another replacement.

The coffee it makes tastes fine. However, the machine is too tall, it seems to be flimsy, it is not easy to pour in the water and see the measure at the same time, the coffee holder is too small for a #4 filter to fit into properly, the mechanism to pour from the thermal pot is inconvenient, and the removable top is in two parts, one of which will surely get lost soon. Having used the pot for a month, I would not purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasently surprised","review":"I have had this coffee maker for one week. I replaced a very expensive \\"capresso\\" brand machine and also have had a very expensive cuisenart machine recently. This machine by far makes the hottest coffee and keeps it hot the longest of the 3 that we have had. It is not fancy and at first glance appears cheaply made but i have to say, so far i am impressed with it. For 90 dollars i think it is a good buy. Honestly, my main concern is the temp of my coffee and so far i am impressed. I hope it holds up well but at this point i would highly recomend this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"overflow and underheat","review":"i guess these coffee makers are luck of the draw because the one i got seems to overflow 50% of the time and the coffee doesnt stay hot. this is NOT for people who want to set the pot and forget about it because if it overflows it just keeps going. the filters have to be packed down dilligently as the lip of the filter tends to be pushed down by the how water arm as it swings across the top. this ofcourse tends to make it overflow.i would not buy this again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coffee","review":"My husband & I purchased this coffee maker from Amazon about a month ago & we love it.

The filler tube used to determine the amount of water in the reservoir is on the side of the unit and hard to see when you fill the reservoir. Also the cap for the thermal carafe retains brewed coffee inside the cap and you cannot get it out during cleaning.....not very sanitary. I had to drill two 1/4\\" holes in the bottom of the carafe cap to allow drainage from the cap so I could drain the retained coffer and be able to clean the cap. The overall unit is unsually tall requiring a tall storage space, Lastly it is of flimsy plastic construction. I would not purchase another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on Arrival","review":"I selected the free shipping option on this coffee maker. It took about a week and a half to arrive and when it did, it was discovered to be Dead On Arrival. Almost no water gets into the water outlet from the reservoir. It sputters, steams, and heats the water in the reservoir, but cannot make coffee because almost no water makes it into the filter basket. The hot water just remains in the reservoir (yes the water outlet was swung out over the filter basket).I went to the manufacturer's website and attempted to contact technical support. In order to do that one needs to enter the product serial number. The website says that the serial number is on a silver label on the product. There was no silver label anywhere, hence no serial number.I gave up in frustration, and am returning this coffee maker for a full refund.

The first worked fine for a long time, but fell on the floor and some of the plastic cracked, but it still worked. Since I liked it, I ordered a new one and threw the old one away. After six months it's totally dead. The heating element no longer heats. I opened it up and checked the over-temperature sensor and it's fine, and then I checked the resistance of the heater and it's an open circuit.Now I make coffee by manually pouring water over the grinds. This works for now. Looking for a better unit that has a thermal carafe. Probably will buy the $40 Cuisinart at Costco. At least it has a three year warranty.I'm disappointed in Zojirushi these days.

There is nothing RIGHT about this machine. It leaks coffee all over the counter unless the carafe is in perfect alignment with the valve. The recommended #4 coffee filters don't fit correctly (what were they thinking?). The carafe cap has sharp edges and is difficult to work.

The water is quite hot and it picks up some nice subtleties of the coffee, but the brewing speed is extremely fast which tends to create rather weak coffee without much body. The speed also makes the basket overflow extremely easily if the coffee is ground too fine or you add \\"too much.\\" That's in quotes because in order to get a good solid cup of coffee, the right amount is \\"too much.\\"The pot itself is rather quirky. To fully seal the vacuum pot, you need to add an external topper, which we've already lost track of, and to dispense coffee, you need to twist the cover, which can easily become stuck and require a good amount of force, to the open position. Finally, this unit is very tall and doesn't have enough weight at the bottom leaving it more than a bit tippy and awkward to place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a good pot of coffee","review":"We like everything about this coffee maker. The coffee taste great and the maker is simple and easy to use, plus cleanup is a snap.

The machine is easy to use, quick and produces fine coffee (or hot water, for that matter). I very much appreciate that the carafe works well, and keeps the coffee hot for a few hours, in our situation. I use a # 4 filter, which works fine. Yes, it's a little large, but scrunching the filter down works fine.The brewer looks fine, but the body of the machine is plastic. Cleaning the machine is no problem. I have had the machine overflow a few times - this seems to be due to the grind being too fine, clogging up the works. The lid can be tightened too much, making it difficult to loosen. The fix is to not tighten the lid so far.I would certainly consider buying this machine again."},{"rating":"2","title":"zojirushi ec-bd15 fresh brew thermal carafe coffee maker","review":"I am very pleased with the purchase.

Not up to Zojirushi's usual standards -- rice maker, for example, has been outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty great coffee maker","review":"I ordered this coffee maker after breaking the carafe of my old Krups machine. It makes very good coffee, looks great, and is simple to use. I ordered a Cuisinart gold filter to use with this pot and it fits pretty well where a paper filter would go. The carafe keeps my coffee hot for hours with no thermal plate. It is tall but has a (relatively) small footprint, great for my tiny kitchen.This is a great no-nonsense coffee maker at a moderately expensive price. It gives me what I wanted (thermal carafe, no warming plate, accepts gold-tone filters, insulated brewing), but if you're less picky, there are probably cheaper options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffeemaker in spite of mixed reviews on Amazon","review":"We have had to replace our thermal carafe coffee maker every couple of years. Sometimes we get one we are really happy with, sometimes we settle and live with it. We've had terrible tasting coffee, we've had spills when the carafe wasn't seated just right and it brewed all over the counter, and we've had pour spouts that don't pour well.In spite of reviews on Amazon that were not exactly glowing endorsements, we decided to try this one based on Consumer Reports recommendation. I am happy that we did. The coffee tastes great. We have had no accidents while brewing. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for several hours, and is still warm if left overnight. It pours easily too.It is a little hard to see where to turn the lid from brew to pour, but we can live with that. There is a small dot on the lid where you turn it to the pour position. I have considered putting a dab of bright paint on the dot, but found it is not that big of a deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Luke Warm in 30 minutes","review":"Bought this machine about 9 months ago. If you like HOT coffee, please hit backspace and keep shopping. This thing gets 5 stars for looks and ease of set-up. It gets 3 stars for quality of taste and one star for temperature. Coffee comes out a bit weak and you have to add additional scoops to compensate. I don't think the brew cycle gets hot enough to extract all the flavor from the grounds. My wife has to microwave cups of coffee if she pours it any later than 30 minutes after brew cycle.

Here's why: 1) the brew pause function (to pour a cup while it's still brewing) does not work- it dripped coffee all over the plate each and every time I tried to do so; 2) the carafe is not well designed-coffee dripped down the side of it and my cup; and 3) the \\"ON\\" button stays lit after the brewing has finished, so monster-like sounds keep emanating from it well beyond brew time. (I had to push the \\"OFF\\" button a few minutes after the brewing had ended.) In all, a horrible product, especially with the steep price.

The problem comes when you inevitably forget to put the lid back on after pouring the water in from the carafe and press the brew button. When this happens you come back to coffee and grounds all over the counter and floor. While it might sound easy enough to just remember to put the lid on, over the past 2 years this has happened to me at least 10 times. If you have a great memory then this may work well for you.

When you swing the basket into place, there's a plastic feed arm that is supposed to automatically swing over the center of the filter basket. However, because the #4 filter sticks up so high, the arm can't swing over. I tried cutting the filters down and that worked better but who wants to do that every time? Also, to fill the reservoir you have to use the carafe. No big deal. Except there's a piece on the top of the carafe that has to be taken off for the brewing process and then put back on if you want to keep the coffee warm in the carafe.

When plugged in the clock kept time but the on switch did not work.

Well, it's not, and the coffee is barely warm right after brewing...what a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the trick","review":"After going through two Cuisinart coffee makers in less than two years, I decided I needed a change and picked this one because of its simplicity and it's thermal carafe. It is all it says it is and makes decent coffee, but have two minor issues with this model. First when you place the carafe under the basket you have to be very careful that it is lined up properly before hitting the start button. You need to visually be sure it is lined up or the coffee can not flow into the pot and thus will overflow all over the counter. Second, make sure you don't fill above the 10 cup mark. Filling up to the reservoir overflow is too much water and the carafe will overflow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zojirushi subpar","review":"I have had the Zojirushi coffee maker for over 6 months now. If I had it to do over again, I'd purchase a different brand of coffee maker. Here's why: The lid on the carafe is too difficult to open and once open the coffee pours out too slowly. The coffee holder must be placed a certain way or you'll wake up to counters and floors full of spilled coffee. If even a little bit of coffee overflows the filter it is certain to clog the carafe and once again, counters and floors are running over with coffee. My opinion is that the Zojirushi is overpriced, under-engineered, and not a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great coffeemaker for a couple of years but then...","review":"We did our due diligence and decided on this coffeemaker even though a few reviewers claimed the coffee flows all over the counter and not into the pot. Other reviewers indicated that was strictly user error and not the pot. The first year we owned it, it only overflowed once. We take great care to site the pot exactly right, but now it is overflowing a good third of the time. Oddly enough, the pot itself is about half full before it starts overflowing, which indicates to me that somehow it shifts slightly during the brewing process. Regardless, I'm tired of cleaning up the mess. Having said that, my husband has been very happy with the quality of the coffee and the ability of the thermal carafe to keep it properly heated. We have not ruled out getting another Zojirushi as a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the insulated carafe!","review":"Be sure you buy the BD15 vs 17. This is the height of the unit and the 17\\" will not fit under most US upper cupboards. The carafe does keep the liquid hot for 12 hours as advertised. I don't know why people rate the turn top as difficult to loosen. You don't have to screw it down so hard-dah! I am a scuba diver and you learn to tighten the knob and then back it off just slightly...this can be true for many things in life! I switched to this type of maker because I am tired of a glass carafe which has no insulatory capacity and also breaks very easily. Buy it! I have added to this now that this device is still working just like new 3 years now! 10/18/2010"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Coffee Maker.","review":"I bought this coffee several months ago and have been very happy with it. It makes good coffee and the thermal cafe does its job (hot coffee for a couple of hours). I agree with several other reviewers that the plastic is somewhat flimsy and that it could have been better. I also appreciate the comments from other reviewers about not screwing the lid on too tight since it does expand when it is hot. I have not had any issues with it spilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after 5 months.","review":"This was only used on weekends mostly and it still died after only 5 months of having it.

We couldn't wait to try it out. The lid of the carafe, however, was the problem. It screws on to the carafe with just a few turns. In the \\"closed\\" position, the arrows are supposed to line up with the \\"closed\\" dot. Evidently, ours wasn't threaded correctly, as it never quite got to the \\"closed\\" position - off by about 1/4 inch or so. As a result, the carafe poured ridiculously, and leaked all over the place. Back it went. Lucky we bought from Amazon... given it was defective, it was free return shipping, and 100% refund. No restocking, nothing of the sort. So-- all we really lost was time. Ended up with a Cuisinart. Wish you better luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I had a defective one?","review":"I really like the style and ease of use of this coffee maker and I REALLY liked the quality of the cup of coffee it brewed.

I returned the product and was afraid to try again given some of the other problems noted by people on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"It does make great coffee. Which is fine if you like slurping it off the counter. My unit leaks from the bottom sometimes. The \\"sneak a cup\\" mechanism jams open easily and jams closed sometimes as well. Both result in a mess. The carafe lid sometimes does not allow coffee to flow into the pot and it spills all over the place. I ended up having to remove the \\"sneak a cup\\" mechanism entirely and brew with the lid off to prevent spilling 3 cups of coffee on my countertops everyday. For the price this costs these flaws are simply unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Coffee Problem","review":"There are Quality control problems with this maker. The coffee made started off medium strength (at best) and is now rapidly moving towards brown water. I have had the maker ~ 1 week.

Otherwise, no complaints. *easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great IF/WHEN it works","review":"My Zojirushi coffee maker stopped working yesterday. I bought it 11/12/08 from Amazon -- that's less than 3 months. It simply will not brew although the ON button is pressed. I am going to try taking it to a service center.

We just haven't had coffee for 2 days now. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great Tasting Coffee","review":"The machine is nice looking but the biggest issue is that the coffee does not come out very hot after brewing.... which I believe is why it does not taste very flavorful.

It makes good coffee but we've a recurring problem with the basket overflowing during the brew cycle and literally flooding the countertop. We've tried multiple brands of paper filters, different grinds of coffee, all to no avail. The only sure method is to babysit and turn the unit off manually when the basket is draining into the pot more slowly than hot water is going into the basket. Totally defeats the purpose of an \\"automatic\\" coffee maker.

I thought we would give it a try, and it did make excellent tasting coffee. Kept it hot enough for me for 2 hours (which is about the same for all the coffee makers like this). The lid was very annoying, and often could not be turned open without using a gripper, and you have to take off and put on the top piece each time you brew coffee instead of the lid being one piece. Then one day it just wouldn't brew coffee anymore. For the price of this pot I would have thought it should have lasted longer and while I enjoyed the taste of the coffee, I don't think I can trust the quality of this coffee maker again.

Clear and easy-to-read water level window2. Insulated brew basket3. Insulated carafeIf you fold the paper #4 coffee filters along the seams as directed on the filter box, they fit just fine (otherwise they poke above the basket height and can interfere with the water arm motion). Coffee tastes great and is somewhat stronger, due to the brewing water percolating at a higher temperature (195-197 F according to my meat thermometer), than my old B&D; insulated carafe maker. Thus I need to use less coffee grounds to achieve my preferred taste, saving money! All-in-all, very happy with this purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"As temperamental as a maiden aunt with the vapors","review":"Makes good coffee, when you can get it to cooperate. The carafe must be placed rather precisely under the valve that lets the coffee flow from the filter; get this wrong and the machine barfs coffee + grounds all over itself and your counter. The device requires a level of accurate aim of which I am incapable in the mornings before I've had my coffee.Also, the little swing arm which drizzles the water from the reservoir into the filter does not reliably swing into place when you close the lid. And finally, it's very easy to hit the wrong button when trying to set the Auto brew feature, and to bump the time set buttons when you're just trying to turn the thing on. Nice form factor, good coffee but an altogether poor design. I would never buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China junk!","review":"Had the exact same coffee maker for about 3 years and had no complaints until one day it just stopped working.

After I cleaned it thoroughly I tried again and the water would not heat up and it didn't pump water. Luckily I can return to the company for warranty repair (at my own cost for shipping).

A couple of weeks ago, we discovered the maker was starting to kick off before the all the water had been passed out of the reservoir and into the basket. So, in order to make an entire pot of coffee, someone now has to stand there and keep turning it back on after it kicks off. We've contacted Zojirushi about the problem, but haven't heard back yet. When we checked other's reviews of this product, this switch problem now seems endemic with this maker. My hope is that Zojirushi, if it doesn't want to lose customers, provides a replacement without customers having to pay shipping costs, etc. to get a new maker. If we don't get a timely and cost-effective replacement, we're done with this brand for good, and I think Amazon should think twice about selling this maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted only two months!","review":"After only a couple of months it has quit working!

I currently have a Braun Flavorselect drip coffee maker with a glass carafe and wanted a drip maker with a thermal carafe. After reading the reviews on the Fresh Brew, I purchased it mainly because it was supposed to brew at the ideal 200F temperature. I brewed two pure water runs to clean out the unit and had no problems with leakage. I checked the water running through the basket with a digital thermometer and it read 180F which was discouraging. I then brewed 6 cups of Brazil Coromandel-Fazena Sao Joao. The taste lacked the complexity I got with the Braun and lacked body. The brew water was about 170F. I will be looking for a new home for this coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never hot enough","review":"We bought this machine a year ago and have kept it because we paid so much for it. Sure it is easy to use, but the coffee is never hot enough. Within the first 15 min of it being made it is sort of hot, never piping hot, and an hour after it is made it is only warm. Today the twist on top to the carafe broke and we are so happy to have an excuse to buy a new coffee maker. For sure it will NOT be a Zojirushi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate, with some serious problems","review":"The coffee maker works well enough, but it has too many problems for a unit of this price level:1. The coffee isn't all that hot to begin with and cools rapidly in the supposedly thermal carafe. If you don't plan to drink it all within a half hour or so, you will need a separate, more effective, carafe to keep it in.2. If you do keep it in the stainless steel carafe, you're supposed to use a separate lid to plug the inflow hole. That's an additional component that is easy to misplace. Once you lose it, you're sunk.3. The lid sticks very tightly after the coffee is made, and it has no easy handhold. You can either make your hand bloody trying to open it, or find a dish towel to provide some cushioning. And you have to be pretty strong to get it open.I will use this maker until it needs replacement because having paid for it, I don't want to just discard it. But I would not buy another one, nor would I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work after less than 6 months","review":"This coffeemaker made made okay coffee but burnt out after less than six months of use. I contacted the manufacturer. The representative informed me that I would have to ship the coffeemaker to one of their approved repair centers for repair. I stated that this was unacceptable and I wanted a new coffeemaker. No dice. The most they would offer was free shipping to the repair center. In my opinion, a coffeemaker that stops working after less than six months is defective and needs to be replaced, not repaired. Therefore, I'm sending it back to Amazon in hopes of getting a partial refund. I also thought that the coffeemaker was kind of basic for the price, but I thought I was getting a really good appliance that would last a while. What a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zojirushi EC-BD15BA Fresh Brew Theraml Carafe Coffe Maker","review":"I've always been happy and satisfied with Zojirushi product but not this one. The carafe's lid design is poor. It is generally difficult to open (not enough edge overhang to hold the lid to turn), but worst of all it traps water in cleaning and there is no way to flush it out.

I am truly sorry I brought this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Died","review":"I purchased this coffee maker because I was sick of the burnt coffee that occurs with the typical coffee maker with a glass carafe and hotplate. This one got great reviews so I went for it. It will keep your coffee hot for hours, if there is a full pot in the carafe. As you as you get to maybe half the pot, you have an hour, tops. To make matters worse, after about 2 years, without any warning at all, the coffee pot just stopped working. We opened it up to see if there was a simple fuse to be reset, but there's nothing you can get to, and obviously after that amount of time it is out of warranty. I think that all coffee makers eventually die, but why spend this kind of money when you can easily get one for a quarter of the price? This machine is simply not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a good cup of coffee, BUT...","review":"I was disappointed after spending $90.00 for this coffee machine. Cons: It is cheaply made, no insulation, very loud, and no water filter. Now the thing that makes me most crazy is the screw down cap on the carafe, it is extremely hard to open after you brew the coffee because the heat from the coffee distorts the cap,, making it next to impossible to unscrew to get your first cup of coffee. The cap has a thin edge with small bumps to grip, very bad design. It slowly gets easier as the coffee looses it heat. Pros: The water comes out at 200 degrees which is a good thing for making a great cup of coffee. The coffee stays hot for a long time like 5hrs. If you don't mind all the negatives than this is the coffee machine for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems, problems","review":"The Zojirushi (fun to say) worked well but had continuing problems. First the heating element went out at about ten months. The warranty covered it but it is a two hour drive for me to the authorized repair shop and I was without a coffee maker for three weeks while they got a new element. Then the carafe top split into two pieces. I am very good with adhesives but four tries with different adhesives failed to keep it glued. Between the heat and the torque to open and close it, it wouldn't stay glued. Then the heating element went out again. This was after the warranty, but the repair shop went to bat for me and Zojirushi repaired it for free. I was just ready to try again gluing the top when the distinct smell of melting plastic filled my kitchen. The unit won't hold water and hence is useless. Less than two years is an unacceptable life span for any appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it worked","review":"Worked great for 1 week, then it just quit.

Searching my Amazon purchase history (love that feature!), I found it was purchased over 6 years ago. I've used it just about every day for those six years, and never had a problem with it. But when it eventually does die I'll look to buy another one. All I've ever done for maintenance is oxy-clean the pot every few months to remove the stains. Great product!

Nice, hot, good tasting coffee. But the 10's unit on the display stop working on the 3rd day. It made it difficult to set the time. Amazon promptly sent a replacement unit. The 2nd unit had a slow leak. The first morning I found approximately 1 cup of water had leaked before it started brewing. It was very evident that it was coming from inside the unit not an accidental spill. I had high hopes for the unit from all the user reviews. It did make a good cup of coffee but I can't put my faith in a brand that became defective within days. I will look for a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahh, more than satisfied!","review":"I did a lot of research before settling on the Zojirushi EC-BD15 coffee maker. I am more than satisfied with the quality of the coffee it makes. The carafe works quite well my coffee stays hot for hours. I do take the time before brewing to place hot water in the carafe - only for the time it takes to fill the maker with water and get the grounds prepared - maybe this makes a difference in the heat retaining qualities of the carafe. I would highly recommend this coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does the job.","review":"I wanted to take the time to write a short review on this coffee machine. I was hesitant at first, buying a Japanese coffemaker, especially being Italian, but it seemed that if I wanted a quality thermal carafe at a decent price this was the product to buy. I've had it for a month and I must say along with the gold filter I bought with it, it is making a very good cup of coffee. Currently I'm brewing the Whole Foods Rainforest Blend. The coffee stays hot for at least 3 hours and stays warm for the whole day. It defineitely keeps the coffee fresh much longer than conventional carafes. I also like it because it's very fast, so in case I don't want to program it, I can still have my coffee ready within 2 or 3 minutes.The only thing I would change about it is that I would still have a warming plate at the base of the machine or a separate warming plate to plug in at the table. Otherwise it does the job it's supposed to do, which is a lot more than I can say for most products nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zojirushi Fresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker","review":"Good tasting coffee is reliably produced.

This is because there is a very small area to grasp on the lid. The lid needs to be improved in future models.2. The pot will drip almost every time you pour a cup of coffee.Other than those two items, this is a good coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I've owned LOTS of different coffeemakers over the years--the one from Starbucks was my favorite, until now. I did a lot of online and in-store research to find the Zojirushi and am so happy I did! This coffeemaker has all the features I wanted: a thermos (I've broken WAY more of my share of glass carafes), is easy to clean, simple to operate, the coffee produced is just the right temperature (I hate lukewarm coffee), it's not oversized, and the cost is affordable.From reading previous reviews, I note the \\"problem\\" w/ the filter--I also thought that the #4 was too large and actually cut it down a bit (because I had so many #4s on hand) but then found that some grounds wound up in the coffee. So, it's just fine if you hold the filter down when you bring the arm over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Works great and keeps coffee hot for hours. Only problems we have had were our own fault. I made one improvement in the lid. It has a black dot that is hard to see on the edge of the lid. You line up the dot with the pour spout to open the pot so you can pour. Took a round file and filed a notch in the edge of the lid next to the spot. Much easier to line it up with the spout now.Our unit just failed today but we are ordering another just like it. The first one was used at least twice a day for 3+ years. It earned it's keep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zojirushi EC-BD15BAFresh Brew Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker","review":"We bought one of these coffee makers a year ago and were so pleased with it that we bought another one for a vacation home.

As long as you put the plastic plug in the hole in the top, it stays hot for hours.Negative-After brewing the screw on lid is difficult to loosen. Need a paper towel or napkin to grap edge to open. The #4 filters don't fit great..you must fold a little. If you forget to put the plastic disk / with plug, it cools faster & when you pour it comes out the spout & thru the hole in the top.All & all, worth the price & the annoyances are livable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"We are very happy with our Zojirushi coffee pot. It does indeed reach the desired temperature for a good cup of coffee. An added benefit for me is its size. I had grown tired of big bulky coffee pots taking up space on my counter; we are very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 months!","review":"I purchased this coffeemaker based on the great reviews. However, it is terrible:1. When the water is placed in the machine the night before (programmed to go on in the morning), the coffee is barely warm. I know you can pour warmer water in the coffeemaker right before making it, but what is the point of programming it for morning use if it can't prepare hot coffee?2. It is tall, bulky and cumbersome.3. After being used about 5 times per week, it broke after 2 months of use. Just stopped making coffee, I followed the manual, and used it according to directions.4. The coffee is not very good.5. It is expensive. Why waste your money on this?Don't waste your money! I rarely write reviews, unless I wish someone had told me re the problems w/a product in advance. Unfortunately, that is the case w/this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of...coffee","review":"I read the reviews of this coffee maker not knowing the brand at all. The reviews were very positive, so I decided to give it a try, but was very unhappy with its design. First, it is much taller than most makers and barely fits under kitchen cabinets. Second, the coffee filter area is tight and does not fit most cone filters. This crunches the top of the paper cone leaving grounds in the holder (more cleaning required after each use). Third, it is true the controls are poorly placed on the right side of the maker (why, I do not know). This makes it very difficult to start and program without moving it from a good location on the counter. Fourth, the carafe top is in three parts which I am sure I will loose the top cover had I kept this maker in my home.So, as you can tell I returned this item due to its poor design and I am still searching for a suitable replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward and annoying","review":"I've had this coffee maker for 6 months now. I can't recommend it. Why?There are so many awkward things about it.1) The basket is not easy to seat. You have to continually turn it until it finds its right place.2) If you don't seat the basket correctly, the water overflows in the basket and you have grounds and coffee all over the counter.3) The carafe must be seated exactly. If it's a 16th of an inch off center the water again overflows and ditto to #1.4) It's not easy to see the little red ball that indicates the water level.5) The carafe is awkward to pour. It spits and sputters whether full or almost empty. Ergonomically, it is the worst I've seen.6) Items 1 - 3 happen about once every two weeks; 4 & 5 happen every time.7) I recommend you look elsewhere. I preferred my Mr. Coffee for $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zojirushi Coffe Thermal Carafe","review":"Used the product for two weeks and quality of the coffee is acceptable but encountered an unwelcomed surprise this morning---freshly brewed coffee on the counter, floor, drawers and behind the frig.

I will be more cautious in the future. We had a Delonghi coffee maker and were very happy with it until the carafe broke. Did some research and purchased this one. The cap to the coffee maker holds water that you can't even get out without shaking it vigorously. I contacted the company and they kept sending me replacement caps. They all did the same thing. I even drilled holes in it for more drainage but it didn't help. Will buy something else the next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"This coffee maker works just fine.

I'd exhort Zojirushi to fix the design of this machine, to deliver higher-temperature water. The design is beautiful and elegant, but alas I cannot drink the design, so am returning this product with regret, and sticking with my current favorite, the KitchenAid coffee machine (KCM222CU)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"First of all, on the Zojirushi, the lid on the carafe has raised edges, and they are very uncomfortable on the hand when trying to remove the lid. (I'm a paramedic and lift weights regularly, so no, I don't have delicate hands). Second, the \\"water-viewing system\\" is very poor quality. It takes no small amount of time for the little red ball to rise when water is added, and most of the time, it must be tapped to get it to move. It has now stopped working completely. Third, it does not keep the coffee warm very long. And yes, I even warm the carafe with hot water before I run the maker. I end up having to microwave nearly every cup! I am in the process of attempting to return this piece of excrement.... (By the way, I had a Gevalia carafe before this one, and it was wonderful)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Engineered Carafe and Clogs","review":"1. Coffee carafe lid poorly engineered and clogs if coffee grounds overflow filter basket. This happened on three occasions including course ground coffee as instructed by manual. Due to the poor engineering of carafe lid the unit cannot be used unattended. (Coffee flows all over the counter) This is a critical part of the unit design for timed auto start.2. Carafe spout design pours very slowly and prompts the user to open it further that results in the lid coming off and spilling the coffee.Returned the unit and went back to Consumer Reports for recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"love my zoji!","review":"I bought this two years ago because my sister in law and niece both had one and I love it.

NO KIDDING!!","review":"Like many unhappy buyers of this coffee pot, I did substantial research before I bought this maker (I bought a Zojirushi Rice cooker before; and that was super). I was totally shocked to find out the timer and the power went out of order after only 1 day's usage!! None of the buttons worked. I tweaked and tried different electrical outlets in the house without success. The carafe looks good, but the whole machine is useless nonetheless :-( Unfortunately, the machine was bought 3 yrs ago; only I waited 3 years to use it. So the warranty expired a long time ago. What a huge disappointment!! What a waste!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer Reports Missed on This One","review":"Though this coffee maker was highly rated by Consumer Reports, I could not get hot coffee out of it. I did an internet search, and found the temperature of the water I used might affect the temperature of the coffee. Instead of cold water, I tried room temp and hot tap water.

Most times it only brews one or two cups and stops brewing. If we start brewing again it well brew another one or two cups and then stop again. I can no longer brew a complete pot.I can no longer return is since it's past Amazon's 30-day return policy.

I especially liked the flavor of coffee that was not scorched by being kept warm by a warming plate. Like everything, it eventually had to be replaced. A thermal carafe was the #1 requirement, eventually choosing the Zojirushi EC-BD15. Although taller, the BD15 utilizes less counter space and is easier to use than the B&D. My only complaint is that the B&D brewed coffee was warmer and stayed warm longer than the BD15 brew. I am going to try preheating the thermal carafe, that might make a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zojirushi Coffee Brewer","review":"I am very pleased with the coffee maker and especially like tha I can program it and have coffee ready when I arise in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"good coffee/ Still going","review":"I got this to replace a broken coffee maker. I do not know all the special things that make a good coffee maker work but I can say this unit makes good coffee. Better than the last Carafe type maker I had. Easy to use, carafe works as good or better than the last one I had. Timer works good. Everything is as it should be so far. My only complaint is as stated in other reviews I read about this coffee maker. The typical #4 filter does not fit just right but they work fine and once you get used to that little quirk im sure you will be happy with this product.UPDATE 9-28-2011Everything is still working as good as the first day. Still makes great coffee, Still keeps coffee fresh and hot. This has lasted longer then I thought. It is the one thing i just dont give a second thought to it is always there working like it should.

It is unreliable and consistantly overflows - making a mess of your countertops and and drawers near it. Zojirushi first commented that they had never heard of this problem - even though it is posted all over the web. Then they changed their tune, and asked me if I was grinding my own beans - as that could be causing the problem. I brought to their attention, that if this machine could not handle fresh ground coffee, it should be advertised as such. I am throwing this machine in the garbage - where it belongs, as I do not have the time in my morning to watch my coffee brew, and jump up and pull the plug when it starts overflowing. Zojirushi needs to step up to the plate, acknowledge they have a design flaw, and refund any monies spent on this useless product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spill Spill Spill","review":"This COULD have been a good coffee maker.

This coffee maker only reaches the optimal brew temp of 195-205 degrees for the last 2-3 cups of water. The first 7-8 cups brew around 180-185 degrees. I even tried pre-heating the water on stove to 100+ degrees before pouring it in and brewing, and it still can't brew higher than 185 for the first 7 or 8 cups.

Bought this because of the positive reviews but was very disappointed in the quality of the coffee. Using the same amount of water and coffee as I did with the Krups, this unit brewed coffee that tasted bitter and weak. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the temperature is too low and when cold milk is added you wind up with a lukewarm cup of coffee. I'm returning this and purchasing the Krups Moka Brew which will hopefully make coffee similar to my old Krups unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor ergonomics and very thin, cheap plastic - returned immediately","review":"Though highly reviewed, I couldn't help but think that the folks who reviewed this positively must not be coffee drinkers. The top on the coffee pot is very hard to remove because it has small spokes around it which provide the only \\"grip\\" to open it, and the spokes cut into your fingers - so much so that at a minimum, you need to open it with a towel (I'm 40 and mechanically inclined, by no means frail).

The carafe top is difficult to turn, and you have to turn it if you want coffee. The carafe doesn't cleanly engage with the filter basket, if you don't precisely place it. The carafe, when closed will leak if someone tries to pour coffee. The carafe top requires a separate top to seal the hole so the coffee doesn't cool off. But the seal isn't tight, so coffee can leak out if someone tries to pour it and the carafe top is in the \\"closed\\" position. Overall the carafe system is unnecessarily difficult and awkward to use. So much so we had to return ours.The rest of the unit is beautifully designed. Timer. Controls on the side (where spillage won't seep in). Water level indicator. Thermal carafe (so coffee doesn't get ruined by overheating, yet stays warm.

It is not solid what-so-ever. The carafe is a joke - as my coffee is luke warm within two hours. A small piece of plastic (the \\"lid\\") you have to put on after brewing just does not cut it. The review that mentions it does not really take a \\"4\\" filter is right on...you have to be carful the hot water spout (not sure what that is called) is over the ground beans and does not get hung up on the \\"4\\" filter paper....or you have a mess on your hands. Maybe I got a lemon - but the water also does not saturate the beans, leaving part of them actually dry after the brewing cycle.

The worst of it is, that is how it pours - you have to twist it to get your coffee out - no easy button to open the spout. We kept is so long because the coffee stays hot and delicious.

It is VERY difficult to open after brewing coffee. Definitely not for the elderly or anyone who makes coffee first thing in the morning.My other complaint is the plastic cap that goes on top of the carafe lid. It is designed to keep the heat from escaping after brewing. The problem is if you forget to remove it before brewing the next pot. If you forget the coffee will end up all over your counter and floor.

The second works, but there's nothing special about it. Other machines keep the coffee hot as well and are not so difficult to open. The plastic is cheap too and you have to turn the machine to see water level and controls. I don't need an extra plastic piece to keep the coffee hot.

I started to look at WalMart, KMART, Kohls, All the kitchen stores I could find. I couldn't find anything so I started to look online. I went to Amazon.com and ordered this Zojirushi EC-BD15 Thermal Coffee Maker. When it came it looked really good with a good design. It had a metal coating which made it look more contemparary. It started to work very good and the coffee was no exception. It was 100% until a few months ago. Now you can't set the timing so my mom can't start it in the night and have it in the morning. It was kind of a waste after that. I exchanged it and now I have a new one. No complaints so far, but lets ride this one out.

Well, I couldn't open the carafe to get the coffee out and it took me about 4-5 mins to drain the contents . I am really shocked at all the rave reviews that were listed for this maker.

Sadly, however, it's one fatal flaw for us is that the coffee is just not hot enough -- even when freshly brewed into the carafe. We really tried to convince ourselves that it was our imagination, but it wasn't. So ... the pot went back and we've opted for the Cuisinart DCC-1200 in Black and Stainless Steel.

I kept reading on, waiting for Newman to develop into something but it just bogged down into some psycho-babble about man's evolution into something crueler, yet Newman showed the most emotion of anyone.

Many episodes, including Pilar's story about the episode in her villiage, Maria's rape, and Sodo's death could be ommited or at least greatly summarized. Although the book is almost five hundred pages long it could be summarized in ten pages. The love affair between Jordon and Maria is overly idealized and is extremely unbelieveable. Maria's bland and submissive personality and their dialouge make me physically sick. It seems appropriate to say that Hemingway had absolutely no idea about women.

Even being imprisoned and exiled by the communists, he still served in their military hospitals during wartime because he believed it was his duty to save lives, even those of his enemies.An amazing, inspiring work by Archdeacon Vasiliy Marushchak that is highly readable and inspiring.

I am about halfway through the book and I am ready to just forget about it, but I keep thinking that he will FINALLY get to the point and tell me how this miscreant got the punishment he so RICHLY deserves.

Olsen went into way, way too much detail about Eli's gay sexlife. I'm no homophobe, but after awhile, I became grossed out by descriptions of 'ball stretchers, cock rings and fisting'. It's like Olsen himself had the obsession.

Ms. Molenda is portrayed to be an expert, however, she hasn't really given a lot of good information in this book. I question some of her methods in the care of handfeeding and formula content. Misleading information like this can confuse a new breeder. She shouldn't have written in absolutes but recommendations instead. I have found other breeders that have more information and are much more knowledgeable in Parrotlet care. Unfortunately, they have not written a book.

Simply turn it on, use the zoom as needed and snap away. I even used it to record an underwater movie and the microphone picked up the sound of the water hitting the case. Very cool.The only issue is we accidently dropped the camera while it was in a beach bag. I think the most protruding button on the back which controls the function set took the impact and depressed the button on the camera very hard. The button still works, but you have to press much harder than before.If it was exposed to salt water, be sure to soak the case in fresh water for a while, and then dry it with a towel.The bottom-line - this is a great case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing ease of control","review":"Great case and easy to use.

It was a lot of fun to me. The instructor is funny at times, as opposed to other instructors that are too serious and tended to be boring. This is the one guitar dvd I would recommend if you're just beginning, because it kept me practicing to learn more songs. He teaches you the chords as an introductory of playing a song and the songs get tougher as you progress. The songs range from bluegrass to country. I also have an electric guitar as well as an acoustic guitar, and would like to learn to play music other than country and blue grass, although I doubt the songs I really want to play are available for lessons, but this dvd is a great start to the right direction of learning them later on your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good instructive DVD","review":"Acoustic Guitar Method DVD is super easy to follow along with and David Hamburger's presentation is unpretentious. He is not about impressing you with his ability or how many music terms he can lay on you or blowing you away with lightning fast riffs. He is truly focused on a \\"building-block\\" approach; laying a good foundation and then allowing the student to advance at your pace.

Straight off the bat I feel comfortable changing lyrics, making me feel more creative, and he even encourages changing cords up. Sometimes I get a little strict about things, this is a nice relaxed approach and I'm loving it. I've started the dvd a couple of weeks ago and am only about halfway through the first video and I have enough practice material to last a couple of weeks without watching further yet. I like that it will take me time to get through this, it makes the cost even more worthwhile. If you like deadpan dry wit, he'll entertain you while you learn. Reading other reviews I see that some methods don't show how to play songs while you learn, so I appreciate this even more.From an absolute beginner's standpoint, this is a great video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, I've read it all before..","review":"There was absolutely nothing new to this book.

The descriptions of the shellings, and the description of the battle for the Pimple will leave you stunned. This is one of the best books I have ever read (or re-read several times).

They branch out a bit with a rockin' \\"Born Too Slow,\\" along with more familiar sounding tracks. Overall, I like the album, but I wonder how much longer I'll be listening to The Crystal Method, The Chemical Brothers, et al. It sounds like the genre's pretty well played out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legion of yawns.","review":"This CD is definitely TCM's most uninspired work. There isn't too much by way of originality in the songs, too many tunes with vocal accompaniment, and all together kind of boring. Guest guitarist WES BORLAND (formerly of LIMP BISCUIT) is way underused, especially on the second to best track: WEAPONS OF MASS DISTORTION. Halfway into the tune you think it's going to kick into something full blown cool and never does. The highlight track is ACETONE, and is a reminder that CRYSTAL METHOD still has chops. However that certainly is not appearant on the rest of this album. Weak entry, especially after the inventive COMMUNITY SERVICE, and the do-all/say-all of techno recordings-VEGAS."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer breaking ground.","review":"Mainly this showing is just boring. And after seeing TCM in a DJ set, and hearing what they choose to spin for the crowd, I just can't listen to them anymore. They get a star for obviously having some technical skills... but that doesn't equal sounding good."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHEW!!!!!","review":"Man, if I had believed the negative reviews I read and saw posted here, I would have hesitated on a for-certain purchase. Glad I didn't wait. Don't believe the anti-hype. CM are still movin and groovin. In particular, tracks 2,9, 10 and 11. Believe, me, it's not often four tunes jump out at me anymore, so I consider that well worth the investment. Go with the flow, listen to it more than once and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally Crystal","review":"Rock on.I'm actually not that big of a fan of the single \\"Born too Slow\\" but the rest of the CD more more MORE than makes up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds more like a Jam session than a record...","review":"One my most personal seminal moments with electronic music was when the acid rock tinged 'Keep Hope Alive' hit my ears. Then the amazing 'Get Busy Child' followed it up with an even more amazing recipe for bouncy synths and beats.Many years later 'Legion of Boom' fails the attempt of making an exciting record. The beats are typically arranged and the musical arrangments seem to take me nowhere. I'm caught in a loop of the same sounds and the same tempos. They should have titled this release 'Moebius Loops' because every track has a real ground-hog day effect on me.This album is nothing new and it's utterly boring. It sounds dated and it lacks any innovation. It feel not as well thought out as previous works by these lads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boom? ...more of a bust","review":"I had high hopes for Legion of Boom. I'm a huge fan of Vegas, but didn't enjoy Tweekend nearly as much, and was hoping for more of an upswing in excitement.I don't go very deep into the techno/dance scene - BT, Oakenfold & Van Dyk are my biggest interests... but like I said, Boom just doesn't cut it for me. Too slow, too repetitive and just too boring. There's nothing here that's new or exciting, and the whole thing sounds like a lackluster effort. Every tempo seems the same (slow!), and even in my car with a 300 watt sub, I'm not hearing any decent lows. Vegas had all sorts of moments where something unique caught me off guard and made me smile. You know, the \\"Awwww Yeah!\\" effect... There's not a single moment like that on Boom. Dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legion of boom??? Where is the boom???","review":"Well... I have been a method fan for a long time. Vegas and tweekend both have that sound that just makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck. Vegas and tweekend were PHAT sounding records. If you need a good dose of some synth bass, and some dope beats check out those two records.Legion of BOOM seems to have left out the BOOM. I would have to disagree with the other reviewers and say that this record has much less life and phatness than the other two. Nothing on this disc even matches the sheer in your face bass on PHD. If this record wasn't put out by the crystal method I probably would have liked it a bit better. (because I expect more out of the method) I do enjoy the disc, but I think the talent is there and these two could have done much better. No tracks really jump out at me as being any better than the others. All of the tracks seem to blend together. One other note... if you get a chance check them out live. They put on a quality show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Vocals and Lyrics wreck the tunes","review":"This new CD struck me by surprise in a bad way: it has lot more vocals than usual and the tracks have a nearly constant vocal hip-hop thing going. No thanks. I like my electronica a little less grimy. One person said listen to UNKLE, but that is also electronica with a voice-heavy hip-hop flavor. Be warned: this CD is quite different from Crystal Method's previous stuff. It is a shame because I liked their previous stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"this CD Rules ! ! ! ! !","review":"I loved \\"Vegas\\" and \\"Tweekend\\", but have to say I think I like this one even more. Not a bad track on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment...","review":"Having been to several of TCM's concerts in different venues, I was dying to hear this album. I can't say that it was better than their previous two releases but it's growing on me. I'd say half the album works for me and is truly different. A few songs leave me laughing because of the childish lyrics and undramatic bass lines. Maybe it's (Legion) so different that I have to learn to like TCM in a new way(?) I'll be pulling out my Vegas album again to recall the good 'ole days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legion of Boom","review":"would you rather go to Vegas or the Golden Acorn Indian Gaming Casino?Sure the Golden Acorn is fun, has a nice buffet and feels a bit like Vegas. It still lacks the dirty corrupt sinful call girl strippers and Elvis.."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome as expected","review":"The Method are once again serving us those original beats. This is their most diverse CD yet, though, with songs ranging from synthetic rock to club friendly big beat. I expect some really awesome remixes coming from these works leading to a possible sequel to Community Service. How rad would that be? This album is a must for those who have even the slightest interest in dance music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good; dark and brooding","review":"I like this album, because it is a lot less mainstream then their others. Now that is not the sole reason, but I really like the dark aura that surrounds this album. It is not as high octane as their previous works, but the dark mellowness is nice. Also, to all of you who say Vegas is their best album are morons. Vegas was good don't get me wrong, but Tweekend is where they came into their own. Also, the tracks at the end of Tweekend are really good. Tweekend has a nice blend of high octane and then some nice tracks for the cool down. With Legion the whole album is pretty mellow, and I like that. It's kind of like a continuous mix that stays constant throughout and throws in some new stuff here and there. So, if you like TCM get this album it's pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, dont blow your money","review":"Being a fan of the Vegas Crystal Meth, I was excited when I heard \\"Born Too Slow\\" hit the air waves and couldn't wait to check out the CD. Turns out its a big disappointment. The guest appearances are uninspiring, the beats tend go no where, and there's just well...no kick. It's a decent album, but decent drum n bass aint worth buying because well...its drum and bass...you need something to keep your attention, something to set your act apart from others. Or at the very least some nice guest acts to keep intermediary songs fresh. Let me put it this way: the album will bore you to tears. Think some beats with an occasional repetitive voice saying \\"synthesizer, crystalizer\\" over and over. If you aren't paying attention it's nice to work to though.Stand out tracks: Bound too long, I know its you, born too slow"},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff but not quite their best though","review":"This album is kinda like a mixture of tweekend and vegas, there's a couple of rock influenced tracks like \\"born too slow\\" and \\"WMD\\" and there's some stuff that sounds like the classic vegas stuff like \\"i know it's you\\" It's not as excessively produced as tweekend was, more bare bones in letting the beats take over. overall its a very good album but not a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"TCM may be our next Milli Vanilli. How does a group produce a CD like Vegas and 5 years later produce something like Legion of Boom? The CD should be titled \\"THE REGRESSION MOVEMENT\\". This CD was so disappointing that I decided not to give them any more money by seeing their show in LA. When other artists (like BT) are out there developing as musicians and putting out music that is elevating the electronica genre it is a crime to invest in a CD like Legion of Boom. There isn't even a redeeming song to rationalize buying this...Well I should have listened to the other reviews. Don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was hooked the first time I heard their first LP, Vegas, about 5 years ago or so. When Tweakend came out, I thought, decent album, but doesn't touch Vegas.Legion of Boom is a very boring album. Everytime I try to put it in I give it the benefit of a doubt. I figure maybe the last time I listened to it I was just tired, or I wasn't open to a new sound.Wrong.This album is just boring as hell. There is nothing in this album that keeps my attention. For anyone who thinks they are just growing musically, well, just keep thinking that I guess. They sound bored. Maybe they've made too much money with their songs appearing in commercials and movies, and they have just gotten lazy.Come on guys, light a fire under you so we can be wowed again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boom baby...BOOM!","review":"I'm loving Wes Borlands guitar playing on this CD. Favorite track I would go with song 2 - Born to slow. They have the best mixing that I have ever heard. Big Crystal Method fan of Vegas and Tweekend and now of Legion.

From the hardcore Fat Joe, to the lyrically underated Joey Crack, to the on the verge of superstar Don Cartagena. From intro to outro this album never failed to keep my ears listening. The two tracks which I still can't get enough of are \\"John Blaze\\" which Joe enlists the help of Rap superstars Nas, Raekwon, Jadakiss and Big Punisher, and \\"Bet Ya Man Can't(Triz)\\" in which the virtually unknown Terror Squad helps out. The only real disapointing track was \\"Good Times\\" which he has two members on Bone-Thugs-n-Harmony, but that track is easily forgiven with songs like \\"Don Cartegena\\", \\"My World\\", and \\"Terror Squadians\\". I think anyone who wants to hear how Rap sounds should turn to Fat Joe's most brilliant album \\"Don Cartagena\\" and get a taste of the unofficial mayor of the Bronx."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is hip hop coming to?","review":"Why is it that every rapper all of a sudden thinks he's in the mafia?

All three projects we attempted were a complete bust. We spent hours collecting all the parts needed, then cutting and preparing.

After several attempts and finally getting the projects built, they wouldn't work anyway.

There is some new work that is particularly strong, like the driving house-influenced \\"Anger - Rare Force 2 Meg Mix\\" and the calm (yet tense) Bossa Nova / Alva Noto ambient mix \\"Insensatez\\", which finishes the CD. The five videos on the accompanying disc are well-done and show Sakamoto at different stages of his career, including a precious early live performance of \\"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\\". Since Sakamoto has too much tremendous work to fit on one compilation CD, it's not surprising that a lot of significant work is left out, like anything from what I consider his best CD, \\"Smoochy\\", and the best song from his \\"BTTB\\" CD - \\"Aqua\\".

Full manual control is also nice. How good is the picture quality? I found that when mounted on a tripod, the A510 would take sharper pictures than a EOS Digital Rebel using a $300 wide-angle lens.

You also CANNOT...I repeat CANNOT copy the photos from the camera to any type of a non local hard drive using their terrible software or drivers which makes these horrible for a business environment because you must copy everything local and then manually move them around.We already rolled these out at my employer or I would have suggested that all 13 of them that we purchased be sent back as junk.As for the camera itself it is okay but I would personally never buy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok camera...rebate declined?!","review":"I bought this with the iP4000R Wireless Photo Printer to get the $70 rebate for the 2 items together.

Picture quality is great, lcd viewer is easily viewable, multiple settings, and manual control of focus, exposure and shutter speed, plus movie mode!. Takes awesome pictures in near complete darkness (with flash on)...in focus and vibrant colors.Cons: None really, considering the price but if I had a choice:; I would like the movie length to be only limited by the size of the sd card, instead of 3 minutes, also to be able to adjust zoom level in movie mode. However, I consider this a camera with the added bonus of 3 minute movies, if I had wanted something for movies more than pictures I would have purchased something else.If you want an awesome digital camera at a lower -end price...look no further, you can find cheaper, but not with these features and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice photos, love the movie feature","review":"I'm pretty sold on Canon for digital camera's. I was delighted when I saw this camera at a good price. The ability to make little movie clips is great. I bought a couple Canon 110's for work and I love them too. The A510 has a better zoom, (4x vs. 2x), and works on regular AA batteries. I believe you can even change lenses. I probably won't, but that seems like a nice feature. I suggest getting a bigger memory card, (generic brands are fine), and a rechargable battery pack. A case is nice too. The Canon case is good quality and pretty cheap.The things I don't like are the slightly larger size of this camera. It's small, but not as small as the 110. which is like a pack of cards. I also prefer the 110's metal case. It seems more rugged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little camera.","review":"This camera took great shots and was easy to use. I liked the large LCD screen and the settings available.I would definitely recommend getting another memory card (or two or three) because the one included only allows about 20 photos at the best resolution, and rechargeable batteries are a must.One thing I didn't care for was the slow shutter lag. At least to me, it seemed slower than other cameras I've had. It was frustrating to take pictures of my dogs or my child because they'd have already moved by the time the camera responded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect First Digital Camera","review":"My wife and I have never owned a digital camera and this one is perfect for us. It's small, uses AA batteries instead of a fancy camera battery, has a movie feature, and a large display screen. Make sure you buy a memeory card with the camera, though, because the one it comes with only holds 16-17 pictures. Also, if you use the camera a lot, turning it on and off, it goes through batteries pretty quickly. It only needs two at a time and AA are cheap, though, so this was not a problem for us. And the \\"slow shutter speed\\" talked about in other reviews has not been a problem either. I don't feel like it's any slower than any digital camera I've used before. Overall, a good buy (for the price especially!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon A510 \\"service\\"","review":"Bought the camera as a gift. My son-in-law used it less than three weeks and it would not turn on. He is in Iraq and sent it home. I contacted Canon and sent it in. The turn around time was less than two weeks. It works now but they scratched it badly around the screws used to disassemble the camera and added an extra one on the display for free. Poor, poor repair. Just beware of Canon \\"service\\". I'm a long time Canon user myself and own 7 film and digital cameras and have had good luck with all of them but be very afraid of their \\"service\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter camera","review":"Given this camera is not as small as others, it offers great value for money in the starter camera genre. With a 4x optical lens and a 3.2mp resolution it gives me great pics for a fraction of the cost of similarly equipped smaller cameras.This is a nifty little thing that you can carry around anywhere and snap pics with. The portrait function is especially nice. I've taken quite a few stills that came out awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon A510 camera...From L. Orr.","review":"I agree with M. Arse with the 2star rating. I was disappointed with this camera from the beginning. Not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light. I'm interested in the 7 Mp camera Canon offers. I've read that it has much better shutter speed. Recommended??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lens barrier trouble!","review":"My A510 will not open the lens barrier all the way when the power is turned on. I sent it to Canon under warranty and it was returned to me with the same problem only worse. Last (and only) Canon for me. Returned to Canon again but it's still not working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great value when working","review":"I've had the A510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2M camera.After six months the lens and cover have jammed and I noticed that many Amazon reviewers have had the same issue. One evening I took several pictures and the next morning the camera would not operate.I'm hoping the service center can provide me better service than some of the reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shutter jams","review":"I bought this for my son and within a few days, the shutter jammed. He was still able to use the camera by manually pushing the shutter open. He really liked it except for the shutter problem, until he dropped it in the river. He is waiting for it to dry out. If it survives this, I'll change the rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera","review":"Good size, good features. AA battery power is a major reason I bought this camera because you can find replacements almost anywhere and not be dead in the water if your batteries go dead. Good low light images. Functions are fairly simple to use. As long as you are not expecting an SLR then you will be impressed by this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera but not my ideal","review":"I like a simple point and shoot camera that I can quickly capture images of my kids with. This works for me for the most part, but there are areas that bother me. The shutter speed is quite slow, and if my kids are moving, I often get blurred images. All other things are great--it's a great shape with a good hand-feel, the screen is good, and the images are nice. Very good for basic user. The shutter speed and blurred images are very problematic for me though, and I would ideally get a camera that did not have these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon Powershot A510 negatives","review":"I bought the Canon Powershot A510 two years ago and was very happy with the quality of pictures. However, during the past several months I noticed that my battery charge was not lasting as long as it should. I first blamed it on my charger and bought a new one. Its not the batteries or the charger, its the camera. It completely drains the batteries within seconds. The camera is now unusable and I probably won't buy another Canon camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for a first camera, but not for a second...","review":"I have owned a Powershot S200 for some years and loved it, but it finally gave up. I thought the A510 would be an upgrade...it is not. It is just as heavy and quite a bit larger. Night shots are very difficult to get right, and you can not trust the auto mode. It also has a less sturdy feel to it. Well I'm gpnna keep it but am certainly disappointed. As a first digital camera it is probably great, but if you are used to digital and are looking for an upgrade, this is probably not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the Canon ELPH models better","review":"I have owned this camera for about a year and I have never really enjoyed it. For a point and shoot it is bad, it takes pictures way too slowly and I often miss out on a good shot. It is also not as user friendly as I would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings. While I enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects). I have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but I rarely get a good picture when I need it. I never had these problems with my ELPH s200. This camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. If given the option I would not buy this camera again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not again","review":"Well, we are on our third Powershot of the same model. The first one was stolen and the next two broke within 2 weeks of having them. First it started by not turning on, then we would change the batteries and it would work for a few pictures, then the lens wouldn't open all the way! What a pain! I'm glad to see so many others are happy and not having this problem, but I think its time for me to try a different camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Camera","review":"I bought this camera as a gift rcommended by an owner. For the money you can't beat it. It is easy to operate, light, comfortable in the hand, and best of all uses AA batteries. The results are great, especially for recreational use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"Overall this is a great camera. It has all the settings of a regular 35mm camera, so your picture-taking can get pretty advanced; and it's great just pointing and shooting as well. This is my first digi cam and I'm very pleased with it; however, I was surprised at how quickly it sucked up the batteries if it was on for a long period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flash recycle way too long","review":"I used this camera for 3 days, and returned it back (to Amazon) yesterday.Why I returned it:- Everytime you take a picture with flash, the camera displays the picture for 3 seconds, after which it goes blank for 8-10 seconds. You can not take another picture till that time.- It takes 3-4 seconds to achieve focusSo imagine you're taking a picture of your kid cutting his birthday cake, and someone stepped right into your frame... you can not take another picture till 8-12 seconds until the flash is recharged, and it tries to focus again. By that time, the scene and moment are gone.I used to own a Canon A75 before (and a Canon A70 before that), so I'm a hard-core Canon user. But I am very disappointed with this camera. I would advise folks to check other forums on digital camera sites and then decide if they want to buy this camera or not. The user reviews are not pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera","review":"Great camera! Good image quality, easy to use, plenty of modes.Definetely recommended.Only thing I don't like is that the dial can be a little hard to turn sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go bad too soon","review":"I purchased a 510 PowerShot in summer of 2005. After couple time of use the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work anymore. I cound't take any picture anymore. I contacted Canon over this and they ask me to pay shiping to send the camera to them to fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, quick clean up","review":"This carpet cleaner is great for quick clean-ups. It gets the crumbs and lint off my area rug in dining room when I want to do a quick clean up in between regular vacuuming chores. Only major complaint is that the handle is two-pieces and comes apart easily, so you have to lift the sweeper from the bottom of the handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Push sweeper.","review":"Sturdy, quick, efficient and uses no electricity or dreaded batteries! We have a powerful central vacuum, several a/c vacuums and several irobot (battery powered), vacuums. My wife would forsake them all for her Bissell push sweeper. She is now buying them for gifts. It really is handy and does a great job. It gets into the carpet nap better than you would expect. I would not recommend using this for a whole house or very large areas, but for spot, area and quick cleaning, it's great. Well built and fairly priced too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Not-Sturdy Sweeper","review":"The sweeping part of this Bissell works just fine but as many other reviewers have noted, the handle falls apart if you breathe on it wrong. My husband actually screwed the sections of the handle itself together but now it separates at the point where the handle meets the sweeper. And don't bother reading the directions about how to put this together. The handle problem persists no matter what you do.I'd recommend getting down to your local chain store (as much as I dislike recommending any of them for anything) and get a carpet sweeper with a handle that's in one piece. This one is not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless on hardwood floors","review":"The other reviews convinced me this product was what I was looking for - quick and easy cleanups in between major vacuuming. I unpacked it as soon as I got it and tried it out on the cracker crumbs on our hardwood floor left from lunch. What it would pick up was only the smallest of crumbs, and even some of those it just brushed around on the floor. I decided to return it immediately. Problem now is getting the handle unassembled to repack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so sturdy - it fell apart","review":"This thing basically self destructed the first week. The handle pieces wouldn't stay together and when I pushed down on the handle to tighten the pieces together the base fell apart. Not worth the money!

Like others have mentioned, it does not work well on hard floors, and does not work much at all in corners or edges, so I will still have to vacuum those spots. Works wonderfully on very tight short pile. I dump out a fair amount of \\"floof\\" so it does pick up a lot of stuff. You do have to figure out how to empty both chambers so that you don't miss the garbage. Contrary to earlier reviews, I find that the handle is strong and holding up well. Best $27 I've spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Functional","review":"This sweeper is more like a child's toy than an adult's tool. It works only when pushed in the forward direction and barely does the job for small quick pick-ups.

Would not recommend unless purchased for a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirt Pusher??","review":"I am very disappointed with THE BISSELL STURDY SWEEP SWEEPER. It does not perform well, at all. I can sweep over a small bit of paper 15-20 times before I actually need to bend down and pick it up by hand. It pushes dirt around the floor before sweeping it up.

As far as the negative reports about it's pick-up power especially pet hair, again no problem here. I have 6 cats and so there's a goodly amount of fur about.

You have connect about 4 pieces of metal to create the metal pole which connects the little sweeper to the handle but within a minute of normal use it falls apart and does not stay together.For the few seconds it did stay together it did clean my rug pretty well however it is completely useless for ceramic tiles.

Read it. You don't know camelot until you've read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am Mordred: A Tale From Camelot","review":"This is the one of the well-written and enjoyable books about Arthurian lore. It is about Sir Mordred of Lothian, son of the Very King Arthur and his step-sister Morgause. Even before Mordred was born, the wizard Merlin prophesied that Arthur would have an evil and unnatural son. He predicted that one day the king would be killed in battle by him. As Mordred grows up, he must live with the fact that he must one day carry out his fate. I really liked this book. Each character is thoroughly believable and realistic. Unlike nearly every other book about him, \\"I Am Mordred\\" takes a close look at not the treacherous villian, but the human side of him in this unforgettable tale from Camelot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gripping, Unfortunately","review":"It had seemed like a good book when I had started reading it, but, no, it wasn't, and for a lot of different reasons. The first (and probably the most annoying) is the way the author sets this character up: in a good story, you'd want to make your audience sad when they die. When Mordred died, I was very happy. When Arthur lived, I was disappointed. When Mordred didn't die, I wondered what the point of the story was. To make everyone hate Mordred? Um, that's already happened, Miss Springer. The second, is its details, which were not only boring, but pointless. The third, is that I couldn't stop reading it. Really, I wanted to rush this over to the nearest recycling center, but the book won't relieve you of its awfulness. If ever you concider this book, DON'T READ IT! I'd never read a bad book until I read I AM MORDRED."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no longer a line between good and evil...","review":"IT wasn't that this book was poorly written or that it was totally bad. It's just the author has taken both heros and villians and turned the tables completely around.In all the other books I have read, Mordred is an evil, treacherous villian no better than his half sister, the witch Morgan le Fay. Here he is portrayed as merely confused and scared. I for one am also scared. We have lost the boundry between good and evil and when that boundry is taken away people begin to really think good is evil and evil is good. And when that happens, total anarchy ensues.I highly recommend that you DO NOT read this book as well as it's counterpart \\"I am Morgan Le Fay\\". THe philosophy is too dangerous to get involved in.HOwever, if you're looking for a great story from Camelot I highly recommend \\"KIng Arthur and His KNights\\" By ANthony MOckler. I have read many king Arthur books and by far this is the best out there. At least someone can get the story right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Mordred","review":"I Am Mordred, by Nancy SpringerIn \\"I Am Mordred,\\" Springer recounts the life of King Arthur's illegitimate son, the son who will kill him. Mordred's typically gotten a bad rap or been ignored in Authurian stories, and Springer takes a different approach and tries to show what led to him killing Arthur.Because Mordred was conceived by Arthur and his half-sister, he was considered morally evil as soon as he was born. Springer examines Mordred through the lens of today, where most people assume children are born innocent. In this book, Mordred is an ordinary teen, struggling to come to terms with learning who his parents are, sibling rivalry, and the feeling that he doesn't quite fit in.I thought the premise was interesting, but the book doesn't stand out much for me. It's a book I read, momentarily enjoyed, and forgot a few days later. I'd recommend this for fans of Aurthruian tales, or anyone interested in Mordred.2/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saddest Story Ever Told","review":"Nancy Springer creates the most sympathetic \\"bad seed\\" character in Mordred. His tale of trying to fight his fate is intriguingly horrible and sad. Mordred finds love--in Nyneve as a mentor, in Gull as a companion, in Lynette as a possible love. And all of it is lost because of his curse.When Mordred and Arthur discuss their entwined fates and Mordred says, \\"What have I done?\\" the result is heart wrenching. By this point in the novel (Part Four) it has become abundantly clear that Mordred is a good soul, a fighter, someone to connect with and care about. And yet, he has no control over how his life will turn out.The death of Gull is one of the most upsetting deaths in all of literature. Mordred's one true companion, Mordred's only friend. When he buries her beautiful whiteness under the dirt, the starkness of the white/black contrast is fantastic.Cheers to Nancy Springer for such a powerful tale that always leaves me emotionally changed after reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Love it - parents - here are some sanity-saving tips","review":"My kids love this game - it has been a huge hit - they are Pokemon fans and they each have one, ages 6 and 9.

A quick adjustment makes the screen *much* easier to read.2) Sound can be turned off on the 'options mode' - and you will definitely want to do that (beep, beep, beep, agggghhh)The kids say they wish it had a color screen, but at $40, it's hard to expect that. They area also making their way through the games pretty fast - meaning that they may get bored with it after that - and its not expandable.

He played it for about 2 minutes and all the sudden the screen froze and it started making a clicking and humming sound. I took out the battery in hopes to \\"refresh\\" the Pokedex and even after taking the battery out it STILL made the noises!! So I put the battery back in, but it didn't fix it.

A Pokedex is meant to be a Pokemon encyclopedia, used for checking information on Pokemon. This, however, has games, incorrect information, and a screensaver. Honestly, why does it need a screensaver? I doubt anyone's going to be playing with it for that long, if they play with it at all. Normally it goes for about 30 bucks. I got mine for 5 bucks, and would gladly have my money back. It has only the advanced generation Pokemon, no National Dex programmed into it, and they have stupid errors!

The sleepkey helped to break the cycle and get me onto a normal sleep schedule. Now, as long as I stick to my nightime routine and relax before bed, I hardly ever even hear it beep.

I have suffered from sleeping problems since I was a teen. The SleepKey has enabled me to improve my sleep efficiency from a starting value of 57% to an average that hovers around 90%. This means that I'm getting about the same amount of sleep (about 5:45 hours per night) but am spending much less time getting it. This has given me many more hours to read, etc., especially during the weekends, because I don't sleep in anymore.One other benefit is that my wife is sleeping better, probably because I'm not waking up in the middle of the night which was disturbing her sleep.I strongly recommend this product.

The performances are all wonderful. Although Orkis is not as famous as Mutter, it is evident that he collaborates on at least an equal basis (in the earlier sonatas, the piano is the leading instrument; in the later ones, the violinist becomes an equal partner). Mutter is second to no one as an executant and these performances are free of significant technical flaws. Picture and sound quality are first-rate. I can't think of any reason you wouldn't want these DVDs.

This is a not-so-subtle push for HIS classes. We all know that authors of such books make very little in royalties.

Some of us may not be aware of this when we look at our lives of struggle and mediocrity. Others may say this is a dreamer's attitude. Norman Maclean shows us how it is as natural as a river, and as powerful as a fist . This book is about men, and growing into manhood. It uses the river both as metaphor and as the dramatic backdrop for a life of a man. It is written as if every word was distilled to its purest essence, and reads as a drink of the finest wine. I read it sentence by sentence and went over many passages simply to savor the view and the feel it created in me. Read it and treasure it and give it to another man you may care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read.","review":"I like the way Norman McLean handles the relationship with his brother.

Thanks for putting my thoughts on paper Mr. Maclean."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent addition to public library audiobook collections, sure to be enduringly popular","review":"A River Runs Through It and Other Stories is the unabridged audiobook adaptation of Norman Maclean's classic autobiographical novella of a generational, family love of fly-fishing that borders on religion. The river itself is a metaphor for how life flows onward, and the interconnection of all things. In addition to the Maclean's timeless classic, two more of his stories are performed on audio for the first time: \\"Logging and Pimping and 'Your Pal, Jim'\\" and \\"USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky\\".

As poetic a writer as I can think of--except, perhaps for Louise Erdrich.Don't listen to reviews that urge you to skip the sections on fly-fishing. I've never fished a day in my life, but to skip these sections is to miss some of the funniest parts of the story--and to miss how Norman, in trying to understand the river, is really trying to figure out his relationship with his father and brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"This book touched my heart like no story or movie I have ever experienced.

Although the two can be intertwined, Norman Mclean takes the simple premise of the bond between a family and especially its brothers made permanent by fly-fishing and creates an artistic collage about the two. Admittedly, although I am not a fly fisherman, the sport can be quite beautiful to watch. Mclean is able to translate that beauty onto the page. He then effectively compares that beauty to the inner workings of his family. One warning, if you have seen the movie and have the same expectations for the book, beware. The book is not so much a linear story as a picture illustration of one family's relationship represented by fly-fishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Z-z-z-z-z","review":"If you think fly fishing is better than sex, this book is pornographic. Brilliant (I guess, what would I know?) expositions on the art and technique pad the story. Take these out, and it would be a good short story (or movie) for the non-fisherman. Non-fisherman who aren't looking for a good nap should see the movie instead.

The book is fantastic, tells the story of fly fishing in the American West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inherent beuaty throughout","review":"Maclean's beautiful novel centers more around pure emotions than fly fishing. His story only uses fly fishing as a basis for a more important intention, describing the relationship between a pair of brothers. What I find incredible is the skill with which he weaves his story. The feelings which seep from his story are paralleled only by real life. I cannot help but pause at every new emotion and marvel at how it is so similar to those that I have felt. If you are lucky enough to recognize someone you know in his story you will probably discover something about them in this story, and you will definitely find out more about yourself.

But the real gem in the album is \\"Lamento\\", in which the great Antonio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim sings and plays. Now THAT'S a showstopper!

John Montroll folds them using a single square. Quite a challenge since most of the models are not simple to fold.Models in this book include tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron, decahedron, double diamond hexhedron, triangular dipyramid, pentagonal dipyramid, hexagonal dipyramid, heptagonal dipyramid, triangular prism, pentagonal prism, hexagonal prism, sunken platonic solids and many others.I prefer folding polyhedra using modular techniques since they end up much more colourful. In this book polyhedra are folded using a square and hence only in one colour.At the end of the book, Montroll gives suggestions on how to expand on the techniques he uses in this book to create your own one piece polyhedra.Yes, I recommend this book for polyhedra enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will deprive you of the will to live","review":"There are some children's books that delight children and their parents alike.

At best, it is a book about renovation not restoration. \\"The hubcaps 'appeared to be chrome' so we re-chromed them\\" is not a restoration statement but that of a hack. There is nothing on research (color matching, decals, creating missing parts, and so forth) and his examples are an endless repetition of the same theme of sandblasting . . . blah blah blah. He can't even tell you how to restore a serious dent or bend in the metal. The author does not seem to be a restoration expert but a writer about restoration. There is padding in the form of photographs of collectors. Tin plate models are really not covered in any depth yet these are the most difficult to restore. The list of suppliers of parts is pathetic. Don't waste your money. It is not even worth a 1 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"If this book is supposed to be a how-to book as its title states, it falls very short.

There was plastic that didn't separate properly between the tines of the sporks in the set, but I fixed that with scissors. There was only one other spot where a little bit of plastic didn't get cut off of the side of one plate. Other than that, this set is great. I love the cups, which are heavy and almost look like they are made of molded clay. The salt and pepper shakers are not flimsy at all like one reviewer stated.

Although I agree with the main thought that tithing being taught in the institutional church is not correct, I am very disappointed with his open slander and malicious criticism of those in the church. Although we are not to condone actions of those that are openly contrary to God's word, as another reviewer stated, Mr. Johnston is not expressing God's love in any way regarding the individuals he's addressing. Aren't we supposed to gently correct and restore??"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly written comic book","review":"This book is by far the worst written on the subject of tithing. The author covers the same information over and over again. The result is a book that could've been written as a two page pamphlet that would've covered everything the author knows about the subject. Tithing is definitely not a mandate for the Christian, but if you buy this book expecting to be able to convincingly argue against tithing with anyone possessing a high school education, you'll be sorely disappointed. Don't waste your money on this poorly written comic book. Instead, get your hands on a copy of \\"Tithing in the Age of Grace\\" by Joel Parker or \\"Beyond Tithes and Offerings\\" by Michael and Mitchell Webb. Both books offer rewarding reading and will equip anyone with the ability to oppose tithing from a biblical basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"I gave this book 5 stars only because of the topic.......","review":"Well first off is that as far as the topic goes Johnson is right on target about the tithe issue. I mean he hits it on the head. I also agree with the guys he does expose like Hinn, copeland, and oral roberts etc....( Word of Faith teachers...Heretics indeed.) I disagree with some of his remarks and the way he calls pastors who do tithe in there church as a Pulpit heretic and etc..... Heretics attack essential christian doctrine. This is not an essential. It is however a issue in the church(tithe) but it not for salvation or anything. Like I said I gave it 5 stars on the issue but the presentation of it would be one star...But I understand his zeal .... I commend him on that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I agree with others - this is a very good book - exposes many of the inerrencies in the tithe-doctrine. It is a bit harsh, and the graphics are a bit much, but it is a worthwhile read. The most amazing part is the author confirmed what I have long believed: that tithing is not for the Christian church. Hopefully, as more books are written on this subject, the Church can move away from this flawed doctrine and back to the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE TEACHER!","review":"After going through this book I was amazed at how deceptive the author cleverly and cunningly distorts scripture as a basis of robbing God. Of course this book will have a wide appeal to many in the church who are dull of hearing, lukewarm in heart and looking for loop holes NOT to tithe. This book is clearly anti-God's Word and therefore anti-God. The abundance of Scripture, both Old & New Testaments are very plain - God expects every TRUE Believer to honor and obey Him with the tithe and promises great blessing for the tither.Don't waste your money on this un-Scriptural book. Any thinking person reading this poorly written book can easily see the gaping holes in the author's twisted theology! My advice to you is that you pay no attention to the author's WILD CLAIMS as he simply has no Biblical basis for his teachings. Jesus warned us about FALSE teachers and FALSE prophets in the last days - so be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is TERRIBLE!","review":"Don't waste your time and money on this book. There are lots of spelling errors and any truth that MIGHT be there is buried in all the criticism of pastors and anyone who tithes or attends a church.Some of the scripture interpretations he gives are blatently wrong!I regret buying this book and instead of giving it away to a thrift shop I'm going to put it in my garbage recycling bin so I don't inflict this book on anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"***ZERO STARS***","review":"I kinda felt cheated after paying such a lot for such a badly written book. Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself practiced and endorsed tithing as we see in the Gospels. The book of Hebrews gives many clear references to the tithing principle for the church today. I felt the author's arguments and teaching were very weak and confusing; it's almost like he goes out of his way to modify the plain/simple teachings of scripture to suit his own brand of doctrine. Having been a faithful tither for nearly 30 years I know from experience that it pays great dividends to tithe. I give this book: ZERO STARS. Most disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to dig through the poison, to find the meat!","review":"The entire book could have been condensed into 20 pages if all the hatred, bitterness and name calling were left out. The author takes GREAT liberty in assuming things! Statements like, \\"Your pastor is involved just as much, if not more than the televangelist\\", are spilling out of the book on virtually every page and of course can't be substantiated at all. It's really a shame because the book has the potential to transform a persons entire outlook, unfortunately it didn't do that much for me.

We meet Pan, the half goat/half god who basically flits around the woods with other mythical creatures all day. It isn't until he meets Iphigenia and falls in love with her that his life really seems to have a purpose. People with any background in Greek mythology know that Pan had a curse placed on him upon birth that he will never be loved in return. His quest to find Iphigenia again then seems a bit fruitless to the reader, but what we don't realize is that he may be able to save her from her father's mission to sacrifice her. This book needed more detail. I felt it was lacking in some other areas as well, as the plot meandered quite a bit.

Peyton's voice is indeed hauntingly beaufitul, but the acoustic arrangements (as well as the ethereal keyboard sounds) compliment her voice perfectly. Even though the CD was recorded in Tennessee (Brentwood), one can tell Peyton and her team are all Irish.

Their classic 1980's hits sound better than ever, and they've written some catchy new singles as well. Unfortunately, the band performs only two of the songs from 2004's Astronaut - (Reach Up for the) Sunrise and What Happens Tomorrow. All five original members are featured almost equally in the concert footage, and loyal saxophonist Andy Hamilton gets some well deserved attention too. The bonus features on the DVD are fascinating for true Duran Duran fans, especially the \\"history\\" told by each of the guys with footage of some of their old hangouts in Birmingham. The 3-D feature is pretty hokey, and the CD that comes with the Deluxe version isn't much different from 1998's \\"Greatest\\" although it does include Sunrise off \\"Astronaut.\\" Overall, though, this is a must for any Duranie and a pleasant surprise for casual fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIve from London","review":"What a great DVD!

Hopefully, Sena will decide to sell the cases here directly soon.Case is slim and elegant, doesn't interfere with the use of screen or keyboard. If you want to protect the screen when you're not using it (this case doesn't, which is why I only give it 4 stars), Sena also makes one with a flip-down cover -- because it flips from the bottom instead of the top, it's a lot less dorky-looking than the usual sort.

In doing so, he suggests wonderful alternatives to the acceptable post-college tracks: med school, law schoo, business school, grad school, ibanking, etc. It's a very practical guide for Christians in college -- and I wouldn't wait until your senior year to read it. I've met the author, and it's wonderful to see how he and the students he has discipled have tried to live this good life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I enjoyed reading the story relating man & dogs' relationships.

By the time I made it to the 30 minute marker, I began fast forwarding. There was barely a word of dialogue, so I knew I wouldn't miss an important passage, and the movie largely consisted of the same 3 flashback scenes being played over and over and over again.Besides, who cooks their lover's heart and vital organs on a gas grill for 45 minutes? There's a reason why people don't grill up hearts of any species, and if you left a heart on the grill for 45 minutes to go on a scooter ride, you'd probably come back to charred lump, which you'd still have to choke down because otherwise, why'd you kill him?If I ever met director Ulli Lommel in person, I would seriously be tempted to eat his heart, just to prevent him from making another devastating failure like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful, dreadful, dreadful","review":"I'll watching anything horror related, but this was truly painful.

This time it's about a young couple who meet on the internet, fall in love, and the girl eats the guy. Told mostly in flashbacks, with minimum amounts of dialogue, the story would be enough for a fifteen minute short film, but Lommel somehow managed to stretch it out to feature length and needless to say, the result is an extremely slow, very boring movie with lots of scenes that add nothing to the \\"plot\\" (if there ever was one). You sit around waiting for something to happen but it never does.Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"empty","review":"This film is slow and disjointed. No I didn't watch it more than 10-15mins but its enough to know this film doesn't have either the style or technique to get better.How can anyone get involved with the cannibal couple when their relationship is snippets between flashes of gore or her with a bloody face looking matter of a fact. These snippets are among other snippets of her in a hospital bed being interviewed by police then ones that prod the plot along. No character development since there is no character. The plot would have to pretty linear to survive its fragmentation; I think its all supposed to suggest a bad dream.The music is crappy, vapid and vaguely sentimental. There is a sensationalist air to the whole drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"First of all I didn't buy this from Amazon or one of its sellers. That was my first mistake. I could have read the customers reviews. I didn't hate it ONLY because I am a gore fan and there was a little of it (NOT MUCH) and Jillian Swanson has nice looking tits. (So much for my two stars) My second mistake was trusting Ulli Lommel. I really liked The Boogeyman but he messed this one up big time. The screenplay was horrable. Sometimes movies based on true stories just don't work. This story should have been changed where the woman was insane and killed several boy friends instead of just one. It is SO druged out. Over and over and over the same scene with her holding a knife. The religious cult idea didn't fly either. MY last mistake was NEVER trust a DVD by it's cover. Hey at least there were a couple of interesting previews from Lions Gate before the movie. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a little over the top.","review":"While a good idea they have way too much stuff.

Also who giver a rat's a-- if you fart in a public place you don't need bioware to prevent it and ant GM who uses that to penalise their characters should be drawn and quartered.

These people could be white for all I know because there is nothing street or even black-sounding about the story. I should have known that with a man named Yardley.

However, I detested the ending and wished Zane had not tried to mimic non-fiction themes into a really good piece of fiction writing.If I wanted a lesson on relationship behavior or to be preached at, a novel being sold as \\"erotic literary fiction\\" is not where I turn to first.That's also why I purposely do not read Oprah approved fiction because I know these books can't just be about happy people doing happy things. No, someone's gotta be miserable or die but most of all, the reader's emotions have to be pulled at by reading about misery and suffering leaving us in tears. There's always a lesson to be learned, moral or otherwise.I really could have done without the dose of reality seeping into my fatasy erotica. Without it, the book would have gotten five stars.

I did sense that everything was going too perfect in the last few chapters for it all to come out right. I wasn't expecting it to go down exactly as it did, but I was close. So tragic! I really wanted everything to come out perfect, with a glimpse of Yardley and Rayne's life together in the future. I wasn't feeling the last chapter, but I suppose that's life.

Zane trys to make us realize that tomorrow is not promised to any of us and we need to live each day as if it is our last and try to love and get the best out of life.Yardley and Rayne were a special couple. Yardley was the PERFECT example of a TRUE man and how a man should treat a woman. I loved the way Yardley treated her and her mother (despite all her mothers issues).I truly hope that there are man out there like Yardley but I haven't come across him yet....a man with a good job, nice car, penthouse, values, can make you wet just by talking to you and just overall loving you to the fullest.All thru this book I was saying \\"man, I wish it was me\\".But I was really surprised in the ending and I can't wait till Afterburn 2!

I absolutely fell in love with Yardley Brown. All the characters are wonderful and I can only imagine being Rayne growing up with a mother like Arjay a self proclaiming whore!!! Although I was a bit upset with the ending I see why Zane had to take it there to get her message across about not wasting time. We all tend to worry about the what if's instead of focusing on the here and now and what feels right at the time and Yardley and Rayne did just that, wasted time. But they made it through it all until....Now I can't tell u everything!!!

Not only did this book make me laugh out loud but it made me cry out loud as well.Im not going to summarize the story line because its so much depth in the two man characters Yardly and Rayne. Their love story is exciting, funny, and unexpected all at once. Zane wanted to make a point to NOT WASTE TIME and she did with the ending of the book.

I loved the end and then hated it at the same time. I became drawn into the characters wanting to know more about them as I did when I read 'Addicted'. I loved the lesson that she included at the end, something that is almost non-existant in most books that have I read. Overall this book was great great great and if ya have not read it then this a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"ZANE WORKS HARD","review":"Yes, I am a kid, a 12-year-old kid. Imaginably, this is my first time reading a novel by Zane. I read a lot, and I didn't have any more library books left, so I picked up my 16 year-old brother's library book. I was immediately engulfed in it, and I am currently reading Addicted by Zane.Afterburn is about Yardley Brown, a successful chiroprater in Washington, D.C. Every week he brings in his deposits and spots the lovely Rayne Waters (Lovely name). Zane looks deep into their pasts and describes their rocky relationship, especially the head-banging sex.This book comes to and unexpected turn and I did indeed cry. Zane has wrote a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The story line is average. Definitely not Zane's best work. The author states at the close of the book that her choosen ending was to show that tomorrow isn't promised to anyone. I however, felt that Zane injected hopelessness in this story.

Most of them were friends; One was my pastor, another was someone I truly cared for; I understand the timeliness of Zane's latest; No, the couple didn't go away happily in our minds; One died, and the other lived and endured the pain. On the last pages of the book, Yardley mentioned that he and Rayne wasted too much time initially because they thought that the other wasn't available,and then more time getting caught up in other's people's problems and letting it get into their lives; Oh, what a timely message; As far as I'm concerned, that alone was powerful; This will probably be my favorite Zane book; for real."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!","review":"For real Zane has out did herself.

I think there's a lot of empty spaces in Rayne's life. The book jumps from the time she lost her virginity at 17/18 to her life as an adult around age 27/28. That's a ten year gap and we all know in ten years a lot can happen. Rayne don't trust relationships, not even with her best friend since 3rd grade, but the author never explores why she doesn't. The reader doesn't have a good understanding of Rayne's life with her mom its assumed. In a nutshell, it's one of those books that don't hold your interest so you put it down often and when you pick it back up you have no idea what's going on so you have to read back a page. Of course you finish the book just because...... Somewhere near the end I understood where the Author was trying to go with the book and appreciated the epilogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN U SAY BORING AND PATHETIC?","review":"STARTS SLOWWWW U CAN PRETTY MUCH GUESS WHAT GOING HAPPEN.....BORROW OR RENT A YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY PLEASEEEE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for one-sided decorating","review":"The bowl would be great for displaying Christmas balls or something similar on a side table.

I have read this book twice already, and, while I generally like books that are more light hearted than this, I enjoyed the strength, passion and commitment of the characters, as well as the rich detail of the french revolutionary setting. I have suggested this book to several of my friends who tell me they are enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass this one by...","review":"I read alot of romances.. and at 5.99 and up.. Im starting to have to get more picky.. I had put Karyn Monk on my list of authors to follow.. but like the previous reviewers found this book to be very disappointing. In fact, not worth the money. The heroine has very little to recommend her, the plot just plain boring..and you do question why the hero is interested! Lets hope this work was just the result of a couple of bad months, and her other works are more typical.."},{"rating":"2","title":"On a scale of 1-5 this book is a 10 !","review":"I have read all of the other review and they have really captured this book well. I had to add my 2 cents only because this is perhaps the best book I have ever read. (Well, tied for best anyway). The writing is superb. The story line is compelling and twists and turns. The characters are tormented, selfish and then courageous and self sacrificing. The emotions run the gamut. I do find some of the French Rev. graphics disturbing but those were in fact true. It is unbelievable that such atrocities occurred in our wonderful world at any time of our history. The characters were fully developed and I loved the addition of Phillipe to the story. If you read one book this month, let it be this one. It's remarkable. Great job KM.( \\"The rebel and the redcoat\\" is an amer rev story by this author which was also excellent. \\"The Prisoner\\" was also enjoyable.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disagree with previous reviewers","review":"I count it fortunate that I read Karyn Monk's later books (Once A Warrior and The Witch & the Warrior)before I read Surrender to a Stranger. If I hadn't I would never have read any of her other books. This story was so lame. First I couldn't stand the \\"heroine\\". She was selfish and stupid. She is bent on revenge even if it means leaving her only two younger sisters alone. Then when she thinks she has her revenge she doesn't even make sure it is complete. The hero falls in love with her and I can't figure out why. He is like the Scarlet Pimpernel in saving people from the guillotine. His only shortcoming seems to be falling in love with selfish and absurdly stupid women. I read this with hope it would get better but it never does. I think I am being overly generous in giving it two stars. But if hadn't had some interest I wouldn't have been able to read it through. If only to see what really stupid thing she would do next."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a reprint and not a new Karyn Monk Book","review":"Unfortunately, I made the mistake of assuming this was a new work by Karyn Monk - only the cover is new. It took less than one chapter for me to realize I was once again reading a book which was about ten years old. A book I never bothered to finish because it was quite boring. Karyn Monk has the ability to become a superstar in the romance world but only if her publishers refrain from insulting her readers intelligence by reprinting her earlier work and labelling it as \\"new\\". Save your money & valuable reading time. If you are a new Karyn Monk reader try Once a Warrior or The Witch & The Warrior. If you liked either of those books pass on this one and wait for a truly new Karyn Monk book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!","review":"Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Karyn Monk. I have read all of her books. If I had started with this one though, I would never have read her other books. Her heroine is a selfish, stupid person who somehow attracts the hero. I found her to be totally unlikeable. I kept reading this book hoping it would get better. (Remember I read all her later books and loved them.) This book never does. The heroine has twin younger sisters that she leaves to go after the murderer of her parents. Not caring that if she dies, she leaves her sisters orphaned. When she finally is able to 'kill' the murderer she doesn't even make sure he's dead! This book disappointed me on so many levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply incredible!!!","review":"There's not much I can add to what's already been said, but I wanted to tell you that I ADORED this book. I think it's my favorite Karyn Monk book (and that's saying a lot!) so far.I loved this book so much I loaned it to a friend and didn't get it back. This may be one of those books I have to keep buying over and over. Definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book that transcends the genre","review":"Truly a wonderful book, and one of the few romance novels I've ever read that could be called a classic. Worth tracking down even if it is out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Having read Ms. Monks other books I was very disappointed with this one. Try as I might I could not like the heroine. She was not only spoiled but stupid. Throughout the first half of the book she constantly refers to her being from a privilaged family as \\"god's will\\". She even goes beyond being naive and believes everything she is told which ultimately puts the hero in danger. If you want a good Karyn Monk book try reading \\"Once a Warrior\\". The characters flow together and you actually feel like your part of the story. My second choice would be \\"The Witch and the Warrior\\". Good supernatural storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"For diehards and completists only....","review":"If you love the early days of \\"Getting To The Point\\" or even the \\"Lion's Share\\" version of this band, look elsewhere....Simmonds still has the heart, but the group's performance here is thin and often as amateurish as a common bar band. If you want some compelling live Savoy Brown, get a copy of \\"A Step Furthur\\" (my favorite) or \\"Blue Matter\\", each of which has a side of live material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Song Selection, Amateur Performance...","review":"Very little to recommend here. Simmonds still shows a few flashes of \\"semi-brilliance\\" although they are buried somewhat in the mix. The overall performance sounds like an unrehearsed pick-up band. The biggest disappointment is the song selection; not one of the groups better known tunes is here. Yes there is a track listed as \\"Medley (Greatest Hits)\\", but ironically (or sadly) it doesn't include what I consider there best song \\"Tell Mama\\"? So unless you're a diehard fan needing to complete your collection, I recommend taking a big pass on this one.Enter \\"Savoy Brown Blue Matter\\" in the search box for a much better \\"live\\" Savoy Brown purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borla exhaust","review":"This thing sucks A** i had before on my 08 Fj Cruiser a flowmaster super 44, a friend of mine told me about borla and he has the complete system i only had the catback , whenci bought the borla catback i thought that this thing will be loud as hell and have an even more agressive sound because of borla's reputation..When i fished installing this muffler this thing doesnt work, meaning it sounds completely stock no agressive sound, nothing just the sound of the fan and radio. I went took the borla out and went back to my flowmaster. Maybe i will melt this thing and make something functional for this thing.

Ms.Greenlee's unique view of life's everyday challenges is one we all can identify with on some level.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is in need of a boost to handle procrastination and prioritizing.

And, it's a LOT CHEAPER THAN THERAPY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"message and idea are good, price high for what you get","review":"The idea of the book is good, if you don't take care of the little things when they first appear, they end up snowballing and becoming big things. However, I thought the book would include more to read and digest rather than just drawings of paperclips. OK I get the message now offer some insight on motivation. The message didn't need 109 pages of paperclips to get the message across. One cartoon would have done. It took me all of 5 minutes to \\"read\\". Sorry, wanted more for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper Than Therapy","review":"Who wants to be uncomfortable? No one. Well, \\"Cheaper Than Therapy\\" uses the coolest paperclips to remind us that consistent comfort comes at a heavy pile up or at a high price. The truth isn't easy to hear but it's indeed simple. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to function better in life. I'd also recommend this book to anyone who wants to say, \\" I actually read an entire book today!\\" I'm a busy one and for me that in it self was theraputic.

I bought multiple copies for friends in need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first review because I put all the others off","review":"For procrastinating personalities, Greenlee's book is sheer perfection. It's so appealing and quick to read that it's a great thing to pick up while postponing something else. Then, when you read it, it really hits home without being preachy or judgemental. It's a real joy. Great for team leaders or company management to give to staff and great for staff to give to team leaders and management. It works for the old and the young. It's a classic.

If you regularly read Martha Stewart, or even watch her, you'll find this book, like her other book \\"Great Parties\\", simply a regurgitation of the things her staff have put together for her magazines or shows over the years. If you, like me, have already spent enormous amounts of money on all her previous magazines, this book will leave you feeling, well, cheated. It would be a lot cheaper for you to go through your old Martha Stewart Living magazines, cut out everything you like, and compile them into one big collection. I've come to the conclusion that that's what these books of hers are about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"I read through this book once and actually threw it out.

The book's concept is equally compelling. Jennie obviously knows and loves God's word and her desire to share her experiences with other women shines right through.I love the way she introduces modern day stories as she leads back to the bible and shares observations that are as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago. The other wonderful thing she does is to give \\"homework\\" in such a gentle yet inviting way we want to read and learn more.Thank you, Jeannie for your lovely book..

Part II covers Dollhouse Miniatures, Decorating with Miniatures: Furniture, Metallics, Ceramic, Porcelain and Glass Miniatures, Art, Accessories and Oddities.

A majority of the information is historical fact and Herman Wouk does a masterful job of weaving fictional characters into the story.The only negative is the lack of information on Japanese atrocities.Mr. Wouk provides accurate information on the allied firebombings that killed thousands of Japanese but fails to mention the thousands of Americans, Phillipinos, Chinese, British and other allied soldiers and civilians that the Japanese murdered in POW camps and in countries they invaded.The subject of Japanese atrocities is never mentioned in the book, a small shortcoming to an otherwise superb historical novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edit the Kindle Version!","review":"Having read the reviews of the errors and misspellings in the Kindle version, I have decided not to purchase it.

The number of these errors is inexcusable especially when the publisher charges $9.99 each for them.Woulk and Kindle customers deserve a lot better.

The first few chapters were, if not mistake-free, at least readable. However, the further into the book I read, the more glaring and grating the editing (or lack of editing) errors became. The final straw was \\"Midman\\" when referring to \\"Midway.\\" Don't waste $10 on this edition. Better by far to get your hands on a hard copy. This is a terrific story, thoroughly well-researched and it deserves much better than it's received from these \\"publishers.\\" That they have the nerve to charge for this is hubris.

These two books represent the absolute epitome of what hefty, epic, and sweeping historical fiction can be. Global in scope, flawless in chronology, Wouk has woven the events of a fictional naval family within the triumphs and tragedies of world war in a manner engrossing and suspenseful - indeed, unforgettably so.It's all here. Hitler, Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin, Yamamoto, Mussolini, Moscow, Stalingrad, London, Berlin, Warsaw, Auschwitz, Teheran, Singapore, Pearl Harbor, and more.

One of the chapter titles is \\"World Solocaust\\". Another chapter's title is Midman, instead of Midway.Sample sentence: \\"When you come back, and you willy111 be here.\\"There's about a 50% chance that a 'ü' in a german word will be 'ii' in this edition, as in 'Fiihrer'. I kid you not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true painting of the era!","review":"Read this book for the second time, the first time being when it first came out in the 1970's. It reflects the era I grew up in like no other book I have read. The three Daniel Silva WWII based novels come close, but those were thrillers and not historical novels. Though some 1400 pages in length, which would scare off a lot of readers, I preceeded it by reading the prequel, The Winds of War at 800 pages. I still wanted more after they ended. The book is carefully researched, eye-opening in many aspects of WWII not normally written about in novels. This is especially true of our Russian allies and The Land-Lease program. Eloquently written and politically revealing on all fronts of the war - U.S. Britain, Russian, Germany, Italan and Japan.

And did the green ink on a later message reveal the miscreant?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful moving trip through history","review":"This was the best historical war novel I have ever read. And that is saying alot because that is all i really read. It starts a little slow but give it a chance becuse once you get going there is no stopping it you have to make yourself put it down. Incredible use of real historical facts and personages it gives the reader a great scope to the size of the war and the issues being faced by both the public and those involved. This book in my opinion is only matched by its predecessor Winds of War buy it read it and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whirlwind Historical Tour","review":"Wouk's sequel to \\"The Winds of War\\" is an enveloping epic that enchants throughout its pages. It chronicles the Henry family's continuing saga during World War Two. Wouk offers a unique glimpse into the national mindsets of the enemy German and Japanese who seek world domination as their entitled destiny! Most touching is the author's haunting description of the living and dying conditions in the Auschwitz and Thereinstadt concentration camps. Wouk lays bare man's inhumanity to man and puts personal faces on individual Jewish people who suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime. \\"War and Remembrance\\" presents hsitory in a way no high school or college course ever could. This work speaks to both the courage and cowardice of mankind. It also forces reflection of the sacrifices made by our veterans who stood in harm's way during World War Two.

It is riddled throughout with mis-scans that in a couple of cases are impossible to translate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Lousy Kindle Execution","review":"This book is superb, a compelling story and very historically educational. However, the Kindle edition makes me think it was scanned and run through a mediocre OCR program. Typos abound and they all look like what I've seen from OCR programs from years ago. On top of that, no competent editor found and fixed these errors before it was published as a Kindle book. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book--Poor Quality Proofreading","review":"I agree with everyone who raves about the book. I've read it several times over the years and even bought the video tapes. An irritant with the Kindle edition is the extremly poor quality proofreading/ I found enough mistakes in punctuation and spelling such that it became a distraction. I'm not talking about two or three errors in the book but a very large number--Herman Wouk would be ashamed. Come on Amazon--it's the Battle of Midway, not the Battle of Midman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comments","review":"I appreciated the historical information and the presentation of characters in the novel to bring the story which needed to be told. I was in high school during that period and really enjoyed the TV series and have just completed looking at it again plus reading the books for both Winds of War and War and Remembrance. The DVD series was excellent and was enhanced by the two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed the first book, but the second book is not up to par","review":"Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no reference tool.","review":"If all you want is quotes, you will enjoy this book.

However, so is the smarmy sarcasm of this author in response to Wilkinson's errors. Clearly from scripture we are to confront false teaching but it is to always be tempered by the fruit of the Spirit. Sarcasm is not listed in my Bible as part of the fruit of the spirit. Straightforward apologetics is certainly called for in the face of false teaching but to build a ministry around sarcastic parody is quite frankly not Christlike. The author also obviously has some theological axes to grind beyond what is covered in the Prayer of Jabez which come through in this little ditty as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"some people have way too much time on their hands...the Prayer of Jabez is an awesome book.James 4:2"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most readable, understandable history books ever.","review":"I had to read the second half of this book for a class assignment.

His performance wasn't that good and it wasn't anything that I have not seen him do before. He is not in the same league with Depp, Eastwood, DiCaprio, and Cheadle. These guys are real actors who have been in many good movies. Jamie Foxx does like two good movies and people are throwing their panties at him and praising him like he's the best actor ever! I personally think Leo DiCaprio should win the Oscar this year because his performance in 'The Aviator' was so good that it should not be passed up by some comedian.

The life of Ray Charles is/was quite an interesting one. Coming from humble beginnings to the legend he became I couldn't help but be engrossed. The only thing that really bothered me was that it just seemed to go on and on. Throughout the movie,I just couldn't help but wonder when Mr. Charles was going to check into a rehab center. The life of Ray Charles was a life that many dream to have but with turmoil that you'd never wish on your worst enemy.Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles alive again from his walk,talk,and to the way he played the piano. Jamie Foxx was Ray Charles and I found myself sometimes forgetting that Foxx was only playing the character of the great legend we so love. Foxx deserves every award nomination from this film. Job well done in the role of a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very uplifting","review":"Really good. Jamie Foxx comes into his own here. Very enjoyable. Definetely deserved the oscar it got."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Music Will Stand Forever....","review":"....but the film is subpar, TV fare. While much has been made of Jamie Foxx's performance, the fact is, he teeters between comedy and being an outright minstrel. The strongest supporting role accolades go to the underrated Clifton Powell as longtime road manager/assistant Jeff, the man who keeps Ray grounded and in touch with his morals and obligations. As I stated before, the music is timeless and never goes out of style and a documentary about the man and his creative process would have served his legacy better than this fodder, but since audience expectations are so low and the Oscar race/hype machine has to start somewhere, \\"RAY\\" is as good a place as any.

It's thoroughly embarrassing. The rags to riches trajectory, the hyper-indulgence in lavish living, the drugs, and oh, he has a taste for the ladies - what a clever plot twist. Of course he rises above it, kicks the drugs (with perfunctory tough love from a doctor in the clinic). Ray plays like the most predictable VH1 Behind the Music segment - wholly unoriginal, stepping hard on every cliché. Over-hyped drivel and an absolute must miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"PROPS!!!! Jamie Foxx","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and Jamie's performance. He captured Ray's essence! I know Ray blessed the movie and Jamie's performance. Jamie's acting in the latest three movies (Redemption, Collateral and Ray) has shown the depth of his ability. I also commend the entire cast. Regina King has certainly come into her own as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAY OF HOPE","review":"The best segments concerned Charles' childhood, sweeping vistas of rural Southern life brushed in the deep color tones only apparent to the young, and \\"Ray\\", although still little more than a standard Hollywood bio, escalates dramatically in the first half and sort of surrenders to the rigorous biographical schedule at hand in the second half. The music is superb and the recording sessions and live performances come alive with a fly-on-the-wall authenticity. His heroin addiction though, seemed lacking in true dramatic depth but steeped in nobility as he requests no medicinal help during withdrawl and later we're told, as it is written on the screen, \\"Ray Charles never did drugs again\\". It's not enough to say so, the movie could have continued on showing Charles' basking in the reverence finally awarded him and living the drug-free climate he apparently earned. I love Ray Charles though and I very much enjoyed this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the music","review":"Who could not love the music by Ray Charles.

So I was amazed that it exceeded my expectations. It was an incredibly well written movie that did a great job of making us feel what Ray Charles must have been feeling. Looking at life through him was moving and beautiful. And on top of that the music was inspiring. It made me feel like I was getting to see Ray- an experience I never got to have. My Dad who saw Ray in concert at least a dozen times said that Jamie Foxx nailed Ray's mannerisms and personality. This is a must see movie that leaves you with the need to see it again.

I can't even handle seeing the last scene with his little brother--crushes my heart every time. It is intriguing to watch the story of Ray Charles life as a father, a singer, a musician, a player, a dreamer, vulnerable, strong, determined, lonely, a junkie, a business man, and listen to the tunes I have learned so well.

I truly saw Ray Charles throughout the movie. Jamie Foxx went all out to transform himself to be brother Ray. Director Taylor Hackman, who worked with Ray Charles and Ray Charles Jr. for the last 15 years on this project, proves to be a master to deliver such a touching and sometimes shocking history of a man who gave so much to the world through music and passion for life.If Jamie Foxx doesn't win an acadamy award for his portrail of Ray Charles; it will be a travisty.

I am pretty smart when it comes to movies and great acting and this is it. Jammie Foxx gives the performance of his career in Ray. He walks, acts, and talks like him! \\"HELLO\\" This is one of the greatest performances in movie history because it stands so true and Mr. Foxx stays in character throughout. But lets not forget about his mother in the movie the things that she had to go through with being poor and losing her child. Kerry Washington gives nothing less than a Best Actress Nomination performance as Rays troubled wife. Last but certainly not least Regina King as his back up singer. She is stunningly surprising. Her performance SHOULD earn her a Best Supporting Actress Award at the Oscars. So, if you have not gottin your ticket to the film Ray you better go get it.

The biography is neither a total slam at Ray, nor a \\"white wash.\\" His good points as well as his failings are portrayed honestly and fairly. The movie stops roughly around 1980. While it would have been very nice to have had more of his life from 80-04, any more time would have watered the story down to fit a movie's length.

Not only does it look good, it sounds good. I only wish there was more music in here. When it's inserted, it's fabulous but there isn't enough of it.The only negative I had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis of Charles' problems being blamed on one early childhood event. That tragedy was used as cop-out for all Ray's misdoings as an adult.Note: There is an extended version with the DVD but word has it that it is so poorly edited that it's not worth watching, so stick with the \\"theatrical version.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept forgetting I was looking at Jamie Foxx!","review":"I truly felt like I was watching Ray Charles rather than an actor playing him!

He actually had prosthetics put over his eyes so he could know more what it's like to be blind! Now that's dedication! Of course all the music is great because, hey, it is Ray Charles after all! :)The bonus material is pretty good. There's deleted scenes, a jam session between Ray Charles and Jamie Foxx, the ever popular commentary with the director, plus other good stuff. You also have the option of watching the version of the film shown in the theatre or the extended version with is 25 minutes longer.

Its latest incarnation is described here. The authors show you how Microsoft has tweaked it into the .NET framework. The teaching pace is deliberately measured. For example, in a chapter on making menus, the steps are set up in considerable detail, with many screen captures. The authors take little for granted in your programming background.The size of the book partially reflects the many diagrams offered. Since these can be very useful and reassuring to a new programmer, it is a good thing that the authors are so liberal in furnishing them. But the size is also a measure of how far VB has come from its Basic roots. VB now has strong object oriented capabilities, and several chapters use this. More for you to learn, of course. But in the long run, it might help your coding habits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written, Scrimped On Editing","review":"I have liked Wrox books in the past, including Beginning VB 5.0, but this book is not up the level of quality that the others achieve. It is very frustrating to read unedited or poorly edited text, where the authors are trying to describe something and they use the wrong words. Many of the descriptions and examples are unclear. I am sure that there are much better books than this. I am sorry that I purchased Beginning VB.Net."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a VB.Net book","review":"This book is geared towards teaching beginning programming skills. It just so happens that the authors chose VB .Net as the language. In the outset they indicate that their intentions are to teach you programming skills, no matter what language you use. This made the book title misleading. I can usually depend on Wrox to produce a pretty good book. If I were a beginning programmer perhaps I would be impressed. If you want to really learn the ins and outs of VB.Net this is definitely not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PRINTER IS THE SYRINGE, THE INK IS HEROIN","review":"I would hate to dis the seller/mfr of this product by mistake, as I have bought ink from a number of vendors here at Amazon. But I have to say, ALL of the cheap, and/or refurbished ink cartridges I have bought at Amazon have turned out to disappoint. If you can find the REAL, OEM ink for less, by all means buy it. I would never again buy anything but first run, new cartridges from the manufacturer.JUST KNOW THIS: WHEN YOU BUY A PRINTER, YOU ARE BUYING INTO THAT COMPANY'S INK LINE. IF THEIR INK APPEARS TO BE TOO EXPENSIVE, THEN THAT PRINTER IS TOO EXPENSIVE (EVEN IF THEY ARE GIVING IT AWAY).REMEMBER, THE PRINTER IS MERELY THE REUSABLE SYRINGE; THE INK IS THE HEROIN.Here are just a few of the bad things a cheap ink cartridge can do: clog, smear, fade, stain, splatter, corrode. IN MOST INSTANCES, IT WILL ALSO VOID YOUR WARRANTY."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring story","review":"My foster brothers went through some of the same ordeals that Trena and her siblings endured. I felt so many emotions as I read her book, it took me to places that didn't seem real before. The book was heart-wrenching but enlightening. It is painful to realize the world is full of things like \\"recreational abuse\\" but this story shines a light on a world uncharted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charred Souls","review":"I love this book. I would recommend it to anyone with a strong heart. A rewarding story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An open look at life from the eyes of the abused","review":"Writing under a pseudonym, the author of \\"Charred Souls\\" takes the reader through her experiences growing up in an abusive family. It is not for the timid or those offended by foul language but the hurt and pain the author has endured is openly visible through the text. What makes this story somewhat different from most is that it is a case of recreational abuse, abuse that is done just for the pleasure of the abuser.The author takes us from her earliest childhood memories, through her childhood growth years, and on through high school to adulthood. At each stage she shares her thoughts and experiences as a child. This book will appeal to people who identify with the abused person and those who want to acquire a detailed knowledge of the potential of this type of abusive relationship. It is a detailed and heart wrenching tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I ever read","review":"This book left a huge impact on me. The courage and insight that is displayed throughout the book is what makes her story so inspirational. In all the horror of her childhood, she still found the courage to survive and become a caring adult. She had the strength to break the cycle and help others who suffer. I love this book and her story is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written - Rambling memoir","review":"Not to say that this story isn't tragic. It is. The story itself isn't the issue that I had with the book. My issue stemmed mainly from the fact that it feels like a repetition of the same thoughts over and over and over. I felt like every sentence I read was nearly identical to the last.The book itself also contained numerous typos and grammatical errors. This might not be off-putting to some readers, and if not, please don't let this comment stop you.I have read several books about child abuse and its aftermath. If you are looking for a good read, I wouldn't strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charred Souls","review":"I think that people are giving high reviews based only on the story. I can't see how this can be given five stars based on the writing style, the amount of grammar errors, and the amount of repetition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read..but had a few little minor scrapes","review":"This is a good book if you are studying child abuse, or familiar with it. I was looking into going back to school for social work and this book is really good at making you aware of what can happen out there to children. Trena tells a good story. Whoever edited it though, didn't do a good job. It can be repetivie , but that didn't bother me as much as the misspelled words (there were only a few)The author did a good job at telling the story and if you can overlook some of the spelling errors you've got yourself a pretty darn good book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, Repetitive...Did I mention Repetitive?","review":"Wow! While the author's honesty and pure heart-wrenching feelings were wonderfully portrayed, the book could have been shortened by 150 pages. Hearing the same information 2 or 3 times in the same paragraph was irritating to the point of putting the book down many times. It took me over a week to read 'cause I just couldn't deal with the inconsistencies of the \\"flashbacks\\" and the constant repetitiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It probably could have been an interesting book but it was so poorly written I didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written","review":"I was excited to read this book, but am finding it very difficult to get through because it is written so poorly. The whole book is very repetitive which gets very annoying.

It's an intense snowboarding game that needed some intense music to go with it.Not all of the music on the soundtrack is Rasmus, but all the best stuff is.Because of that game alone, I am picking up this CD. Not only is it good to virtual-snowboard with, it's a good mix to drive to, or work to, or what have you. Vengeance of the 4/4 Beat, for example, is a very groovy tune that makes you want to get moving - or, in the case of the game, get your snowboarding character moving.If you enjoy electronic dance music, I'll bet you'll enjoy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I thought","review":"This is NOT \\"The Rasmus\\" The Finnish group very quickly on the rise in Europe and soon in the U.S. I thought this was an older release of the Finnish Group \\"The Rasmus\\" but I was wrong.Okay with that said I should fairly say that this Rasmus is pretty good. It's got a lot of sampling which makes it that much more interesting to try to guess what's sampled next. Strong beats keep this a pertty rockn' CD also. I believe the Finnish group had to change their name to \\"THE\\" Rasmus because of this group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I know a lot of folks are praising this record, but I beg to differ. I don't know what happened. This is almost easy listening compared even to the \\"lightest\\" of their previous CDs. The songs are quite boring for the most part, the only highlights being \\"Eagleheart\\" and moments of \\"Fantasia\\" and the instrumental \\"Stratofortress\\" (albeit Tolkki is still an amazing guitarist). Perhaps a solo career is best for the members from now on? They still have some killer music see \\"Episode\\", \\"Visions\\" and \\"Infinite\\" but this is lacking... if this album is any inclination then they must step aside and concede the throne to the True Metallers Rhapsody, Kamelot and Lost Horizon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stratovarius Disease....","review":"This band has sooo much potential, but they can't EVER pull it together.What am I trying to say? Well, Stratovarius makes 1 or 2 masterpieces on each album and every other song is a throw-out. This album is no different, there's Eagleheart and A Drop In The Ocean, melodic and catchy as hell. The rest are....boring.Other examples include:Infinite - Hunting High and Low, A Million Light Years AwayFourth Dimension - Against The Wind, Distant SkiesOther than the two great songs per album, it's just the same ol stuff over and over. Tolkki just does a fast guitar riff, terrible double bass pounding and Timo's lead vocal is just doing the same ol stuff on every fast strato song.C'mon Strato, pull it together and give us a whole album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear, The Elements are against us....","review":"The gradual softening down of Stratovarius, with ludicrous attempts at driving a rock band via keyboards, has finally produced this. Some love it, but most old time Strato fans failed to see the point. Some lovely music, very few real songs and a total change of direction for the most part, this is an album of stories that nobody seemed interested in. The track Eagleheart is promising enough and builds to a cool crescendo - so why doesn't the rest of the album follow this lead cut? A disappointing effort from a band who always seemed to be on the verge of producing a masterpiece of melodic power metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can do it better","review":"Kotipelto signs great as usual, but...the record is way too artistic. There's too much choral singing and too little brutal force and uncontrolled passion from their early days. For new listeners: buy some old record like Visions or Infinite."},{"rating":"1","title":"One less fan...","review":"I have been listening to Stratovarius's previous releases for about a year now and I must say, they have lost me as a fan! Talent and musically speaking, they're one of the best power metal bands in existence, but lyrically they're lacking! Ones philisophical and religious beliefs is his/her own choice. In the future I would recommend keeping their own views on Christ and God out of their music, and move forward with other lyrical content. There are many more subjects to write lyrics about other than what God hasn't done for me. What have your done for God?"},{"rating":"1","title":"yaaaawwwwwnnnnnn","review":"This is pretty much the biggest load of overrated crap i've heard I'm used to over the top bands like Rhapsody, Sonata Arctica, and Nightwish those are all good bands with solid songs but this.

It was about a little girl's life. It was sad, because her house burns down and her family loses everything. Her mother was a waitress and didn't make much money, so it took a year to save money to buy a big comfy chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very beautiful \\"A Chair For my Mother\\" by Vera B. Williams","review":"This short story is great for young children, ranging from kindergarten to first grade. The moral of the story is a good one, showing a family's perseverance and hard work after a tragic house fire. This story shows that hard work pays off as well as showing its' readers the act of saving and putting money away to use for something you want to buy. In this book a young girl helps her mother with chores while she is at work, showing young readers that should develop work ethic at a young age. On top of the many moral lessons this book offers, the illustrations are tremendous! The illastration based Caldecott award was well deserved! So much color and detail! I really enjoyed reading this book and thought it had a great lesson on hard work and saving money, and the illustrations by themselves made the book a great read!Williams, Vera B. (1982). A Chair For My Mother. New York: Harper Collins Publishers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for kids","review":"I recently bought this book for my 7-year-old, and was really impressed by both the story and the beautiful illustrations. I felt it was a good story for my daughter to read as it told how the young girl, her mother and grandmother survived a fire that destroyed their home and built a life for themselves afterward. The reward to being able to buy a comfortable chair after all their hard work and savings drives home the point of how much we have and how little we may sometimes appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"mom and grandma","review":"A beautiful book, visually and story-wise.

It has drama and kindness and an appreciation for small things that make life rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another missing Dad","review":"Where's the father in this story? With all the unfortunate divorcing going on in this world, I plan to inundate my child with stories about happy families with both a mom and a dad. If it doesn't work out for him when he grows up and gets married, at least I can say I tried my best. I'm tired of forcing the feminist agenda on our kids. They need to know that not having a GOOD husband/father at home is not a good thing. Also, I thought the book was boring and the chair was ugly."},{"rating":"2","title":"All_time Favorite Book","review":"I first read Outlaw Red and as yong girl about 30 years ago. I still go back and read it from time to time. The story is clean, honest, and it takes the reader right to the setting of the Wintapi in Canada. I love all three of Kjelgaard's books for that reason. Kjelgaard masterfully used imagery to keep his readers' interest This however, is my favorite. Sean, the pampered showdog, is haphazardly thrown into the wilderness. Through cunning and instinct the dog manages to survive the perils of his situation.Sean's courage in adversity makes this book a perfect read for anyone of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"over -all a wonderful book!","review":"Set in the Wintapi a gorgeous setter,sean, has captured the heart of a young man. dumped into the wilderness, pampered sean must survive on his own with a ruthless coyote on his trail.

It's small, interesting, and is enjoyable for children and adults both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this book for?","review":"O.k. first, let me say, it's my own fault. With picture books it's best to have a look to see if you really want to spend the $. I didn't. I made an assumption that with YSL retiring this would be a retrospective of his glorious career. Not so. Fuzzy, boring, behind the scenes pictures of people at work in his atelier. Very few dresses and those shown aren't shown well.

It gives worthless testimonials that tell you nothing about how to buy and sell Penny Stocks. Additionally, it is potentially the worst written book I have ever read. Riddled with typographical errors it appears to me an opportunity to fill up pages so that the author can make money rather than offering any real decent product. Additionally, it seems that the majority of the other reviews of this book were written either by the author of this book or by one of his close friends because they are nowhere near the truth. If you buy this book, do not say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penny Stock Winners","review":"First of all I would have rated this book only a quarter of one star but the lowest rating was one star. Now, after having said that I would like to say that there were a few penny stocks mentioned in this book but for the most part, stocks listed in this book were what I would categorize as low-priced stocks instead. How can you classify a stock trading as high as five dollars as a penny stock? In my mind, it's apples and oranges.I also did not think that bringing up religion in this book was relevant and I saw it mentioned over and over.I did like the Lou Dobbs interview and that was about it.For newcomers interested in penny stock investing stay away from this book because it has no value as far as I'm concerned.Sorry, Mr. Bowser but I returned the book for a credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Document of Otello","review":"This truly is one of the great documents of Otello available. Vickers is amazing in the title role, creating many moments that are literally hair-raising. Freni is a godess like Desdemona and the less melodramatic yet beleivably everybodys friend reading of Iago by Glossop allows him to become much more frightening in the long run - in this way it is surprisingly similar to Kenneth Branagh's interpretation on film.There are moments that do seem more stage-like that film-like, yet one is drawn into the experience so easily it is easy to forget such trivial matters.By the way, watch out for a special cameo appearance which happens twice in Iago's drinking song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cartoon classics are great!","review":"My boys 4 and 2 1/2 love these cartoons.

I would definitely reccommend it as long as you are not wanting a tall tripod."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jazz Classic","review":"This record contains seven songs with three alternate takes. They are from live recordings in 1957. The sound quality is very good, although Oscar Peterson fans will not be happy because the piano does not come through very clearly. More important, the mixture of tennor sax and trombone is outrageous. The Blues numbers have great solos that resolve beautifully at the end. The up-tempo version of my funny valentine is great. This record is a classic as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Big Picture, Concentrates on the Details","review":"\\"Understanding the French Revolution\\" assumed that the reader already knew all about the French Revolution.Names and events were introduced without explanations; competing factions were referred to but not defined until many chapters later. Idiosyncrasies, such as calendar revisions, were not explained. For the novice like me, it meant piecing things together and hoping I got most of the pieces.The revolution was led by financial, mercantile, and manufacturing enterprises that wanted power commensurate with their wealth. This book mentions the \\"leading role\\" of the \\"big bourgeoisie;\\" however, it was entirely devoted to conflicts between various factions of the petty bourgeoisie.This book does present most of the relevant facts about the revolution, but the book is poorly organized and lacks a unifying theme. It is not easy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK EVER!","review":"i learned a lot from this book especially about cliques, and friends, and that its hard sometimes for girls at that age to get along.

Everybody has a good side and bad traits... Lia almost seemed like a \\"Mary Sue\\".Plus it really didn't teach much of a lesson, didn't hold a deeper meaning, a bit typical, and just one of those books I'll read to the end simply because I can't find a place to stop, but afterwards, I feel nothing and will probably forget about it.I suppose it flowed nice but the story just wasn't deep enough like Christopher Pike's books or Anne Rice's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perils of Public Poetry","review":"A much finer collection of Harper's verse than this could be made. Here are collected the most standard examples of Harper's public verse--in which the voice is declamatory and oratorical in a most wooden way and effective only in the public lecture hall. Not even \\"The Slave Mother\\" is here, the best of that type. Missing from his collection are the Aunt Chloe poems, the high point of her poetic output, where the public voice is dropped for the more intimate folk voice.

All four guest musicians were nothing less than outstanding and Burton was at the top of his game. Yes the cd rates 5 stars but live is ten. Christian McBride is Ray brown incarnated 35 years ago. The group obviously enjoys playing together as they smiled and laughed through a wonderful set of tunes that left the crowd wanting much more. We felt this group was worth every dollar paid plus some. Yoshi's club has the rare distiction of drawing great talent backed by comfortable suroundings and acoustics. Catch them live if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a big fan of Gary Burton and I had high expectations for this cd. It did not live up to them.

Hernandez uses a historical-structuralist approach for understanding Dominican immigration, which I found an important corrective in a generally celebratory literature that ignores real social problems confronting immigrants of color. Hernandez takes race seriously and does an excellent job with her data. The book is well worth the investment if only for the data, although I'm comfortable asserting that Hernandez is exemplary in her race-class-gender analysis among immigrants of color (Dominicans) in NYC. An absolute REQUIREMENT for any serious engagement of Dominicans in the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction to Electrical Machines","review":"As an undergraduate, I used Fitzgerald/Kingsley as my machines text.

The only potential support I can find is to purchase Applecare for Video. Why do I need to PURCHASE support when I already paid for the product. The product should work and the support should be included!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Barenboim Par Excellence","review":"Daniel Barenboim always delights me with his musical insight, precision and pure musicality, no matter which composer he's playing.

Eddy, Jr. Both of these items, along with dozens more reminiscences from Lovecraft's friends, were reprinted in the recent omnibus volume LOVECRAFT REMEMBERED, so what else do you get?Well, you get a few well-reproduced snapshots.

All in all, this is a book that all Lovecraft fans should read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good keyboard, but clicky","review":"I bought this a few days ago and it's definitely a quality keyboard, with plenty of extra buttons and straightforward software. It has extra keys for the internet toolbar, MS office, multimedia, and copy/paste. The scroll wheel is a nice touch, though most mice nowadays have them already. However, be warned that this kb is very clicky. The noise can be irritating at first, but one gets used to it. The included palmrest is very comfortable, and has a nice semi-rough texture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helping sagging suspension","review":"I got these spacers for my 1996 and 1997 van. Even after replacing the shocks, the suspensions seemed too soft and had lost that firm \\"new\\" feeling. I cannot afford new coil springs with the installation costs, so this solved the \\"problem\\" in less than an hour and I did the work myself in my driveway. Now the vans have a firmer ride (that I like), handles better, and carries loads without 'wallowing', and the headlights going skyward. I put these spacers on all four coil springs on the my '97 van, and on just the rear of the '96 model since that is the one that my wife usually drives.

There are hardly any bsides or bonus tracks like those on the reissues, and material from Sad Wings of Destiny is scarce and nearly nonexistent (you would think that with all the money Priest could just buy out Gull records by now). Packaging like this is cynical and manipulative, and if you're already a hardcore fan, unneccesary obviously. The Iron Maiden box set was at least unreleased live material (however repetitious much of it was as far as track listings), and the only draw of this one is the SFV tour live dvd, which was previously available only bootleg. Skip this unless you have the money AND are a newcomer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest heavy metal collection","review":"I'm a Judas Priest fan ever since I first heard one of their songs.

It's a great collection for Priest fans and for metal fans around the world. The collection also has a DVD of one of their live shows included. And it also has a very cool book that includes lyrics, pictures and some words from the members.Great buy! Great collection! Would buy it again anytime if, for some reason, it got lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview of Priest's music","review":"This Boxed Set demonstrates just what a powerful band Judas Priest is. Covering their whole period, fans get a taste of what Priest can do both in the studio and on stage. There are of course some omissions. Many songs should have been on this set and others should not have been. Plus, I feel that including \\"Defenders of the faith\\" in almost its entirety almost defeats the purpose of this set. But these flaws do not detract from the quality of this package. The jewel of this set is the DVD, containing a live concert. Many fans may not feel the need to shell out 50 bucks for a DVD and a cool book.

Yes, that's it! This marvellous show can only be officially obtained, until now, by spending the priced US$ 54 of this box!In Electric Eye, they put the awful show from the Turbo tour, when the band seemed Motley Crue or Ratt, a sell out hair-metal act!

This Boxset expands the 30 years of priest from the hard Rock stylings of Rocka Rolla, to the the agressiveness of Demolition.

The Bonus DVD of a 1983 show in Memphis completely owns and the booklet is very informativeThere's no mistaking Priest's influence in Metal. This is a Must Have for all Defenders Of The Faith!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't crap, this is awesome.","review":"Judas Priest are one of the greatest metal bands of all time. The music in this box set spans a career of countless 5 star metal tracks. I understand that some people may find the very early Priest material a little dated, but you have to place yourself into the time zone and the generations Priest were playing to. Priest put a lot of work into their songs and still play a lot of their classic tracks - Sinner, Victim of changes, Ripper etc etc live even today. If you wanna listen to a metal band ahead of it's time, you gotta listen to 'Unleashed in the East'. This is by far one of the greatest live albums by a metal band ever.

I think my 5 year old could too. As few as two and as many as six people can play, more with add-on sets. If someone wants to stop, everyone else can keep playing. It is good for people of different ages and intellectual abilities, since it is mostly a game of chance. It requires little concentration. And yet it's entertaining as well. Since I prefer games of strategy or knowledge, it wouldn't be my first choice in every situation, but over the holidays or for families with children of varying ages it was perfect. We played Blocko as well, which is a fun game and easy to learn, but some family members don't take competition all that well, so it caused a little too much tension.

In each of the previous books, the hero settles a major problem of the time (and creates the groundwork for future problems), and makes a discovery about the order/chaos balance. In The Death of Chaos, however, Lerris' solution is virtually the same as Justen's in The Order War, and it seems that we're right back where we were after the destruction of Fairhaven. I also find it strange that Justen and Dayala would be in favor of such a resolution.

I put them between the 4th and 5th spring coil which were initially separated by about 1/2\\". Since these spacers are a total of 1\\" in height, this gave me an extra 1/2\\" of ride height which is what I needed. Instructions: Take a look at the springs and determine which two coils you would like spaced apart (depending on how much extra height you want), then jack the car up and slide the spacer in. I lowered the car slowly, checking along the way that the spacer was in place and had no problems. They only took about 10 minutes to install both sides. I've driven about 200 miles on them without any problems, although it has made the ride a little stiffer (this is to be expected since the spring cannot be compressed as much).

I've only had them on for a day so I'm unsure of the durability, however, for sixteen dollars I managed to solve a problem that could have cost $300 to $1200 to fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and easy","review":"I bought this for my grandma to make it easier on her to clean up instead of lugging out the huge vacuum. I actually bought it to replace her old one. She likes it very much BUT it is not quite as good as her original. But she would tell me if it didn't work or she didn't like it so it MUST be good! :) I'm going to get one for myself eventually too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The thing wont stay together!","review":"I try and try to use this, but the handle keeps coming apart. I will have to glue it in order to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly for me!","review":"I bought this because I have a pet rabbit who tracks wood shavings all over the carpet. This sweeper is great at picking up the relatively large pieces of wood shavings (and also rabbit poop). I love not having to vacuum every day to clean my carpet. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY READ THE REVIEWS","review":"I unpackaged it all put it together (really easy),.. threw out the box and waited to use it. When I finally used it it barely picked up anything. I really had to keep going over the same crumbs and dust bunnies to get it to sweep it. I think that the bristles don't reach the floor enough to do the job. I was really disappointed in this product but for what it would cost to return it it wasn't worth it. I also might add that if you have a really thick carpet it might work better for you, I was looking primarily for a bare tile, floor item that would pick up crumbs etc. However a sweeper is a sweeper and it should to the same job that a broom would do. My Grandmother had one many years ago and it was like magic! This one is cheaply made also. Hope that this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for dog hair","review":"This works great for getting dog hair and other dog-related debris (leaves, bits of mangled toys) off bare floors and rugs. It empties easily, and the included comb gets rid of the dog hair entangled around the brush. The handle did come off, as others have noted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sweeper","review":"I use this in my cubical because the janitors only come through about once a month to vaccum and clean so in the meantime I like a cleaner environment. I can see how people may have problems with the handle coming apart but oh well. I'd buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"The sweeper works great! Perfect for a dorm, small apartment, office, etcWorks great, picks up lots of dust and debris. I fell in love with this thing the second I got it. So easy to use and keeps the floor clean. It's incredibly easy to empty the dust pans and not make a complete mess, and comes with a comb for the cleaning brush. I USE THIS ALMOST DAILY!The handle does have some issues but if you hit it on the ground when assembling it you shouldn't have the problem (the instructions tell you to do this). It also has problems getting around corners or up against the wall, but that is expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good thing!","review":"I looked at the reviews for this sweeper and decided to get one. What a waste of money! It won't pick up much, a hair here or there, maybe. The brush is VERY soft. It would work great if the brush was stiffer so that it could grab on to the stuff on the floor. Oh well, you get what you pay for. As for the others who like it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the 4 stars fool you","review":"I wish people that had problems with the handle would not have given the item so many stars. I admit I neglected to read the reviews ahead of time because I was in a hurry, but also because it's a cheap, simple sweeper with 4 stars. How could I go wrong? I agree that the sweeper part works well, but the handle is junk. Sure, you could tape it, but even at the price you shouldn't settle for something so poorly designed. If only all the parts of the handle screwed in, or locked, it would be fantastic. But they don't. It fell apart on me 3 times in less than five minutes.I'm returning it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great convenience!!","review":"I bought one of these at a local big-box store on closeout- it is OLD technology to be sure, but it is a terrific thing to have around. You have no idea how much you will use it- when there are a few pieces of carpet fuzz, pet hair, or crumbs on the floor- whooosh! they are gone. I like it so much I bought 5 more from Amazon to give every household one as a family Christmas gift!!We recently moved into a new house w/ darker laminate flooring and carpeting. When the crumbs and lint show up I grab the Bissel, and clean them up fast without all the hassle of getting out the vacuum, plugging it in etc. It works equally well on our thicker wall to-wall carpeting and our low-nap area rugs, since it is self-adjusting as far as height. It cleans up faster and better than a broom and dustpan, too.No batteries, no recharging- whoooosh!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sweeper","review":"Perfect for crumbs and dog hair (labrador). This sweeper does work on hardwood floors, but not as well as carpet; the pickup bristles sometimes chase the crumbs by flicking them on hardwood. It is true what people say about the handle coming apart, but it only seems to be a problem if you pick the sweeper up and carry it by the handle. The handle is a friction fit socket and cup (three joints), it would be better if it had a lock on the individual sections. The crumb tray is easy to empty, and the sweeper is quiet. All in all, a great buy for the money, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Daily Helper!","review":"This is a cheap little carpet sweeper, but it does the trick for me on a daily basis.

No complaints from me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle","review":"The Bissell Swift Sweep picks up fine but the handle is a piece of junk. The parts do no interlock and no how hard you bang it, it falls apart immediately. Compared to the Rubbermaid sweeper I had for 15+ years (which finally gave up the ghost), it is a waste of money, with no hand grip to speak of.Bissell Swift Sweep Sweeper, 2201-2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal flaw","review":"Don't buy this. It does pick up bitsies well. But it has one limitation and one fatal flaw that landed it in the garbage. The limitation is that it is ineffective along edges. The fatal flaw is that the three-piece pole falls into three pieces as you use it, after just a few strokes. I spent more time picking up the pole pieces and reassembling than I spent cleaning. And taping it only works temporarily. Didn't the manufacturer test this at all?!?!? To replace this darn thing, I bought the Dirt Devil SD20000RED Versa Power All-in-One Stick Vacuum Cleaner for $20 on Amazon. It is so much better for essentially the same money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeper","review":"This little sweeper is great when you don't want to lug the vacuum cleaner out. Great on floors. Only complaint is keeping the handle together keeps slipping out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell Swift Sweep","review":"This is a great sweeper for light carpets such as the one I have in the master bathroom. We have ceramic tile on the floor and it sure gets quite cold in the winter to walk on it. So, we installed a bathroom carpet and to use a regular vacuum cleaner only pulls up the corners of the carpet. The Bissell Sweeper is just handy for such a task. It works well in picking up dirt and lint."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"Sweeper was easy to put together, no problem with handle falling apart. Light weight easy to push. It only picks up about half the stuff from my carpets. Brush is not very stiff. Will not pick up cat hair. I bought it just for this purpose, for quick cleaning between using the heavy vacuum cleaner. Maybe a higher price one would be better. Will not buy another one unless I can feel the weight for the brushes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful!","review":"I bought this, not for cleaning up after a pet, but for cleaning up after my toddler! It is great for picking up cheerios, puffs, and other food that gets all over the floor. I wouldn't recommend using this in place of a vacuum, but in addition to one. I just run it over the floor real quick after meals and snacks.The only reason I took off one star is because the handle does continuously fall apart unless glued together. After one day, I knew that was going to drive me nuts, so I used a little gorilla glue and now it's perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good little carpet sweeper","review":"It's a little smaller than I was expecting, but that turned out to be a plus because it fits into tight spaces. Doesn't do good really close to the wall, but otherwise it picks up misc. dirt, hair, flakes of crud just fine. Easy to empty, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for area rugs","review":"This sweeper works great for area rugs, which is what I bought it for. Not great on hard floors, but I didn't expect it to be. OK on mid pile carpet, but again, I didn't expect this to be a vacuum/broom/sweeper. Just a sweeper. And it's a good one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have for light duty.","review":"Purchased for my 86 year old mother. She needed something light for carpet touch-ups between vacuum cleaning. This is perfect and easy for her to use. No problems with the handle. I put it together with a rubber mallet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money if you want to use it on carpet","review":"Had to send it back.Maybe this works on hardwood floor, but on carpet it does not.The handle assembly is flimsy at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweep semi-flop","review":"This is a small carpet sweeper. I should have looked more closely at the dimensions. It works fine just takes forever to go over an area to clean....back and forth over and over to get the job done. Assembly is easy, BUT, the handle sections don't stay together and I had to tape them. Storage is interesting because the handle doesn't \\"lock\\" in an upright position so when the closet door is opened out comes the handle. If there was a hole on the top of the handle it could be hung on a hook because it weighs next to nothing but then if the handle wasn't taped together it would fall apart. Not a good value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell Sweeper","review":"This is the easiest sweeper I've used since I was a kid. In fact, I remember my grandmother having one just like it! What's even better is that my teenager doesn't even mind getting it out and helping sweep around the table after supper. It really works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not using the vacuum anymore","review":"I absolutely love this. After using it for the first time, I wondered why dint I order it before. It picks up absolutely every single dirt on the carpet. Does not require power or dragging along the big vacuum and struggling with the power cable. Easy to empty the dirt bin, and the additional comb helps to remove the hair easily off the brush. Does the work faster than the vacuum, and the carpet feels fresh. I don't use the vacuum anymore.Note: This is a carper sweeper, does not work on hard floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for the Money","review":"I needed a quick sweeper for the nursery at church.

I'd actually rate less than zero","review":"Ads for this sweeper are very misleading. I've used it 3 times and each time it has only picked up some dog hair and nothing else. It will never pick up: Tiny pieces of thread, paper, leaves, dirt, etc and these were all very tiny pieces. You can roll the thing back and forth over these items 20 times and all it does is move them an inch or two, never pick up. The amount of time it takes to use the tiny comb they provide to clean the roller brush takes longer than getting out the vacuum to do the job over. The handle comes in several pieces and even when assembled as instructed the handle will not stay together. It constantly falls apart and has to be put back together. You can get around this at least by using duct tape. Unless you have a very low pile carpet or berber, and the ONLY thing you ever have to pick up is pet hair, this Bissell product is a total waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"It didn't seem to be picking up anything on the tile floor, so I swept and then tried using it to pick up what I had swept - it took SEVERAL Minutes just to get most of what I had already swept to get picked up.

Piece of junk: beware!","review":"All the caveats written by other reviewers are true. I had to use duct tape to hold the pieces of the handle together... and then the two prong piece connecting the pole to the sweeper itself broke! In other words, this is a perfect piece of junk.

I have \\"hit\\" it so many times trying to get the pieces to stay together. It lasts for about two minutes then the handle comes apart while I'm sweeping my kitchen floor.

It's going back.

Hard as one tries to securely insert one piece into the other, unpredictably but inevitably the two separate while sweeping. This renders this sweeper essentially useless, unless you crouch down to use the small rod without the extension.That's too bad because it does a fairly decent job picking up crumbs and small particles. I use it on a Persian rug, on tile in the kitchen, and even does well with kitty litter on tile floor.A 4 or even 5 star product had they used a screw-in mechanism or a spring action secure lock to fasten the extension to the base rod.

You have to really push the thing and go over things many times in order for anything to get picked up - even something as simple as a bit of paper from a spiral-bound notebook's torn edge. Also, the design placing the roller brush in the very center of the head is unfortunate and makes it so that you can't get it to do anything near walls/edges unless you can move the sweeper with its sides up against them (I would expect the roller to be in the frontal part, not the center).Anyway - doesn't work for me.

Bissell used to be a quality product, but now it's just another piece of light gauge, doesn't-fit, falls-apart, never-works manufactured crap from the Chinese. The handle kept falling apart at mid-section...funny part was I could not get the other part to come undone to fit into the package for return. If only the rest of the item was as well-built.

It sounds like it's an all-around basic sweeper, but it does not work on hard-wood floors. Sure, for carpets, it's quite helpful, but that's not why I bought it. We have the pricey vacuum for our one and only oriental carpet (I have allergies). I wanted something to pick up all the debris my kids bring in on our hardwood floors, which cover the remainder of our house. The sweeper picks up nothing. Literally, you can run it over the same spot 5 times, but you'll be very lucky if it picks up anything. It's really meant for carpets -- the rollers inside use the friction with the carpet fibers to pick up debris. Without that friction, nothing happens.Yes, the handle doesn't work on mine either, but that didn't concern me: a piece of packing tape easily solves that. My problem is that the product is not as versatile as the manufacturer leads you to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissell Sweeper","review":"Kicking my self for not buying this years ago.

I have not had trouble with the handle--I read in the instructions to push the handle parts together hard. I did so by tapping them together on the brick patio until they \\"clicked\\".

On hard floors it simply pushes dirt / garbage around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother?","review":"This sweeper is basically worthless. The brush that is supposed to pick up items is too far away from the sides of the dustbin, so that you must bend over and use your hands to move debris away from walls and furniture for the sweeper to catch it. Same goes for debris in the grout grooves... the brush doesn't reach 1/8 of an inch below the level of our tile. As long as I'm bent over to move the debris to a position that this sweeper can catch, I might just as well pick it up myself.As noted by other reviewers, the handle falls apart frequently, even though we followed instructions for assembly, and \\"banged\\" it as recommended by other reviewers.

Great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost bought a cordless vac","review":"We already own a heavy upright Hoover, which does a great job. I wanted something lighter and easier for quick pickups in the kitchen and hall. This little Bissell is great. It's basic, to be sure, but it works on the throw rugs and the hardwood, and for some strange reason, long after the novelty wore off, the kids are more willing to use it than the broom. Gotta love that, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sweeper","review":"Works really well and is compact for easy storage. It is used on very low carpet, tile and linoleum. Very easy to empty as well. I'm very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Except For the Handle","review":"I have the same problem as many others who have posted reviews on this sweeper. It seems to pick up junk on the carpet pretty good but the handle comes apart after a while. I find that annoying. I haven't yet done anything to fix it but I think just drilling a hole through where the two parts connect and then running something through it will solve the problem. I bought two of these, one for upstairs and one for the downstairs. They don't replace the upright vacuum cleaners but they're nice to have ready to sweep up small areas of crumbs, cat hair, toenail clippings, etc....all that good stuff that seems to land on the carpet! And they don't require electricity, cords, have a loud motor or extra weight. These are very light and easy to carry from one room to another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"They didn't even give you any tape to tape it together. Handle is in 4 pieces, no threads, so everytime you use it the handle falls apart. It is like something for a little girls playhouse. :-(Bill in Las Vegas"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened!","review":"Breeze to put together, getting it to stay together is a different story. Yes, the handle does break apart! The size of the sweeper itself is that of a childs toy and picks up just as well, if not worse. For the price, I wish I had bought the less expensive Bissel at Walmart. Oh, and the mess I had with shipping was awful! Please, don't waste your money on this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this book!","review":"If I Asked You Would You Stay was an engaging, imaginative book. Two teenagers are searching for their place in life. They stumble upon each other when he rescues her from drowning in the ocean. Its a very compassionate, yet hard felt book. The book moves at a slow pace. I highly recommend this book, even though the ending was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time, money, ink and paper; see below for sample","review":"This is easily the most badly written book I've read in years. Here is an example of one of the better parts -- a paragraph that begins at the bottom of page 174:\\"Super Achievers believe that a free will demands eddies in the stream of creative conscious behavior; as all forms of creative endeavor struggle to flow back to an increasingly closer relationship to the creative source (in awareness). Awareness is a personal Gameboy that never runs low on batteries as you play your own game. Awareness is a one operator Gameboy. Each plays his own game and records his own score. It's more fun to play by those with similar scores. We call angels Super Achievers. The natural order is the most exciting of all games; we call this game Life.\\"If you want 236+ pages of that and worse, go ahead and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hoped it would get better!","review":"I did not purchase this book, I received it as a prize at a networking event. I felt bad that I hadn't touched the book for a few months but I was already deep in other personal development books. When I did finally give it some time, I was very disappointed. Dohrmann begins with a personal anecdote that lasts way too long and leaves you wondering what the point of the story is. Dohrmann uses a technique of capitalizing entire words (like THIS) to create emphasis. This may work for him as a speaker but it makes for a very frustrating read. This will be the last time I deviate from NY Times best selling authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money...","review":"All I can say is about 30 minutes into the book i have no idea what I'm reading other than his experiences he's had... big deal.. book is now in the garbage.."},{"rating":"2","title":"BJ Dohrmann, the other Napolean Hill","review":"Anyone who likes Napoleon Hill, Og Mandino, and the Super Stars of philosophy will love BJ Dohrmann's books.

Virtually (no pun intended) the entire novel takes place inside the Matrix, and yet somehow fails to make the Matrix a immersive setting. It's not just disappointing, its absolutely uninteresting.

Just Gilberto's lush voice, Wanderley's ace organ playing, solid drumming by Claudio Slon and some very welcome guitar by Carlos Lyra (NOT Joo Gilberto, like the cd booklet wildly guesses), along with a very good selection of songs, make up Astrud's best album. Why is this the best one? Because of the bare bones production, the fantastic playing and the good repertoire choice. It reveals what Astrud's really all about: a great pop singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy To Hear","review":"It is wonderful this Verve release is still out there on CD. It has a great offering of standards \\"A Certain Smile\\" or the Gimbel/Valle hit \\"So Nice\\" and yet is more like a group of musicians just having fun. There is truly a \\"spirit\\" to this collection performed by four compatriots. \\"Nega Do Cabelo Duro\\" is the proof in that!Of all the pairings Astrud has recorded, and with the exception of the CTI Stanley Turrentine classic, this is her best. Walter never sounded better and Astrud never sounded more relaxed."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding on that price!!!","review":"I just searched the Burt's Bees site and they are selling the soap for $6.

The Rull enemy has a fantasy element (shapechanger) that will appeal, and a cold-blooded ability to eradicate the humans it opposes.

My advice: listen to this on a good stereo when you're free from distractions...DEFINITELY one of the top albums of 2004. Just can't decide the category it falls into: Hip-Hop or R & B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Machine is the heat","review":"Far too often Hip Hop has been bound by an industry that is more concerned with units moved as opposed to genuine talent and advancement of the artform. Cee-Lo however is not. This is without question one of the most important albums of 2004...already. I don't think I've ever heard of a more diverse, introspective, broad record to date. If you do not listen and enjoy this record then you don't appreciate \\"Soul\\" music. He is tremendous, and this record represents the most solid effort I've heard since he left Goodie Mob...I can appreciate this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive Work Of Art","review":"Cee-lo Green decides to move in a different direction with this release and it pays off. It is a collection of his many styles all rolled up into an album. Actually, this is something your parents can get into. This is a good, progressive work of art.

WORST CD EVER!! TOGETHER WITH HIS PREVIOUS ALBUM!i just wanna slap Cee-Lo if i get to see him. he ripped me off. just think about this one big chubby guy in the little studio trying to made this annoying squeaky voice that's not even his real voice.....and he even tries to rap, i find that real funny.

I knew Cee-Lo was bumping, but damn. It is very soulish. I have never heard his first solo, but this is a good cd to start. Just so you know, just because he is soul, he can still rap with the best of them. Production includes Cee-Lo, The Neptunes, Jazze Pha, and DJ Premiere. Overall go get this album. Probably will be one of the most slept on albums of 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable thing!!!","review":"Cee-Lo has most definitely out did hisself on this album. I thought the first album was tight but this one took it to another level and beyond. The lyrics are hot, the beats are felt, and the bars are something to be dealt with. I haven't purchased an album in a while that I could listen all the way through but this is one that I can. Cee-Lo you made us wait to long but it was most definitely worth it. Keep dropping all the funky stuff and more!!! It's all lovely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brotha Got SOUL","review":"I've liked Cee-lo ever since GoodieMob stepped on the scene.

His gritty voice captivated me on his first cd, so I bought this one. I have been listening to this cd for more than 2 years. I recently uploaded it to my MP3 player, and I must admit that he helped me lose many pounds on the treadmill! ....\\"well let them wait!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album!!!","review":"This is a really good album. And, though I like almost every song here, my favorites would have to be \\"I am Selling Soul\\" and \\"When We Were Friends\\". \\"I am Selling Soul\\" shows why he's thought to be, by some, one of the best spittas in the game. More than just you're average flow, it's also thought provoking and just feels good to listen to . \\"When We Were Friends\\" has him taking a soulful trip down memory lane to when he and Khujo were good friends. Even though this song sound really good to me, I can hear the longing for their friendship to return to that place. So, it's a kinda sad song too, in my opinion. But still, I love this album and would urge any Cee-lo fan to go get this if you haven't already. You'll be glad that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a hip- hop CD should be!!","review":"This is not all great songs. There are some great songs and some experiments, which is what makes this CD worth spinning again and again. The first song I heard off this Cd was \\"Die Tryin'\\". That turned out to be a good move because that song is Cee-Lo's anthem against run-in-the-mill hip hop he says, \\"I could be a pretty good thug but it wouldn't compare to great me!..Aint no way/ain't no how/ I can stop now/I'm a die tryin'\\" This is Cee-lo saying I know every one won't like this, but I REFUSE TO SELL OUT-I'd rather die. I appreciate the solid effort put forth on this disc even if it doesn't always work it wouldn't sell even if it did. Cee-lo knew this and decided to try for it anyway. That's cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Let The Music Play\\"","review":"One of my favorite albums that came out that year. Just a good mood, good vibe cd. Pop this in and roll the windows down and enjoy. Good combination of rapping, soul, and R&B.; His last album did not have enough rapping, he spits plenty of good verses on this one.Its creative because there is a little bit of something on there for everybody. My wife does not like much rap, but she even likes this cd. Check it out. Hotep!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What?????!!!!!!!!!","review":"Cee-lo is BY FAR one of raps greatest lyricists. Shawdy is a genuine artist. His singing is OK. His words are nuthin but poetry, very potent; provocative and profound, also appealing to the conscious. He's a grown man in a boy's game. Frida Kahlo caliber, feel? Intimately artsy, what a album is SUPPOSED to be. Even manages to creatively make radio transition without dillution. A definate musical artifact amoungst the force-fed garbage on the radio, evidence of the last days-they literally hypnotise us with it, this album is a definate option, Artistry at its best, with or without garbage to compare it to, I feel if musicians were artists again, this album would STILL stand alone. Soul piercing. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"This is exactly what it says it is--a book about ballet. Loved all the stories, used it for a research paper when I needed the story line of several classical ballets and it was perfect! My only complaint...it was damaged in shipping. The hard cover was smashed or something while it was being shipped and now there three lovely holes in it. But the book itself is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great picture of life for women in Afghanistan","review":"I use this film in my classes to show how women have had to deal with medical issues in Afghanistan through the time of the Taliban and war. It's a very humbling view of what women have to endure, especially when pregnant, and you learn about the high death rates of women in birth and babies for the very reasons the Taliban has created...no women doctors and women not being able to go to male doctors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viscera","review":"I think that the book was appropriately named, because some of the reactions that I had where exactly that ....visceral. I understand what Cara Bruce was trying to accomplish and did accomplish. It was to take you to the brink of the taboos we have about sexuality. I always welcome a new approach to writing, and I especially enjoy erotica. Unfortunately there were a few stories that crossed the line for me. The only thing I could compare it to would be if you were to read a story from the perspective of the police officers that commited the rape of Abner Louima and how much fun they had while engaging in the act. If that sort of thing turns you on, then you should have no problem reading and enjoying the stories in this book. It is not a book for the weak or squeemish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick!","review":"This is NOT erotica, this book is for sick an demented psychos and not for a normal healthy sexual human being. I bought it out of curiosity, oh boy did I ever learn a lesson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Christmas Time","review":"If you're in the mood to relax and watch a well-told history of the man in red this is the DVD for you! If you're an educator this is great for students, to teach them not about religion but about a well-known character in our past/present/future!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for younger children","review":"For the most part, I thought this was a very interesting DVD. However, I let my 3 and 7 year old children watch it with me. Near the beginning, there was a graphic cartoon image of three little boys who had mutilated and stuffed into a pickle barrel. St. Nicholas brought them back to life and was able to reassemble their bodies. I really didn't think it was necessary to have such a violent visual image. Also, near the end of the movie, there was a brief segment about how Santa is not always seen as a good guy---there was a movie clip of some murderer in a Santa suit chasing a person with an ax. Again, was that really necessary? There should definitely be a warning at the beginning of the show telling parents that there are some images which might not be suitable for young kids. Or, here's a crazy thought, just delete the violent scenes! It's a Christmas DVD which the whole family should be able to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"I have seen other reviewers here mention the fact that there are overtones of Rush on this CD. I couldn't disagree more! I believe everyone thinks that Crucible's lead vocalist sounds like a toned down version of Geddy Lee. To me, he sounds almost identical to the lead singer for Triumph. Musically, the band sounds like Trick Of The Tail era Genesis, with overtones of Kansas or Under The Sun. When the band gets a little more accoustic, there are shades of Jethro Tull.It took a while for this to grow on me, but once it did...WOW! It is nice to see another band join the growing ranks of the resurgent progressive rock genre. It's too bad that the only radio that will ever play this are the web-based prog radio channels. A great band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"70's Progressive Music for the 90's","review":"Picture Rick Emmet (Triumph) fronting a Genesis/Jethro-Tull cover band and you'll get a feel for the sound of this band.

Save your money and invest in Spock's Beard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXELLENT ENGLISH-SCHOOL \\"PROGRESSIVE\\" ROCK","review":"Crucible is a tasty,versatile band that has all the elements:arranging,dynamics,and great individual and group playing.For fans of classic Yes,Genesis,and Rush,this album offers lyrical and subtle tracks of a type rarely heard in a landscape of expatriate metalheads posing as \\"progressive\\" rockers.Great analog keys and acoustic guitar round out this \\"English\\" style album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book was incredibly helpful to me in dealing so many different types of loss and the grief that follows.

I recommend this CD to any Drive Thru Records listener or a fan of good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"unclassified and loving it","review":"This is an excellent album, if you are a fan of loud, sometimes mindless, screaming. What it is to burn, New Beginnings, Grey Matter and Untitled are rad tracks. The guitar and screaming give Finch a certain edge that is all their own. It's a good break in the drive-thru norm although their presence is still felt in the lyrics. Be warned, this band does not \\"bridge any gaps\\" between genres. I wouldn't even put them in a genre. They're just pretty good music. Don't overanalyze them, don't try to classify them, just listen. For all of you out there that do, grow up, Santa claus isn't real. If you want straight emotional music with meaningful lyrics look for Thursday or Taking Back Sunday. Don't get me wrong, Finch has gnarly tunes, and I would seriously recommend buying it. But don't be sucked into the ever growing need to classify music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight to the top!","review":"I remember the first time I saw these guys at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, CA about 3 or more years ago. They were called Numb at that time. I was just shocked. Their set was so beautiful I just couldn't keep my eyes off of them. I was actually outside smoking a cigarette when I heard the beginning of their first song and immediately ran back inside. The music was like every style I liked brought together as one. Nate has such a beautiful voice and an incredible song writing ability (which is very, very important to me). After drooling over their set I walked right up to Nate and shook his hand. \\"You guys are going to blow up,\\" I said. I will always love this band for the way they made me feel that day and I'm happy to see that they're finally getting what they deserve. I just wish nate would stop trying to steal Daryl's moves!

I have seen them twice so far, and I plan on seeing them some more. Let me explain this to all of you out there who dont know whether or not to purchase this record.First off, this is a punk band that sounds like the Deftones. These guys play with a great punk intensity. They are not a hardcore punk band. They are heavy at times, and soft at times. They are great musicians, especially the drummer. Great lyrics, and different sounds, and a worthwhile experience for the whole family (of rockers).

If you've heard \\"Letters to you\\" and \\"What it is to Burn\\" on the radio, and liked them both, you'll love this cd. It's mostly similar to those, but each song is different. Some of the songs are really screamy, while some have mostly softer lyrics. I think this is a cd that any rocker should give a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This is definately one of the best albums I've bought this year. Almost every song on the album is well done, from the hardcore-inspired \\"Project Mayhem\\" to the made for MTV \\"Letters to You\\". Its hard to describe Finch's sound, they are closer to pop-punk than hardcore, but calling them pop-punk doesn't do this band justice at all. Melodic hardcore may describe the music a little, but it seems like this album posseses qualities of many types of music that can't be categorized. My personal favorite track would have to be \\"What It is to Burn\\", a very well done track that shows how many genres of music this band can bring together at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks my face off","review":"First song I heard was \\"Letters to You\\" in my friend's truck and I decided it was definitely a must have.

There are simply no weak links on this record, no album tracks whatsoever.There are at least 5 obvious singles should the band choose to release any,and with the way that Finch mould emo-core, pop-punk and hard rock, they have every chance of being huge.

Songs such as \\"Post Script\\" and \\"Three Simple Words\\" give the CD it's upbeat tone and displays the singing/screaming mixture. The guitar parts on songs like \\"Post Script\\" are very unique and make you want to listen to the CD over and over and over. The drummer is also very talented and he shows it, especially in \\"Stay With Me\\". The whole track is not all upbeat though, \\"Ender\\" gives the CD a slower beat and gives the CD some more variety. The singing and screaming technique is very unique and helps attract all kinds of music lovers, from the hardcore fans to the more easycore fans. The CD is very organized and one of the better CD's I have heard. Four stars for this great performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like emo, you should by this album","review":"This album has a few really good songs, and it doesn't really have any bad ones. It's really tough to find any diversity in this genre of music, so they don't really stand out. If you're really looking for something different, try coheed and cambria or thursday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcore Punk At Its Best!","review":"Finch is an awsome band, that happens to be more on the alternitive side rather then the punky side. But they still have alot of screaming so their good, oh yea and they're from \\"Drive Thru Records\\" so you know they'll be good. The lyrics in the songs are very good and better then you average band who just throw a whole bunch of words together and call it music. The words really are meaningful and have a purpose, and you can tell they thought it out a while. The insturmental part of the songs are very good to, and actually fit the music. Everything about the band is great and there is not one song on the album that isn't worth listening to. The best songs on the CD are the first 5, and then 7 threw 11, and then 13. There are so many good songs on the album that I couldn't write all of them out. I would very much recomend that you look into buying this CD, it's a winner and you will be too if you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Ass Kicker","review":"Their only full length album, and it kicks so hard it blows you away. Finch has an awesome style; not majorly distinctive, but emotional and powerful enough to make them stand out. There are so many good tracks on this CD, with awesome production work and overlying vocals on each one. Musically they rock, but it's the vocals that totally kill every song. Nate has better vocal control while screaming than anyone I've heard. This is one of those albums where it's almost impossible to match on any subsequent recording. Worth listening to. Over, and over, and over..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive-Thru killed emo.","review":"I admit I used to adore this band above all others. Now that I've learned a bit more about the 'scene' and emo genre as a whole, I have realized that Finch is hardly emo at all. They do have potential, but they are just incredibly overrated and have little originality. Lyrics are a tad shallow, as are most of Drive-Thru's bands, and vocals are shaky. I suppose this would be alright to download and burn, but don't spend money on it. Finch is more of a \\"gateway emo band\\" than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one song album deserves one star","review":"I simply can't believe the reviews below. Generous or what! Other than the first track which has some good hooks and a nimble tempo, the rest of the album is lame, derivative and immature. \\"What It Is to Burn\\" is a one hit beverage coaster.

As they say better luck next time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is horrible","review":"Seriously, this cd is not worth it at all. Whoever says that this cd has emotion is a downright liar. It's void of any feeling whatsoever. I can't believe how people say this band rocks. I honestly tried to like it thinking maybe it would grow on me, but who am I kidding? This cd is terrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. The Ramones were less repetitive than this, but at least they were fun. This is just mindless, over-produced drivel. It was a serious waste of money and time. Go buy something better, and if you're going to buy from Drive-Thru, buy something by the Movielife. At least they aren't boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another terrible band off Drive-Thru","review":"Gah... I just don't see the point.. Even by pop punk standards this is pretty sub-par.

I'm afraid it would make her sick too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pitiful","review":"Perhaps this vocalist should take some of the money he has made selling his sorry excuse for a music album to buy himself some voice lessons. And if he has already had voice lessons, someone should take away that teacher's right to teach. Seriously, when will people learn that they shouldn't embarrass themselves like this? Just because you can scream and play some fun little I, IV, V chord progressions on a guitar doesn't mean you should start a band. What's ven more pitiful is that people actually pay for this stuff and think it's great! You people amaze me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Kicks (5 1/2)","review":"... This is the best mixture of music I have ever heard. From \\"Untitled\\" to \\"Ender\\" this CD gives you every range of music you could ask for. You have your punk in this and your Hardcore is there to. I could not ask for a greater band. You can expect many more great things from FINCH. I admit it has some Deftones and GlassJaw sounds in here but it makes it all the more better. Offically this kicks a$$. For all of you fans continue to listen.

Theres been all this hype about them so went to get the album but it didnt really live up to expectation. Some of their songs are besically a pop song with heavy guitars. A good example is 'Letters To You'. Dont get me wrong, i like this song. They are like a pop punk band but only heavier. This is a sort of album 14 year old girls would listen to and sing the songs when they get to skool. Finch id say are just another emo/hardcore band. If you really want an amazing album that lives up to expectations, get The Used. They're like finch minus the pop punk and with more emotions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid band... good music","review":"When I first heard Finch I knew they were an amazing band, that played good rock and mixed it with some sort-of-heavy vocals, and I liked their style right away as I thought it was very similar to Story of the Year (especially their earlier sound) or Jimmy Eat World.However, they're not the best band ever like some people insist on saying. They rock alright, their sound is quite enjoyable, but it's not like \\"What It Is Burn\\" is the best CD ever made and Finch is the best band ever. I mean, c'mon, with all due respect to the band, there are far better musicians out there.If you're looking for some very good music buy this CD, it's great.

I'm glad I did! Erich Schiffman goes into great detail about the breath, meditation and especially the benefits of each asana. He explains in detail how to do the different poses and even has a sample home practice for an overall workout. I recommend this book for anyone, whether new to yoga or a seasoned practioner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifetime companion","review":"After dipping into and out of various yoga and meditation texts -- and their accompanying philosophical bases -- I can say this book is the best I have ever found. I use it daily, it encourages both thoughtful contemplation and regular mindful practice without a lot of gobblydygook. Schiffmann's style is both easy and surprisingly far-reaching. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to center themselves and learn to sit still."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book written on yoga to date.","review":"Most yoga books focus on how to do the postures from the outside in---the external approach. Erich Schiffmann's book shows us how to do yoga from the inside out---the internal approach. There is no other book, or teacher for that matter, that is able to convey this information in such a profoundly clear way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual book by an interesting teacher","review":"Erich, if you have ever experienced his teaching in person, is an interesting teacher. He has a very exploratory nature when it comes to yoga and frequently practices at home and makes up new postures as he goes.

A good motivation to self analysis and positive, healthy lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent yoga sequences","review":"I love the yoga sequences and descriptions of asanas in this book. In order to really use it, I had to go through and highlight the important elements of each asana, since his descripition last for pages and is quite detailed, and you just can't hold it long enough to read everything! I also love the guiding priciples he offers, like lines of energy. However, the beginning portion of the book, before the descriptions of the asanas, is a little difficult to read. He is very wordy, I read sections to my family and friends that actually made them laugh as he goes on and on about something, making a good point but making is about 7 times before he moves on. Better too much explanation than too little, I guess, but please be sure to get past that part to to the asanas, don't get discouraged! Erich Schiffmann is a wonderful teacher and a very wise man, his message has changed and reinvigorated my practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"read if you need peace","review":"Whether you want to spend your life studying yoga or just have a curiousity about yoga, you should read this book.

But the nice lady on the cover is not an indication of its content. The entire book is just one man with a pony tail doing all the poses and he made me inexplicably uncomfortable. Also the discussions on each pose really wasn't what I was looking for. I returned this book for \\"Hatha Yoga Illustrated\\" by Kirk, which I enjoy MUCH more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll probably sell this on eBay","review":"I am disappointed in this book.

Through simple instruction and essential illustrations, this book reveals more than one hundred poses and yoga routines for all levels of ability that will slow or even reverse aging, increase stamina and strength, and slim and tone the body; a complete program of meditation to promote self-realization, decrease stress, and promote creativity. Discover how to feel balanced, centered, and coordinated, increase flexibility, eliminate pain, and become free of life's negativity through the spirit and practice of Yoga. In my opinion, there are a lot of better yoga books out there and this one is a bit advanced, especially if you're a beginner.

Found it to be very Disappointing & lacked the passion I was hoping to learn from it. The book starts out talking about stories & how he asked every employee \\" How can I help you do your job? What is it you need?\\" The second half of the book talks in management/manufacturing lingo. Must be why it's a MUST-HAVE for Purdue students. As it turns out Mr. Dauch broke the union, saved labor cost, raised prices of products & made Billions. Let it be known, all business's who do business with AAM are most often owned my a Dauch family-friend or colleague. True americanism at its finest.

It does not have a glass thermal lining (I should have known to look for that feature before I purchased this product.)After a half hour in the server, the coffee is lukewarm and I have to reheat it in the microwave.Secondly, the screw-on top has some features that seem to serve no purpose - a button on top that I assume is intended to release the vacuum so the coffee can be poured out. It doesn't work, you have to loosen the lid itself. Also, the lid comes apart into several pieces for cleaning I guess.

A little bit spell book, a little bit decorating book, she talks about making a house a home through some effort on your part.It's a nice little book with some nice ideas, but she seems to try a little too hard to take Pagan ideas to non-Pagan readers. Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, for instance, presented in a Pagan way might appeal to many Pagans, but not to many Christian or Jewish readers. It has a feel of effort to it, like she's trying to sell the book to a group that never visits the \\"New Age\\" section of the bookstore.Still, things are presented in a very clear way, suggesting materials and moon phases for the most appropriate times for the spells. None of the materials are very exotic, so the spells are indeed accessible to anyone who is of a mind to try their hand at a little magic.The index is quite good, but unfortunately no bibliography.

Shultz works through philosophical issues concerning modernist's foundationalism and postmodern thinking that Pannenberg did not spend much time commenting on explicitly. Shultz scours Pannenberg's work to show how he anticipated these kinds of questions and implies a practical middle way between them that Shultz calls \\"post-foundationalism.\\" Best of all, rather than giving pure speculation, the author obtained an endorsement and consent from Pannenberg who writes a couple of pages at the beginning of the book to show his approval. The book is dense and not necessarily easy to follow for the beginner in Pannenberg, theology, or philosophy.

We were excited to read his story and ordered it right away from Amazon. I started reading it the day it came and very quickly realized this book was all about his sexual adventures ! It is NOT what it says it is on the cover or when you talk with him. I read about 1/3 of the book before I was completely disgusted with this man. His \\"adventures\\" seem really far fetched and more like the writings of a 12-14 year old boy. I threw the book in the garbage as I felt this book was inappropriate to even give to the Goodwill.

Because I wanted to learn more, I picked up Howard Jones' Mutiny on the Amistad from the remainder table of my local bookstore. I must say I was disappointed. Jones succeeded in saying in 215 academically-bloated pages what perhaps could be told in half the length. As a lawyer, I am interested in and readily follow legal arguments, which is most of what Jones endeavors to recount. Each time an argument is referred to, however, Jones restates it in full rather than assuming his reader had read the preceding chapter or has some attention span. This fills a book already made ponderous by academic style and language. This book reads like a PhD dissertation; if, in fact, it was, I'm sure Jones deserves his degree, but I'm not confident he should win readers outside the ivory tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but far too long and very dry","review":"Book has a lot of info presented in a sensible order but is obscenely dry and hard to read.

Takata's \\"Story of Reiki\\" is sincere and from the Heart which is where Reiki SHOULD BE. You can feel the warmth through the words and gather a sense of Knowing that this is \\"The Way\\". As a Reiki Master I use this book in my Reiki class work and in lectures. Why don't YOU read this story and you decide. Very quick reading. It also tells in the last section of Takata's clinic and some of the Miracles that took place. If you practice Reiki you will be able to related to this book.

I like this book more than the others of this really great series the reason being that the 1st book is superb but seems hazy and that the 3rd book is a materpiece but so hopelessly depressing, this book seems more alive than the others . The reason i would give this book 4 stars is because this story badly needs an epilouge even though you know where the 2ndary character lands. I like how the author chooses a family failure as a character.

The book is a metaphor of the periodic table: elements conform substance so words conform ideas.Primo Levi is a mentor; he begins a melancholic tale, connecting us with characters and at less expected time we receive a little lesson about chemistry, -it's a good way to spread science, didn't it?- but that's not enough for him so we also get his testimony about how he suffered WWII.Primo's statement is hard: \\"... I felt guilty at being man, because man had built Auschwitz...\\" at last it's not clear if he got peace at his mind; but, I must recognize he is honest, because somewhere in the book he says that Primo Levi writes for Primo Levi.In conclusion, it's a gentle book wrote to present a testimony of a man who was born Jewish in Italy, studied chemistry and suffered the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I read a review of this book in a chemical engineering magazine I subscribe to.

I thought that I'd read about tragedy and misfortune, but I didn't get what I expected.What I got was a tale of subtle defiance and quiet resiliency to the war that looms in the background of the book. The author hints at the drama and struggle of the war through his many short vignettes--each related to an element from the Periodic Table--but he is never overcome by it, remaining distant from the events, submitting helplessly to the way things were, but looking brightly toward the future.This was altogether a very interesting book. Strangely inspiring, aloof but aware, it provided me a view of the second world war that I never would have imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it but had to return..","review":"I started out wanting a jogger because I do alot of walking but was afraid to get a stroller with the inflatable tires so I ordered this one. I loved it but unfortunately after a month of use the back rear wheel kept coming off after my walks. I hated that I had to return it because it's such a nice overall stroller. However I didn't want this to happen again so I had to part with it. I ended up getting the Baby Jogger city series and I am very happy with it. The only thing is it didn't come with all the accessories. Oh well at least we don't have any wheels coming off mid-walk. So beware this could happen to you if you order it but it may have just been a defective stroller, Who knows? So I'll still give it 3 stars because of that and the fact that I loved everything else about it and that may have been just a fluke."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stroller","review":"Just got this to replace a maclaren vogue I have had for past 3 years.

Solid rock reminiscent of *good* STYX."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst!","review":"I liked Styx and liked Tommy Shaw's songs with them. But this album just plain and simple doesn't work.

Don't expect to hear any listenable stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Wow. This is bad. Really bad. After listening to this and that joke of a STYX album (Brave New World - which Tommy took over most of the production away from Dennis), I've come to the realization that this guy needs to realize that just because an CD can hold a lot of songs, doesn't mean you have to use up all of the space. Sometimes fewer is better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst!","review":"I have always liked Shaw's work with Styx and Damn Yankees, so I had high hopes. This CD is a waste! It sounds like it was put together in a rush. Shaw also seemed to be trying too hard to be trendy, by going with a somewhat techno sound. That avenue may have worked for Madonna, but Shaw can't pull it off. Without the likes of Dennis DeYoung or Jack Blades to direct him through the entire production, Tommy Shaw appears to be lost in the wilderness. I have listened to the CD once and that was enough. Considering Shaw has kicked Dennis DeYoung {the cofounder of Styx} out of the band when DeYoung became ill and was temporarily unable to tour, I fear for the future quality of Styx music. However since DeYoung has now started a tour of his own that is absolutely breath taking, that will be the Styx tour that I will patronize repeatedly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"Typically There Are A Few Die Hard Tommy Shaw Fans That Buy Anything He Does.

Both albums are far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this be any worse!","review":"We all have our moments when we will experiment with anything just to see what happens, but when you put it out to the public, it better be right! This is a lesson that Tommy Shaw still hasn't learned! What a hodge-podge, muddy sounding mess! I have no idea what Shaw was trying to do here, but then it appears that it was a mystery to Shaw himself. It sounds rushed and thrown together. Shaw should have taken more time to figure out what he was looking for in this experiment. If this CD was a chemistry lab, it would be a smoking pile of rubble!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking? Too bad for words!","review":"I'm trying very hard to muster the words to discribe what a pathetic effort this is. I have been a fan of Shaw's since the mid 1970's. I liked Guns with Guns when I was 15, but now it sounds a little cheesy. I have matured, and one would expect Tommy Shaw had as well. Nope! This makes Girls with Guns seem like Mozart! There is nothing on this CD that is profound like \\"Boat on the River\\", and there is not even one all out rocker that we have all come to expect from Shaw! Obviously, Shaw needs to collaborate more to make his work coherent. I only wish that he had Jack Blades or Dennis DeYoung guiding him through the entire process, then this CD might not be collecting dust in my box of reject CD's that I wish I had never bought! I'm sorry to say that when my husband and I first heard it, we both said \\"What was he on that made him think this should go public?\\" Shaw's writing over the years has shown shades of brilliance, but THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE TIMES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Winterness","review":"I bought this for my Mother for Christmas after I heard it on National Public Radio...My mother has never been happier!The melodies are haunting! dreamy!

He is a rare male character who is totally and naturally comfortable with exactly who he is, direct, open, warm, and nourishing. He's a great male model character and there are few like that in American movies.Amy Irving's character is complex, annoying, real, and, importantly, she learns, albeit the hard way. This is a real, warm, and sweet movie. It may not be to everyone's taste, what films are, but those who criticize it and diss it as a film just because it's not a film they get or like, don't do it justice.The film is a small gem.

She however is irritated by the whole business, at least to start with. This movie is, set partly in an old, traditional Jewish neighborhood in Manhattan.

I first saw this on a PLANE of all places, and fell in love. Peter Riegert (always great) is so wonderfully charming as a man who is far more than the sum of his parts. Amy Irving is wonderfully strong and vulnerable as a woman looking for. . .something more than a pickle salesman. Riegert is ever-mindful of his \\"place,\\" and never ceases to amaze Izzy by being so. . .much. . .more. . .than he appears. Don't we all hope to be more than we appear?

The plotting is deft and intricate, with a three-level nested storyline showing how one smuggled shipment of arms affects a variety of people with no other connection to one other. The characters in each -- the enterprising Indian foreman who discovers and sells the weapons, the Chinese brothers who arrange their shipment, and the American couple used as straw buyers -- are drawn so distinctly that you almost forget about the other parts of the book when reading a particular section. The only criticism I can think of is that the finale is a bit drawn out and doesn't provide any particularly interesting resolution; the best parts of the book are the characters and the intricate scheming they engage in. Ambler has some good secondary characters here too -- the dissolute Chinese brother, the apparently lesbian ship's passenger who tags along with the Americans, and the Singaporean police superintendent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to SIP","review":"I found this book very helpful, descriptive and a very good introduction to SIP and it's services."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coverage, not too technical","review":"This book gives good insight into the commercial and business aspects of SIP usage, but this is not a technical book on SIP.

The example applications in almost every chapter were a good test bed to play around with and explore the concepts. I would not have understood things nearly as well without them. As the authors state, they don't teach you everything you need to know about the AI pieces, but with some digging on my own, I THINK I understand the basics enough to make progress. The UML package diagrams are worthless, and I wish the space had been used for something else -- maybe more background info or a summary of the agents in the chapter. But that is a minor complaint.

Very few CDs have every single track be great but this one goes beyond that. Every track on this CD can be best described as my favorite song ever. With hard riffs like Bullet and hypnotic songs like When She Comes. This Album has everything you could ever want in music from Hard Rock to some slow songs like Ms. Fortune (my personal favorite) all without one hint of rap!

This band combines superb musicianship, dynamics and great hooks to produce one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. Did I mention the hooks? Injected really know how to write a good song. Highlights of the CD are: Bullet (rockin'), Faithless, Only Hurts A While (this one almost made me cry) - just about all of them.

Either way it ...","review":"Luckily I heard this album off of a streaming web site, and I nearly fell asleep. The first track \\"What\\" with Face Hurts is really well done, trippy beat, and Eve provides some decent lyrics. Gangsta Lovin is the radio smash of the summer, that doesn't mean its good. Irresstable Chick and Party in the Rain sound like something Jessica Simpson would do, and it comes off very bad on Eves part, the chrous' are catch however. Basically, this album falls after number 3, and it falls hard to the floor. Eves lyricism is extremley boring, and she is not saying much behind these nice beats.

This album has nice lyrics and never ceases with the ill beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theory of Eve-Olution","review":"I really think that Eve is the best female rapper out there. All other females ever talk about are their performance in bed or what not. Eve keeps it real without losing her pride. She also develops more and more lyrical skill every album, and yet manages to maintain a female identity amongst all the Ruff Ryder clique. Big ups to Eve.Eve also demonstrates her acting ability on Barber shop.CD is hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE SUCKS!!!","review":"Here is just another ghetto chick trying to cash in on this lame hip hop trend of female rappers.She has as much talent as lil kim,and thats not saying much.The whole album is boring and repetitive.Weak hip hop beats and even weaker lyrics.All she talks about is bling bling and how she's better than everyone else.Ive heard she's starting her own clothing line.What a surprise?People stop worshipping these corporate sellouts and start empowering yourselfs.DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good!!","review":"I like Eve and I think she is one of the best Female rappers out here today! She looks ok...well besides the fact that her face looks smashed in...but that is fine because what lacks in looks comes back in good rhymes. I mean let's face I am don't look good either.....but that's another story!This album is good on production and lyrics...it's good to bump in the car and it's good to play loud as heck. This album is a little different from her debut album. She came out hard but on the album she calms it down and that's coo!!Overall...this album is at least worth a listen...I would buy it...heck I did! If you are a fan a must get and if you looking for a female rapper to like then look no further...E-V-E is here! Peace out folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eve Bounces you Until Dawn","review":"Eve's new CD is a bouncy, rhythmic serving of upbeat rap infused with pop and old school r&b. She features guests Truth Hurts, Alicia Keyes and Snoop Dogg among others. However, have no doubt that Eve holds it down all by herself. The raps here speak of varied topics---love, jealousy, and hope, but the album is not preachy and does not take itself too seriously. From the intro to the end the album the songs are strong and ear catching, perfect for a party or just starting your weekend or evening off right. Tracks to take particular note of--- Gangsta Lovin', Irresistable Chick, Party in the Rain, and the title track. This is definantly a CD worth your time. Get an extra copy for your car stereo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for outdoor use.....one dead on arrival","review":"ordered a twin pack. Arrived in a small brown box with two small tags on it indicate \\"Indoor/Outdoor Light Timer\\". However, it's clearly stated in the first line on operation guide that it's \\"Indoor use only\\". It's also stated to be applicable 0C~55C (32F~131F) so I can't use it to control the Christmas decoration in my front yard at all!More than that, I found 1 of the 2 timers are actually dead out of box!If you want to feel safe and ease while your Christmas decoration is controlled by a timer, go get better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and easy to use","review":"My favorite part of this timer is that it doesn't have those little plastic tabs you usually have to pull on and off (don't you always lose them too?) This one is almost like a flower - you lift the \\"petals\\" to turn the lamp (or whatever) on, push them in to turn it off - all in 10 minute increments. There's also a switch on top that lets you turn off the outlet on the side of the timer without screwing up the timing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for outdoor use and not digital.","review":"Advertised as a set of heavy-duty indoor/outdoor timers, instruction number one states the timer is for indoor use only. There is a strong warning about getting the product wet. The product is manual not digital. It uses tabs you flip up to set. It says it may be used with a 10 or 15 amp outlet. It will accept a three-pronged plug. I just got it, so I can't comment on how well they work."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of trash","review":"piece of trash.

Lacks any character development or sense of place (or sense of humor). What I learned from this book:1. Israelis eat humus.2. There are lots of places to shop in Jerusalem.3. Israeli cab drivers are not honest.4. Men drive better than women.5. New York cops encourage their wives to investigate homicides and to come along to arrest people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"Given that this was No Doubt's first album, I will cut them some slack. I know that they were more into ska when they started out, and that is obvious on this album. Most of the songs are corny and juvenile (I'm not gonna be mean and say they were downright \\"stupid\\"), but there are still great vocals (props Gwen), guitar riffs (Tom), bass parts (Tony), and a steady drum beat (Adrian). I also notice the keyboard parts Eric contributed to this sound. But this CD is so much different from how they were in '95, or now. I didn't like any of the songs, really, but since they were young and inexperienced in the music biz, I will not rate them too critically. (Note that the only reason I said these things are because I prefer their rock sound to their ska sound...I don't like ska.)In conclusion, it is clear TO ME why this album did not sell too well. (Don't worry, I still love you NxD!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is What Launched Their Career?","review":"I was expecting something way different from this. I loved Tragic Kingdom, but this, no way. The type of music and sound is totally different. There's no rock! And the lyrics are really stupid(like on track 2). I do not recommend this CD. Specialy if you are a fan of Tragic Kingdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"After hearing Tragic Kingdom, I wanted more. When I bought this album, I wanted my money back. Sure, Gwen Stefani's voice is great as usual, but the songs were short, badly writen, with no musical quality or good lyrics. The word I would use to describe this album is- Silly.

This self titled album is different to their newer stuff but i still liked it. There are great tracks like Get On The Ball, Big City Train and Trapped In A Box. This was a great buy and its a must have for any fan of No Doubt"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait a sec, how come all music isn't this good?","review":"THIS....CD....ROCKS!! All you people who gave it one star, come one, pull your heads out from under that rock! What are you thinking!?! Anyway, this is definatley No Doubt's best album. Why couldn't they have stayed this good? Gwen and the band seem to be floating in to the mainstream pop/rock scene, if only I could save them. Their self titled cd is fun, energetic and can I hear FUNKY? The best songs are Let's Get Back, Move On (does the beginning of this song sound like killer clown music or is it just me?), Big City Train, Trapped in a Box, Sinking and , of course Paulina!! Buy this cd, I command you BUY IT NOW!Oh and PS, I like \\"a music fan's\\" comments. Oooooh mindless MTV bashing, you go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After this it's all downhill","review":"This is a fabulous album. It rocks, it's funky and the lyrics are excellent. This album shows how much talent this band has if they want to use it. Unfortunately, after this it's all downhill. The reason this album is so good is because Gwen Stefani had such a limited role in the songwriting process. She got into the mix late after the band's lead singer committed suicide. The more Gwen got involved in the songwriting process, the worse the band's music got. She should stick to singing, which is something she's very good at. And, after her brother, Eric, split the band, they really got bad. Now all they write and play is bubblegum pop music marketed towards 14 year-old girls. Return of Saturn and Rock Steady are horrible albums. I would definitely recommend this album, but I can't recommend anything after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Pop","review":"Going by the majority of the customers' reviews displayed here, I opted for this one instead of Tragic Kingdom. Baaad move! This is your typical synthesizer-heavy light pop that predominated in the 80's. Not at all the ska/reggae influenced music that I was expecting. Truly trashy, truly forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst No Doubt Album Ever","review":"No Doubt has really evolved over the many years they have been together. Unfortunately, this album came out before they put out great rock songs that I associate them with.This album is so annoying. Only tracks nine through twelve bear repeated listening. The rest sounds like torture used to drive criminal holdouts out of their homes and into the waiting arms of police officers. Gwen Stefani sounds like a manic hamster, and the band seems caught in a frantically spinning hamster wheel of polka music, with aging marimba players delightedly playing their horns.One song is about eating all kinds of food, with a nice belch at the end. Grow up.Instead of this album, I highly recommend, No Doubt, The Singles (1992 - 2003)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ska Fan's Opinion","review":"I got the album thinking that it might be good, since No Doubt was a \\"ska band\\" back then. It is definitely their best album ever, but only because they play a better kind of music. Basically, this is just really weird ska. I just couldn't listen to it. If you're into second and third wave ska, definitely don't get this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubt at their best!!!!","review":"Since my creative writing skills have been drained, what little I have, I will make this review short, yet sweet. Though not recognized as well as the critically acclaimed \\"Tragic Kingdom\\", this collection of songs strongly reflects their major influences during their teenage, club-playing years. Though many of these songs that appear on \\"No Doubt\\" may seem somewhat nonsensical, this ablum is by far the most interesting of the three that are currently availible. As Gwen calls it during ND's live performances, \\"ol' skool No Doubt\\" is by far the most interesting and most charismatic of all that ND CURRENTLY has to offer. I strongly recommend this ablum to anyone who enjoys the music of ND."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of No Doubt","review":"This is the best from No Doubt.

Green tries to be funny but ends up being stupid. The monsters are a miasma of bits and pieces of Lovefraftian-style critters, and their descriptions are really lousy. No one, not even the author, seems to know what the plot is or what motivates these critters, making this a lousy C Movie, like the kind that The Sci-Fi Channel puts out. Indeed, bad writing equals turgid plotting, dull characters, plus trivial dialogue -- which is the losing formula for many cheesy sci-fi horror B-flicks, as well as for this story.Conclusion: I'm only marginally relieved that I paid $2.02 for this book. That's because I still feel as if my $2.02 has been wasted. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mellow musician","review":"He hardly kicks like a rock band; more like a Georgia mule.

Then, a little past halfway, the track transitions into a more traditional club trance synth line.

I really felt for the author and looked forward to him succeeding. I looked online to read about the rest of the author's life, and I was so happy to see that it ended well. The reader will be able to see that the author of this autobiography is very smart and funny, yet he makes such wacky decisions. He definitely lived his life to the fullest, and his feelings of joy about the world will rub off on you. This book is also an intriguing look into the past. You will learn all about the way people lived and the strange jobs people had many years ago. This book is written in a different writing style than modern readers are used to, but the chapters are so short, and the author so charming that you will definitely enjoy reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to cause acne!","review":"I really like the MyChelle cranberry cleanser and Pumpkin peel but I did no have much success with this serum. I have mild acne which seemed to worsen with this product. When I stopped using it and continued with the cleanser and peel, my skin cleared up nicely.

It used to be not the least bit sticky, and was highly effective. Now it is sticky almost to the point of being soapy, and is no longer effective for my acne-prone skin. I respect the effort to make this product completely vegan, but unfortunately, for me, it compromised the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No improvement","review":"I've this product a month before I decided to review it - my skin isn't any better than when I started, possibly even worse. This doesn't soothe and calm any red skin. The bottle is tiny and you have to very frugle with the pump because every pump costs you 25 cents. All in all, about as effective as if they had just put water inside it. Unfortunate because I had held out hope for this. I'll order this one other time because sometimes things do take 2 months to really become effective. If the second bottle improves my skin, I'll remove this review. If not, I'll keep it up.Update: 3 months of use, never noticed a single improvement. In fact, the serum wound up making my skin feel perpetually tight and dry, causing it to be MORE red. Wonderful waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change in Formula since I originally gave glowing review....","review":"THIS IS AN UPDATE 1/24/2011: Since my original review last year, Mychelle seems to have reformulated this serum. It now has a soapy, sticky feel to it that wasn't there before and leaves my skin feeling tight and dry afterward to the point of requiring moisturizer. I have yet to find a moisturizer that doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts, so this defeats the purpose of the Clear Skin Serum. I will not purchase this again and have lowered my original star rating and deleted my stellar review. So sad.... the original formula was really, really fabulous. And the zit zapping quest resumes.

But what happened to the story? At a point very quickly into the story (10 pages), the author seems to lose interest, and the book just wallows along. There is also very little erotocism. This is a fast food book. Frankly, a reader would be better of with any of the Emmanuelle series or The Story of O. While the stories are different, the writing is far superior, and at least the authors complete a thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash!","review":"I can see that others found this book exciting, but to me this was an all time low.I don't see the piont in naming pure sadism erotica. Punishment and no passion. Torture and no sex.

You can't even completely blame the author because there were too many typos to count. But falling on the author(and editor)is that the material had not been proofed. I would hope that if you write a book about something that you have researched the details. I also remember on an episode from second season when Isabel is talking with Max about leaving for college and mentioning that she could change the value of money. I have to point out that in a section of the book when Michael, Max and Isabel are outside painting,Max is recalling a time back when he was thirteen and they were painting with his dad. Dad said he was glad Michael could join them but on one of the episodes Max and Isabel's mom had mentioned that she was surprised to never have met Michael before.Also, HOW MANY TIMES CAN THE AUTHOR HAVE MARIA CALL MICHAEL SPACEBOY?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there an editor in the house?","review":"I'm only about a third of the way through this book, but I have to say I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in the proof-reading and editing. Three major errors in the first 12 pages is rediculous.The author can't even get the timing right. He indicates that Max and Michael have known each other for 18 years before leaving Roswell. They were six when they came out of the pods and weren't reunited for two years after that. This makes only 10 or 11 years together. Not 18. (although I would agree to 12 if you want to count the day wandering in the desert together.)It's so filled with errors, I'd think it was a vanity press edition of a fan-fiction. Although I've read better fan-fiction, too.There are some good points, but in general, I'm not at all impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"GNR rocks!

In my opinion, the album is just bad and somewhat silly. Use Your Illusion I is clearly the better album of the two. Don't get me wrong, I love Guns N' Roses, but Use Your Illusion II and The Sphagetti Incident, I think are GNR's worst albums. By the way, Geffen records has just released GNR's Greatest Hits album, inspight of Axl's objection. Anyway, the best songs from Use Your Illusion II are going to be on this greatist hits album.

The rest is really BAD.\\"My World\\" is a weak joke. \\"So Fine\\" features some of the world's worst singing and lyrics. \\"Breakdown\\" isn't even halfway complete.

This includes the soundtrack for Interview with a Vampire. The Gunners do their kick a@@ rendition of \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" originally done by the classic Rolling Stones. But for the regular GNR fan, Use Your Illusion I & II are a must have, for within these two CD's lies the Guns N' Roses Trilogy: Don't Cry, November Rain, and Estranged.

Like Use Your Illusion I, there is some experimentation away from the straight hard rock/metal of their first album, but the different styles work quite well. However, this album has even less of that pure rock than UYI1, and a just as heavy dose of bleating about the evil media... and just about everyone else, for that matter. (No wonder Guns N' Roses broke up.)But even those songs, like \\"Get in the Ring,\\" are good enough that you're willing to listen to the album all the way through.

If combined with Use Your Illusion I, I believe that it would have been more successful, and would be recognized as one of the '90s best albums.

Excluding songs such as \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\", \\"14 Years\\", \\"Civil War\\", and \\"Yesterdays\\", this album is weak.

I prefer Use Your Illusion 2 compared to these.This album has many 'quite moving' soft rock songs and a sprinkle of GNR's unique hard rock/ soft metal. The latter is evident in songs like 'Get In the Ring'.The collection of soft rock songs are the best i've heard in one single album. Songs like 'Civil War', '14 Years' and 'Knockin' on Heavens Door' will be familiar to people who have never even heard of GNR, (thats how famous they are). The best song on this album is undoubtly 'Don't Cry' and Its a shame that you can't hear the sample on Amazon.I got this album in 93', and i'm still discovering new sounds (thanx to Slash).

From there the album takes a downward spiral into inexcusable ineptitude, I mean, some of it is really really bad, \\"Get in the Ring\\"??? Come on! The album recovers for \\"Estranged\\" and \\"You Could Be Mine\\" but finishes poorly with the god awful Vanilla Ice-like \\"My World\\".

I know that anyone who takes the time to study his materials, this video and the books, will better understand the LSAT as well as improve their overall score.

It's that simple, and honestly it's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I was able to review this video as part of Nathan's class. The video is very similar to being in class with him. He has a unique and often entertaining way of teaching. I've seen significant improvement in my performance on all of the LSAT sections thanks to Nathan's style and methods of teaching. The video breaks down 12 Logic games, step by step in the manner Nathan himself would actually have done it. Through this, Nathan teaches you some of the best ways to attack each question, quickly make inferences, and improve your score. If you are unable to attend an LSAT prep course, this video would be worth the money it costs. Keep in mind that the DVD does not include the tests that he reviews.

The book's cover, which was questionably plain in the first edition, is repeated here with a different background color. This new guide is supposed to be revised and updated, but the only thing I see different are the enormously inflated values on many of these figures. I can count a handful of pictures that are actually new to this edition. I was looking forward to this book as I am an avid Mego collector, but I cannot express to you how disappointed I was in this revised edition. Everything is virtually the same. Some figures are curiously overpriced. (Example: a prototype that is valued at 6000.00, yet it is the only one and has never been sold - where does that value come from?)If you have the first edition of this book, it is enough for you to have some good reference, but this second edition is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible Comes To Life!!","review":"This bible is excellent!

It focuses on Cuba since the Revolution (1959), but covers events from countries throughout the region, including the Central American civil wars and the Southern Cone military dictatorships. Everything is true in the book; but its great weakness is that it is nothing more than a long list of events trying to show that US policy towards Latin America was belligerent in the latter half of the twentieth century. It lacks any original or dynamic interpretations. I would only recommend this book to someone who does not know, or believe, that the United States has behaved as an imperial power in Latin America."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for the student of Latin American history","review":"Overall an excellent book that deals with U.S. military interventions in Latin America from the perspective of a Latin American scholar. My one critique of the book is an obvious bias against the United States with no intent on even trying to be objective. I would still highly recommend it. The obvious biases aside it is an excellent tool in understanding why Latin American people and leaders have negative feelings towards the United States and why Latin Americans see the U.S. as the bad guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Melons","review":"My family has read the first book of cute and bubbly Caddie and wanted to read and learn more about her life growing up in Wisconsin.

Rudofsky denounces the customs and history of the country as soon as he erroniously explains them. Ancient accounts from racist sailors are given to back up the history of Rudofsky's bad interpretations, lending to some downright obsurd and incorrect accusations of the Japanese people.This is a book that is not fit for anthropological research, and seems to only belong to a bygone era. If you are looking for the skewed American view of Japan from the 'The Kimono Mind's publishing date of 1965, this is the book for you. Typical of old white American men in 1965, the book has a racially biased tone and misquoted history to serve it's purposes.

There are many great anecdotes about the countries the shawls derive from, and historical information about how the shawls were derived. The shawls are all lovely, and range from simple to complex.Oberle does not waste the experienced knitter's time with a how-to section. There is a \\"techniques\\" chapter, but it only gives instructions for specific methods used in the patterns. These are methods that will probably be familiar to experts, but the chapter is informative for beginning and intermediate knitters.I say it's \\"mostly\\" a pattern book, but the construction of each design is broken down in such a way that a knitter of intermediate or higher skill level could adapt it for a different yarn and gauge. So in that sense, it is also a book of inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow what a book!","review":"Any knitter will be pleased with this book of shawls, there are shawls for everyone's taste.

Another great knitting book this year","review":"This has been quite a year for great knitting books. And Cheryl Oberle's book on shawls is not to be missed.The photography is really outstanding. Cheryl models her shawls in such a way to show the beauty of the shawl and at the same time make an artistic statement.The shawls represented are quite varied; most are done, however, in sport weight yarn. This is convenient for those who don't want to attempt a project in cobweb-fine laceweight yarn. However, directions are given if you do want to change the yarn weight to suit your tastes.The schematics include a layout of the shawl shape (oblong, diamond, triangle, etc) and the lace patterns are charted in many cases. There is a nice section on techniques.All together, a really fine volume in the folk series from Interweave Press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully instructive!","review":"As a somewhat inexperienced knitter (been knitting very little more than stockinette stitch for nigh on 30 years), I found this book to be excellent! The patterns -- reworked from traditional designs into knitting patterns reflective of the origins and intentions of the originals -- are lovely, and the photographs give you a marvelous preview of what the finished product should look like. Of course, the one that I chose was one of the most complex in the book. The charting and instruction given, including (and especially) the section on techniques, were most helpful, and I was able to create an heirloom quality piece without running to anyone in the middle of the night for assistance. I'm eager to try another!BE ADVISED: It does take quite a long time to finish some of these projects. It has taken me three months to finish one since I don't have large blocks of time to spend.

Here were the problems and reason I am not buying another one: 1) Crackling sound 2)Backup battery never charged up 100% thus an annoying message would appear that said you need to recharge your backup battery or you will lose data 3) During average use, the battery only lasts for 1 - 2 days until you have to recharge. 4) Customer service is horrible. They never responded back to my problems and I called them 4 times! 5) The camera takes low quality pictures 6) The screen res is horrible. This is strange since Viewsonic makes decent monitors. 7) The playback audio, ie voice memo playback, is too soft to hear in a car. 8) Need I say more.

I was planning on the iPaq, but the ViewSonic was $100 cheaper, and had the digital camera. With the same specs, except minus integrated WiFi and plus camera, it evened out. It performs well, has a long lasting battery, and is increadibly slim. It also charges quickly. It may not have as crisp a display as the iPaq, but it does its job. Besides, I can't really tell the difference. The camera does appear to be more of an after-thought though. It needs just the right amount of light. In a partially dark room, the whole thing goes black. In a light room, it goes bright white. Even if the camera was excluded, it would still be a better deal then most PDA's. No problems yet.

After a few days the replacement started doing the same thing. I email Veiwsonics tech support and they said that it is a problem that they are working on. Recently (I've only had this replacement for about a month) this new replacement has started a new thing where the screen starts getting fuzzy and then nonresponsive to where I have to do a soft reset.

I wanted an updated version, and the information in this new printing is indeed updated. But the pictures are very badly reproduced. My 44-year-old version looks brand new in comparison. The plates are blurry and over-exposed, making them look washed out and destroying important nuances.

It's a great guide, VERY comprehensive, & sure to get much use by me but I only have one complaint in the updated version - in the 1966 edition they had a list of all of the birds in the back of the book with a little box next to them so you could check off which ones you had seen & keep track. I thought this was a great feature to have but it is not included in the updated version so I guess I will have to take the pages from the old book & stick them in the back of my new copy.

What I don't love, however, is this collection of cover songs, which includes the unlisted bonus track \\"Look at Your Game, Girl\\" (written by mass murderer Charles Manson). It's kind of a grab-bag of the bands' favorite old punk songs, and not really a true GN'R album. Get it (if you must) as close to dirt-cheap as possible.

What awful covers I could've done better myself on the singing. Guns were great in 87/88 but with the last few things they've done over the last few years has really been a load bollocks Paris, France 1992 for one (and even now they have remained inactive for the last 7 years). Axl and the rest of the band consider retiring unless you bring back Steve Adler and get rid of Matt Sorum.

Granted, I realize the lineup present when this album was recorded had a different drummer and rhythm guitarist. So, obviously not quite the same band, but Slash and Duff were still there (at the time). That worked.I only bought this album because I didn't have it and plus I needed to fulfill the $25 supersaver option. Otherwise, I wouldn't have. Don't get me wrong.

If you are collecting all their work I would put this towards the bottm of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool album!","review":"I believe the title of this album is a parody of a movie entitled \\"The Linguini Incident\\". This album contains songs previously recorded by other artists. One of them is SINCE I DON'T HAVE YOU which was a hit. I don't know the name of the artist who first recorded the song back in the fifties,but I do know it was previously covered by Art Garfunkel. DOWN ON THE FARM tells about boring life on the farm. W. Axl Rose sings \\"I feel just like a vegetable\\",\\"I feel like a fish out of water\\", and \\"Everything smells like horse----!\\" on that song. There are other profanity-filled favorites like ATTITUDE,I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU,BUICK MAKANE and AIN'T IT FUN. This album sold far less than Guns 'n Roses previous albums. Also the group disbanded after this album. All the other songs are cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks bad","review":"Hmmm....unless you are a REALLY REALLY huge fan of GNR (where anything that comes from them sounds good to you) then you should STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.

Unless you are really into GnR, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"AIn't it fun?","review":"This is a well-done collection of covers from punk and neo-punk bands of the 70's and 80's. Most are well done, but one track stands so far above the rest that, for me, this is a \\"one song CD.\\" And that is \\"Ain't it Fun?\\", a remake of the Dead Boys 1979 original. The GNR version is quite simply one of the best rock singles ever made. Great guitar intro. Axel's tortured vocals capture punk nihilistic angst perfectly. Listen to it as you're getting ready to go out and party. You'll have a great night! (BTW, there is a CD single out for this, so if you find it, you could skip the rest...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem","review":"You may read the synopsis of the album: 'a collection of punk covers by GNR' and think it's going to be rubbish but if you know Guns N' Roses, they make everything special and this ain't an execption! Every song is cool, there's lovely ballads like 'Since I don't have you' and pure rockers in there as well. Well worth buying if you like GNR. In between the tracks, there's banter from the band and they really do sound happy to be in each other company, so why the split up? (I now cry into my beer) Do'h. Anyways, BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spaghetti Incident?","review":"There is nothing wrong with this CD, except there is nothing GN'R has wrote. It's all covers. These covers have like a punk-rock tune and this is not like GN'R's style at all. And where the hell did those excellent Slash solos go? They're not missed, but there is a huge different between the Use your Illusion-series and this album. But buy it if you like punk-rock. Although it's not GN'R, it's pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work","review":"Duff really takes control and delivers while axel helps out with the classic \\"Ain't it fun\\".A must for G N R fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spaghetti Incident? more Gn f'n R","review":"This album, which is just like 'Lies' was a album put together to give the fans a little something to keep them content. I personally think it was a really good album. They gave gratitude to some of their favorite bands and people who helped inspire the great music that Guns N' Roses created. People bash it cause its an album of remakes, the said it was going to be. Give it a rest, and just celebrate with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I don't know what is the deal with people who say this album is bad, but I know this is a truly great pice of work. The songs are not written by Guns, but they are preformed really well. Everyone is saying that this is no good, but I don't see it. I say buy it, listen to it n' decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"For diehard GNR fans only","review":"Save your hard-earned money, folks. This album is the epitome of laziness and ego. When a band thinks you want to hear its interpretations of other artists' songs, you know they've jumped the shark. Skid Row fell into a similar trap around the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm ...","review":"This was just strange as far as I'm concerned. It's not unusual for a band to do cover songs, but it is unusual for a band to put out an entire album of cover songs. I wonder why they - or let's be frank here, Axl - felt like he needed to do this. To say this was a weak ending to their career is the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing it. After the phenomenal success of the Illusion albums we get ... this? Well, it's something. Covers are covers, even if it's one you really like. I never listen to this one, but it will remain in my collection. This is like all those boxes of cereal in the pantry - not enough to eat but too much to throw away."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"wat in the hell is this crap use ur illusion 1/2 were good appetite for destruction waz amazing but the spagetti incedint? wat kinda name is that"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guns N Roses hit rock bottom","review":"The Spagetti Incedent was Guns N Roses last ablum. They really fell from glory. First of all the album is 100% remakes. In the past GNR has done great remakes like \\"Knockin on Heavens Door\\" and \\"Live and Let Die\\". These were lousy remakes. They even did a remake of a remake. This was the first CD without Izzy. He did a lot of the writing. Maybe he was the talent of the group. Hopefully GNR will make a new CD to make up for this.Nate Dusek"},{"rating":"2","title":"GNR's best album","review":"By far their best.

Its a bunch of cover songs and the only one I could stand was \\"hair of the dog\\" a cover of Nazereth...

At its very centre, the theme, as we find out if unlucky enough to purchase this lemon, is simply Rose's last temper tantrum driven by an overblown ego and the belief that he is the band. Gone are Slash's spirit and the band's pretence of staying together. No good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Guns N Roses","review":"The Spagethi Incident? The bands 1993 album and the last too feature most of the original members. Honestly its not really that good and is pretty cheap. Look the whole album is a punk tribute album, obviously they didnt really care about this album AT ALL. Though there are some good tributes like there tribute too Hair Of The Dog is good but honestly its not really worth your money. It is a hard rocking album but the thing of it is, is that it just isnt really them, and most metal fans dont like punk so why would they come out with a punk tribute album. This album is only for those who want all of Guns N Roses albums or just like punk tribute albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review on a Wedding Start Up Adventure.","review":"The book was a really good insight to what one should know when starting up his/her own wedding business. The book went step by step on from what attorney you need to where you should market your clientele. Some of the chapters I knew just from taking entrepreneur courses in college and a lot of materials I didn't know ex: liability section,etc. I would have like to see a few cities with maybe 2-4 wedding consultants and their phone number to talk with them and get their insight. Reading the book and learning is a wonderful experience, but also hands on training is another wonderful experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Material","review":"This is a very good reference material for someone exploring the opportunities in the wedding business.

I cut multiple 3/8 x 1 1/2 dadoes in maple end grain. flawless and effortless. it deserves the highest marks (although Amazon gets a \\"D-\\" for packing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Grooves","review":"I do a lot of cabinet work. This blade set is worth the money if you're making furniture or cabinets. The grooves are square and the bottoms are flat. As for the quality, even when cross-cutting oak plywood there is no tear out of the fibers. I was so tired of having to go back over all my cross-cuts with sandpaper and then the joints wouldn't be tight due to the bottoms not being straight. This blade set also comes with a nice set of shims to \\"Dial In\\" the thickness and the extra blades are great with plywood. It's expensive but with this product you get what you pay for. If your doing quality work don't skimp on a cheaper blade set trust me when I tell you, pay a little more it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I've used this set in my radial arm and Unisaw. They're easy to use and do a really nice job. To make things easier on yourself, label each of the chipper blades to make setup quicker. I wish they would have done that at the factory but it took 5 minutes so it wasn't a big deal. The shims are handy and there is a little instruction book that tells you how to set up for different size cuts. I'd also recommend using a dial caliper if you're a real stickler for accuracy. I'd be interested to try out the new dial-dado from Freud, but until these wear out (which should take a LONG time) I'll stick with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuts flat and true, but it had a chipped tooth on a chipper.","review":"I probably won't ever cut more than a 3/4\\" dado, so the chipped chipper was a spare anyway, but I still say it should have arrived in factory condition. I thought the package was a little flimsy, and no doubt the reason the carbide was able to chip out in the first place. This is a real pricey dado blade set, so a better system of cutter separation would have been much appreciated.I have made several cuts with it, and I haven't had any tear out, or chipped work pieces as of yet. I usually prefer to use my router for dado cuts, but if I am going to be making a whole lot of small repetitive dado's and rabbets, then the blade is worth the time and set-up.Some reviewers had trouble with the shims and their arbor, but I had no issues. I am using this set on a Jet JTAS 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cut and easy to setup","review":"...This dado blade has a guide (in the manual) for setting the correct width, it has almost no chip-out and the cut looks like I cut it with a razor. The true test for me was when I had to make a series of cuts for undersized plywood. The guide told me what to use to get the width of 19/32 of a inch. It took me just a couple of minutes to set the dado blade in table saw and make my test cut. The cut was amazing. The dado was exact and because the blade didn't wobble I set the fence correct the first time. If you are planning on making dados find the money and buy this dado blade you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did I get the ONE bad SD508?","review":"Based on the other reviews, I didn't think there would be a problem. When I got my blade, I did a test cut. I noticed that one of the chippers was slightly bigger (diameter) than the others based on the test cut. The bad chipper cut a deeper groove within the dado and the bottom of that groove was a mess. (Ripped out of the wood, not cut). With the one exception, the dado cut was as described previously, glass smooth and perfectly sized. Bad luck follows me but I'll try one more time because of what the other reviews have stated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cut at a great price!","review":"Cuts flat-bottomed dados with no tearout. I have used it in plywood, melamine and hardwood with great success. What else could you want?If you look into the cost of the Forrest or a Systematic stacked set you will find the Freud a bargain. Both of the others cost well into the 250+ range. If the shims were marked it would be perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Blade rocks!","review":"I've had the best dado set Sears had to offer and I found it too complicated. I decided to give the Freud a try and its everything I dreamed of. The cut is perfect but more important its simple to use. Its just a matter of adding chippers to your set up to get your cut. Its amazing and I would buy it again, thats how good it is. Now who do I see about doing a commercial??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Dado Set","review":"I've only used one other stacked dado set before (brand unknown), and this set tops that one. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that the dado bottoms weren't totally smooth, and two of the carbide tips on the outside blades already cracked off after only a couple of uses (Probably a fluke - and the warranty should cover this - I plan on replacing my current set with the same make/model). Even after careful setup, following the instructions as exact as possible, I still got lines in between the chippers and outside blades. In all - the finish produced was good and I would definately recommend these to anyone looking for good, reasonably priced, stacked dado sets, but don't expect perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a good buy","review":"Not a good unit for the price. This has gone up since I bought it and is too high. All the shims are accurate and easy to set up. I thought a high dollar dial-in would have been nice but those were at least twice the price and do not always give a flat bottomed dado, but now I wonder at the current price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blade","review":"I purchased the blade based on numerous reviews in magazines and on on-line forums. However, it does leave scoring marks on the outside right blade. Other than that a 5-STAR purchase. Also the price was great too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust, rust, rust","review":"I haven't even been able to try this set yet. First set came with shims all rusted together plus some rust deposits behind the outside cutter teeth. When spending $200 on a dado set you expect the condition to be pristine. Replacement set was sent and had even more rust deposits than the first.Spoke to a foreign based cs agent who said that all they could do is offer a refund on the set. I asked why it wasn't possible to check the replacement set before being sent that it was free of the rust. Didn't get satisfactory response.I'm sure that this set works really nicely per the \\"FW\\" review, but don't want to start off with a rusted set and have to buy third party shims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dado set you can buy","review":"I have a 3HP Delta Unisaw and have a made quite a few cuts with the SD508. It make repeatable, glass smooth dado's. Set up is easy. The instructions are sparse, but they are adequate. The case is great. It helps avoid dinging the blades/chippers. All the shims you'll ever need are there. I have a friend who purchased the SD506 and is equally happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, Every Time","review":"I have now been using this dado stack for two years and it still works great.

Well worth a purchase if you are into Voyager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but achingly badly written","review":"No one's going to buy a book about the making of Voyager if they don't like Voyager, so it's understandable that the writer refrains from any criticism. Yet he adopts the tone that Voyager is unrivalled high-quality drama and whether you believe him or not it rankles enough to make you wince through even the really interesting sections on the making of the show's pilot film. There's also a peculiar habit of trying to force a structure to the book by leaving bits out from the beginning and throwing them in at the end which you might live with if there were an index. Poe is a name in Star Trek circles because he wrote The Making of Star Trek (under a psuedonym) but where you can excuse the poor journalism of that book because he was new and fresh, thirty years later you feel he should have improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the Voyager fan!","review":"As a fan of Star Trek Voyager, I found this book to be an incredible glimpse into how the show was created. Mr. Poe has done a wonderful job of exploring the \\"how's, why's, and almost's\\" of this often underrated series.

A must have for the Voyager fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"If you like endless detailed descriptions of people's offices, their small working areas at Paramount and all the minute production details explaining how this series got off the ground then this book is for you.

Wasted potential.","review":"When I saw previews for this film, I thought it may have been based on Algernon Blackwood's short story The Willows. I was excited, but quickly became bored. The film is little more than the same \\"kill the cast\\" flicks of which you have seen entirely too many.The setting is lovely (the Broads are a joy), and the thought of being lost in a sea of reeds is bound to bring out fear, but I wound up fast-forwarding in the hopes that something would catch my eye and tell me what was going on.SPOILER ALERT. The \\"reveal\\" doesn't really reveal much. The killer is told to kill by the ghosts, but that makes no sense. No explanation that I saw said why he killed the kids in the first place. So it is a chicken and the egg kind of thing. Makes no sense, has no significant plot, and the very end, where everything seems to go back in time and the woman's eyes turn black, makes no sense either.

However, two fights stand out as quality fights. Randleman vs Ninja features \\"the Monster\\" turning Rua's right eye into roast beef. A pleasant sight to watch.

As the one reviewer below mentioned, I too wish this whole album would've been acoustic. To this day, I consider G N'R Lies, side 2, to be one of my favorite album sides ever. The four songs just flow together perfectly, always leaving me wanting more. I would've paid full price for just the acoustic songs on this album. It's now fourteen years later, and although some of it may be sentimental, I can still sit back and enjoy these great acoustic arrangements. -1 star for side one, which never really grew on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underated Unknown middle album","review":"A relatively disregarded album (in the history of GNR) I think it is one of their strongest. This album really highlights Slash's ability as a well rounded guitarist (not just a loud one). Those who complain about racial slurs and lewd material are those that let words hurt them.

Even with that being the case there is really not anything to like about this. I suppose Patience is a pretty pleasant tune, and I will throw it on every once in a long while. However I really can't stand most of the material on here. Mama Kin is the worst butchering of a classic I have ever heard. Even for fans of the band, don't expect \\"Use Your Illusion\\" or \\"Appetite For Destruction.\\" This band was not meant to release those albums ever again, they burnt out as quick as they arrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisiting this album","review":"Recently I was talking to an old friend of mine and we were talking about how great Guns N' Roses are when I realized that while I could remember Appetite For Destruction and Use Your Illusion 1 & 2 I had trouble remembering Lies. My friend said \\"Don't you remember the song Patience?\\" and I was like \\"Oh! Of course, how could I forget\\"?! To make a long story short I thought I would \\"revisit\\" the album and to figure out how the hell I could actually forget about an entire album from a band I freakin' love. Well, now that I've listened to each song I remember that back then when it came out (I was around 17 years old) I remember thinking the album cover was cool looking but that the album SUCKED HARD!!!! After Appetite For Destruction, this album was a piece of \\"Fluff\\" in my mind back then and still is now that I've heard it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skrwedriver?!?","review":"Wow!

The opening 4 (Live) are fantastic rock songs that get you going. The Next four are a little more varied Patience is beautiful, One in a Million is lyrically \\"different\\" and not for the easily offended, as is also the Inlay card, where lyrics were, amusing stories (\\"LIES\\") of Sex Scandles invilving vicars and amongst other things some Soft-Core Pornography.

To my amazement, Guns N' Roses actually took a step backward. A huge one! G N' R Lies will disappoint anyone who appreciated Guns N' Roses material off their two most successful albums, \\"Use Your Illusion I\\", and of course \\"Appettite For Destruction\\". I honestly can say that this album is near terrible. It does not feature any hit singles, videos, or any really good songs, like all the successful Guns N' Roses albums do. I advise people not to purchase this album, and I encourage them to focus more on buying the better Guns N' Roses albums, \\"Use Your Illusion I\\", and \\"Appettite For Destruction\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smooth pop ain't Rock!","review":"\\"Good boys don't make rock'n'roll.

Undeniably so...","review":"The lyrics are disturbing, that was kind of the point. It seems to me they're most disturbing to those people who have something to hide. The power of this music, this band, to make people confront the most primal depths of the human soul is undeniable. And they do it with such tough vulnerability, time after time, it's just beautiful. Guns N' Roses have given the world a gift in the form of music that simply cannot be denied... if you're brave enough to confront it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"A LOOOOOOOONG time ago this was THE second tape (yes tape) I bought with my allowance money (the 1st was Appetite for Destruction.) I loved it then and still love it now. People say there's no talent, the music is hatred and the singer is lousy....they are complete idiots. The band is completely fantastic. They broke up the mundane mainstream music and made their own type of musical masterpieces, unlike anything out there at the time. The music is still kickass, my kids even love it!! They STILL rock, and in my opinion are the BEST Rock band that exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"GNR AT ITS FINEST","review":"God, there's so much good about this album. First of all, the previously unattainable \\"Live ?!*@ Like A Suicide\\" is on here, which really shows longtime fans how GNR was back in the day. You can really understand what these guys were going through as they talk about life in the city. \\"One In A Million\\", while controversial, is one of the best lyrical musical composures Axl has ever written. Axl truly is a genius. But to really get into it, \\"Patience\\" is an awesome song as well. The tune and characteristic whistling is just pure GNR. I got this album today, and i listened over it once. It is one of my favorite GNR albums now. Second only to Appetite For Destruction, with the Illusion ALbums coming in next. The Aerosmith cover is notable, but \\"One In A Million\\" is the highpoint of this album. If you're new to GNR or a hardcore fan, just buy it. It's definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Patience is a good enough reason to buy this album alone. The song absolutely blew me away with the emotion and power of a normally hardcore band."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSURD","review":"This is a lousy excuse for \\"music\\". Other than the poorly sung ballad or two that are recognizable on this piece of trash, this album is an utter downer. It does well, however, to demonstrate how this band lacked creativity and talent... ultimately leading to their demise. THIS IS THE WORST LEAD SINGER IN THE HISTORY OF ROCK AND ROLL.

One has the strong impression that the author knocked off this tome for one and only one reason: money. While the previous novel was impressive for the obviously immense research done to complete it, Aztec Autumn relies on implausible plot twists, magic, and the author's obvious prejudices for its effect. A fatal flaw is the author's choice of a mass murderer as a hero; any reader with a sense of justice begins rooting against the \\"hero\\" soon into the novel. Still, there is a certain amount of history interspersed with the author's prejudices, and fans of Aztec may want to read this mercifully short book just to get it out of their system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Most","review":"If I could pick 3 1/2 stars I would have.I enjoyed Aztec Autumn. It is not one of my favorite books and I don't think it is quite as good as Aztec. Reflecting on the that statment, how many sequels can claim to be as good as the original? There was something about Aztec that I find unplaceable. A sort of je ne sais quoi that Aztec Autumn unfortunately lacks, and while it does not make up for it, the book tries its hardest to by filling up every instant with action. With both this book and its predecessor, the endings left me thrilled yet high and dry at the same time. My only complaint of this book as an independant book is that, like Aztec, it is somewhat unbelievable, not so much in its greatness but in the characters' greatness. It is a good book, but not Mr. Jenning's best by far. If you haven't read Aztec read it and if you haven't read Raptor, then well, read that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Letdown","review":"In Aztec, Jennings came close to producing a modern prose epic,a panoramic picture of an infinitely interesting, sadly vanishedculture. Aztec Autumn, unfortunately, cannot measure up to the earlier effort. If Jennings had had more artistic sense, he wouldn't have released it, but there were probably so much pressure from his publishers and his literary agent that he couldn't help but try to cash in on his earlier success. The most telling weakness of this novel is Jennings' reliance on gratuitous sex scenes to keep the story moving. This device was beginning to wear on me in Journeyer, but by this stage it is beyond banal, and I am by no means a prude. He was simply running out of ideas, so he succombed to the Harold Robbins school of best-sellers. If you want to read a truly dumbed-down version of Aztec (one of the greatest \\"reads\\" of all time) fork over your money for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last hurrah.","review":"I read \\"Aztec\\" and \\"The Journeyer\\" when they first came out and still consider them to be the best historical novels I've ever read. \\"Aztec Autumn\\" pales in comparison to the original. Nevertheless, with all its flaws, it is still a better read than most of the novels I have read this year. But if you haven't read Jennings's earlier works yet (including \\"Spangle\\"), read those before you read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing comparable to the Aztec","review":"It is always a difficult task to write a sequel of a successful book. But also taking into account this kind of difficulty, I didn't like very much that one. Of course it is a readable novel (Jennings is an expert writer), but all the epic and historical backgrounds I found in the Aztec, has been currently lost. It is an average work, and any interest it can retain, derives, in my opinion, only by the sound of the original subject. I would have expected much more by the author of the Aztec."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete let-down!","review":"Anyone who loved Aztec as much as I did will only be dissapointed in AZTEC AUTUMN. The charachters are shallow and familiar, the story rushed and not nearly as impressive or believable as AZTEC. I had to re-read AZTEC to renew my feelings about Jennings lost after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing book","review":"Aztec was one of the most entertaining and engaging books that I have read in the last few years. The story was gripping, the characters were somewhat believable, and it was a real page-turner. Aztec Autumn, on the other hand, was completely dissapointing and sort of felt like it had been strung together by a computer program which pulled out elements of Aztec and then strung heavy-handed plots around them. Very little in Aztec Autumn seemed surprising or inspiring, and the narrative voice did not capture my attention the way it did in the original. It's hard to tell if a sequel like this, actually written by the author, is worse than one of those sequels written after the author died, by some hopeful writer obsessed with making a quick buck. One of the things that was great about Aztec was that it told a finite life story, but this book just dragged the story on in an unoriginal manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"In support of the author ....","review":"and the astounding first book, Aztec, i bought this book and amazingly finished reading it.Aztec Autumn should have been called Aztec winter since most of Jennings masterfull artistry has not only numbed but one would venture say has been frozen.Whereas in Aztec we find Mixtili the hero that one can identify with, while in Autumn the hero has few of the noble albeit violent traits and can actually be considered as probably the dumbest and luckiest of the Aztecs.It almost became omical while reading of his simplistic plots to kill Spaniards the idiot invariably was found out and usually foiled.And darn if there wasn't also an abundance of man hating women in this crowd of strange characters ... Quite unlike the Aztecs and totally missing from the first of Jennings books....Ok so I paid my dues in forking over the bucks for this book but Jennings the next one you publish I'll be a lot more carefull"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story, intricately woven.","review":"I loved this book. It was the first book of this author I have read, and I will definitely read more of his work. Although it reminds me of the book River God, Aztec Autumn is not as vivid. A great read for people who love history and a great plot. It reveals the horrors inflicted on native peoples by the Spanish conquistadors, and helps you see it from there point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aztec Lite","review":"If you've already read \\"Aztec\\", there is no need to read this book. If you haven't read \\"Aztec\\", and are intimidated by its length, then \\"Aztec Autumn\\" may be the book for you.\\"Aztec Autumn\\" covers much the same ground as \\"Aztec\\": the natives' puzzled reaction to Christianity, the Spanish conquerors failing to live it up their stated ideals, obligatory sex scenes which show how the natives innocently enjoy pretty much anything consensual. Though a sequel to \\"Aztec\\", \\"Aztec Autumn\\" adds little to the original story.Gary Jennings seems tired in this novel. There are occasional flashes of his story-telling skills which enliven the story, but by and large, Mr. Jennings seems to be going through the motions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennings is still great...","review":"As the second book in the Aztec series, \\"Aztec Autumn\\" pales a little in comparison to the epic \\"Aztec\\". It is still very well researched, and it carries the story well in the early days of the Spanish conquest. It just isn't quite as engrossing as \\"Aztec\\". I still enjoyed Jennings's extremely well researched realism and the lead character in this book, Tenamaxtli, is still an interesting character. He just isn't Mixtli. That's probably the danger in creating a character as brilliant as Jennings did in the first book.I still recommend this book. I think it is much better read back to back with the first book in the series. Turning the last page of \\"Aztec\\" then opening the first page of \\"Aztec Autumn\\" is worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift to husband","review":"This book was a gift for my husband.

This is Counting Crows best record since the original, and, contrary to what some reviewers seem to think, the lyrics are still as amazing as ever.

But, my attraction to them came with the soulfulness and truth of the music. I liked them in spite of their popularity.Like them no more. This disc is overproduced, overwrought garbage. It takes some particularly pungent aspects of eighties music and forms it into a CD of concentrated trash. I can't understand why so many people rate this ablum highly.The big struggle here is that I can't even respect their direction. It's one thing to be experiemental (a la Kid A of Radiohead or even Zooropa for U2). But this is just a big ole' sell out. There I said it. It's sellout.

What we have here is overproduced, predictable, routine, dull, mainstream, candy-coated electro bop.

The CD also comes with a book that does give you liner notes to every song so please fell free to sing along or look at the magnificent photos of the band. Now if this album were to be released in the year 1973 instead of 2002 it would fit right in just like the Beatles a timeless album that will be remembered for ever \\"my own option\\".

Duritz's sound has definitely turned pop with this record, which is unfortunate coming from one of the best songwriters of this generation. The originality of August and Everything After isn't there, nor is the edgy rock riffs of Recovering the Satellites. Some of their old sound come out in Black and Blue, and Richard Manuel is Dead, but American Girls is so syrupy-sweet it makes your teeth ache.

I'm not suggesting you not buy it - I'll still buy their next one - just know what you're getting into. This album finds the band exploring just about every sound except the one that it's good at, and Adam singing his same melodies, just changing the emphasis from song to song. If this were anyone else, it would just be an average album, but coming from CC it's dissapointing. A lot of bands have trouble growing and staying commercially viable at the same time, and I think CC has thus far accomplished this with a creative juice that has consistently blown me away. However, Hard Candy seems like a project that was phoned in. It's the sound of a band no longer deeply in touch with its music, but rather bored by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I loved August and Everything..., really liked 'Recovering the Sattelites' and from there its been downhill.

The sounds on the album are much more varied from song to strong, and stray a little further from the roots rock that has dominated their earlier albums. Songs like Good Time, and New Frontier, have sounds that are strikingly unfamiliar when considering the Crows earlier material, but nonetheless fit. The standouts on the album are \\"why should i come when you call,\\" \\"Richard Manuel is Dead,\\" \\"Up all Night,\\" and the title track. The only real fault with the album is that it seems to be over produced, leaving some tracks too busy to pick up on the little subleties. With that said, it is an amazing album nonetheless, and puts the Crows in a very select group of bands who can last for more than 10 years, and have multiple great albums. Buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"A huge fan of Counting Crows, it is hard for me to understand their sharp turn into the world of pop. August and Everything After begins defining the band with amazing lyrics and a beautiful, haunting piano accompanied by Adam Duritz's mournful and unforgettable voice.In Hard Candy, they have proceeded to throw all of that out of the window.The only song on the album which resembles their older music is Holiday in Spain, an extraordinarily likable track, even reminescent of the matchless Anna Begins.The entire rest of the album seems cheap and poppy, and lacks the true depth that characterizes Duritz. While the lyrics on the album read very meaningfully, the typical poppy music in the background brings them lightly to the surface where they float without true meaning. Had it not been for Holiday in Spain, my album would be for sale used on this site right now.I wish the friend who had given me this CD had been able to give me a Holiday in Spain single, and saved his money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You!","review":"I must admit, I just re-discovered the Counting Crows. Sure, I was a fan of radio hits like \\"Mr. Jones\\", \\"Round Here\\", and \\"A Long December\\", but I mostly forgot I even owned thosed cd's. I saw this in the store, and thought I might give it a chance, based on the fact that I enjoyed their past efforts. All I can say is THANK YOU for a band out there that finally releases and entire album full of great songs. If you've like the Counting Crows before, you'll love them now. If you've never given them a chance, pick up Hard Candy. It will leave you wanting more and more, just like your sweet tooth!Hands-down one of the best albums I have EVER picked up. My only regret is not finding this disc sooner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to like this album....","review":"I really do. But after months of listening, its just not taking. I own everything the crows have released and about 20 boots they didnt. As a songwriter, Ive worshipped Adam Duritz. And I feel like as a fan, Ive really grown with the band through their first three albums and been right there with them, but this-- this is mediocre at best. If it werent Counting Crows, theres NO WAY I'd have even considered buying it. I certainly wouldnt have put so much effort into trying to enjoy it. Sadly, I think the love affair is over. \\"Hard Candy\\" squeaks out a few moments that shimmer, but its mostly weak tunes that are overproduced propping up a collection of throwaway lyrics. Eek, its enough to make you cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pure delectable sweet","review":"The long awaited-for album has finally come out ! Hard Candy captures the Counting Crows' flavour and spirit. It is a pleasure to listen to as the texts are quite lyrical and there is more maturity in their music. August and Everything After (1993), Recovering the satellites (1996), and This Desert Life (1999) were pretty good. And if you like Counting Crows, you'll definitely like to chew \\"Hard Candy\\". Nice delectable sweet ! Although not a Turkish delight, but a real American one.Jam (from the strawberry country, France)This album is for me just like the \\"Dire Straits\\" albums I used to listen to : they all sounded the same, but each song had its own touch, and as I listen to Hard Candy again and again, I keep on discovering new pearls. Keep on listening to Counting Crows, you won't be disappointed. You will find your own personal treasures in this kind of delight.Christophe (Landerneau (try to find me !!))"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one great CD","review":"This is the best CD by the Counting Crows! It is deffinately worth buying for yourself, and all of your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Worst of the four albums to date. Despite the lyrics being consistently excellent - the music is instantly forgetable except for cuts: Hard Candy, Miami and New Frontier. The Joni Mitchell cover was stupid, lazy and not gitchy to us 40 year olds who heard Sonny and Cher stink it up on this song, too. Adam needs to find some better song writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.... it is really as groundbreaking as they say?","review":"I must be the odd man out. I eagerly awaited the release of this CD, as I have all of the other CC discs. I own everything they've released and have been a big fan.... However, I'm not sure that this CD is such a marked departure from the previous efforts, except perhaps it's their most commercially viable CD yet. Each song sounds like a crafted radio tune. I think the music is \\"good,\\" but far from spectacular. Given their brilliance on August... and Recovering... this CD is a grave disappointment - not because it's musically different, because it feels like yet another creative band selling out and directing their music further away from creativity and closer to pop success.Overall, it's a fair CD, but those of us that are die hard CC fans have come to expect a great deal more than a \\"fair\\" CD from this band. I am gravely disappointed and consider this a very weak effort, at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Crows Album Ever","review":"I've listened to the album repeatedly over the last week, and can now honestly say that this is indeed their best album to date. It starts off with a one-two punch: the title track and their first single \\"American Girls,\\" are two of their cathiest songs. Naturally, as the album progresses the mood becomes a bit more dark (though still hopeful)as Duritz wails about missing former flames and the like (and sometimes with lyrics that make no sense, but I like them anyway). \\"Butterfly in Reverse\\" is a beautiful song. Other high points included \\"Carriage,\\" and \\"Black and Blue,\\" and the \\"hidden track\\" at the end is a fun number. Nothing on here is quite as memorable as \\"Mr. Jones,\\" or as moving as \\"Round Here,\\" both from \\"August,\\" but it is a more solid album overall (some of the later tracks on \\"August\\" bored me). 8.5 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duritz & Company Deliver Again","review":"Many speculated after the release of \\"August and Everything After\\" that the Crows would struggle to ever match the creative workmanship of their first album. However, the Counting Crows have once again proved the critics wrong, with their critically acclaimed fourth-album, duly titled \\"Hard Candy\\". The Crows have reinvented their sound once again as they moved further from the rootsy grassroots accoustic rock of \\"August..\\" to beautifully constructed songs and elegant writing. Standout tracks include \\"Hard Candy\\", \\"Miami\\", \\"Up All Night\\" and \\"New Frontier\\".This is one piece of candy to savor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Craftsmen","review":"Another solid effort from Adam and the boys, but I can't help but wish they had pushed the envelope a little more. AAEA was an unbelieveable record; like a lot of debuts its the very best songs from years of anonymous writing and playing. And RTS was a tremendous follow-up, in part because a lot of the songs sounded nothing like AAEA. Now it gets a little harder. They seem to have settled into a comfortable groove, which is nice because the songs are accessible and vaguely familiar (where'd that Lynyrd Skynyrd lick come from?) and the lyrics are interesting (if somewhat obscure). But I wonder whether (or maye hope that) they're going to get a little bored with the formula and take some risks next time out, even if it falls flat, ala U2 or REM. They certainly have the talent.And I liked Big Yellow Taxi - a nice hidden treat from a band that actually plays covers fairly often in concert and does a great job with them. Check out their live version of Sweet Home Alabama - it's cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already!","review":"The Counting Crows are perhaps the blandest band ever put on the radio besides Dave Matthews and REM. Their music is for rich, spoiled, poetry-obsessed upper-class college kids!All this band does is whine about how sad they are about girls- makes me sick! I don't know how anyone considers this \\"rock\\"- u wanna hear \\"rock\\"? Pick up \\"Dirt\\" by Alice in Chains!"},{"rating":"1","title":"COPY PROTECTED CD! Don't buy for MP3 Player","review":"Great album, but I have to give it one star because of the copy protection. I BOUGHT the album. WHY can't I copy a file to the MP3 player I use at the gym and when I travel! Don't tell me it's because others illegally file share. If the record label is going to restrict the use of the music CD they should be required to disclose it BEFORE you buy it. THIS CD IS GOING BACK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing effort","review":"But this one back in my car stereo as part of paring back my CD collection and was reminded both what a good album \\"August and Everything After\\" is and what a bad album this is. This is one that is clearly going into the donate box without even bothering to burn any of the tracks to my computer. Do not pass Go! Do not collect $200!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you do with hard candy?","review":"Suck it! That's the sentiment I gathered from the band after listening to this album. The music is mediocre, polished with just one or two fairly bright spots. I was drawn to this album upon seeing names like Ethan Johns, Ryan Adams and Leona Naess listed in the credits. I was hoping they could save the Crows from churning out another soulless record, but I was let down. This one is going up for resale."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a long time since August...","review":"And a very, very long time since \\"Mr.Jones\\". The band tries hard with \\"American Girls\\", but even at its best it's only a so-so Counting Crows track. The remainder of the album is mostly embarrassing, almost veering into Barry Manilow territory. The album hits its lowest point on tracks like \\"Miami\\", and is bafflingly inept on \\"New Frontier\\". On the strength of these songs I really wouldn't be surprised to see Counting Crows opening in Vegas very soon. They've already morphed into a lounge act on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome CD!","review":"Exlent album for music lovers. Sounds to me like a modern day Beatles group. Not usual CC album... but cool non the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Good","review":"Counting Crows deliver an album that is the highest quality they have done to date. There is not a bad song on this disc. I listened to it through about 3-4 times and realized there were 4-5 songs that really kicked out of my CD player. Adam Duritz still has a great voice, and you tell Steve Lillywhite had a huge influence on the making of this album. The songs are well-produced and smooth. This is not the hard rocking Counting Crows of their first two albums, but it is much better than the last, \\"This Desert Life.\\" In the last album they were headed for Hootie and Blowfish status, but this album puts them back on top, and for the near future at least, grammy candidates."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This music is not just beautiful but thought provoking. I love this fourth CD for its deep music and profound lyrics. I recomend it 100%!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the year? We've found it.","review":"What can I say? Hard Candy is another tremendous achievement in album creation by Counting Crows. This is definitely one to add to the collection; every Counting Crows fan should have it and any fan of music, and moreover any fan of quality songwriting, should pick up Hard Candy. Adam Duritz and company have done it again. Standout tracks? Off the top of my head, I'd go with \\"Hard Candy,\\" \\"American Girls,\\" \\"Good Time\\", \\"Miami\\", \\"Black and Blue\\", \\"Up All Night\\", \\"If I Could Give All My Love,\\" \\"Holiday in Spain\\", the hidden track cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\", \\"New Frontier\\"...wait......I'm just going to list all of them...this is how an album is supposed to be.Hard Candy injects a refreshing breath of life into the music scene, something that has been sorely missing as of late. Album of the year? I think we've found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Candy is Sweet","review":"It appears to be somewhat silly and futile to await another album by this group which would match the power, the grandeur, or the dramatic impact of their first, \\"August and Everthing After\\" of nearly a decade ago. Instead, we choose to take pleasure in another splendid work by one of America's finest bands. By maintaining those same influences that they have had from their inception--Van Morrison, Springsteen, The Band, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Burt Bacharach-- Counting Crows exhibit a measure of consistency that few rock ensembles do. And while Crow #1, Adam Duritz can be accused of occasionally being whiney, pretentious, and/or irritatingly self-conscious, we think this cd once again proves him to be a superb songwriter and one of the most emotive singers in rock today."},{"rating":"2","title":"All feathers and noise","review":"Not a bad album by the Crows, but far from their best work. Their catchiest song on this album is \\"American Girls,\\" featuring background vocals sung by none other than Sheryl Crow. Other than that, no tracks really stand out on this album, but none are particularly bad, either. If you are a fan of the Counting Crows, you'll probably enjoy this album. Otherwise, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Good","review":"For a CD I don't feel is Counting Crow's best effort, this is still a really good album and brings lots of listening enjoyment. Everyone had heard their cover of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" which is a very strong song, but not the best on the album. Even the debut single from this album, \\"American Girl\\" is only average for this disc. Great for any Counting Crows fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool counting crows","review":"countings crows new cd rocks!!! if you don't like them, you are crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"},{"rating":"2","title":"great songs + great band + great production = great album","review":"This review won't be long. I just want to tell folks who are looking into buying \\"Hard Candy\\" to go ahead and do so. I won't gush about how great the CD is and everything (and it is great) - I just want to tell you to buy it. Counting Crows are one of the best bands making music today and they undisputedly demonstrate their abilities on this album. Go ahead and purchase without fear. Thanks for reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Counting Crows best work yet","review":"With the addition of a new drummer, and soaring vocals, I think this is their best record yet. Up all night is my favorite. You finally hear Adam sing like we all knew he could. The rest of the guys let themselves soar too. This is a well written, well produced record sans the cover of Big Yellow Taxi [Joni Mitchell]. I don't remember who the teeny bopper is that joins them, but it sounds like she mailed the vocals in and they were added at the behedst of her record producing uncle. Just doesn't seem like it belongs. I really like this record other than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the bad reviews - This is GREAT!","review":"I can't understand why everyone doesn't like this album. I think Hard Candy is the best Crows work since August. I absolutely LOVE this. I - saddly - find myself hoping Adam stays sad because he is the true definition of a tortured artist. It's so obvious that he was completely heartbroken when writing these songs. I'm a fan for life. If you have any doubts, listen to the songs while reading the liner notes. It's amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best of 2002","review":"While I didn't like this CD quite as much as their previous, slightly mellower release \\"This Desert Life\\", this is still a great CD. The album's title track is one of the catchiest songs of 2002, and the Ryan Adams collaboration \\"Butterfly in Reverse\\" is lyrically beautiful and musically elegant."},{"rating":"1","title":"what were they thinking?","review":"I truly believe that every song on August and Everything After is a masterpiece. It should be in everyone's top 10 albums of all time. But Hard Candy? Blink and you miss it - the songs are nothing to ooh and aah over. They're okay.. but okay doesn't cut it when you're the Counting Crows and you used to write lyrics like \\"there's things I remember and things I forget , I miss you I guess that I should.. Three thousand five hundred miles away...but what would you change if you could?\\".... I guess I just expected more. If you're looking for another August, go listen to Pedro the Lion's 'It's hard to find a friend'.... Hard Candy won't do a damn thing for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Candy","review":"I only bought this CD for one song which was Yellow Taxi and it was not the version I was expecting that was displayed as being on this CD before I purchased it. I am not at all happy about this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam Duritz","review":"If you like Duritz, check him out on the I-10 Chronicles album, where he pays tribute to Warren Zevon who wrote \\"Carmelita\\". Nobody does \\"Carmelita\\" better than Duritz, not even Linda Ronstad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Terrible","review":"People should be ashamed for endorsing this album. This album is a commercial sellout. Unfortunately, this album will sell based on reputation and not quality. The lyrics (just look at American Girls) contain no thought and musically it lacks the direction of August and Everything After. Why is it so hard for some people to admit that their favorite band did not live up to the quality of a previous album? How could they even think about releasing American Girls as a single? Adam probably is only concerned about getting puddentang by playing up to American Girls, instead of writing quality songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the wait","review":"I liked their previous work and read the reviews. It is bland and unimaginative. Why bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"i've tried but this is too slow","review":"I borrowed this album of a friend and listend to it about 6 times in an attempt to try and like this album but nothing excited me, it was slow, timid and unadventerous.

The collaborations are intricate, yet effective. They are not overpowering in any regard. The slight antithetical nature of music and lyric, found in \\"Hard Candy\\" and \\"American Girls\\" especially, is genius. The upbeat tones do not nearly imply that the songs are, in fact, about sobering and, ultimately, sad topics. Although I do not place this in the same esteem as \\"Recovering the Satellites\\" or \\"August\\" for that matter, I still commend the band on a fantastic musical body of work. I will forever be a fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed and nobody to call","review":"I ordered this product and received a different manufacture's edge banding ( band it is the company whose product I received not Freud).

This not something that we talk about in ever day society. In fact, about 8 out of 10 people will have attachments, this book is great for understanding that.

Guns N' Roses is truly set apart from the crowd by Slash, thier lead guitarist. He is my favorite musician, and in this album he writes some of his best music. The Garden, Double Talkin' Jive, Don't Damn Me all contain some of my favorite solos. The song that really stands out for Slash though is November Rain, GN'R's sweeping rock ballad that features three solos. The last solo is far and away the best musicianship I have ever heard.

While still having killer, straight-ahead rock n' roll, this album (as well as Use Your Illusion II) brought them into a much greater realm of musical possibility. Although Use Your Illusion I is slightly better then II, both albums show the band was more diverse and exposed their many different styles. This is because, in part, Guns N' Roses (unlike most other bands) were never content to put out another album that was like something they already did. After the success of Appetite for Destruction, most bands would set out to make another one just like it. Instead, Guns N' Roses was more concerned with growing and expanding their horizons.

These guys are in a league of their own when it comes to song writing and composing. Axl's voice is one of the best ever, no doubt about it. Slash is one of the best guitar players of all time.

You could combine these two disks into 12 songs and have a pretty decent follow up to Appetite albeit half the songs would be remakes. The rest of the songs some of which they had the gall to release and make videos for (remember when MTV showed videos) should have been eliminated. Didn't they ever hear of editing? Of course it's been 8 years and they haven't done anything since, so I suppose they had to go for quantity when they could. Coma, Nov.

Their are not too many duds. I would say this album, much more than part 2, hits the creative nail on the head for this band. Axl's provocative lyrics, Slash's bluesy metal guitar riffs, & the drumming of newly recruited Matt Sorum, formerly of the Cult, Along with Duff's laid back bass thumping combine to create a unique sound for a unique band on this one. The only unfortunate part is that you can almost feel the ripples of discontent that eventually caused the dissolution of this once revered unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both would have been better as one","review":"Both Use Your Illusion CD's contain some great songs and a lot of filler.

They were called Use Your Illusion. This album, UYI1, is not as ear-blasting rock n roll as Appetite. It is actually quite bluesy. There is nothing wrong with that, but I think on some songs, they take the blues influence too far. many of the songs are absolutely fabulous, like Right Next Door To Hell, Dust N Bones, and Garden of Eden, but some are weak and filler like You Ain't The First and Don't Cry. Although the latter was a huge Top 40 smash, I still don't like it. It sounds lame. anyway i thought this is a cool album and any hard rock fan should get it. For fans of heavier stuff, go get Appetite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic Fail!","review":"How did GnR fall so far in only one album.

While this CD certainly has hard rock songs, it is not a hard rock albulm. This is more ofa hard rock-blues rock fusion. Use Your Illusions I was the first part of the Use Your Illusions multi CD debut. It was the first time an artist debuted two cds in Number 1(Illusions I) and Number 2(Illusions II) on the Billboard charts. That being said, there are some great songs on this cd. While nothing rocks quite as hard as Welcome to the Jungle off the Apetite cd, November Rain easily matches and then surpasses rock ballad Sweet Child o Mine. Also COma easily trumps Paradise City as far as \\"off the wall track\\" and when you throw in Dust and Bones and Dead Horse, you have a great albulm.

To me, this is a marvelous idea.I've noticed below that some of the criticisms of this book center around the fact that there wasn't enough room to fit in the story, the romance, and all of the details on werewolf daily life that readers would like to know.

Usually honest, often brutally so, Vonnegut works this book into a crecendo of cheesiness.

By masterfully portraying the abyss between the \\"dirt-poor\\" and \\"filthy rich\\", wittily arguing that the latter are far more useless than the former, Vonnegut only casually mentions the fairly well-washed millions in between; the ground on which the demarcation lines are blurred, and his personal rules of humanism are frequently set aside in favor of garden-variety street smarts. Vonnegut's trademark quirky characters, vivid style, and tight, beautifully wrapped up plot are, as always, very useful weapons in his emotional blackmail: if you don't see the world on his terms, if you take neither side, be ashamed of yourself! Be very ashamed of yourself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing ventured, nothing gained","review":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a perfect example of a canned story. Nothing about this book could be considered excellent, nor original. The alleged wit of Vonnegut makes no appearance in this bit of tripe. The only somewhat redeeming facet of this book was the fact that everyone in it was useless: the Senator who obvioulsy bought his way into politics, the absent-minded heir to a fortune unearned even by his father, and the helpless souls of Rosewater, IN.

Not recommended for anyone except the rare person who thinks Vonnegut's good books are bad and wants to read a bad one for the sheer pleasure of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"eccentric, naive, and often rather dull","review":"After greatly enjoying some Vonnegut sci-fi, I was perhaps looking for the wrong thing with this book. It is a weird story about a nutty millionaire, who is in danger of losing his money to an assembly of the sleaziest twits you could possibly imagine. While there are many very funny asides, such as his love of Kilgore Troustian conceptions or the characterizations of the evil guys (one's posterior is \\"luminous when wet\\"), the plot is weak and far-fetched. For example, Rosewater's grandfather built his massive fortune by buying companies in accordance with their acronyms from the Bible's text! That is too silly to be satire. Moreover, Vonnegut's laments about the coldness and brutality of American capitalism are sentimental and even ignorant. He seems to have an obsession with rich people and money.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read!","review":"I've read a few books by Vonnegut and this one might be my favorite. This was a fast read, great satire, very funny. I loved the characters, especially the titular Mr. Rosewater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonnegut does something right","review":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a great read. It is funny, and something to go in between books of intellectual substance. Without requring much thought, Vonnegut entertains with a delightful smile. I can't get over the absurdity of Kilgore Trout and the Eccentricity of Mr. Rosewater. This book is short and sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"short and to the...well...not the point...but something","review":"vonnegut is addictivehis choice little phrases, and witty little quips, make well worth, reading a book which is not to par with his others.it is not that this is a bad book, for by no means is it.it is written in his typical manner, running little plot fragments back and forth, and casually waxing on about mild side threads...which i personally find to be one of my favourite things about his writing, the attention to details, however trivial they may seem.kilgore trout features into this book a little bit, and samples of his writings are present as wellfun fun stuffbut, read other vonnegut before taking this one on."},{"rating":"2","title":"God bless you, Eliot Rosewater.","review":"I almost never read books anymore, but today I started this novel on the bus when I was going to my family's house for Thanksgiving and I surprised myself and read the whole thing. I've been a fan of Kurt Vonnegut for a while and I've read a lot of his books and this is definitely one of his best works. It might not be as good as his three best-known works but it is still a 5 star book. It was never boring, I loved each of the characters, especially Eliot, and while it wasn't as funny as some of his others I still laughed a great deal. This is going down as one of my favorite Vonnegut books."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Vonnegut's most endearing characters comes to life","review":"Eliot Rosewater could be someone you know. Though caught up in a family struggle of money and power, Rosewater himself wants nothing more than to read the science fiction novels of Kilgore Trout and be a volunteer fireman. Here, Vonnegut uses his great skill of detailing characters to bring this tremendous, lovable character to life. In the background, of course, are the usual life-problems which bring a tinge of dark humor and a sometimes muddling subplot about Rosewater's money which surround him in his life. A gratifying, and greatly humorous experience"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh!","review":"Didn't care for this work very much. It went on and on and on in it's side comentaries and I got bored with it.

Glad I didn't spend any more money on it-pretty ridiculous, verbose reading. Hard to wade through-made it to the third chapter before giving up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not for a first Vonnegut read","review":"I just finished this book, and I absolutely loved it. This was the last Vonnegut novel I hadn't read, and it was definitely a great summary of themes and beliefs he expresses in his other novels.To that end, I wouldn't recommend it as a first Vonnegut read. It's almost an essay about his views on the madness of capitalism in America.It's a great novel, no doubt, with a very satisfying ending. But if you've heard about Kurt Vonnegut and you just want to try it out, try \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" \\"Hocus Pocus,\\" \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" or \\"Mother Night.\\"You really can't go wrong with this amazing author, but \\"God Bless You Mr. Rosewater\\" might come off as a bit preachy if you don't know what you're getting into.That being said, it is still a great novel. So if you're a fan, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vonnegut book","review":"I have only read a few Vonnegut books, and this is definately my favorite.

A great book and I reccomend it to all Vonnegut fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic...","review":"This book is truly a pearl. This work and \\"Slaughter House Five\\" are the two anchors of my Vonnegut collection. As I began to collect his books, I was like an avid junkie who couldn't wait to get her next wry-wit fix from Mr. Trout and company. I have gone through 2 copies of \\"God Bless you Mr. Rosewater\\" after being worn out from many re-readings but no matter how tattered & torn, I still have them -- tape, notes in the margins and all! My collection, all in paperback, is one of my prized posessions that I hope to share with my child as my mother had done for me. You will enjoy this work and if it is your first experience with Vonnegut, what a treasure you have found!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To call this a DEEP read is an understatement.","review":"Mr. Vonnegut has put forth a great piece of literature that binds together the worlds of poverty and gross wealth in a study on what makes human beings worthwhile or worthless and the make up of the architect of man.This novel is a collage of introspection and lessons. Using religious allegory, Vonnegut shows that human beings are only human-- whether poor or rich. His god figurine, when all sculpted by the end of the book, shows the reader a view on the creator of man: entropic on the surface, yet acutely set in his ways of good, even after the denouncment of him by his people. Take this view however you wish.Vonnegut's god is all of us: rich, poor, filthy, crazy... the list goes on. And Vonnegut raises the strange question: Was God crazy for producing mankind?This novel is thought provoking, entertaining, and enlightening. Take my view however you wish."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read for the Gifted Student of Bugei","review":"This is an excellent supplement to any and all of Lowry-san's writings on his experience in the martial arts.

Im a big fan, but come on, this movie bites...no pun intended"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time has clearly passed","review":"When I was a young kid, I was creeped out by Dark Shadows. In hindsight, it had more to do with forbidden subject matter to a young child and the occasional flashing of fangs rather than the quality of the show. I remember seeing this film version of the show and enjoyed it because there were more fangs, blood, action and suspense. More monster movie and less daytime soap opera. That was then, this is now.Viewing this film 40 something years later, this stuff has not held up at all. Barnabas Collins is hardly a threatening character (Van Helsing/Buffy/Blade would have iced this wimpy vampire immediately), the acting is so corny and the story is preposterous.Universal and Hammer studios monsters are timelessly endearing but this is just a curious and nostalgic relic from the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I hated this movie and I'm surprised at the good reviews. It was just dark and sinister and killing off most of the Collins clan was a big mistake. It did not show the \\"real\\" Barnabas we had come to love. The 1991 series revival that Dan Curtis produced was much better at showing the angry sinister Barnabas who was also tortured, lonely and still wanted family and love. The movie just seems to reflect the mood of Curtis and the writers in the last year of the series - It's almost over so lets get rid of everybody and move on.

The storylines began reating themselves, Parallel Time, diff characters but essentialy the same storyline. I sincerly believe Dan Curtis was losing interest int he series as well. Again, these are only my opinions. But, the real deathnell was the release of HODS itself, while hugely successsful, parents got to see what they're children were watching, and as we (as fans) know, the series was in no way as violent & bloody as the movie. Albeit, I enjoyed HODS. Can't wait for the DVD. But, no bonus features, interviews, etc. Seems Warner Bros. is rushing the DVD into production just as the Tim Burton reboot will be coming out on DVD. I read it is due around the same time as the original films. A hope a sequel is in the works. Maybe Quentin, 1795, 1987 storylines, just saying!!! Thanks for all of the memories Dan! Rest in peace.

I'd be curious to learn the history behind it. It has the look, feel, and polish of a student film. Scenes start and stop abruptly. Music cues come to an abrupt end as if there wasn't time in post production to do a proper transitional fade. Audio is sometimes out of synch -- again as if not enough time in post production. There's very little coverage -- many scenes are shot with only one camera set-up. Apparently it was shot on 35mm but looks to be 16mm.The lowest budget Hammer horror film is ten times more slick and professional than this movie.It almost seems like a two-part TV episode with a little more blood than usual? If you were to place it in that category, it's a worthy endeavor. But otherwise the production values (aside from the interesting location work) are student film level quality.On the other hand, the DVD transfer is top notch... for whatever that's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Released In Digital Format","review":"Being an avid Dark Shadows fan, I have been waiting for years for this movie to be released in something other than VHS tape.

The songs released were pretty good but after all these years, this album is dated and annoying now.

I bought this CD apon hearing Dont Speak (the only song I like besides Tragic Kingdom). Spider Webs was stupid garbage (leave a message and Ill call you back? What the hell is that?)Dont buy this CD. Its terrible.Its a untalented lyrical nightmare."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of No Doubt's best albums","review":"This album made NxD famous. It made Gwen Stefani into a star.The first four tracks on the album set the scene. The whole album is represented by those tracks.The rest of the album is amazing, but some of the songs go over your head. But that just gives this album more replay value.I hope NxD release their new album soon. Till then fans, myself included, have \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" and the acclaimed \\"Rock Steady\\" to tide them over.Favorite tracks: \\"Spiderwebs,\\" \\"Excuse Me Mr.\\" \\"Just a Girl,\\" \\"Happy Now?\\" \\"Sunday Morning,\\" \\"Don't Speak\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"This is one of my favourite albums of all time. The themes are consistent through-out the entire album, and references to DisneyLand are hidden through out. This is one of those cds you should have on a top 200 basis, especially if you love 90's music. The singles on this album are superb, but even the non-single tracks are awesome. The title track is epic. Also good are Happy Now, End it On This and World Go Round. Classic Ska, Classic 90's, and just good stuff all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry, I'm Not Home, I'm Walking in the Spiderwebs...","review":"I absolutely LOVED Tragic Kingdom. It has the edge that makes no Doubt what it is, My favorite tracks are:SpiderwebsDon't SpeakJust a GirlIf you have not already bought this CD, I suggest you go out and get it. Along with many other No Doubt fans, I am anticipating Rock Steady. Gwen's vocals are amazing!!!!!!! Just a Girl is my anthem! I can relate to it a lot. Remember: ROCK STEADY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An average albumn","review":"I love No Doubt. I am a faithful fan. But this cd did not thrill me. Some songs are great, i.e. \\"Don't Speak\\", \\"Spiderwebs\\", and \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" but after the first few songs you get bored,(well, at least I do). All the songs sound the same to me. I mean, it's a great buy, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. but it's kind of...repetative."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those things you either love or hate","review":"Although Gwen Stefani seems to be a bit of a prima donna, she has a great voice and the band has a totally unique style that no current artists can obtain. However, I can understand why some people don't like Tragic Kingdom; it's just the type of music that some people adore and others can't stand. I personally adore it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW BUY IT NOW!!!!!!","review":"Ha ha ha...that got your attention didn't it? Well if you are a sucker for attention buy this album. Catchy lyrics, amazing guitar playing wow. This band has it all....gotta buy it...NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great party music","review":"it's wonderful to finally see a woman who is singing about what it's like to be a female in the 90's. Gwen is beautiful and talented, and singing about the things that bother her in todays soceity, without selling sex. If your into up beat music and just want to have fun the you should really pick up this cd. It's a real good time. I love it and i thing you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"this CD is sooo OLD!!!!!","review":"Look, this CD had gotten old, i admit a couple songs were good when they first came out, but now i hear it on the radio and i CRINGE!!!!!! if you want you can buy this CD, but after a month, you will be sick of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's No Doubt about it...this rocks!","review":"No Doubt's \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" was an awesome example of the group's incredible talent. Gwen Stefani's powerful and unique voice is such a cool asset to the group. This CD is in my CD player over 50% of the time. There is such a variety of songs. I listen to the same CD whether I'm sad, angry, in a great mood, or tired and need to chill out. And I get great results each time. When I first bought \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" I felt like a dork cuz it's a fairly old CD. But trust me, if you don't already own \\"TK\\", you need to buy it because you're missing out big time. Give it a while, though. You might need to play the CD the whole way through before the songs really grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Album-but not Great","review":"I think the structure really saves the album. They start with Spiderwebs, a great song and extremely catchy. This energy carries through past Happy Now, which is wonderfully biting, but then the album sags in content. Of course, right when you could give up, Sixteen saves the day, pulling you back into the great sound of the beginning. Climaxing with Don't Speak, it drops off. End of This pulls you back with the same pain as Happy Now. And the last song, Tragic Kingdom, is strange in the extreme. I suggest a few forced listenings. Once you accept the style it's a satsfying end to this overall good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubt About It This Is No Doubt's Best","review":"This cd was the essence of the ska/punk genre, this cd definateley represents the best of the ska/punk mix as well. Then to top it all off Tragic Kingdom is No Doubt's best release out of all of their albums. From songs such as Don't Speak and Spiderwebs, Gwen shows off her amazingly strong voice, and does it very well. From the punk riffs, to the bright ska sound from the horn players No Doubt made a huge impression on the world of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Doubt Rules!","review":"I have been an avid No Doubt fan since 1995 and even though Tragic Kingdom isn't their first cd, it got them the most recognition. Full of ska and since I currently redside 'unfortunatly' in Orange County where they happen to be from, I have much interest in the SoCal ska and neo-punk that comes out of here. I love this album and give it five stars for its unconventional lyrics and wonderful drum and bass solos'. Gwen Stefani has some of the best hair I have ever seen and had a unique and thouroughly enjoyable, quirky voice. I recommend this cd to anyone who is looking for fast-tempo, upbeat, ska that is always going to cheer anyone up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduced the MTV generation to the sounds of ska","review":"Before this CD came out ska music was mostly isolated in its popularity to California, and had a small following in other places. Then along came No Doubt and kaboom, ska was launched into the public eye finally getting the recognition it deserved throughout the United States. Most modern ska bands can thank No Doubt for a good portion of their following because their fans probably owned the epic \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"NoDoubt ;-)","review":"This is a fabulous CD! Full of energy, every song is diffrent! I never get tired of hearing it. It's original, and no one else can mimic Gwen's voice or the band's sound. There is no one else who makes music like No Doubt, I would recommend this CD to anyone who respects music!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"The only songs I like are Just A Girl, Spiderwebs, Don't Speak, and The Climb. That's all. She has the worst voice in the whole universe. I don't know anybody who likes this c-d. At least it has the lyrics! So I would borrow this c-d from a friend first before you buy it! In my oponion, this is the worst c-d I will ever own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This cd is good at first but after a while it starts getting extremely boring. I dont recommend this cd. If you want to listen to a female vocalist garbage is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD CD","review":"THIS CD IS GREAT MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE \\"HEY YOU\\" AND \\"DONT SPEAK\\" IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS CD YOU SHOULD GET IT GWEN STEFANI IS JUST GREAT IN THIS CD THE GUYS FROM NO DOUBT ARE GREAT MUSICIANS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very lame.","review":"Hey Buddy, Want to know why this disc is forgotten? Because it is HORRIBLE. These guys are awful. Whenever I hear spiderwebs, (which is not very often anymore, Thank heaven) Makes me want to smash my head against the wall. It's just noise. Those Idiots need some lessons on how to play instruments. And Gwen Stefani.... Oh boy, Don't get me started. Her Voice makes me Scream out loud while my ears bleed. AAHHHHHHHH!!! She's a Madonna Wanna-be. and that is definately not a good thing. She really loads up on the Makeup. She better not go into the Sunlight, She would melt. So in closing, THIS BAND IS LAME. Do not buy this. You will regret it for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THIS CD SUCKS !","review":"I would have given it less than one star if I could. If you like really irritating whiny voices this is the album to buy otherwise you would have to be an idiot to buy it. There is not anything good about this album. It is horrible. The music has a fast beat in many of the songs. The lyrics are dumb. All of the songs serve no purpose. What good are they?"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT! It is the best!","review":"I love the band No doubt, when I first heard them I taught that they would be on the radio forever. Sadly though they took it off. So I got the cd from my cousin and I listened to it on my trip the took three months. Tradgic Kingdom was the ONLY cd I would listen to. Strangly though I've never gotten tired of it, and it seems to always put me in a good mood. Everyone should have this cd it is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a classic!","review":"This album is masterpiece. I still have my original copy from 1995 when it came out and it still makes me ooze with excitement. Out of the many rock albums of the 1990's, this one will go down as being in the top 100 albums of all time. It is a classic! I love all of the songs on here. \\"Spiderwebs\\" always makes me feel energetic and youthful. And of course, \\"Don't Speak\\" leaves me in awe; it is a timeless song and I think it's one of the best rock ballads IN HISTORY! Anyway, BUY THIS ALBUM! It should be in everyone's cd collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed the face of music","review":"Up until \\"Tragic Kingdom\\", Ska/Pop type music was unheard of in the mainstream. After the release of the song \\"Just a Girl\\", all of that changed. It opened the floodgates for a wide variety of bands with horns.Back around 1995, when this album was released was when I actually liked Gwen Stefani. Her voice was excellent (has gone downhill since), and she just had an attractive energy about her. She was the single reason why No Doubt surfaced on the scene.This album, Tragic Kingdom, was a masterpiece. I can listen all the way through, without skipping a song. Standout songs are, \\"Just a Girl\\", \\"Spiderwebs\\", \\"Sunday Morning\\", \\"Don't Speak\\", \\"Happy Now\\", and \\"Different People\\".A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic Kingdom","review":"There isn't one song on this CD that I can't identify with all the time. I absolutely L-O-V-E this CD. It made me a No Doubt fan for the rest of my life, not to mention lead me to purchase thier others as well.The beats on these songs are mezmerising, the vocals - outstanding. I love the singles released, but the other tracks are just as good, if not better. If you don't own this, you should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"No Doubt's best cd. All before they compromised their sound for record sales. That is in the past though and this is one of the best cds of the 90's. A good buy if you're into the ska/punk sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst album ever","review":"this is the worst recording possible.\\"NO DOUBT SOLD OUT\\" with their crapy single \\"dont speak\\",thats what gwen should of done.the only good no doubt song in the world is \\"total hate\\"...because bradly nowel of sublime is in it...so everyone go out and buy some real music"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Doubt ...","review":"This CD is pure pop w/a bit of Ska mixed in. The ska is what saves it from being horrible. I do like Excuse Me Mr, has a more punk feel and Don't Speak is a terrific little love ditty. Have you seen this band live? Ugh. I had to leave their Halloween 96 show because of Gwenny's screeching. Maybe she's taken voice lessons, but that show was horrid. Luckily Face to Face made it worthwhile. She was hot when she had some chub, but now she's not so hot w/this ... glam look. I will never purchase another No Doubt CD and this one's going to eBay. If only they kept to their more-ska roots instead of where they are now as rulers of the POP world in cutesie punk/ska/rockabilly clothes. They remind me of the term sell-out."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 Stars","review":"This CD isn't so great... the only really good song is \\"Don't Speak\\"... it's a shame, I was hoping for more songs like it, but they are all \\"strange\\". I should have known better than to get a CD with rotted peaches on the cover! Oh well... at least it DOES have that one song on it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid for NEW...got USED","review":"The CD that arrived was clearly used. There was no security strip present on the top of the CD, the shrink wrap was loose and did not look original, the inside cover booklet had a bent corner and cracks/creases down the binding (like it had been opened many times). If I ordered a used CD this would be fine but I ordered a NEW CD.Luckily, Amazon refunded my purchase immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I lived in Fullerton, I never saw them, they're all liars","review":"When the truth comes out, we'll probably hear that this Gwin Stiff-on-me chick is really a lipsynching hooker from British Columbia. One star for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly for children","review":"No Doubt combines the pouty vocals of bleached-blond, obsessive poser Gwen Stephani and her three garage-band-quality sidemen. The music is pop-based pablum. The lyrics too, are utterly juvenile. They either deal with the priorities of a spoiled 13-year-old schoolgirl or refer to poor Gwen's busted affair with Tony what's-his-name (No Doubt's Indian bass player). This is music for the pre-pubescent crowd, many of whom are fanatical fans of Gwen, the make-up queen. If you're an adult and are looking for something with a semblance of sophistication, move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sellouts","review":"No Doubt are the biggest sellouts I've ever seen.

WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE A NEW CD. SO I BROUGHT THIS NOT LOOKING AT THE SONG TITLES AND GOT HOME TO FIND OUT IT WAS THE SAME MATERIAL FROM THE LIVE SETS DONE IN ATLANTA AND MOBILE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. IF IT WAS TO BE A REPEAT OF THE SAME MUSIC ALREADY OUT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN STATED SO. SAVE YOUR MONEY..IT IS NOT EVEN THE BEST SONGS OFF THE LAST CD'S."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits like a Glove","review":"I ordered the sunshade to replace a ten year old generic shade that was falling apart. I was happy with the generic model, but this shade fits so well and works so much better I am sorry I waited 10 years to get it.

I think Rocket Queen is the best song they have written. Axl can't sing. The drummer blows. Slash can't make it out of the box and his tone sucks. The bass player failed at guitar and continued his tradition on the bigger guitar with two less strings to screw up. I saw them live and had to bail."},{"rating":"1","title":"guns and stinks","review":"Did you know these guys copied the main guitar riff from the Black Sabbath song \\"Zero the Hero\\" and used it for \\"Paradise City?\\" Don't believe me? Just buy Sabbath's Born Again album and read the inside notes. All the information you need to know is mentioned right there in the notes. The other two hits by Guns N' Roses are just overplayed, unmemorable rock songs that seriously copied what Aerosmith was doing back in the mid 70's with the dirty, speedy rock sound. I don't sense a hint of originality anywhere. I don't sense any good music anywhere on the Appetite for Destruction album either. So why is it so popular? It's not a classic by any stretch of the imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"they suck","review":"wow how could they ever become popular. Oh i know why it is because of slash. now i must admit he is a great guitar player but i just dont get axl rose wath a bum. his voice is almost worse that the blink 182 singer (almost). But seriosly has any body been listening to the same album i am i mean if it is i dont know what youre problem. I know the problem is that half of the people who reviewd this album havent even heard them. they just want to be cool so they go get the t-shirts from myrvens and pretend to like them so they can fit id. The other half are deaf, or have never heard real talent. over all dont get this album if you dont like a screechy voice that breaks glass blasted in your ear dont get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute tripe...","review":"guns and roses what can i say except for the fact i hate them with a passion any questions about this non talented band....."},{"rating":"1","title":"GUNS AND POSERS","review":"one of the biggest flash in the pan bands ever, i hate this band, i don't understand why they are so god damd famouse for being posers. axle is the (...)singer in existance, he should (...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"its been said perfectly before...","review":"Squash 'n squeek a couple of guys behind me has said it the best, this album is the most overrated of all time. I think that the reason that it is popular is because Guns 'N Roses made a genre like Metal more tangible in the public eye, when there where many more talented metal artists out at the time, before, as well as after. I do not think that they have enough talent as musicians to be considered so great. They made songs with some good aspects that I feel are way overclouded with the bad ones (and there are a lot!). They are just drug addicts with no substance to theie musc, and they have maybe one or two decent songs. I'm sorry but this gets a one star review in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"Guns and Roses would be a good band if Axl Rose's singing didn't sound like a MOSQUITO buzzing in my ear at loud volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"THE BEST DEBUT ALBUM OF ALL TIME\\"?","review":"Reality check.The Velvet Underground's first album was released in 1967 - This album inspired everyone from David Bowie to the Clash to start playing music, and has proven to be much more influential than Appetite For Destruction.And if you think Appetite for Destruction is the best debut album of the last 20 years...Reality check.Pearl Jam's 'Ten' was released in 1991 - Is almost every band on the radio trying to sound like Pearl Jam? (creed; nickelback; default, etc..) or Guns N Roses? Exactly...Best debut album of all time? Not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the 80s and hair bands are not cool","review":"Let me tell you something. This band was never \\"cool\\", and just because they were a bit famous back in \\"their day\\" doesn't mean they are good. Just because they got a couple of videos on MTV doesn't mean they are worth jack now. Times change, and now MTV only plays GOOD rock music and these losers are nowhere to be seen. I've never listened to this album but I can tell it sucks just from looking at pictures of the band. None of the rockers on TRL or the mall look like these guys so that means they must be bad. If you don't look cool then you can't produce good music. That's why Beethoven sucks. Thank god Nirvana saved music in the 90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unoriginal, stinks to high heavens","review":"I got this album due to its repuation as being the greatest metal album of all-time, yada yada, but I was sorely disapointed. This CD stinks. It is plain to anyone with ears that Guns N' Roses is just a huge rip-off of Creed. \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" is a third rate \\"What if.\\" \\"Sweet Child 'O Mine\\" is a poor man's \\"With Arms Wide Open.\\" And the list goes on and on. That hack Axl Rose is such a Scott Strapp wannabe it's not even funny. All of Slash's solos are straight out of Mark Tremonti's songbook.

Welcome to the Jungle and Out Ta Get Me are rock at it's purest. Paradise City demonstrates some catchy lyrics and a great tune. Sweet Child O' Mine, their first hit, seems a little softer and is clean lyrically and yet still great rock and roll especially with the guitar solo towards the end. VH1 named GNR #9 on the best hard rock bands of all time on a recent show and although Use Your Illusion I and II both show more versatility, they have too much filler, and this is the best overall album. Definately a good buy, every rock fan should have this in their CD collection. Top Songs: Paradise City, Sweet Child O' Mine, Welcome to the Jungle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the unedited album.","review":"Appetite for Destruction is arguably the best debut album of all time. The \\"censored\\" version is not very good. Most of the material is very poorly censored and although I respect the idea of censoring the music, I don't support it - because frankly kids should not be listening to Guns N' Roses, and if adults have a problem with mild language (and it is quite mild here) they just shouldn't be listening to Gn'R! Sometimes profanity filters are good (such as the one I purchased for my television for family viewing) - but editing a hard rock CD isn't a good idea since the content to begin with is pretty hardcore. I mean, the very idea of censoring \\"naughty words\\" from ROCKET QUEEN is hilarious - forget about the recorded female orgasm that plays midway through, just make sure they don't say any bad words!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Album of all Time","review":"In my opinion, this is the greatest album of all time. I first brought this album as an 8 year old back in '88 and it still rates as my favourite album. No filler tracks on here. The album opens with the famous 'Welcome to the Jungle' and ends with the awesome 'Rocket Queen'. There is not one bad song on this album, Still the only album to this day which i can play from start to finish. Hopefully axl and slash can reconcile their differences because they complement each other. A must have in any CD collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Starving for Anarchy","review":"This CD is it!

From the first time I listened to it, I loved it's style. It was rocking that didn't give a F**K. While axl Rose was a nut case, he was a good writer and had great voice rang. Slash is my favorite guitarist of all time. Izzy was an even better writer than axl. Duff was a nimble bass guitarist that turned out to be a pretty good song writer too (i.e. so fine on use your illusion II). The drumming was all right too, with both steve adler and matt sorum. This CD is the best CD I own, from my favorite band."},{"rating":"2","title":"EASILY ONE OF THE TEN BEST ROCK RECORDS OF ALL TIME","review":"Unless you were born after 1980 you likely already know that this is one of the best rock records of all time!

Along the lines of appitite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Your Brains Part 2.......","review":"I agree with 'use yor brains part 1'(previus reviewer). There is nothing about this album that has an original thought tied to it. Very predictable record. Axl went to the same vocal coach that every other wanna be heavy metal singer went to in the 80's. The man simply can't sing. These guys spent to much time idolizing Keith Richards off stage persona and not enough time paying attention to his playing. All these 80's glam bands did this. They wanted to be rock stars before they learned how to play. It wasn't about music, it was about being famous. Only real talent has staying power. These guys barely got through a second album. They are now listed in the 'Where are they now?' category........the funny thing is though..........nobody is even asking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use your brains Part I","review":"C'mon, folks! This is just Hollywood stuff. Pretended rebels, pretended punks, fake clothes, lots of overdubs and ultra-kitsch videos on MTV.You can't be serious about this being one of the best things you've heard...Try harder, there's MUCH more to be enjoyed than this petty appetite.Axl's voice is disgusting and the bass/drums are SOOO predictible.It's a SIN to compare these guys with a band like Led Zeppelin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolish","review":"Never have understood the popularity behind this drug addict band.Seems to me that they were more about the image and Axl's temper tantrums then they were about the actual music. Most of these songs are played on FM rock radio to death, i'm pretty sick of hearing \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" for the 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 time. It's moron rock at it's worst, no other way to describe this horrendus group's music. People claim them to be the dangeorus \\"bad boys\\" that brought mean and nasty rock back in the hair-metal era. These people need to have head examinations, this is no different from Poison or Def Leppard, change the make up and spandex for bandanas and ripped jeans. Same processed commercial [...] wrapped up in a different package to be sold to the gullible masses.

About as hard as the spice girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, hairmetal is actually good","review":"In my opinion there are only two good\\\\great hairmetal bands and G N' R (Van Halen as well) is one of them. Appetite for Destruction was good enough to save metal long enough to have people love it for the next 5 years. Then Nirvana came into the mainstream. Back to the review, Slash is a great lead guitarist who has little flaws and Izzy has a great rhythem. Duff is a bassist of thickness, intensity and loudness with Axl's screaming vocals and raunchy (awesome) lyrics. Steve Adler was no Neil Pert but he was not bad either, I guess he made the songs more intense. Some songs however, have repetativeness and thats why this got 4 stars. If you are a Hairmetal fan then buy this along with UyI 1+2 and VH I+II. Even if you like punk and grunge, or even rap\\\\rock you should get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's The Big Deal?","review":"I agree.Slash is the best guitarist ever,but that's beyond the point.I,along with others,belive that this album is on a low level of lyricism and is full of hair metal ego.Sure,it was a groundbreaking metal album,but it only changed the face of the metal world,where as albums by such artists as Nirvana,Pearl Jam and Green Day helped form modern rock as we know it.Plus,the songs to some people sound the same,using riffs that are to similar to the last.Plus,all the songs are about the same thing:Women or their city.Belive me,women are awesome.But hearing some ugly dude talking about them...not so cool.And people call him the ultimate frontman,which just meant he was an egotistical jerk.So,instead of listening to a one hour and fifteen minute death sentence,go buy Nevermind or Dookie,or Ten(even though i dissed it,it's still better than this).Seriously,this should only be used in execution chambers to murders who have killed many people or anyone else who deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Understood Why?","review":"This is Guns'n'Roses best album according to most. I'd agree, but it still sucks. Guns'n'Roses are white trash; their music is so stupid. People argue that the 80's were a horrible time for rock. The truth is it was one of the best times for rock, the problem is the mainstream music blew. People were listening to Guns'n'Roses or The Motley Crue, instead of good music like Stiff Little Fingers, The Clash, Gun Club etc. Not into punk? There was still plenty, Jesus and Mary Chain, The Pixies etc. Yet people waste their time with bands like Guns'n'Roses."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 out of 12 tracks","review":"mr.brownstone is without question one of the BEST rock songs i have ever heard,hands down,welcome to the jungle and its so easy, are the other stand out tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album Amazon has mistitled...","review":"The album is fine. Most everyone has heard songs from this album, the only small thing is that if you put the songs into your MP3 player they will show up with the [explicit] which isn't bad since that way if you have kids you don't want hearing the bad words you can get the clean version but its just small thing, easily fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"I'm not a big fan of Gun's n'Roses but I like good music and this album is good. It had some [great]tunes. The musicians are great and the production is amazing. The Album is enjoyable and disturbing and Axl Rose charisma and lyrics are also a big part of it's brilliance. I recomend every rock fan to get this album ( if they already don't have it) because it is indeed a fantastic album which recieved 5 stars in Rolling Stone. One of the few heavy metal albums to get that. And Like happens to many acts after making a brilliant commercial and critical aclaimed debut they never followed it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing album!!","review":"I hadn't really heard much of G N'R's music before I got this CD. Just the major ones like Sweet Child and Nov. Rain, but I have to say this is one of the best albums I have ever heard. Axl Roses genius is apparent, although the question is raised; how on earth does he manage to sing that high? Maybe it's the tight trousers. If anyone has ever heard his normal speaking voice they will know exactly what I mean! Anyway, put that aside. Among the best songs on the album are \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and \\"My Michelle\\". DEFINTELY WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't have this one.....you got nothing.","review":"Appetite for destruction....need to say more? this album is to me the greatest ever,if you are a rock fan and don't have it...go get it! every single song is a hit guaranteed to blow your mind away and make you come back for more.

It's a great album, the first GNR album I listened to. After Led Zeppelin, I didn't think any band could rock as hard as they did. Well, Guns N' Roses came and took an important place in my musical likes. I really liked the evilish My Michelle, the nostalgic Sweet Child O' Mine, and the energetic Rocket Queen. There are great guitar solos and riffs, I mean, it's music at its best, Slash is an amazing guitarrist. Axl has a powerful interpretation in most of the lyrics (there are exceptions). This is one of those CDs that stay tattooed in your mind and you can't stop listening to it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"guns n roses brought back booze drugs and women and killed the corparate hair metal era so many bitching about the profanity, a band with a reputation like G\`n\`R shood give you an idea of wat wil be on this album and if you dont like it (in the words of axl rose) \\"you can suck me\\".

It is a legendary, pure rock album, and is generally considered not only their best, but also one of the greatest albums of all time.I have to say I do think it is slightly overrated, due partly to the odd vocals and some of the 1980ish lyrics. Still, in my opinion, most of the songs rate from good to classic. The three most famous tracks---\\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" \\"Paradise City,\\" and \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\"---are still on rock stations somewhat often even today, nearly two decades after their release.If you are a fan of Guns N' Roses or a fan of angry rock music, and you haven't heard this album before, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic \\"must have\\" album with songs that will never die.","review":"\\"Appetite For Destruction\\" is a great record that has stood and will stand the test of time. From hard (Welcome to the Jungle) to soft (Sweet Child O' Mine), this album has it all. It has the romantic hard rock that is so powerful and also the disgruntled release that is so needed at times. The thing I like most about this record is that there is a song for every and any kind of mood that you're in. Absolutely a \\"must have\\" for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest album ever, easily.","review":"My favorite hard rock album of them all. This is what music is all about. It was vital 12 years ago when it first came out, and it's still vital today. This album will live as long as rock and roll, and then some. No one expresses a wider range of emotion as powerfully as Axl can; Slash and Izzy are the best guitar duo of all time; and the three of them, combined with Duff, are four of the finest song writers to ever practice the art. And all in the same band! Do yourself a favor and *listen* to this album. It has the power to change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums Ever","review":"Plain and simple--this is one of the best rock albums (and debuts) of all time. The rock magazines touted GNR as stars before \\"Appetite\\" even hit the shelves, even though it took over a year after the album's release for that to become reality. When it did hit, GNR were bigger than anyone could have dreamed, but their incredible first album justified it.The sound was clearly Aerosmith-derived with a slightly punk edge, but it was extremely fresh, brilliantly written, and it seemed the future of rock was in front of us. Axl's aggression was the edge that they needed to put them over the top somehow. Almost every song is a highlight (only filler is arguably \\"Anything Goes\\") and I can't say enough about this wonderful breakthrough album. Sadly, they never came close to reaching this level of achievement again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THE ORIGANAL","review":"Ok this cd is still gnr but without all the words and riffs it's not nearly as good. Buy the origanal not this. It's much better and cheaper to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to love this!","review":"I have worn out two cassettes, and one vinyl copy of this album. That alone should tell you how much I love it. But even one who loves the album as much as I do should be able to admit to themselves that it's just not very good anymore. In it's initial release, sure, it had power and fury, but it all seems so cartoonish and limp.Take \\"Sweet Child O Mine\\", a very nice ballad. I had many a party with that as the soundtrack. Listening to it now, the melody is still appealing, but the lyrics are greeting card quality, like bad Paul McCartney. And Axl's singing does the group no favors, either. \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" has just become SO overplayed. . .I won't even watch the fifth Dirty HArry movie, which features it prominently.I love Guns and Roses but even I will admit that this album has become nothing but a snapshot of a bygone time. A true \\"great\\" work of art will still sound vital and fresh many years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest rock albums ever!","review":"Appetite for Destruction is probably one of the greatest rock albums ever to be produced. The album really can be listened to in it's entirety with really no filler songs. A couple of the songs such as Sweet Child O' Mine, Paradise City, and Welcome to Jungle would make it in the top rock songs of all time. Mr. Brownstone and Nighttrain are also voted perfect 10's in my opinion. Only a couple of songs would not be rated 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. Think about you and You're Crazy are the only songs that could be passed over but, they are still worth a listen. This album made Guns n' Roses rock stars back then and they will always be remembered for this album. This album was easily their best with other pretty good ones to follow. If you love rock music and do not have this one, buy it. You will probably agree with almost everyone else that this is a five star album. Anyone who voted it lower than that probably has a problem with Axl Rose and his odd ways!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD ever!!!!!","review":"This was the first album of the kick-ass band gnr.

His compositions really aren't that impressive or amazing. There are tons of guitarists out there that put out material far better than this, on a regular basis.Axl isn't that bad of a singer. He just uses the same tone for ever single lyric, and it gets old after a while.The band's ego is so big it's hard to get your hard around. I couldn't believe it myself the first few times I heard them. Also the album artwork is quite boring..I would recommend downloading \\"Paradise City\\" and \\"It's So Easy\\", but the rest are over played, and overrated.

Every song is absolutely wonderful. Anyone who does not like it must be sick. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I was sitting around with my husband a few weeks ago having a drink. A Guns 'n Roses song came on and we got into a discussion about which song from Appetite for Destruction was the best. I said, \\"I've lost my copy of Appetite at least three times; I should just go on Amazon and order another one.\\" So I did. For around $10, I had a new copy in my hand in less than a week. Speed of service, great. Quality, great. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Album Ever !","review":"Simply put this is the greatest album of all time by the the best band line up in history. There will never be anything close to this ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best record ever, this record will go on forever","review":"The first time i heard this was after school. actually i only saw the video for \\"welcome to the jungle\\". the video has to be the most powerful video\\\\song in ages. to this day i still get chills watching the video. right after a saw the video, i went straight to my local music store and bought appetite (Best 10 bucks i have ever spent). i listened to this nonstop. if you have not heard the record, just go out and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is easy to review.","review":"Just like many other albums (such as the Goo Goo Dolls' \\"Dizzy up the Girl\\" and Bush's \\"Sixteen Stone\\"), the hits on this album are excellent, Hall-of-fame type material, but all the other songs aren't that great. I would reccomend just burning a CD with Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, and Sweet Child O' Mine on it. Those are their three hits, and the only songs worth listening too. Unless you really think that you'll like it, don't bother spending your money on this CD based on the songs you hear on the radio. My Michelle is a decent song, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"best hair metal album","review":"Appetite for destruction is very good for what it is, which is hair metal, although it is not as good as Def Leppard's Hysteria and Pyromania. These guys learned alot from bands like Ratt and POison, and they are definitely better. This alubm is not their best, tho. Use You Illusion I & II are much better than Appetite because by that time they were better musicians are played a better variety of music. Guns n Roses best songs were written by other people (Live and Let Die, Knockin' on Heaven's Door). The best song they wrote was November Rain but that sounds like Elton John anyway.As far as hairmetal goes, these guys were one of the best, but buy Use You Illusion I and II and Spagetti Incident before buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Credit Where Credit Is Due!","review":"C'mon without Tracii Guns this album would have never been possible...\\"Sound never repeated\\" Get an L.A. Guns C.D. Moron! Why doesn't anyone wonder why Axl was never able to duplicate this success, and why he always relied on cover tunes? BECAUSE TRACII WASN'T THERE TO WRITE THE MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also why Axl is sitting on his rich fat butt and Tracii is still rockin' out with legends like Nikki Sixx! Because Axl was a no talent hack! Tracii Guns Rocks Axl was, is, and always will be a wannabe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appetite for scratchy-ness","review":"Whenever I hear a Guns n Roses song, I always wonder what Axl does to make his voice sound like that. That dude has that scratchy-est, grittiest, most annoying voice in the history of rock. He sounds like he has a sheet of sand paper caught in his throat. Axl has the kind of voice that totally ruins what could have been a perfectly good song if it were sung by somebody with a listenable voice. GNR has lots of songs (like Paradise City or Welcome to the Jungle for example) that start out great, but turn into total sh.it as soon as Axl opens his mouth. I would have liked this band for their instrumentation, but because the lead singer is a repulsive creep with an annoying voice, I can't stand their music at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please....it's a friggin' classic!","review":"Not that this album needs any customer reviews, but this is a rock'n'roll classic. One of the decades' best. And this \\"American Rebel\\" fella? Must be a fan of show tunes and window treatments. Go check out his (or her) other reviews: the Beatles' \\"Abbey Road,\\" Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" and Zeppelin III all received one star from this turkey - even referred to McCartney and Lennon as overrated songwriters - while 5 stars were given to Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears, and Cher. So if you like that crap, then you might agree with American Rebel's review of this classic debut from the Guns. Go buy the soundtrack to \\"Annie\\" instead. All others please disregard the review, and all others from American \\"Rebel\\" and keep rockin'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Ever","review":"This is no doubt, the greatest album of all time. A great mix of Slash's guitar and Axl's voice makes this essential to any true rock n' roll admirer. The album is GNR's best, and you can truly listen to it all the way through over and over again. Trust me, listen just once, and you'll be on the Nightrain never to return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Record Made In History, Period.","review":"This is the best record ever made in history by any rock band. They totally redefined the meaning of rock n roll. Anyone who considers themselves a rock fan (the old stuff 'cause Kid Rock? Korn? Slipknot? come on!) should buy this record. You should buy it even if you hate GNR so that you can see how good they were. You will sure be in for a surprise because everyone thinks they're too old (GNR is probably the most underrated band in South Texas, maybe the entire US.) They just knocked out mythical rock bands such as Van Halen and ACDC (I also like these, but GNR is the best!) with their combination of lightning fast riffs from Slash and Stradlin' and Axl's charismatic persona. From the intro of \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" to the final chord of \\"Rocket Queen\\", this album is the best ever made. Even though they are no more, they sure are better that Blink 182, Slipknot, (I could mention every \\"popular\\" band, but that would take forever.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Legendary Rock Album","review":"This is, along with Van Halen's first album, probably the best debut album of all-time. I recommend this 100%. But it's not just \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" \\"Sweet Child 'O Mine,\\" and \\"Paradise City\\" that make this a 15x platinum album. It's the supporting cast, such as \\"It's So Easy,\\" \\"Nightrain,\\" \\"Mr. Brownstone,\\" \\"My Michelle,\\" and \\"Rocket Queen.\\" I really can't pick out one bad song here; they're all hardcore, super-charged songs. This covers everything that a hardcore rock album needs: dancing with Mr. Brownstone, telling of a girl w/ a dad in porno and a mom that was a heroine-addict, etc. Lastly, I really stress the fact that Slash is the most underrated guitarist around. Take one listen to this album and you'll hear some nasty riffs and crazy noises coming from his ax. This is the ultimate album, no question!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't matter anymore (not a Linda Ronstadt reference)","review":"This album is so politically backward. It's very sexist -- GNR Lies is racist and homophobic at times. But \\"Appetite\\" rocks so hard it doesn't matter what they are talking about. They could personally make fun of my mother. I wouldn't care. Axl's throaty voice and Slash's fast as lightning riffs would still bring a smile to my face. I can't wait for GNR 2000 style!!! We want Axl."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's metal at it's best","review":"Slash can play. Izzy can play. Axl can sing. High. This album..well just buy it. Just for Sweet Child O' Mine. One more thing: any idea what the guy below this review is trying to say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a little correction","review":"Just a little correction to George's review. This album doesn't sell 5,000 copies a month......it sells 9,000 copies a week.Btw great album. You don't have to skip tracks. Perfect for a Rock N' Roll fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the all time greats","review":"Apetite for destruction is amongst the greatest rock albums to come out of the eighties.This fantastic album contains anthems like paradise city and sweet child of mine.hugely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% bonified legendary record!","review":"We have all heard the songs off this record that get played to death on the radio. These songs are so popular for a reason. Beyond those songs though the rest of the tracks are just as good. This album has no weak points and you just can't go wrong with this epic album. Records like those only come around once so often and if you enjoy music then you need to hear this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guns N' Roses is the best band in the world!!","review":"Appetite for Desruction is one of the best there is. Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child O' Mine, and Rocket Queen are the coolest. Axle Rose is so fine and talented. I love their music, especially the Use Your Illusions and Appetite for Destruction. Estranged and Don't Cry sound so cool and I love You Could Be Mine. I don't care what anyone says, they are the BEST there is and always will be!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY THE BOOKLET IS EDITED-NOT MUSIC!","review":"Just to clear up some confusion, the booklet is what is edited. The unedited version, has a cartoonish picture of a woman who has just been raped by some kind of robot monster thing. The music is not edited. Pointless idea really! Just thought this would help someone out there.....music gets 5 stars, whosever idea this was gets 0 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"please recommend me songs","review":"I'm looking for similiar songs in time, kind of music, samples: november rain,(gun'sn'roses) stairway to haven,( led zeppelin). total eclipse of the heart(bonnie tyler). if you know about that, please tell me, tanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate hard rock sound - awesome!","review":"This album portrays the classic GNR sound, all those screaming guitar riffs you remember from the late 80's. With songs like Sweet Child O' Mine, Paradise City and Welcome to the jungle, you simply cannot afford to miss out on this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited Version?","review":"It is sad that the \\"edited\\" version of this cd is still filthy, yes, they are great musicians and have great music; however, why does a band or anyone for that matter feel it is necessary to be profane--for the money? This is why I stopped litening to rock music for fifteen years, and started listening to jazz, (most jazz music does not have words and the musicians have great technical ability like many rock musicians). I will always love rock music, my roots are there; however, I will never accept profanity. Sorry, 5 stars for the music, and zero stars for the profanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie!","review":"This movie really touches your heart. I lost a friend in Iraq and so it gets to me each time I watch it. Kevin Bacon does such a fantastic job in this film. Will always be one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Chance with Kevin Bacon","review":"The is one of the most moving videos I have ever seen. We are a Marine Corps Family and it is so heartbreaking to go through this. It is the story of a young Marine who gets killed during a firefight with the enemy.Chance is brought to Dover AFB first.It is the step-step journey of the remains of Chance and how he is treated with great care and love.After Chance is bathed and carefully prepared for his viewing, he is then dressed in his dress blues, arranged in his coffin and loaded into the plane. This video is the story of a solemn journey and of the respect shown to him by passengers, motorcycle patriots and more.Chance is greatly loved and I was brought to tears many times.I think this is a \\"must see\\" video for everyone but especially by those who have never known our military.TEN stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"We had rented this DVD and loved it .. so we ordered it for our collection. It came in looking brand new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Chance","review":"Get a box of tissues ready before viewing. It is a true story of the return of one of our finest who sacrificed his life. The outtakes add greatly to the story, and you will want to view this more than once. No \\"fluff\\" in this story.Taking Chances"},{"rating":"2","title":"An uplifting film","review":"If you respect this country's finest traditions and values, you will cry for happy all the way through this film.I thought the film was outstanding in the way that it portrayed some of the military's traditions and the ordinary citizen's respect for a soldier who paid the ultimate price in service to this country.As usual, Amazon did a good job in getting the DVD to me quickly and in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Review","review":"Excellent film, but sad. But makes you feel good how our soldiers are treated with such respect in death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Dramatic Tension","review":"Even though I didn't care for this film, I should add that I fully respect those who have served in our armed forces and that I mean no disrespect to them or to their sacrifices. Having said that, this movie impressed me as a flat (but morbid and depressing) semi-documentary with little or no suspense or dramatic value. The cast and the scenery all seemed to emanate from a squeaky clean Norman Rockwell painting--multiracial, cross-generational, photogenic, super-respectful and solemn. Maybe if they had introduced some outside tension--such as romantic temptation or virulent anti-war protestors it would have made for a more compelling movie. On the other hand, I can readily see how the film as produced would appeal to Military families and those who have lost loved ones to combat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a movie that will stay with you long after its over. I cried at least 9x while watching. Kevin Bacon did an excellent job. Thank you HBO for making it. If you watch any movie this year, make sure its Takin Chance. (oh I watched it now 3x and yes I still get emotional)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly moving","review":"I've seen this movie 5 times and shed a tear every time I see it, & tonight I watched it w/ several other Police Officers. Now, we usually joke around throughout any movie BUT no one made a peep during the entire flick and, when it finished, every single man watching was crying - not an easy thing to do amongst a room of Police Officers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take time to think","review":"EVERY American should see this movie. If for no other reason so that it might cause all of us to stop and think about all of the service members that stand on the wall around this country and defiantly tell those that would do us harm \\"you will not come in here and f*** with us without paying a terrible price\\"I have ridden in too many escorts of fallen warriors and have seen first hand the unmitigated grief of their family members. I have seen the simple acts of respect and recognition given by hundreds of citizens along the escort routes similar to what is depicted in \\"Taking Chance\\" by those Kevin Bacon's character encounters. It never fails to affect me just as this movie will affect those who watch it.Remember: It is not the preacher that guarantees our freedom of religion, it is not the author that guarantees freedom of the press and speech it is the American Serviceman and the Veterans that served before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See","review":"This is a movie every American should see. Regardless of your views on war It is hard to argue against the humanity of our soldiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome True Story","review":"This is a fantastic story about compassion in the midst of the death of a marine. Kevin Bacon is absolutely great as he plays out the emotions and honor of taking Chance home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going home","review":"Chance Phelps was nineteen years old when he was killed in action in Iraq. This is the story of the Marine escort, Colonel Strobl (Kevin Bacon), who takes Chance home to be buried. We see the meticulous care and honor taken in transporting Chance's body from Dover AFB, Delaware to his home in rural Wyoming.Based on the actual trip report written by Col. Strobl, this movie is a lot like a documentary in its attention to detail and procedure, but it is deeply emotional, quietly observing the reaction of everyone who comes in contact with Chance's body along the trip as well as his friends, family, and comrades.It's a story that could have been told in five minutes, but it makes a powerful, sobering film and I was moved to tears several times. This movie is not about the politics of war, but the honor and dignity bestowed on a fallen Marine. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears in my eyes...","review":"I had heard about this movie several times from family and friends several times over the period of about 6 months because my son was killed in Afghanistan. However, I wasn't ready to view it until 9 months after he was killed. It was good for me to see how respectfully they treat these men from the time they are killed, until they are buried, and although it brought back all the images of my sons's funeral in my mind, it still touched my heart to know that his remains were treated so respectfully and gingerly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Chance, a heart touching saga","review":"Those of us who have lost a loved one who served in the US Marine Corps can only marvel at the respect given to a fallen warier as depicted in Taking Chance. The acting is superb the story line is complete. I am glad to own Taking Chance and can only think of Pvt Jeff as we watch the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You HBO","review":"To the director, producer, the actors and everyone who participated in bringing this true story to the screen, this soldier says THANK YOU. No politics, no anti-military messeage, just the simple truth about bringing a fallen marine home.I just watched this movie on the Armed Forces Network here in Baghdad, Iraq and was very moved while watching it. Very well done.Thank you so much PFC Chance Phelps, USMC. Your service has been truly honored by this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Chance","review":"Can't say enough good about this movie. It's a masterpiece. It's about a desk-jockey Marine officer returning the body of a fallen Marine (Iraq war) to his home for burial. The weight and import of the sacrifice carries the movie from beginning to end. It is incredibly sad and incredibly uplifting at the same time. Kevin Bacon's acting transcends Kevin Bacon the actor, so it doesn't matter whether you like him or not. The only way you wouldn't like this movie is if you are not equipped to handle the emotions it evokes (which is a good and legitimate reason), or because of ideological and/or political infirmities that keep you from relating to the military or the USA in a positive light. I would definitely suggest you watch this movie without distractions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Chance","review":"This is the best movie ever. Kevin Bacon gives the best acting of his career. Be sure to have a box of kleenex when you watch this movie. It will help you to understand what our military troops and their families go thru everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie","review":"As a Vietnam Veteran I have two words for this movie - totally outstanding.This is a must see movie. The acting is first class and every actor in the movie is perfectly cast.Kevin Bacon will never make a better movie than \\"Taking Chance\\".All the other reviews have said what I want to say - don't miss this.God Bless American, Australian and our allies fighting men and women and their families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cried all the way watching this movie","review":"Excellent.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it TEN STARS if I could . . .","review":"Taking Chance is awesome in the truest sense of the word.

As I watch the movie, I cried all the way to the end. I watch this movie with the feeling of pride, honor and sadness for the fallen.

Anyone who watches this has to be moved with the care deceased soldiers are returned to their loved ones. Thanks for shipping quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"taking chance","review":"Wonderful, really shows the respect that they have for our fallen. Not only the military but other people.I was really impressed with the way the military took the time with each fallen soldier getting him prepared for his final resting place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intensely moving","review":"This movie is a quietly intense story, occurring mostly inside LTC Strobl's head. The photography tells the story in a way far more moving than mere dialogue could. Nothing I could write will be good enough to describe the tenderness with which the mortuary crew cared for LCPL Phelps, the respect shown by the air and ground crews, the kindness shown to LTC Strobl, or the emotion ordinary folks showed. This is a movie all should see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply Moving Film","review":"This film is a tremendous testament to the sacrifices all military families have made, past and present, to preserve the value of freedom. It's incredibly stirring and emotionally charged. There is no doubt you'll be moved to tears many times throughout the movie, but it's so worth the experience and will make you take inventory. Kevin Bacon is perfect for this role, sensitive and completely believable. The most authentic film I've ever seen in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart touching","review":"The movie is a little slow but the story is heart touching. I've watched it twice now and each time I tear up; even my husband sheads a tear. I think this is something EVERY American should watch; so hopefully they can understand more of the sacrifice that our Troops make for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't take a chance when you select this film!","review":"Probably Kevin Bacon's finest role.

The movie makes me proud to be an American."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see","review":"This movie first came out on HBO, and it should have be on the big screen. Excellent movie and acting.

I would not recomend watching this with a friend. Knowing this is based on actual events and a trivia fact I read on imdb.com make this an especially moving story for all americans. The trivia fact stated the defense dept. banned virtually all media coverage of fallen vets return home since the 1991 Gulf War until April 2009. Then they offered the \\"Taking Chance Crew\\" a rarely viewed accurate account of the care that goes into the return of our fallen heros. I'm choking back a tear just writing this review. I pray that our men and women who paid the ultimate price for us are treated no less that the way it is depicted in this movie. It makes me proud and I feel honored to have this soldier's story shared with me. I do not think it is possible to make a more intimate film than this. A truly humbling experience.

Understated, subtle and authentic, Kevin Bacon is at his peak- but special Kudos to Director Ross Katz (Lost in Translation).

It is extremely poignant in showing how much respect the remains of the fallen are given as they make their way to their final resting places, accompanied by an equally respectful service member. I have watched it several times and it still brings tears to my eyes every single time. Kevin Bacon portrays Lt.

I teach ballroom dancing and have competed in the past, and I find the music largely uninteresting at best and annoying (ie, Susan's vocals could use some work and the tempo tends to wander at times) at worst.

However, the Esperanto equivalents given are not always the words in most common use for the given concept. Benson has a tendency to list a precise neologism while failing to mention the actual, everyday word for the concept (which may have a broader or less precise meaning than the rarely used word). E.g., for \\"to count\\" he lists \\"kompti\\", a word hardly ever used, and does not mention \\"kalkuli\\", the word routinely used for that action (though it also means \\"to calculate, do arithmetic\\", etc.). There are several similar errors that make me hesitate to trust Benson on any given word until I have checked what he tells me against other sources such as the Plena Vortaro or the Reta Vortaro. But, in combination with other sources, Benson can be very useful, especially in translating materials from English into Esperanto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I bought this to review the quality compared to much more expensive and name branded grids.

The steak knives on the other hand do not meet even those exceedingly low expectations.The steak knives are horrible and do not match the set. Rather than matching stainless handles they have cheap badly made black plastic handles (soft easily dented plastic -- vaguely reminds me of recycled tires) and the blades are flimsy.

Through several seasons now, the lock has proved its durability and the extra keys have been really handy. (Just don't rely on that keylight!) My only concern would be about the lock's performance in freezing wet weather. A few times, water snuck into the locking mechanism and froze into an annoying problem.

I reinserted the key several times, but it wouldn't turn, not halfway, not even a quarter of the way. I had an extra cable lock with me, and figured I could fix the lock when I got home. I tried oiling it, and reinserting each of my five keys several different ways, but the lock wouldn't budge. I contacted the company, and was told that I could get a replacement lock by sending in my key tag along with the five keys that accompanied the lock. I sent these in, along with a printed copy of the email I got from the company representative, about three weeks ago. I still haven't heard anything. I'm shopping around for a new lock now, as I'm tired of only relying on my cable locks.

After hearing her song \\"I'm Ready\\" on a Music Choice channel, I knew that I had to look her up more and read that her album was going to be released. Of course, it wasn't until recently that I started playing this again and I am amazed that this was one of the most overlooked albums I've ever heard, as well as singer. I also remember seeing her guest star on a few episodes of \\"One on One\\" back in 04 or 05, so I guess maybe she did have some notoriety to come out this. Then after this album, she just dropped from the face of the earth, unless she became more famous in her native country of France, but I don't know.Anyways, looking at some of the album, I forgot how much a gem this was. I thought that she would have gotten more notoriety when this came out. Not so much famous, but at least be known to a degree. Very underrated album. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good things come in small packages","review":"The first time I heard (and heard of) Cherie was when she appeared as the opening act at a 2004 Clay Aiken concert I attended. I was blown away by the power of her voice. I bought her CD within two days, and upon listening to the songs again, still wondered how such a big voice comes from such a petite girl. \\"I Believe in You\\" and \\"Get Ready\\" are catchy upbeat tunes, and \\"Rush\\" is dynamic, but Cherie's strongest performances by far are on the ballads. \\"Older Than My Years\\" will make you stop whatever you're doing just to sit and listen. \\"Your Love\\" and \\"Say You Love Me\\" are also stunning. I hope Cherie has some good management on her side, because with a voice like hers, it would be a shame for her not to have a long and successful career."},{"rating":"2","title":"The artist as the perfectionist","review":"This book does an excellent job of exploring the many contradictions of the life and career of an artist who was both his own biggest fan/promoter and his own harshest critic. The book presents the many talents (artist,etcher,interior designer to name a few) and his many flaws (vain, arrogant, bitter and self serving attitude) while still showing the human side of the artist . The illustrations are complete and a glorious showing of both his popular works as well as his less known pieces. The triad of this book, \\"Diabolical Designs\\" and \\"Beyond the Myth\\" reveal an artist who deserves much more critical and popular attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"wax warmer","review":"I like how small it is .

They said they would refund half the return shipping charges. Unfortunately, they never did.After several calls to 7 Gifts, they did refund my original purchase price (not including the shipping charges) but never refunded half the shipping charges.When I located the 2X4 white deck planter in their online catalog, they told me they didn't have this item in their line...they used a different vendor (even though it showed up in their catalog).All in all it was a bad purchase and I would never use this vendor again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEK DEKOR RECTANGULAR PLANTER 2X6X24\\"","review":"I ordered the rectangular pot but never received it because it was back ordered.

McNeill acknowledges his Eurocentrism in his retrospective introduction and provides an excellent critique of his own book: he underplays the significance of Chinese and other civilizations east of the Oxus.Regardless, McNeill expounds a sound theory that civilizations didn't evolve in isolation, but that the interplay of different cultures enabled their progress. McNeill weaves migrations, conquests, international trade, and technological innovations into a riveting story on how modern civilization rose from the fields of the fertile crescent. The book reads like an epic novel -- albeit with lots of footnotes -- in that it weaves over 5,000 years of history into a single story.This has been the most fascinating history book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...amazing California sun sounds...","review":"This album has to be the best ever by No Doubt. I bought Tragic Kingdom after hearing \\"Just A Girl\\" once on the radio but never looked at their older work. After I bought Return of Saturn I was a little disappointed and looked to The Beacon Street Collection for more of their ska/rock music. This album is truly a masterpiece, every song is so incredible, especially \\"Open the Gate\\" and \\"Snakes.\\" It just makes you love NxD and completely outshines any other ska music on my shelf. If you liked Tragic Kingdom or the songs \\"Bathwater\\" and \\"Staring Problem\\" on Return of Saturn, then you have to buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great underground collection","review":"This album shows the side of No Doubt that people usually don't see. Originally released as an independant compilation of songs that didn't make the final cut for \\"Tragic Kingdom\\", this is an underground gem. It kicks off with the fun \\"Open the Gate\\", a great ska song. Then, there's \\"Total Hate '95\\", an awesome blend of catchy songs and reggae/ska. \\"Snakes\\" is the kind of edge that isn't seen anywhere else of No Doubt. Then \\"Doghouse\\" ends this set, with great synthesizer/guitar/saxaphone parts, and an awesome song, plain and simple. The point of this review is that this is No Doubt's only good album because it's the only one not cluttered with pop. This independant release is raw ska/hard rock and worth any rock fan's money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vibing album","review":"Great cd!!It was released independantly by No Doubt and shows their artistic variety with songs that have substance. It's No Doubt at their finest with Gwen's easy going yet wide ranging vocals, Tom's creative guitar licks, Tony's incrediblly vast bass talent, and Adrian's cool, riffing drum beats. It has a little less power than Tragic Kingdom but the Beacon Street Collection should be a part of anyone's collection. Two thumnbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Wow...what a great album. Keep in mind, while reading this review, that i am a big No Doubt fan and am a little bit biased...so there ya go. This album is a really good way to define the way No Doubt evolved from their ska roots to define their distinct sound in Tragic Kingdom. Open the Gate is a great fast-paced opener. Total Hate '95 is great for it's mix of two differnt sounds of two different bands: No Doubt and Sublime. Stricken is a great live song...STRONG LYRICS! By the Way, That's Just Me, and Snakes are really great songs as well. Along with Squeal and Doghouse; the album's closer. Overall, The Beacon Street Collection is a fun and lively album that gives a punch of a plethora of different emotions"},{"rating":"2","title":"After going to their concert","review":"I bought this cd and listened to a couple songs at first, but it wasn't until I went to their concert and heard them play some of their old songs that I listened to it again.

It really shows what a talented band they are and what a cool voice Gwen Stefani has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter rubbish","review":"I myself did not buy this album. It was a birthday present from a mate. I don't know what gave 'mate' the idea I liked ska but never mind. I thought I would like this album as I put it on and heard Gwen Stefani and the rest of No Doubt beating out the first song. Sadly, none of the other tracks live up to 'Open The Gate'. 'Utter Hate '95' is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. This got so boring, but as there were only 10 tracks it was not much to worry about. I only gave this two stars because1) 'Open The Gate'2) It is No Doubt.

It has a great packing list, metric & temperature conversions, rainfall/temperature charts in various African cities and a southern hemisphere constellation map - all of which I use to gather separately before going on safari. Along with general travel information, it contains basic maps of the main safari countries and national reserves in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, DROC, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Bostwana, Namibia & South Africa.

Not only is it funny to see a grown main adjust to a new time, but adding all those children into the mix really added to the humor in the story. The only thing that really did not add up was how long it took for all of them to realize they were in another time. For the longest time, Magnus and his children thought ways were different becaue they were in a new land, not time. I thought that made them seem dumb. Other than that, it is sexy, warm, and funny.

My favorite part was Magnus' explanation for the word Whatever - that it was what one said when they realized they had lost the argument. I loved the slow revelation in how Magnus is not just some virile stud who impregnated a lot of women, but someone who is truly tender and romantic and believes in family above all else. Now that is a sexy Viking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Abyssmal","review":"One of the worst books that I have ever read, this novel is poorly written and contains some of the creepiest, though boring and unsexy, sex scenes that I have ever read.

Mr. Reeves shares his struggles with questionable teaching in the charismatic community in a way I found refreshing! He points out how a lot of what is being taught isn't found in the Bible but is based on experience and opinion. Much of what is being taught, especially in groups that adhere to the so called \\"Toronto Blessing\\" is actually heresy and Mr. Reeves' backs up what he's teaching with sound Scriptural teaching that sticks to what the Bible actually teaches and not what someone else may want it to say when it actually doesn't.I also found Kevin Reeves to be a man of godly humility and someone I can trust. He gives us freedom to doubt & question & helps us focus back on the truth of God's Word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read!","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who has seriously questioned the new-thing approach to church and to Christianity itself.

Nonetheless it was the originally recorded versions that were remodeled, not re-recorded versions.For this album, the songs were all re-recorded and select songs were remixed. Some of the re-recorded songs sound alright but nothing compares to the original recordings that I grew up with. It would be nice if the original recordings could get some remix treatment. As for the remixes on this album, they are ok, but some sound generic, like they were remixed just for the sake of remixing being so commonplace these days.Do not pick this up if you are looking for the original recordings of these great songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I was so excited to receive this CD when I ordered it following the death of Mr. Pendergrass.

However, Paul Fishwick's Book is quite inadequate and subpar. Firstly, the Book is outdated, being published in 1995 and excluding many of the recent findings in the field. Secondly, the Book does not teach Simulation Theory. The author either assumes the student already knows simulation or simply wishes to deceive the student into believing thats somehow whats being taught. Fishwick's Book is quite inadequate, outdated, and far from being considered an adequate text on simulation. Fishwick's Book details only one aspect of simulation which is the graphical representation of modeling which is largely regarded a quite insignificant and minor feature of simulation theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-Blowing","review":"I bought this as a record , when it 1st came out, Then I bought it as an 8-track.

While the compositions are solid none have the depth of his best work (such as Layla and his Cream albums). The performances are solid, Clapton's vocals are strong (for Clapton)but his guitar isn't showcased quite as much as one would hope. The backing band keeps in line but producer Delaney Bramlett choses arragnements that give too much space to the band instead of Clapton's expert playing. That said, the production here is solid, faithful, acoustic, and natural early 70s, without the bombastic AOR slickness that plagued many artists in the upcoming years.

I read it anyway and the heavy Christian bible belting in it was a turn off. Missionaries trying to turn people into Christians who have for centuries followed religious practices that fit their culture and lifestyle just doesn't sit right.

My students could read about someone their own age and identify with them. I was disappointed with the inclusion of the Joan Wyndham diary for my own school setting. I teach eighth graders in a Catholic school and some of the discussion of her sexuality is inapproriate for my students. That is the only blemish on this wonderful book from my particular situation. It requires that I take extra caution when I use the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"from madison Ohio","review":"The book Children in the Holocaust and world war two and their secret diaries was one of the sadest books I've ever read, and I'm not just saying that because I'm doing this for a school project.

I almost cried because of the facts these children wrote. I couldn't and still cant beleive these children kept diaries, risking there lives to tell what Hitler was doing.

I was very surprised that many people said these songs weren't catchy. It's amazingly catchy. Have you ever wondered what good vocals, good nu-metal tunes, and good guitars at the same time sounds like? Well, here is the product.Obviously, Soilwork's roots are very different. The vocal style has changed completely and so has the musicianship. However, this is definitely an album to check out. People who are older Soilwork fans will flame this -.-If you are into melodic death, Soilwork is one of the best bands out there for the genre. Avoid this album though. If you want to hear really catchy, solid tunes and accept nu-metal to a small extent, get this! If you liked NBC, this is definitely just as good, maybe even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I may be the only one...","review":"I may be the only one that thinks Figure Number Five is better than Stabbing the Drama. In my ears, it still sounds aggressive, yet very melodic. Stabbing the Drama has amazing choruses, but much in between is very weak, and leaves you waiting for a chorus. I really prefer this album over Stabbing the Drama. It's overall faster and just more METAL rather than ROCK (Stabbing the Drama has too many rock elements).Secondly, the change between Natural Born Chaos and Figure Number Five is huge. This is probably why many people flame this album. But it's not too much of a difference from Stabbing the Drama, although they do differ. Speed's high screams are completely gone in this album and Stabbing the Drama (and even in the new Terror 2000 and Disarmonia Mundi, which he is both vocalists of in that band). Well, if you are a melodic death fan, I highly recommend their older albums, as they are furious and merciless.I guess everyone has their preferences. Choose yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Everything From Sweden is Gold...","review":"I got turned on to Soilwork via some testimonials on an Opeth message board, so I purchased FNF song unheard from a local record shop. Serves me right...For the life of me, I don't understand why someone who appreciates the incredibly talented band Opeth would be interested in this paint-by-numbers Pantera clone. The two bands are nothing alike, other than they both originate out of Sweden.There are absolutely a ton of great Swedish bands out there (Flower Kings, Opeth, Anekdoten...), but this isn't one of them. In short, if you like Pantera and want to hear another band pretend they're Pantera, they you'll like this. If you want advanced musicianship, songwriting, and head banging goodness, go buy Opeth's Deliverance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Metal","review":"This may be pop metal at its finest, but then again I am not a huge fan of pop metal. The cd starts out pretty good with rejection role which happens to be my favorite song on the cd. The music stays on par with what they did on Natural Born Chaos with catchy chorus's but the same cannot be said for the music. Almost every song on the cd follows the same formula and after a time songs start to sound the same. I am able to listen to the first three songs but by the time I manage to get through these I am already looking for another cd. If you are looking for a cd similiar to ReRoute to Remain and Natural Born Chaos then I think you will enjoy this cd. If you are looking for a cd of what Gothenburg music use to be then get something else such as the new Nightrage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tuned up version of Disturbed","review":"I'm not really a big fan of commercialized metal in general so this opinion may come off as bias. I would tell anyone who wants to buy this cd to instead go buy a Disturbed album. Why? Because this band came off to me as a really bad version of pop metal. You take away Disturbed's monkey noises and write NO creative riffs at all and you get Soilwork. I think this bands popularity comes soley from people who walk around saying things like \\"I love Soilwork! I love the underground music scene!\\" blah blah blah. Granted, some underground music is great, but then again this is a prime example of a band that doesnt deserve success.

Working with Devin \\"SYL\\" Townsend has obiously helped Soilwork broaden their horizons from the very focused yet brilliant first 3 albums and completes the trend started in a Predator's Portrait (APP).The album is more melodic and dynamic than NBC but falls short on the agression scales, but is a way better balanced effort thn APP. All that remains is to be seen if they can pull the songs off live but this album will win them new fans and keep the legion loyal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"be forwarned...","review":"others have detailed the gist of the three stories very well.

Not her best work by any stretch of the imagination.Drusilla's Dream-Rachel Lee's premise is a good one but the novella's length did not allow for enough plot and character development. It was choppy and very hard to follow. Not up to her usual standards.Moon Glow-This is my first contact with Catherine Asaro's work but I am very impressed.

Often, this book is so dumbed down that key shortcuts to certain mathematical concepts are completely OVERLOOKED. I'll admit, the practice problems and tests are helpful if one takes the time to do all of them (I didn't), but there is no excuse for such a lack of content. The book teaches the reader how to do everything the long way (often, there are much better methods). For example, in the polynomial division section, synthetic division was not even mentioned. Also, the fact that the permutation and combination functions are built into most calculators was not mentioned either.

I find that it is somewhat less useful than the others, if only because it tries to do too much. The book wastes space explaining 4 different organizational systems (Com Star, Star League, Rasalhague, and Clan). The other manuals had more focus, whereas this apears to be an attempt to throw in every reamining non-great house faction. Can't really blame FASA for that though, as Rasalhague and the SLDF had to get something, and surely dont deserve their own manuals (yet).. overall a sold product, and worth getting eventually, although i recommend picking up some of the others first if you dont really need the ComStar info for a campaign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.

But would the townspeople really offer so little opposition to the group that takes control of the town? there are 1 or 2 'bad guys' among the citizens, but i find it very hard to believe that there wouldn't be more unrest and sabotage. i kept waiting for something really bad to happen and was disappointed. actually, i was relieved. i liked these people. i wanted them to succeed. the history was interesting and the real characters were lots of fun. on the whole i enjoyed this book and look forward to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like this was written for 13 year olds","review":"Forgive me for reviewing this prematurely (I'm only a couple hundred pages in) but I can't help but feel like this book was written as either a \\"First fantasy\\" or a \\"alternative fantasy for people who don't want their kids reading fantasy because it's nothing but make believe\\". I can tell that the author did his research regarding the 30 years war, and while the struggles the \\"settlers\\" face are fleshed out quite believably the characters themselves are cliches. Maybe that was what Flint was trying to do, test our way of life against cultures of the past to see how they would react against each other, using stereotypical blue-collar workers as his lab rats, but if that's then this reader still can't help but find the book (and it's characters) unattractive. I'm going to finish it because I bought it at a friends suggestion, but this will be the last book of Flint's that I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"1632--Or how a trilogy seemed to be compressed into one book","review":"Mr. Flint took a great idea and didn't run with it. It seemed to me that this book would have been better if it was stretched out into a trilogy, or more, along the lines of Forstchen's \\"Lost Regiment\\" series. Every thing in 1632 seemed to happen way to fast. The UMWA conquered army after army, won the girl and created a society faster then anything Superman could have done. Within a matter of months or even days these W. Virginians \\"conqured\\" almost all of Europe. It would have been a more interesting book if there was more overall danger and the town didn't seem to overcome every disaster in a blink of an eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite novel!","review":"I found this book as a \\"freebie\\" on the Baen website, printed it, read it, then ran out and bought it. I've since bought and given away several copies. Then I bought a first edition and socked it away on a high shelf. It's the book I take with me on trips to read because I never get tired of it and every time I read it I find something new. I was at the bookstore the day 1633 was released and, sadly, it was not as good. The subsequent books have what I call \\"franchise-itis\\" because they have gotten caught up in the franchise, blown their focus and lost the wonderful character development of the original. However, the Grantville Gazette books do keep a character focus, most of the time, and I buy and read them regularly. WARNING! Stratfordians and history buffs beware, Eric Flint gave one of his characters an Oxfordian claim in 1632 to please his publisher. In a later book he recants, sorta, but it's still a jarring note in an otherwise outstanding alternative history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't stop turning the pages.","review":"This book immediately pulled me in. I couldn't stop turning the pages. For light fiction, the characters were delightfully multi-dimmensional - I cared about what happened to them. Most of all, the action and pace of the story made it hard to put the book down. One scene - four teenage American boys with shotguns face down 100 mercenaries. Maybe not smart, but definitely heroic. Anyway, I highly recommend this book - it's a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.75 Stars: Just Misses Perfection","review":"Eric Flint's book had me turning pages long past my bedtime due its intriguing premise, frequent action, frequent humor, wonderful characterizations, and, again, the situation. The book could have been a disaster, but the writing was extremely fresh, and the homework Flint put in doing research for the book clearly paid off. I will eagerly read the next book in the series.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"1632, A Book For Those Who Like Alternate History","review":"1632 is the best alternate history book I have read. The situation depicted is pretty realistic for what might happen if time travel were possible. The characters in 1632 are all three dimensional. It was easy for me to identify with most of them. In response to another critic's review that this book advocated vigilantism,I heartily dissagree. The main characters, especially Mike Stearns, did not start the fighting. They only fought in order to defend themselves. Mike avoided fights whenever possible. In conclusion, I recommend this book to anyone who likes alternate history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishful thinking on a grand scale","review":"While Mr. Flint obviously has done a considerable amount of research on 17th-century Europe, which at least makes the book informative, his style of writing is more suited for that used in comic books. The plot is shallow, controversy is minimal, and the protagonist characters are so much more superior than their \\"evil\\" enemies, the outcome of their struggle does not produce even a shadow of a doubt. The author attempted to pluck at the patriotic strings of his readers by having a small group of people from a coal-mining community strive to build the new United States inside war-ravaged Europe, and for some it obviously works - patriotism is a powerful driving force, just look at the success of the movie \\"Independence Day.\\" However, even this cannot compensate for sugary-plain romance between a number of couples in the story, one-sided battle scenes, and single-minded thought process of the book's characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing effort","review":"Having read excellent examples of this genre (e.g. S.M Sterling's Ocean in the Sea of Time), I found this book to be very disappointing. The writing and plot construction is poor, especially in an author who has several novels under his belt. My main complaint is simply that everything is way too easy for the 'up-timers.' The main character faces little opposition personally, romantically, politically, or internationally. Every battle is won easily. There is no suspense and little interest.I read this book because one of my favorite authors, David Weber, co-authored the sequel. I am sad to say that even Weber can't save this series.Read S.M Stirling's work instead, you'll find it much more rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"1632 is a very poorly researched speculative history. Historical figures wear white and black hats with very little grey. Events happen to perfectly support the interests of the protagonists. Please do not waste your time reading this lousy book. Please read Harry Turtledove or S.M. Stirling who write good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Paperback!","review":"While this book was \\"OK\\", it's not even in the league of S.M. Sterling's \\"Against the Tide of Time\\"... Sometimes the internal logic of the novel colapses. sometimes, it's just absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Parody?","review":"I am an alternate history/time travel fan, and being fascinated with the Thirty Years War era, eagerly picked this one off the shelf and rushed home to start reading. To my dissappointment 1632 pushes the envelope of horrible. It is as if somebody decided to write a parody of the alternate history genre with bad imitations of S.M. Stirling and a politically-correct Robert Heinlein thrown in. From cardboard characters spouting junior high platitudes to the unflappable march of Manifest Destiny across Germany, this book is a dumbed down stinker. Since I finished the book I considered giving it a two star rating, but then decided such a benchmark is far too generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!","review":"I don't read a lot of novels (due to lack of time), and was a little skeptical about this one by a first-time author. Still, I ordered it here a few days ago after reading the other reviews, and now am sleep-deprived from my inability to put it down! The engaging story line, the numerous twists and turns, the characters, the (mostly) dead-on accuracy of the local flavor and legal context, and the very effective start-to-finish suspense, make this an outstanding read, not just as a \\"first effort\\" but by any standard. The powerful spiritual message isn't overdone, and shouldn't put off readers of any stripe, but still plays an important role in the book's story and purpose. I put this novel at the top of my Christmas-gift-giving list (and got great feedback from recipients), ordered extra copies, and recommended it to family and friends already. I join the other reviewers in eagerly anticipating Randy Singer's next novel, Irreparable Harm, this summer (and others after that)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a page turner! A refreshingly real book","review":"Here's a book with perfect timing. It touches on many of the issues that are going on behind the scenes that the media is afraid to touch--but that are crucially important on the world scene.Randy Singer presents issues of religious persecution, judges run amok, modern day courtship, and so many other things so plausibly. A great \\"Christian\\" book because not all the characters are Christian, nor do they necessarily become Christian. It's a real book, showing how Christianity impacts people in all different ways, and showing how our understanding of the importance of faith has such world wide consequences.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as it gets..........","review":"I really enjoyed this book - I am an avid reader w/ favorite authors such as Grisham, King, and Patterson. This book had a great little twist, was serious, funny, and entertaining all at the same time. I couldn't put it down. As a law student and a Christian - I would recommend this book to all who enjoy the fictional legal genre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but a little too heavy on the religion","review":"I found this to be well-written, with only a few grammatical errors. The plot is clever and suspenseful and kept me guessing until near the end.My only complaint is that the religious slant was heavy-handed at times. I have no issue with the case being based on a missionary and the insight into her views, but the conversion of members of the legal team, prayer meetings, and protests didn't add anything to the plot. I felt it took away from the plot because it seemed that the author took a great story and inserted bits of Christianity as testament to his faith and a thinly veiled attempt to convert the reader. It interrupted the otherwise smooth flow of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"directed verdict","review":"this was my first randy singer book but it will not be my last.the book was very interesting especially going into detail about international law and how it works.it aiso kept me turning the pages just wanting to see what was going to be next.but the greatest thing about the book was the christian character of sarah and others that were not afraid to share what Christ had done in their lives. i wish other christian authors would inject this in their books and storys as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Directed Verdict","review":"Good legal read. Kept my interest and did not have technical or typo errors (that I saw). Will look for this author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courtroom drama at its best","review":"An exciting book...great courtroom strategy..out of courtroom skulldugery...a great read...and without foul language and sex. So real it could have been based on fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only.....","review":"This could have been an amazing, fascinating, and believable book. It really could have been. As it is it was a page turner. Unfortunately the preaching ruined it for me. Every time the author started with this out of place and unbelievable rhetoric I couldn't help but cringe. The worst part is the morals and values the author seemed to want to put across to the reader would have done so, and likely much more successfully, without it. He managed to encompass all the vital components that a great crime/courtroom drama needs as well as a nice side of romance without the sleaze. If only he could have left out the preachy rubbish. Unfortunately for me that just tossed the baby out with the bath water."},{"rating":"2","title":"great legal thriller","review":"I'm sorry to be the first not to give 5 stars to this great work. I agree the plot was interesting, actually very interesting. I finished the book in a couple of days. My only small disappointment comes from some details in the finals scenes (car chasing typical of a b class action movie) and the Christian issue that becomes just an excuse to start the book but weakly attached to the plot at the end. Overall a very nice relaxed time."},{"rating":"1","title":"premise great, writing one-dimensional","review":"Don't I wish that judges were as un-clever as the clowns depicted in this story.Sorry to report that truly biased judges, which includes many but not most, are much better at hiding their biases otherwise they would be subject to disqualification and perhaps removal.I did like the idea of a civil trial to recover damages from a theocratic government like Saudi Arabia's - but it all could have been set out and developed so much better.To the reviewers who compare this author to Grisham - not hardly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"This book was free, and,still, overpriced. It is nothing but proselytizing disguised as a novel. It is one long commercial for Christian Conservatism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wacko right-wing Christian Nuts","review":"No wonder it was free. IT IS ALL ABOUT THIS RIGHT WING RELIGIOUS AGENDA.I was in Saudi Arabia and it is nothing like they describe it. In fact, the Mormons in my company volunteer to go there because of the pure life style of the Arabs. The modesty, and safety of their families have never been in doubt as foreign workers.When I got to the abortion crap, I saw what this book was about... hate propaganda wrapped in christian double speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uck!!","review":"I only got into this book a little. It grossed me out. The torture and then the court scene where the defending attorney was describing procedures; these things grossed me out and I had to put book down. Will not pick it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but ...","review":"Fascinating and unpredictable. Excellent plot and character development. The only reason I give two stars is because of the theological errors it contains. Great to think of someone becoming a Christian, but it does not happen through a \\"Sinner's Prayer.\\" There is no such teaching or example in the New Testament. Rather, people are taught that they touch the cleansing blood of Jesus when they are immersed into him (Rom. 6:3-4). EVERY example of conversion in Acts shows the person rejoicing After this occurs. You can see this with Paul himself in Acts 22:16. A believing and penitent man, talking to and following the words of Jesus, still had his sins until they were washed away in his baptism into Christ. This humble submission to the gracious Gospel is how one calls upon the Lord. With accurate biblical teaching I would easily give this book five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Thriller!","review":"As an avid reader, I've never been too interested in fiction works, but after reading previous reviews, my interest was piqued and I have to agree...this book was terrific! Exciting, to say the least. Initially, I was curious, as I'd read the 'free preview' available on Amazon...and that's what got me interested! I just finished 'Directed Verdict' and will now make every effort to read more books by Randy Singer. Once I started, I was hooked...and found myself picking up my Kindle several times a day to read more. And, as I got deeper into the exciting story, I couldn't help but think about what a terrific movie it would make! I give this book five stars...and thanks for the ride, Mr Singer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just . . . WOW","review":"This is, simply put, an AMAZING book. I could not put it down and just wanted to read it all night. The plot takes some very good twists and turns. Between the trial and the shady dealings in the background, you just never know what's going to happen next and you're on the edge of your seat wondering how Sarah Reed and her attorney, Brad Carson will ever win. All in all just an absolutely astounding book that you will love. Mr. Singer does a great job with his characters, who all feel very real and fleshed out. The plot has humor, drama, romance, it really just hits all the sweet spots. This is the only book I've read by Mr. Singer but I want to get everything else he's written now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"If you enjoy legal thrillers and Christian literature, then you're going to love Directed Verdict. Great plot, characters, and twists. It was one of those books I couldn't put down, the suspense was believable. I'd recommend this book to my friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Courtroom Drama","review":"This is a most enjoyable courtroom thriller, packed with (mostly) believeable characters and a plot which is complex but, in the end, satisfying. You kinda know how it's going to end but the author takes you on a fascinating route to get there. Singer is an excellent word-slinger, unafraid to go out on a limb with his plot and characters. At a few points you have to suspend disbelief, but not often. And, once or twice I thought the plot was going to get out of control and go wheels-off, like so many thrillers do when the author can't figure out how to believeably get the characters out of the jams he put them in. But Singer remains always in control and delivers a compelling book that is difficult to put down. A winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Dickens, Hardy, Waugh and Snow ...","review":"\\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\" is to Modern British Literature what Ben & Jerry's is to ice cream -- fabulous fare to be savored, appreciated and remembered. If you enjoy Charles Dickens (especially \\"David Copperfield\\" and \\"Great Expectations\\"), Thomas Hardy (\\"Return of the Native,\\" \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\"), Evelyn Waugh (\\"Decline and Fall,\\" \\"A Handful of Dust\\"),and C.P. Snow (\\"The Light and The Dark\\", \\"The Masters\\"), you will love Powell's amazing tour de force. And if you enjoy Powell, you will probably also enjoy the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian! Great writing, memorable characters, convoluted plots -- what more can a reader ask?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trivial review of the 20th Century","review":"I read the whole series of 12 beacause it was one of the New York Times list of 100 greatest novels of the 20th Century.I found the whole series to be unfunny and trivial considering they covered a very significant era of History. Over 3000 pages of narration by Nick Jenkins and by the end of the series the reader has little insight into who Nick really is. The characters are a bunch of odd-ball hanger-ons who,though intellectually stimulating, seem shallow and indiscreet."},{"rating":"2","title":"An English epic of wartime social history.","review":"I place this work among literary mammoths of our time, including Proust's \\"Remembrance of Things Past,\\" Durrell's \\"The Alexandria Quartet\\" and Henry Williamson's \\"A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight.\\" My judgment results not merely from this work's great length, but rather in Powell's greatly detailed characters, sprawling plot development and sheer READABILITY. Despite its great length [about 3,000 pages] it still pales in length in comparison to the aforementioned \\"Chronicle,\\" which at times, plods along and tallies up to approximately 8,000 pages. Bravo to the University of Chicago Press for re-publishing this work in such a beautiful edition, as well. Buy this set and read this wonderful work. You'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels in English","review":"This volume contains the first three novels of Anthony Powell's masterpiece, A Dance to the Music of Time. Powell's work is social comedy in the tradition of Jane Austen and George Meredith. Contemporary writers with whom he is often compared include Marcel Proust and Evelyn Waugh. The 12 short novels of A Dance to the Music of Time give a panoramic picture of English upper-class social life from 1921 to 1971 that is both intensely realistic and amazingly funny. Readers either love Powell's work or can't understand what others see in it. My own opinion is that Dance is the best novel written in the twentieth century. Others share this view: A Dance to the Music of Time is #43 on the recently constructed Random House/Modern Library 100 Best Poll (of twentieth century fiction) and was made into a 4-part miniseries on British television just about a year ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribute??","review":"I am more than a little confused about this one. I thought tributes were either done posthumously or after a long and successful career. Ruben is very talented, but since he is living and is just starting his career.....The artists on this CD are among the more talented American Idol participants. However, why was it released under the guise of a \\"tribute?\\" It was just another way to quickly release Idol cuts and earn some fast money.I don't see much of a reason to buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong product ordered and could not cancel","review":"I orded the Van Halen CD which was in Japaneese by mistake. It said I could cancel at anytime, so when I reviewed my purchase and seen it was wrong I tried to cancel it and was told I couldn't cancel. I wanted to order the vinyl album. When the CD arrived it had a return slip with it. I haven't had time to return it yet, but it is a hassel for me. Amazon should not say you can cancel at anytime and then not let you.Very unsatisified,Ronda Glazier"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best- Classic","review":"This is a classic album by Van Halen and the last with David Lee Roth on vocals. Nothing really offensive here. The music is better written than on previous album but overall is not intimidating. A nostalgia trip by now; named \\"best band ever\\" by Christian metal icons Stryper. Key tracks are: Jump, Panama and Hot For Teacher. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"This is the definative Rock album if you love Hard Rock! It doesn't get much better then this! If I was stranded on a island with only a few album choices this would be one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"All good things must come to an end...","review":"and that is exactly what happened. Although the Sammy era wasn't too bad it can never match the power that the original lineup could must on every album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of both worlds!","review":"1984 is the greatest Van Halen album period IMO.Released in Jan 1984, the album took them to the next level.Even though \\"Best Of Both Worlds\\" was a track off 5150, it really defines this album. We get great raw rocking Van Halen, and we also get synth-driven Van Halen. And both sides to them are at peak performance here.This was one of my first purchased cassettes ever (and the first Van Halen I ever bought), and I've also updated it to CD. In a way, I guess it was good that Roth left when he did, because with 1984, they not even equaled their self-titled debut, but surpassed it.I will never get sick of this album and will still be listening in 20 more years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Rock And Roll","review":"I'm not a big Van Halen fan. I liked about 4 songs on their debut, and some of their videos were entertaining. This though is a kicking rock album! Jump and Panama are classics, I Will and Hot For Teacher cement the deal. Footstompin rock, a good listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant addition to ye ol' collection.","review":"This is one of Van-Halen's better albums. Collect it, take it home, listen to it. Drop Dead Legs is a song that will become classic, as soon as people catch on to it. Not to mention the instants, such as, \\"hot for teacher\\", \\"panama\\", and \\"jump\\". Eddie smokes on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lost Time","review":"1984, the last album by the original Van Halen lineup, went over big. The song 1984/Jump was a landmark in rock history. This was some great keyboards, Van Halen wasn't a stranger to them. \\"Panama\\" was next. The slowdown near the end should go on longer as you \\"ease the seat back\\". \\"Top Jimmy\\" is a straight forward, at The Hop kind of Van Halen's version of \\"Johnny Be Goode\\". I haven't poured over the rest much. \\"Hot for Teacher\\" and \\"I'll Wait\\" were popular. It was on the pop rock/hard rock border of an album. These \\"monsters\\" of rock were getting more polished, it seems to always happen. Van Halen I and II seemed like a phase they were going through now. But 1984 left a lot to the imagination of what they would sound like now if they'd stayed together. They surely would have done somewhere around 10 more albums by now. But sometimes even the love of rock doesn't keep a band together. This group kept a pace going like no other set of musicians may ever equal."},{"rating":"2","title":"axe-inspiring","review":"Eddie had written 1984 the song as a 30 minute instrumental.I think this would be fantastic for fans to have.Everything great about VH is summed up right here.This is what Ed should be releasing to the fans.Music that sounds fun and rocks with fantastic riffs and solos.If he can't find any vocalists worthy of his music then just release an all-instrumental rocker.Joe Satriani has been doing that for years and with great success.Forget the trends and release what everyone wants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Halen at it's best!","review":"Van Halen never really recovered from David Lee Roth's departure. Despite all the trouble and his presence when he was there, this compact disc of one of their most popular ever record albums has hits like \\"hot for teacher\\" and a memorable video that went with it but not with this compact disc. We all remember Roth's pants and his rendition of Jump. I never got the song, Panama, but the album is a classic. I remember when my supermarket sold albums like Van Halen's 1984 with Footloose Soundtrack and Michael Jackson's Thriller. Those days of record albums are long gone. Cassettes came and went and now the compact disc looks like it's here to stay so if you're a Van Halen fan, you might as well get this one to play over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984ever","review":"the last album with roth was in my opinion their best ever with maybe the argument of their debut album. the hit single jump is an american classic, but the other tunes rock too. the screaming of panama is great and i'll wait is a mysterious tune which i luv and hot for teacher has one of my most favorite lines in music. \\" i think of all the education that i missed......but then my homework was never quite like this\\". top jimmy is just flat out awesome. if VH ever makes another best of album, at least one of the songs that i have mentioned besides panama and jump should be included. yes, VH does need another greatist hits album, at least one that will do Roth justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have back catalog-definitive Van Halen","review":"In 1984 I purchased the vinyl copy of this recording while in college. Since then my musical tastes have changed however, as a music collector there are certain recordings, regardless of style or taste, that are necessary to complete a rock music collection. Van Halen 1984 is one of those albums. This is the album that took Van Halen into the classs of International superstardom that most bands dream of, but unfortunately this is also the recording that took the band's egos over the top as well making it the last studio album that the band recorded with their original line-up. While Van Halen I showed a band that was fresh and raw, 1984 shows a more mature rock band, familiar with the studio, and recording at the height of their artistic power. IMO the synth tracks on this album augment Eddie's guitar shredding quie nicely and put this record over the top for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panama","review":"The first song ever i heard of Van Halen was Panama. I loved that song when i heard Eddie break with that little harmonic jingle about 26 seconds into the song, and again before the chorus. That hooked me, so I looked into Van Halen more, and found some more incredible music!Eruption,You Really Got Me,Jamie's Crying,Runnin' With The Devil,(Oh) Pretty Woman,Best of Both Worlds,Jump,Panama,And The Cradle Will Rock...,Poundcake,and Dance The Night Away are my favorites.Eddie Van Halen is now one of my favorite guitarists. Eruption is a great solo for any guitarist, Eddie's a genius on his 6-string. Anyways, Panama is my favorite song from this incredible album, 1984. This album deserves 8 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those people complaining about the length of the CD","review":"You have to remember that CD's were first released in 1983 and that records and tapes were still king. The average record length was 35-45 minutes and artists were limited to making records within that time frame. Maybe if this album was made in the early '90s the length would be about an hour. The point is that is as long as the album rocks it doesn't matter how many songs are on this record. 1984 is the pinnacle of DLR's involvement with VH. It's a shame the reunion didn't work out. Maybe Eddie will change his mind and rehire Dave now that Gary Chercone left the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's no VH1, but it's Not Bad At All","review":"This is it. The album where Van Halen ascended to superstar status at the price of establishinbg hair metal as we know it. Still, for what may be considered a 'hair metal' album (UGH!!) it's certainly very good. Panama, Top Jimmy, Drop Dead Legs and espescially Hot for Teacher rock heard with some great guitar playing from Eddie. Even the synth-driven songs, Jump and I'll Wait, are pretty good. Overall thisi s the VH album to get after I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"A rollicking good time. I wore this one out on tape when I was a teenager, and finally re-bought it in my 20's on CD. 1984 and 5150 represent the best, most original VH material since their first album. And the fact that they're with different singers only enhance the band's versatility and abilities. MY favorite part of this album is the sound--percussion, bass, and synth paint the perfect background to Ed's guitar and Dave's vocal overlays. Favorite tunes--\\"Drop Dead Legs,\\" \\"Hot for Teacher,\\" and \\"I'll Wait.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of everything","review":"Quite simply the best of VH, who are quite simply the best of all rock, but what can you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definitive rock and roll album","review":"'1984' is a must for any Van Halen fan, or any rock and roll fan for that matter. The album opens with the almost mystical instrumental (synthesized) \\"1984\\". After that, \\"Jump\\" basically sets the mood for the album. \\"Jump\\" is such an awesome song, I believe it is one of the best rock songs of the '80's, and maybe of all time. \\"Panama\\", \\"Hot For Teacher\\", and \\"Hosue of Pain\\" are amongst many other good songs. The album is worth the money, every rock fan should own this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Halen Goes Synthesizer!","review":"This was the first Van Halen album I ever listened to, in fact I never heard of Van Halen till this came out...I was 12 years old back then and was living on a diet of great bands such as Duran Duran, Culture Club and Kajagoogoo. The album cover was cool, a baby angel with some smokes and the back cover of four long-haired hippys who looked like they came out of some nasty trailer park intrigued me...so I put on the album expecting to hear some ... kickin', fist pumpin', beer guzzlin' mullet rawk but instead I'm hearing sappy keyboards as on the intro 1984 and \\"Jump\\" as well as \\"I'll Wait\\"...I mean Steve Winwood kicks these guys ..., c'mon I want some rock and roll!

I purchased this movie despite the high price because I was curious about what a Kolkatta movie is like. I am so happy I got to watch this movie. I recommend it. I hated spending $19.99 but this movie was easy to watch and Kollywood IS different from Bollywood. I'm glad I got a chance to see the contrast in style.

A scene will be going on like normal and then the characters burst into song! I had seen Bride and Prejudice, also with Aishwarya Rai, before this, but that was made for a Western audience so it was easier to watch.I wasn't crazy about this movie, honestly. I liked some of the scenes wit Meenakshi and Captain Bala (Marianne and Colonel Brandon) the best, actually. And there were funny parts. But I felt it took too long to get started (it's over 2 hours long) and then rushed everything in at the end. I got so bored trying to rewatch it for the review that I skipped over the musical numbers. I guess I'm just not the right audience for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I Hadn't Found It","review":"This film is a lumbering disappointment. While some of the Tamil dance numbers were intriguing,they were soon followed by two of the goofiest vocal numbers: one involved a wealthy young financier floating down the river on a raft,for no particular reason, while serenading a rainstorm; this same character - he does get around - is later seen, clad in a cape, at some fantasy castle with his love \\"Ash\\". She, you, and I would have been better served if he had earlier drowned in the river. The entire film could have used some careful editing, starting with the opening military sequence, which really served no purpose.

It is backed by extensive research into the more extreme aspects of the Sasquatch in popular culture, substantiated by Native American lore centuries old. Yes, there is a history of inter-species hominid communality. The soundtrack music constitutes a masterfully applied parody, moving from love-comedy, through pornography, to tragedy. Though made on an obviously low budget, that is part of the point--this film is a satire of human romantic motivation as much as it is of the b-movie bigfoot monster genre. If you meet the filmmaker he will probably give you a promotional t-shirt, which is even cooler than the film.

Not only do most of the songs involve a beatbox and samples, there are even Madonna and Robert Palmer covers!Humor and irreverence combines with an anything-goes approach the song structures. It sounds like the band is having a lot of fun, and that energy passes to the listener. An added bonus is the guest appearances of Mike Watt and J.

After locking it outside Subway to a street post one day, I go and eat and come back and unlock it. After I unlock it, the key has broken a small piece off inside of the lock. I was more than lucky to have it not break when I was locking it down as my bike would have been there to be stripped down.

Can't say anything about others I haven't used to compare but I love this. If you're not in a rush in setting up and using there shouldn't be any problems. Yes you could break a key if you force it or don't push it in all the way. It may be weak and could be improved but so simple when used right - and there are extra keys. Try it first and you see how solid it is. I had the hardest frame to set this on, a mountain bike frame but it can be done. I always wonder if it's the competition complaining when I read a bad review or someone that got in a hurry etc. and blames the lock.

I can think of few instances where using all caps is appropriate, but this is one. As others have noted already: The lock itself is solid enough, but the base of the lock cracked apart after a few months, and the whole thing rusts quickly, even if your bike is only very occasionally caught in passing rain (I store my bike inside my house). The key can sometimes get stuck, and it sounds like it gets permanently stuck for some. And the notches on the lock are not beveled at the corners so its very easy to ding your frame and chip the paint. The mount for the frame is cheap and locks onto your frame permanently with a ratcheting mechanism, and is a pain to take the lock on and off of.In short, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE learn from others mistakes, and spend the few extra dollars to buy a product from another manufacturer.

One u-lock to lock my front wheel to the frame, and the second to lock the frame, back wheel, to a post, etc. I bought this U-LOCK not knowing the company, but it was sturdy and good feel and at a good price.I had a HORRIBLE experience with this lock. My second time using this, the key broke off like butter while I was opening it. I have owned many U-LOCKS in the past and know how to not force the key, so I wasn't using much force at all. The key broke off inside the lock, leaving me stranded. I'll avoid my heroic details of finding my way home to then return with the 2nd key and plyers to remove the stuck key.The key (you get two) that is made for this lock is EXTRA thin. All U-LOCK keys are thin and should never be forced, but this is a terrible design and major flaw. It's a good lock, but comes with a terrible key, so I would not suggest buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"got a lemon","review":"After careful research, I found this lock to be the best value -- strong and well-priced. I sent it to my son at college. After using it for a few days, he was unable to open it for a few days in a row, he said. Then one day he got it to work. He used it for a few days and then he could not open it when he stuck the key in again. It was just jambed shut. After about two weeks of trouble, he bought another lock. I am not sure if he just got a lemon or if there is an inherent problem with this lock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right now I am in my room...","review":"and my bike is at class.

I will try another key, but I'm not happy now, after having to walk back.edit: I found that knocking on the side of the lock barrel helps the most, as well as rapidly turning the key. Pulling on the U is useless. I added some oil (low temperature engine oil), and it seems to be much better. I think it is worst in below-freezing temperatures. It is better than it was, but DO NOT RECOMMEND. If you haven't bought it yet, buy a different lock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakly constructed key makes this lock a BAD buy!","review":"The key on this product has a thin area right above the notches that fit the tumblers. In my case, this caused it to break off in the lock earlier today (I did not apply excessive force, knowing from experience the hassles a broken key can cause ). Now, the only way of getting my bike off that stand is for me to go home, bring back my rotary tool and cutting disc and have at it (if that works, this thing is hardened steel) . The lock itself might be as safe as the Bank of England, but I would advise against buying this product because of the key.Update: the \\"13mm hardened steel shackle\\" on this lock took about five minutes to cut through with my little-bitty cordless Dremel, so I shudder to think how easy a job it would be for any thief with a \\"professional\\" tool.

The reason I got it is because I usually ride my bike to the lake and like to jog also so I have to leave it locked some how. So I saw the nice price and got it. The U lock is heavy, the piece you attach to the hold the lock to your bike in place is really poor its basically a strap that you tighten to your frame and and a clip that holds the u lock in place while riding. The strap/clip item failed. It doesnt lock in place and the u lock falls out BUT thankfully I found a better way to attach it to the bike just by locking it to the frame and using the cable from one end of the bike to the other. This is my first lock, so as far as the holder it all really depends on your frame of bike so larger the frame the easier it is to fit/attach the strap to it, but the clip part is weak is made out of plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Price!","review":"Great product!

I live on a college campus and I actually have had a bike stolen. That was my fault though, as I left it unlocked while I visited a friends house. People here lock their bikes up with cheap cable locks and U-locks from Walmart all the time. I get the sense that as long as it's locked up with something, it's pretty safe.

I was really not expecting much and this book lived up to my expectations because it kept saying \\"Go see a lawyer! Go see a lawyer!\\" Then my friend saw I had the wrong book... Part of the reason I picked up this book was all the good reviews, but then I see that many of them come from Philadelphia, where this book's author is from. Coincidence? Probably not because all their comments don't seem to match the contents. Do yourself a favor and get the Nolo book, it's really much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews encouraged it, so I bought both...","review":"... both \\"Divorce & Money\\" books, that is, one by Smith and the other by Woodhouse. And I have to say, while this book DOES have a lower price, in this case you get what you pay for.Thumbing through Smith's book, I found some helpful information but really, other than stressing that you had to go to a lawyer, a lot of it seemed less fleshed out than Woodhouse's book. Especially if your split is amicable (mine was), a professional needn't be that involved. Within minutes it was clear which book was better, and it wasn't this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked perfect","review":"I needed an enclosure for my chickens. This has helped considerably and cheaply. Now I don't need to worry about them getting out and eaten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Not deer proof","review":"We got everything set up real nice and the deer fence was almost invisible.Our garden had been growing really well when I got a call from the neighbour that the deer were in our garden.We now have wire around our garden.Not as pretty, but deer proof.The netting didn't keep the deer out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Netting, too hard to put up","review":"This may keep deer away but it is way too hard to put up. It clings to EVERYTHING -grass, hats, glasses. twigs. You name it and it will get caught in it. I never could get it straight and in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"So thin it's almost not there","review":"This stuff is incredibly thin. And I can't quite understand all of the great reviews, especially the ones that suggest that this stuff is easy to work with. They must have incredible patience, or weren't expecting much. (I bought a heavier version of this type netting previously, and had a pretty good idea what I was getting.) It is hard to work with (don't wear anything with buttons) because it's so light and catches on everything. I can't imagine using it for fencing - I drape it over azaleas, etc. I think it discourages the deer, because otherwise, they'd certainly be able to chew right through it. I note that nowhere on the package does it give any indication of how thick the plastic is. That's because it's almost not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its Job, Easy to Use.","review":"I saw a lotta different reviews for deer netting, but only this brand came back with the best responses from customers. I can see why.I was having tremendous deer problems with my garden, losing seedlings early in the year, when I finally went and bought this. Only took a week or so to get to me, and it was easy to install.I too have accidentally tripped on this stuff because it's hard to see if you forget about it, but very strong. You can rip it if you get it caught and yank really hard on it, but that's to be expected. If a deer or other large animal comes across this netting, it's gonna back away and move along elsewhere.Great product; haven't had a single deer problem since I installed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsafe for wildlife","review":"I bought this netting to keep deer out of recently planted garden area. I put it up Saturday. On Sunday, I had small birds stuck in the netting. They were unable to get out, and their struggling caused them to become very entwined. Fortunately, I was able to cut them out of the netting. While it worked for the deer, I really do not want to harm other wildlife, which is why this product is only receiving one star. I took it down immediately and purchased wire fencing from Home Depot. It cost twice as much, but I am just not ok with wildlife being trapped in netting material for the sake of a few flowers. I really do not recommend using this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really wanted to like it ...","review":"My high expectations may have skewed my impression of this movie. I especially enjoy old atmospheric ghost stories, but I felt there were too many holes in this one and I really did not like the ending. The governess (in my opinion) seemed to jump to conclusions without really letting the viewer in as to why. I have never read the book and plan to do so. I expected more from the Truman Capote script. The cinematography by future Hammer director Freddie Francis was excellent. There was a high \\"creepy\\" factor. Fans of \\"The Haunting\\", \\"Village of the Damned\\" or \\"Curse of the Demon\\" will want to give this one a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Befuddled at praise","review":"As of the creation of this review, 150 preceding Amazon.com reviewers had given this film an average review of 4.5 stars. My wife and I are at a loss to understand why. Oh sure, Deborah Kerr if photogenic and a fine actress; supporting cast is good caliber; cinematography/special effects/scenes & film-sets were all first class. However, like a beautiful woman all dressed up with no place to go, none of the above-listed positives can outweigh the lack of a compelling finish to this screenplay - it's a fizzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy crap!","review":"I'm watching this film now,it's on TCM,what a badly acted,I suppose badly written,hence the bad acting,the children especially,lousy actors,the girl scream,cry,scream,cry,scream,cry on and on for what seemed like 20 minutes.Miss Kerr eyes wide open,jaw askew,like she's going to throw up,is good acting by some standards.If the music is supposed to be scary it's not,with that incessant piano tinkling,and drum beats,and the alien movie music,it's about as scary as Casper the friendly ghost."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Innocents DVD - Movie","review":"Not a great movie. I suppose it was considered good for its time. The acting was horrible as were many movies in 1961 I suppose. I was bored with it halfway through. I love old movies...but this one's not on my list of favorites. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful classic entertainment...","review":"I order so many of these classic films that I believe my wife may leave me if just one more silent film graces my dvd player. On that note, a sarcastic one at that, I would say that this film was highly entertaining. The acting is superb and the storyline is well written. I will agree that the pace may or may not allow younger viewers to become engulfed with the story, but I am only 31 and was \\"locked in\\" from the first scene. A true winner for classic horror fans. Also seek out Village of the Damned which was released in the same time period. Great Stuff!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremendous film 5 stars--1 star for this version...","review":"Once again americans are forced to suffer the lack of extra features and the UK gets a 'real' version of this delightful film. Frankly I'm tired of the film industries doing this with dvds. If there are special features for a dvd, those features should be on every copy no matter what country you live in! I don't think it's too much to ask for and do we really need dvd regions? I think not!Thanks for nothing Fox Century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good after all these years","review":"Often we judge horror films by the generous load of effects that can be produced but this 60's black and white classic is a great yarn. It is derived from a very good chiller \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" and the film does the book justice. Deborah Kerr does tend to over act at times and often we expect her eyes to pop out of her head, but she does give a good performance and the film is quite creepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Film","review":"I found this film very interesting and thought provoking. It is the perfect movie to watch on a dark raining night. Scary and it reminded me of a gothic tale of old. Loved the costumes.It is also a perfect movie for a \\"movie\\" club, to discuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Turn of the Screw","review":"This film is without doubt one of the greatest ghost story and book adaptations ever filmed. Henry James' classic short story is given a superb rendering here, with Deborah Kerr in her best role, and a star-making turn by a young Pamela Franklin. Never before (with the possible exception of 1963's \\"The Haunting\\") has a film unfolded its suspense with such subtlety! So engrossing is this film that you'll likely feel the accompanying chill as the ghosts make their presence known! The lighting and cinematography of this film is excellent, shot in gorgeous black and white. The appearances of the ghosts and the final scene are two of the most memorable and frightening scenes ever filmed. If you are a fan of true \\"horror,\\" you must add this film and \\"The Haunting\\" to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ?????","review":"I love psychological type 'horror' movies like The Haunting so I thought I'd like this one as well. After dozing through a lot of the movie all I could say at the end was \\"What in the world did I just watch?\\" You really never get any kind of answers or, for that matter, any real clue as to what in the wide, wide world of sports went on here. Are the kids possesed? Is the nannie? Does the houskeeper know more than she lets on? How about the uncle? Where, if anywhere, does he fit in. About the most fun to be had watching this movie would be to take a drink everytime one of the children said \\"my dear\\". At least then you'd get something out of this horrid film. If you must, rent this from the 99 cent rack. Don't go over that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Watching","review":"This movie just does not deliever. The story makes no sense and the ending is just awful. The children do not act like any children would act under similar circumstances. The adults don't either. When given reasonable courses of action the character played by Ms Kerr rejects them in favor of outlandish actions. As the person with some rationality (in theory) and control Ms Kerr's character acts very irrational and as someone without control.My wife believes the main adult character played by Ms Kerr is nuts to start with, and that may explain the rest of the film because the entire story is told from her point of view. But that isn't made clear at any point. And if she was irrational to start with it isn't brought out. If she becomes irrational during the movie it isn't clear what might have brought on the breakdown.I do not recommend this film. It is not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very odd movie, a bit like \\"The Others\\" with Nicole Kidman","review":"I was excited to own this movie but after watching it twice (second time hoping to like it more) I tossed it in the trash! I found it weird and disturbing but then maybe it was my own fault for getting a movie where the children are the spooky ones. I just didnt like it at all. I usually like the old scarey ghost stories, (my favorite being \\"The Uninvited\\" with Ray Molland) but this just wasnt for me. I know others love it so this is just my own take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at Best","review":"The Innocents says it all! There was not a lot of talent, other than a few of the actors, displayed throughout this movie. This movie was not at all what I expected and was a big yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural or Psychological","review":"I just finished reviewing The Sixth Sense and in doing so I was reminded of this film. Both involve characters that see ghosts and suffer from it mentally. What I like most about both films is that the matter is taken seriously. Very seldom are ghost stories told in a mature manner. For those tired of teen slasher flicks and are looking for something actually creepy that sticks with you try this film. Although it may not be quite as entertaining as The Sixth Sense I think that I admire it more. I love film makers that do not feel the need to overexplain everything in the plot. In this film we never know for sure whether Kerr (in an excellent performance) ever actually sees ghosts or whether she is just going crazy. This sense of unsolved mystery tends to stick with the viewer much longer than if they had explained everything. If you like this sort of creepy, mysterious movie check out one of the all time greats, Picnic at Hanging Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying!","review":"Professional Nanny Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) is persuaded by a handsome playboy to take on the care of his neice and nephew on his large country estate. Before long, Miss Giddens becomes convinced that the spacious estate is inhabited not only by her and the children, but also by evil spirits that mean to do harm.The Innocents is a brilliant adaptation of Henry James's novel, The Turn of the Screw. It is one of the greatest haunting films ever made and is a movie that everyone should see. Unfortunately, it has been unavailable on VHS and DVD until this year. I've been waiting for the day it would be available since the first time I saw it in a theater in college in 1996.The Innocents is a very scary movie and I wouldn't show it to small children. The language is clean and there is no violence, but it's terrifying nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"At the risk of making enemies, the movie is actually more effective than the novel, and that is very rare. James's prose is sometimes difficult to wade through. He was a great writer, but sometimes a great writer has problems with a horror story. The movie, however, is brilliant. If you love gore, blood, sex, and all the 20th century crap, then you will hate this movie. If, however, you love suspense, terror and truly imaginative horror, then you will love this movie. It is second only to the 1963 version of Shirley Jackson's \\"The Haunting\\" as effective, yet subtle, horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven, but the ending packs a wallop.","review":"After reading so many glowing reviews about this film, I finally saw it. Everything up to the final ten minutes was quite slow-paced and, frankly, dull. But then you realize out that it was all table-setting for the final ten minutes, which were truly the most chilling and disturbing I've ever seen in a horror film. Those last ten minutes could stand alone as a tremendously effective short horror film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have not brought my spectres with me...","review":"It helps if you forget that this is supposed to be a horror movie; the ghost-scenes are the least effective parts, and it's nowhere so scary as The Haunting(1963).Where it works is as a human-relations drama detailing the complex relationship between the governess and the children. She is shocked by Miles' overtures, but not altogether averse, seen most clearly in the bedtime kiss. Deborah Kerr is great at registering her ambivalence, something she also did well in Black Narcissus.In an art-book, I saw two paintings by Bronzino (c.1545): \\"Eleanora of Toledo\\" and \\"The Exposure of Luxury\\" - one depicting a sombre and sedate mother, the other a lascivious embrace. And these seem to be the contrary states of the governess' soul.Quint should have been reduced to an invisible hypothesis, as in the novel.This movie is useless in its present format; it demands widescreen presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Adaptation","review":"Based on 19th century literature, it's basically a ghost story. What is the number one \\"ghost story\\" ever made?; doesn't matter, they're near impossible! No one has ever made a two-hour movie from a \\"novella\\" of psychological investment. Read the book! In other words, if you have a \\"device\\" in your hand at the moment ( cell/ipad, etc. )- you will not like this movie. Try reading the book and leaving an intelligent, insightful review or go for a ride in your \\"tank\\" and support foreign oil. Don't forget to Protect Your Children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will this classic EVER be released on DVD","review":"I'm sure I'm not the only person wondering why this has yet to be put on DVD.One would think that when it was put on a list on E.W.'s 5 most scary films you never saw that it WOULD be put on soon.

But this is one I definately have my fingers crossed will soon be released soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling!","review":"The Innocents, is it a ghost story or drama?

I am now using another book, actually two other courses. I would not recommend this course to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely blah book of boring short stories","review":"Of the half dozen short stories contained in the book, only one is mildly interesting. Every story deals with war time back here at home with all the discussions about rationing, blackouts, boys off serving etc. That in itself is not off-putting but the book is supposed to be mystery flavored-and it is not-it's a group of stories about not much of anything.The ONLY little tale that is interesting enough to be recognized is \\"The Lipstick\\" that comes at the very end. It is a clever story that makes you wonder \\"did she fall or was she pushed?\\"I bought this book because my taste runs to the quirky and a little out of the ordinary mystery and/or thriller. This was neither nor was it at all interesting. Don't even know why I finished reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't aged well","review":"Seemed to be a contrived plot at best. The sheer wrongness of the \\"sci-fi\\" animals to people did not help me enjoy this book in the slightest. It's understandable that people may have thought that possible at one point, but for me, a reader in this day and age, that sort of transformation would be best left to fantasy stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Study of Human Nature","review":"For me, this book is H.G. Well's exploration of the three main human behaviors:1. Man as God (Dr Moreau)2. Man Under God (His servants and other creations)3. Man without God (The escapees)None of the three representations is shown to be very attractive, but it certainly does illustrate some of the more difficult aspects of the Human Condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic H.G. Wells","review":"The two movies that I have seen on The Island of Doctor Moreau over the years served as an introduction to the storyline. When I eventually got around to reading it, I was really glad I made the decision to do it rather than rest on the movie interpretations. It is a short novel. You will like it. Read it. It is Classic H.G. Wells. You will be glad afterwards that you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"My daughter use this book at the college and she don't like it.

However, my copy of this ebook didn't display correctly and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who owns a Fire. The pages were presented in a blurry text (which cannot be zoomed), boasting a horrid blue background for each and every page.

It had a good plot, and the author had a very creative story line. It was filled with interesting and imaginative characters, from Dr. Moreau himself, to the creatures known as the Beast Folk. This book was a real page turner. It kept you in suspense and wanting to know what happened next."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read for any Wells or Verne fan!","review":"This book is one of my favorite Wells books.It is about this guy who gets 'trapped' on this island. and this island is inhabited by an infamous scientist/doctor who was 'exiled' from England. Anyway, the doctor is Moreau. And this Moreau guy gets animals and tries to make them more human. What really bothered me about this is that he really had no reason for doing this. It might be a different case if he was actually benifitting the world by doing this. But no, he was just doing this for his own personal curiosity. This also immedietly made me think of our own conflicting opinions and moral dillemas we have with genetic engineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome version","review":"Simply an awsome book, soooo facinating. I loved it! I will recommend this version for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wells' classic on the nature of mankind","review":"This is the only Wells novel I can imagine going back to again in my old age. It has had the good fortune to be made into 2.5 wonderful films. (The Charles Laughton and Burt Lancaster versions count as one each, and the Marlon Brando counts as a half, with Brando serving as the other half.) A meditation on the essential nature of man as well as a fast-moving adventure, it will leave you thinking, as the best science fiction does, about things you may have taken for granted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Moreau, Weird in the extreme!","review":"The farther I read in this book, the more disgusted I was with myself for wasting time with it. It is hyper-fanciful, and in my opinion is not worth the effort. You know how it ends before starting the body of the story, and I finally left it at that.

Not that I have a problem with that, I just somehow managed to not notice until recently. But I do really love his books, and this one is no exception. I found it to be the perfect balance between action and introspection. The subject matter is horrifying (and sometimes gory), but very realistic and similar to what is currently being done with modern medicine and surgery. As usual, Wells shows himself to be almost creepily prophetic. The science in this book would be a little off if it had been written 50 years ago, but it was written in 1896!!! Whereas so many science fiction authors have pictured the future with unisex silver bodysuits and hovercars and anthropomorphic robots, H. G. Wells is the only one who ever seems to get close to where the future is actually going, and all from 115 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This is another free book and thanks to those who are making these classics available -- you are doing a great service for literature. In terms of this story, I found it quite good. I will say, however, that I ultimately found the story somewhat unsatisfying as Wells never really gave a believable reason why Moreau would do these experiments? It was clearly a social commentary on the inhumanity of man, but it seemed like inhumanity merely for the sake of being inhumane. The book also seems to suggest support for eugenics. In any event, it is an interesting read and it's well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"the island of doctor moreau","review":"book is very well writen. it is an classic I enjoyed it through it is an older book it keeps the attention of the reader, there is a movie on this book but the book is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A snapshot of nursing history","review":"The Cherry Ames books give a glimpse into the history of nursing.

One of the reasons I love these editions is because I can easily catch up on classics and stories I have missed.This story was both horrible and wonderful at the same time. Some of the descriptions within - of the gore, the vivisections, the three main characters' reactions - seem so, well, modern. It is definitely a novel before its time. Some of the images stayed with me for a while, especially those from the lab.In short, I would recommend this book, especially to fans of horror/science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Science Fiction","review":"Considering this novel was first published in 1896, it is a testament to Wells' visionary imagination. His description of horrific vivisection experiments is a century ahead of its time. Dr. Moreau is portrayed as the ultimate villain, disregarding ethics for his own desire to play God in the name of scientific advancement. This is a great work of early science fiction that challenges the moral implications of science even today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The law","review":"There is one scene: Prendrick has fled the compound and has entered the village of the beast people. He sits in on a bizarre ceremony where a leader recites the laws of the beast people. The reader, with a heavy ominous sense, can feel that these laws are ultimately meant to be broken . . .Though the story is crowded at the beginning with the plot logistics of stranding the narrator on the island with Moreau and his creations, and the ending is sort of rushed, Wells has created a horror novel of startling implications and fantastic imagination. You'll never look at your genetically engineered tomatoes the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"HG Wells did it again in this book.

Try Sleektress by Nexxus instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Love of the Music...LOOK ALIVE!","review":"This CD/DVD really depicts the musical talent and passion that Incubus conveys as a band. The CD ranges from bossanova to african/tribal sounds to accompany the movie. The scenes between the songs show that the band isn't afraid to show thier true selves. It almost seems as if they don't put themselves on a pedestal over anyone else, including the listener. One of the scenes shows how each and every band member is not afraid to shake hands with thier biggest fans and it actually makes it a touching scene to see.I recommend Look Alive to anyone who has never seen or heard Incubus live. Or if you just want to relive the great feelings you felt during the latest tour, then its definitely worth investing $15 to purchase it. Incubus has always been good to thier fans and this is just another addition to what I hope is a growing collection of Incubus DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"thoroughly relaxing","review":"Granted; the first Incubus album i was introduced too was \\"Crow Left of...,\\" i thought it was a good album. I picked up \\"Look Alive\\" and \\"Light Grenades\\" and am now hooked on their sound. In my estimation Ben Kenney is a standout bassist.I fully intend to buy all their more \\"Funk\\" oriented albums of the past. But for now I am very impressed by this dvd. I was most impressed by the \\"Look Alive\\" concert version of Pistola!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incubus \\"Look Alive\\" CD/DVD","review":"I originally bought the standard single DVD edition of \\"Look Alive\\" because, 1.I LOVE this Band! 2.New concert footage of this band! But what I did not know was that there was a limited CD/DVD version of it at Best Buy stores. Well, when I found this out naturally it piqued my interest. It turns out the cd consists of 11 original scores created for the dvd by guitarist Mike Einziger and heard at different parts within the dvd. All of the scores are stand-out tracks and great for an Incubus collection. The cd also includes 6 bonus live tracks including the new songs Punch Drunk and Look Alive.--Bottom Line--Buy the CD/DVD version of \\"Look Alive\\" even if it is a few dollars more. Also the DVD is Region 0 so no matter where you buy it from the DVD will work on your player.Thanks,And I hope this was helpful. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband Loved","review":"Incubus is one of my husbands favorite bands. I bought this DVD for him Christmas 2007 and he loved it. My Brother-in-law found a similar DVD but it has a bouns CD included with songs on it for the same price. Was dissapointed about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"All over again","review":"I was really impressed by the production of the dvd... The quality of the edition, performance of the band, and feature images of places they visited is a guarantee of a great quality entertainment!For those who were there, at the concerts of the Light Grenades Tour, all the feelings of joy and pure happiness rise up again. Look Alive is certainly somethings that says with sight what can't be said with words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent!!","review":"I bought the product for a Christmas Gift and the person was fascinated with it. The delivery was quick and the rpice was very low...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"Love this dvd. I also own Red Rocks and this has more behind the scenes, etc. Red Rocks is straight concert dvd for the most part. Also, the quality of this blue ray is very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the morning view dvd","review":"I like this dvd because unlike the morning view dvd, you can \\"play all\\". but it has less footage and interviews with them and less about what it was like to film videos and make the light grenades record. It is a good dvd but not the best, depending on what you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I got this for my brother since hes way more into Incubus than i am.He said it was just amazing.Just that...AMAZING!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"where's my copy?","review":"it's been a while now.. im from the philippines and still i havent recieved my order yet. and i hope that i wasnt robbed of $18. please do something about this amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad shippment","review":"I haven't received my dvd yet, i don't know what happened... how can i complain about this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow - phony","review":"they now think they are better than they actually are...redefine acoustic is the worst adaptation ever- really really really bad.they talk about being modest and down to earth so much its clear that they like the smell of their own farts way too much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incubus Refined","review":"I have been a huge incubus fan since around 2003. I loved their tight punchy funk/rock sound,from Mike's creative acoustic and electric guitar passages to Dirk's percussive bass line creations. Ever since Dirk left the band, I've been stuggling to regain the level excitement for their new music as I had for their older stuff.\\"Look Alive\\" has provided the elixir I needed to get it back. Musically, this DVD is still the \\"new\\" Incubus, but it showcases how their \\"new\\" sound has become more refined and nuanced. Brandon's charisma is stonger than ever and Ben is now fully blended into the band. All these refinements fill out the void the first two post-Dirk releases seemed to have.In the mean time the Video showcases their travels, and they use some of their experimental instrumental stuff as a backdrop to the video when their not on stage. Very worthwhile!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incubus Fans - MUST HAVE THIS!!!","review":"Please don't be upset with the next statement but this isn't there BEST DVD available. I will admit it's #2 overall and definitely shows the bands growth from When Incubus Attacks till now. Plus, the amazing music of Light Grenades is displayed throughout the disc.This DVD was put together very well and follows the band members around the world as they travel, play shows, do signings, etc. The bonus features are amazing as usual and make the DVD worth every penny. Needless to say, all real Incubus fans out there should pickup there own copy for support and also to get to know what and who you're listening to. Brandon, Mike, Jose, and Ben don't dissapoint in any appearance in the movie either, I would recommend this DVD to EVERYONE! *But be sure to pickup Morning View Sessions, it will change your life*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"These are very nice standard thickness hoops. The 3.0mm hoops of course are thicker and more rigid but these are on par with most non cast hoops out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"a failure","review":"I watched a tango concert by Rinaldi in the 80 ties, when this cd was recorded.In this concert she sang Piazzolla and Piaf (La Foule: translated) which was very impressing.Unfortunately the synthesizerstrings used on this cd make it into a cheapish Asian restaurant background music. Furthermore the singer seems wanting to show off her knowledge of other languages than her native Spanish (Argentinian) As a result she jumps over syllables in German and French, destroying the tender balance between pathos and subtility needed in tango. I feel the producer was asleep during the recording sessions.Very bad indeed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good results for the price","review":"I needed to augment the high end a little on some desktop speakers without opening the cabinets or a lot of trouble. These little piezo tweeters do a credible job with almost no installation difficulty. I did find that I required two of these tweeters on each speaker to get the needed boost and am pleased with the results. They provided the needed results at a trivial cost and without any installation fuss. An added plus is their small size permitting them to be easily aimed wherever needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"tweeters","review":"I am a thrifty buyer and I saw these tweeters for sale I previously had some pyle tweeters and thought this would be a good upgrade, but unless you have a car that has an absolutely powerful these speakers emit such a high frequency that it mutes out the rest of you system. I would recommend something with an adequate RMS level that matches the total power output."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE REPLACEMENT OR REFUND","review":"GENTLEMEN AMAZON THIS ARTICLE EVEN HAS NOT COME TO ME AND I HAVE ASKED FOR THE REPLACEMENT OR REFUND OF THE COST.REGARDS,MARCO RIVAS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I got the pyle driver piezo tweeters and they arrived broken in the package.I figured forget it, would cost more sending em back then throwing em away.I suggest nobody buy these things, you'd only be wasting your loot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was skeptical, but, now I'm a ccw convert","review":"Use tips from the novelists? Let my computer measure my results? Sure.So I bought this book with a skeptical eye. Once I tried the business about editing to the five number standards, I thought it felt mechanical. But I stuck with it.And what do you know? I soon began to feel an attitude change. I did write better in the first hour, just as promised.Bottom line, and I should have put this into the top line, if I'd taken the author's advice: This is the best book on writing since the Elements of Style. Don't take my word for it. Use it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this Book","review":"Every parent ought buy this book for their 7-12 year old child. It is a very, very good introduction to more elementary mathematics. I still have mine from childhood and use parts of it in my Philosophy Courses (at a rather selective university) to help explain what my above-average college students never understood--were never taught/never asked TO THINK about--in grammar school or high school. Of course, would there were similar (but deeper) books for the teen-aged set."},{"rating":"2","title":"An encouragement and a joy, for both children and adults","review":"This is a very simple children's book I remember from my childhood. It's an amusing and heartwarming story of a monk who tried to do his best and seemed to mess everything up (but didn't, really). The story will warm the hearts of adults as well as amuse children. The artwork is also wonderful."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],R={key:0},B={key:1};function M(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",R,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(N,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-ec498db5"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/9.md","filePath":"glossary/9.md"}'),H={name:"glossary/9.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
