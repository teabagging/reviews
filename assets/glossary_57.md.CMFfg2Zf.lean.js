This book has so much info that I feel it is not a one time read but rather a reference book. Many terms are clearly defined and many situations in the market are clearly explained. For the first time in my life, I understand how basic options work. There is far too much for me to cover in a review. If you want to learn about the stock market, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Money Investing in an insane world","review":"Took me from a novice investor to understanding the game. Thank you Jim Cramer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent and difficult to read","review":"On one page he says your first loss is your best loss. Yet on another page he tells people not to sell in a panic. He detests the buy and hold strategy. Yet he claims to be a bottom fisher. Stocks that hit bottom take a while to come back. Profiting from them requires a buy and hold strategy. The writing is difficult to read. The entire book is crammed with weird stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Real Money","review":"There is no real money in this book. His suggestion of one hour per week per position will not produce what he describes as homework. The most disappointing thing is his shameless self-promotion. It feels even disgusting, when I visited those promoted websites, e.g. thestreet.com. I will not visit the sites any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book on investing","review":"Jim Crammers does a very poor job of backing up the investment ideas presented in his book. He expects you to do what he says just because he tells you too. If you are looking for a quality book on investing look at The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham."},{"rating":"2","title":"RULE 14 IS WHAT REALLY MATTERS FOR THE FUTURE","review":"Well, at least the book didn't give me a headache like the TV program. Lots of good advice, but Rule 14 is the one we should focus on. The average guy is not going to make any money in a correction that never stops - a depression, unless you know WHEN to get out! And this is what is on the cards in just a few years if even half of Arnold's THE GREAT BUST AHEAD comes true. Keep Rule 14 in mind while you read the scary summary on the book's website thegreatbustahead.com and find out when WHEN is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cramer infomercial without the applause track.","review":"I read this book twice in as many days to see if I wasn't missing something?

Still a must have in any home. Esp. for those w/ fingers crossed that things may change after the elections. Don't forget to vote for real; and for Cramer I vote five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guide from a man passionate about stocks","review":"If your not in love with the stock market it can be real tough, Jim is passionate about the market and reveals his winning ways and good insight into picking stocks. excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should you listen to Kramer?","review":"Anybody who thinks they know everything about the stock market should be avoided at all costs. Kramer is one of the world's biggest idiots. I am, unfortunately, the world's greater idiot for listening to him time and again... not believing exactly that he knew what he was talking about, but for believing that other people would follow his advice, resulting in a stock going up or down. I have lost many thousands of dollars taking his advice. He has far too much power for his limited intellect; and his bulldog rants move stocks for all the wrong reasons. In my humble opinion, Eliott Spitzer should investigate him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for basic advice, but don't listen to his picks","review":"This is an interesting book to learn basics of the market. However, Jim Cramer has lost me and others in my family a ton of money. On his show he recommended Cheasepeake Energy, Encana etc. We all bought many of his stocks and years later have lost our shirts. Therefore, I say buy low and sell high and looks at the fundamentals. I think Cramer is a phony. He recommends stocks then doesn't speak about them when they tank. Therefore, why doesn't he take the advice he gives in his book. Or doesn't it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cramer makes more money from his books than investment","review":"People say those who can't do, teach. Those who can't teach, entertain. That's what Cramer is, an entertainer. I bet you any dollar that he is making more money from his shows and his books than from his investments. He knows how difficult it is to make money from the stock market. And he knows it is much easier to make money from selling dreams to suckers. Cramer will make money whether the market is up or down as long as suckers continue to buy his books. That's why he is spending more time promoting his books than managing his investments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advice from the Forrest Gump of Investing","review":"Cramer's book is crammed with cliches, platitudes, and conventional wisdom. It's not as exciting as the TV show, where he gets to yell at you. That's what Cramer really exceeds at -- yelling advice at people who want to be yelled at."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful","review":"Easy read and clear cut concepts to approach sector rotation from a fundamental perspective. good beginner guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"short on actionable information, loooooong on e-g-o","review":"Much of this book is devoted to Cramer's endless pontificating and war storying about how much of a genius he supposedly was at doing this and that.I found little in the way of actionable, usable advice.Clearly the man is a stock picker and trader. He might be good it (where's the proof?) but he is unable to teach what he does.Rule 23 (his) is not to believe Wall Street hype but he engages in p-l-e-n-t-y."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated, not applicable in the real world","review":"I was hesitant to buy this book after seeing a bit of Cramer on TV and I should have trusted my instincts. While filled with egotistical statements and boasting, you will be able to use little of this in the real world.I've read and very much like Eric Tyson's Investing for Dummies and his Mind Over Money which helped me identify my bad habits - some of which Cramer's book actually encouraged! I also have liked Siegel and Malkiel's books on investing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much fluff","review":"I enjoy his show, but, like his show, this book has a lot of fluff in it. While he give some excellent advice, he takes page after page to get his point across. The first 6 chapters could be consolidated down to one easily. If you're looking for hard advice, not endless rambling, this book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets a lot of praise on TV...BUT","review":"For a book that is supposed to be informative and educational Jim does a good job covering a spectrum of trading. But while he tells you what to do, he seldom explains how to do it. One of the final critical chapters is quite confusing (to someone trying to understand the system) and incomplete.Overall, while there is helpful information to be gleaned from the book there is to much razzle-dazzle and glossing over difficult points to be an effectiver primer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Money renews interest in stocks","review":"I went into this book with some trepidation and cynism and came out feeling really relieved that it was not one of those with a lot of academic hype and tripe.

Sometimes Jim can be a little confusing on his shows but the book is a 1 on 1 where he explains everything there is to know about the stock market thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME MUST READ - TWICE","review":"This is the book that should be given to high school freshmen before they start earning and wasting money. This is an easy book to read and understand even if you don't like reading; I was at the end before I knew it and hearing Cramer's voice in my head the entire time. I read the first 100 pages on the first day! This book has given me the courage to invest with a realistic sense that I can be at least moderately successful and less worried about losing my shirt. THANK YOU CRAMER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Advice","review":"Jim has provided an easy read that covers the basic evaluation of stocks and guidence in setting up a portfolio regardless of networth. Great book for new investors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Cramer","review":"To me this was the most informational of Cramer's four book series although Stay Mad for Life is a close second. I enjoyed the different topics presented in the 10 chapters and found them to be very informational. As with all of Cramer's books he preaches homework which I do not think is something any level of investor should ignore. I also like how he establishes benchmarks for when you have enough to invest and what you need to do until you reach the $10,000 minimum. Chapter 6 is a very good one that has the 10 Commandments for Trading and 25 Investment Rules which are not bad to incorporate into you investment strategies. The chapter on spotting stock bottoms was entertaining and if anyone other than Cramer had written it I would approach it with skepticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"jim cramers real money","review":"Very informative easy for a novice to understand takes the fear out of investing and makes you want to get in the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest Your Money Elsewhere","review":"First, Jim honestly wants to help the average person realize their financial goals. He does give some good pointers as to how to better understand the stock market and how to be a better investor. I have several concepts, passages and pages highlighted for future reference.However, the problem with the book is two-fold. First, Jim wants to make us experts like him. He says, \\"this book is a distillation of everything I have learned.\\" I find it hard to believe that Jim can make us such savvy investors in this 286 page book. Secondly, Jim's writing style is annoying and frustrating. He writes like he talks, which makes for wordy sentences. Also he repeats himself, constantly. As a result, the book was not enjoyable to me. I had to fight to finish it.In all, you can get the same information elsewhere, probably with less frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read for entertainment - not info","review":"His first book \\"Confessions of a Street Addict\\" was thoughtful and interesting. This book reads almost like one of his TV shows. He \\"co-wrote\\" this one and it feels like he just sat down with his assistants and let it rip in his usual stream of consciousness style for a couple hours. The book seems hardly edited from that. Meaningless digressions , backtracking, repetition -- all left in here.If you're a fan of the show, you've heard ALL of this on the show (repeatedly). If you're not, you won't get anything from this book. I was hoping for a more coherent and deep window onto how Jim Cramer views the current markets. Not what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least His BOOK Is QUIET....","review":"Really, I figured what could it hurt to read & listen. Tried all his ideas, watched his picks on TV etc. Set up HIS ideal portfolios on my trading page where I trade stocks. After 2 years what are the results? Cramer's picks as well as Vectorvest picks got CREAMED compared to MY own idiotic attempts at making money long term as well as short term.So, do what you like, but if ever in San Diego & you want this book? You can have mine for FREE. Do however pay attention to his common sense \\"get out of debt\\" strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Basics","review":"This is a great book if you're a beginner in the world of stocks or if you just want to know the works behind the man himself - Jim Cramer. This book covers many of his stories while he was working at his hedge fund, both good and bad. Not only do you get the stories but he delivers the best beginner tips to set you off on the right direction. Essentially you can learn from his mistakes. The book is also written in a level that a 5th grader could understand. I gave it 4 stars because I felt some parts of the book were slightly drawn out or it didn't give enough information. I feel many of his ideas still stand true today. This is a great book to help change the way you play the game of stocks whether you're investing or trading. The bottom line: you definitely can learn so much from this man by taking the time to read and understand what he's trying to teach you. Understanding the concepts is the key."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Cramer's Real Money: Sane Investing in an Insane World","review":"This is a comprehensive guide to successful investing of the highest order for anyone who is willing to study it and judiciously apply the principles Cramer sets forth in the book.

If you enjoy watching Mad Money and the advice that Cramer gives on his show then you will like this book. A lot of the fundamentals are very basic, but if you've never been exposed to the stock market then it all can look very intimidating. Cramer helps take some of that intimidation away and shows you how simple many of the underlying concepts of the market really are. He also shows you how to approach certain situations when the fundamentals just don't seem to be working, which happens a lot more often in today's market. I highly recommend this book since it is a great perspective on how to take control of your own portfolio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad book, but do NOT buy the Kindle edition","review":"Not a bad book as an investment primer, but the most important piece of the book, a graph of Cramer's cyclical strategy for stocks is COMPLETELY ILLEGIBLE on the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service!","review":"Great service, great price and we received our purchase even sooner than the site estimated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but I am confused","review":"In this book, Cramer says that we must buy best of breed but on his television show, he recommends companies like CVS, second of breed. Also on his show, he tends to recommend stocks that are close to 52 week highs. I would prefer to buy stocks that are breaking out into a bull market cycle. Cramer is knowledgable about stocks and the market. The info in his book is basic, but insufficient for successful independent investing. I recommend it, along with Bulls Eye Investing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Read!","review":"This is excellent and worth the time! I finally found a book that gives real world information and not just a bunch of definitions we already know. Great for all levels of investors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self promotion","review":"This book gives not much other than Mr. Cramer's self-promotion. It is almost as bad as the TV program that I had once seen (Big Money). If someone tells you which stocks to buy and which to sell, you need to run away from that person as fast as possible. I suspect that he must have his own interest to promote some stocks. Usually his interest will be opposite to yours. When all the gullible followers are buying, he is quietly selling. There is nothing sane in Mr. Cramer's book. And yes, the world must be insane to have this book so high on the list of bestsellers. For some good rading I suggestIntelligent Investor: A Book of Practical Counsel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listening to a Wall Street Shill-Or how my money evaporated...","review":"Cramer is so embedded in the corrupt Wall Street system that he's pretty much giving advice that is counter to common sense. Beware folks! When common sense goes out the window, market crashes are looming on the horizon. Cramer was embedded in the Wall Street lunacy that produced derivatives that made billionaires out of the few and paupers out of millions. The one thing that history shows that Cramer's advice is good for is as a guide as to what not to do.He has tried at every turn to prop up the market and keep this shell game that we now have happening, going. It's like he was vested in the very system he was reporting on, covering his pals on Wall Street."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last I know what EPS means!","review":"Jim Kramer makes investing terms understandable for the ordinary person.

The story line and relationships were different then and I wasn't too keen on it. However, some changes were made so when the program came into the main stream, it flowed really nicely. I found it funny and light comedy would be my best way of describing it. They were believeable characters and the connection between them all was very good. Some of the episodes were a little off but not enough to have me turn off the tv. Near the end the episodes tend to get a bit empty and too dramatic and the comdey seems to go away. I look forward to the next season to see how it turns out. Not just the story line but to see if the humour picks back up or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow This From the Library","review":"Wow! I mistakenly bought this dvd believing that because I've enjoyed some of Tyler's movies this would be a great series. Boy was I wrong. The jokes aren't funny or believable. The acting is horrible, the token white character isn't funny. The little girl seems rude and not a cute spunky Rudy Huxtable or Raven. Even the laugh track is annoyingly unbelievable. If you can, rent this from the library for free just don't waste your money. The writing seems sloppy and lazy. Come on Tyler, don't take your audience for granted.

The songs are diverse for a big 80's hard rock band. The production value is poor however. This may be a deterant if you like a big, clean sound quality.....but the songs are strong enough to compensate if your a fan of the \\"White Lion\\" sound already. The price is steep, but if you like their style, then this a good one to get. The magic of a bands earliest material is rarely captured again.

Then, a magical time comes when you are at the zenith of both your talent and your vision, and you are blessed to be surrounded by people who can help you fully express them. It's too big for just one record. It takes three albums, and five years to unleash this creative bang. Shiny Beast, Doc At the Radar Station, and Ice Cream for Crow, are the three stars in Orion's belt. Each one is a masterpiece, and together they tower above all else.

To me though, its a logical progression from the two proceeding albums, Doc at the Radar Station and Shiny Beast.

This is definitely a record that will have the listener say, \\"I wonder what he would have done if he continued recording.\\" I suppose many answers are best left unsolved. This album, just like 'Doc at the Radar Station' before it, is a wonderful fusion between Beefheart's 'Trout Mask Replica' era and 'Shiny Beast' era, as best evidenced in songs such as the title track, the instrumental 'Semi Multi Colored Caucasian,' and 'Hey Garland, I Dig Your Tweed Coat.'

Needless to say neither the album nor the former acquaintance in question have been back since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun Album to Listen to!","review":"I'm alot younger then most of the reviewers, and let me say, I really liked this album! I randomly saw the lead single, \\"Still Rock N Roll\\" to me on VH1 Classic, and I wasn't too familiar with Billy Joel's transition into the pop realm. I thought it was very campy, but fun to listen to. I decided on purchasing the vinyl after I saw the very cool cover from the album. I finally got the chance to listen to this, and I really loved it. This is defiantly a Billy Joel album that's very upbeat and a little different from some of his bigger songs that I'm familiar with. I loved Still Rock N Roll To Me, Leyla, and Listening to the Television All Night Long. I wouldn't classify this album as to heavy, but its a great album! I would defiantly recommend this to any fan of pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Joel's Best Album","review":"This is one of my favorite CD's of all time and I wanted to let anyone who was considering buying it, to get it!

Or at least he wants us to believe it's his rock album. Some songs do rock out on this CD, like \\"You May Be Right\\", \\"Sometimes A Fantasy\\", \\"All For Leyna\\" (the CD's best track), and \\"Sleeping With The Television On\\". But others fail to live up to expectations, like \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\", \\"I Don't Want To Be Alone\\", and \\"You Were The One\\". However, most of \\"Glass Houses\\" proves to be one of Joel's best and most rewarding releases to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid rock'n'roll","review":"Post-Folk but pre-Uptown Girl resurgence (which track I loathe), this is an album with plenty of driving rock'n'roll beats and lots of fun.

I was surprised to see how easily he dealt with far darker themes, and as an adult I appreciate his wit even more.Not everything here is great, but the highlights are very special indeed.Roald twists things around but is never cruel to the reader or character; justice is usually served, often a la carte...When he's at his best, I'd rank Dahl up there with Saki and O'Henry for knowing how to stand a short story on its head. That's high praise!Very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Switch Bitch","review":"Four wickedly funny, sexy tales with patented Roald Dahl twist endings.

He demonstrates remarkable insights into the forces of the world of politics. It is odd that a man who had such a profound knowledge of the system and an understanding of how it can be tamed made such foolish errors in his own administration. The book, however, indicates that his legacy will be more than just the Watergate scandel, and more than the resignation of the presidency. Much like a lion tamer who one day loses control of his beast, so too Nixon lost the power over politics, but that does not repudiate his long career of dominating in the arena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictably, lacks perspective","review":"An autobiographical account is always a dicey proposition, and in order to succeed, the author requires a certain amount of objectivity, as well as superior writing skills. Unfortunately, this displays neither.I'm not here to bash Nixon politically, but I do have to say that the book comes off as extremely self-serving. Nixon's account of Nixon's life just doesn't come off as honest. I think that when he wrote it, he was still too entrenched in a persona that needed to take public opinion into account. The result is a lot of treacly, ponderous prose that comes off like the presidential equivalent of a Hallmark television special.The one saving grace of the book is that it gives us many little anecdotes that demonstrate the minutiae of the daily life of a President of the United States, and that is indeed interesting. But other than that, there's no reason to pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Espresso!","review":"I ordered this after it was recommended to me by my friend, a fellow coffee lover.

The instructions were a little iffy, but the pictures lead you well. I went w/some of the reviews on here and got espresso roast coffee, warmed up my milk and syrup and put this baby to the test.

Not much to go wrong with it, either, which is another difference between a stovetop expresso pot and the complicated electric versions. Its fantastic, not much else to be said except about size. The 3 cup size is small, go with a larger one if there are two or more coffee lovers in the household. Also, for the camping coffee connoisseur, this is a SMALL pot, it requires a little jiggling on a camp stove to arrange it so that the handle isn't over the flame and still is balanced and basically level and that is important! These also work beautifully on an electric stove."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"I'll join those who love this pot, and add some extra advice on use:While reading a ton of reviews while trying to decide which product to buy, I came across someone who gave the unusual advice of not assembling the pot until AFTER you add boiling water to the lower chamber. ~ Though a bit of a pain, this has turned out to be great sugggestion!1. Boil water in a separate pan or teakettle.2. Fill the part that holds the grounds with your espresso grind. DO NOT TAMP. Set aside in something that keeps it upright and easy to grab. (I put mine on top of a shot glass.)3. Pour the boiling (doesn't have to be a full boil) water into the base, assemble the pot (you WILL need a mitt-type potholder to hold the base, as it gets far to hot to hold immediately).4. Place over low/medium low - (30-40%) heat.5. Remove from heat as soon as the coffee begins to come out the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this pot!","review":"My daughter heard about these little pots and asked for one for her birthday in November.

You just put the water in the bottom, put espresso in the basket above it, screw it together and set it onthe hot stove.-The espresso has a good flavor and is not watery.What I dont'like (and why I gave it four stars)...-It takes longer than the espresso machine. Count on having it on the stove for about five minutes.-The directions were a little unclear. They say to put the stove on low. If you put it on low, it will never brew (at leastnot on my electric stove). Be aware of this.

First, the latch arrived with significant rust on it. Not sure if that affects anything other than asthetics but that sucks to see rust on a new item.As for functionality, I found that the straps would cause my body to swing during reverse crunches, especially if my legs are fully extended. I guess if you install it up against a wall it would solve that problem. However, I installed a pull-up bar in the garage away from the wall and I was hoping to use it with these ab straps.

They easily support your body weight, and they are as comfortable as could be expected for something that supports your weight on this part of your arms. My only complaint is that after a few months use, they still do not collapse when hanging, which makes them about 18 inches wide hanging on the bar.

Granted, the effects are ridiculous. The plot is ludicrous, and the action scenes are absurd. But the acting is, while low key, genuine. The plot is basic, but well paced. The actors didn't go nuts and over-act, they stayed within their roles and came off as real people walking through an absurd background situation. There is a sense of fun in almost every scene, and you can feel that the people making this put everything they had (though not a lot of money) into it.I'm a big fan of bad movies, I've survived everything from Troll 2 to Jesus Christ, Vampire Hunter.

On a good night, there is no player in the world who can match him. But for all of Guy's talent, unfortunately there are few studio recordings that document his genius. Producers have always wanted him either to sound old-fashioned (i.e., the '50s Chess Chicago Blues sound) or too modern (i.e., some abberation of Jimi or Clapton).Buddy was only produced properly one time: and the result is this album \\"Stone Crazy.\\" After several mediocre albums in the '60s and '70s, someone finally let Buddy play in the studio with the creative, reckless abandon that, when playing live, has ignited every building in which he has ever played.

The legs of the tripod twist and bend in every direction to help get a firm foundation for your camera to take a steady picture. All you do is screw your camera onto the base, and press the quick release button to easily slide your camera off the tripod without having to unscrew it.

It was not until the discovery of germs in the mid-1800s that the importance of cleanliness was recognized, and it wasn't until 1851 that the White House had a bathtub with running water.

The quality of the music and the video were superb. I was so excited to find the DVD of this same concert that I purchased it and anticipated reliving this wonderful show. Nothing could be further from the truth on this transfer to DVD. I'm surprised that David Bowie or HBO would allow such a poor quality DVD be released. It's a shame, because the concert performance is excellent, but the sound on this DVD is muddy and the video is blurred. I had purchased a used copy from the one of the Amazon sellers. The DVD actually froze up on me prior to the end of the DVD. I was so upset by then that I just threw it away. To their credit, the sellers have refunded my money anyway, although I do not now have the DVD to return. 5 stars to the used DVD seller, and one star to Amazon for selling such a cheap ripoff as this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"SERIOUS MOONLIGHT","review":"DOES ANYONE WHO CAN READ THIS KNOW WHERE OR IF THERE IS A DVD COPY OF THE MUSIC-VID VERSION OF JAZZIN FOR BLUEJEAN?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor audio and video quality","review":"I am about as big a David Bowie fan as anybody can realistically claim to be, but even I cannot muster much enjoyment from watching this DVD.True, several of the interpretations of songs on this disc are classic and highly worth hearing.

Here's the list of the songs that David performs....Look Back in Anger--Heroes--What in the World--Golden Years--Fashion--Let's Dance--Breaking Glass--Life on Mars?--Sorrow--Cat People--China Girl--Scary Monsters--Rebel Rebel--White Light, White Heat--Station to Station--Cracked Actor--Ashes to Ashes--Space Oddity--Young Americans--Fame.

Bowness still keeps growing as well with his beautiful words. I think Wilson and Bowness have no other compatible mates for making music, other than the Porcupine tree for SW and Henry fool for PB.At first listen I was taken by the beautiful trumpet of Ian Carr on the opening song.The rest of the album flows perfectly as a mamoth musical genius that pours out of your speakers and begs you to make birthday and holiday gifts for friends of this album.One of the best releases in 2002.anonymous\\"Every silver lining has a Touch of Grey\\"R.

I love Stop Falling. It is my FAVORITE SONG ON THE ENTIRE CD. Get it just for that song, but there are also my favorites Most Girls and Love Is Such A Crazy Thing. I never really liked There You Go, because it was too hip-hop for my tastes, but I love when Pink gets down, especially on Hell Wit Ya!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Albums I Owned","review":"This was a terrible waste of money.

She is a good performer and has a strong sultry voice. I am collecting her work in reverse order starting with \\"Try This\\" and finding the early albums great glimpses of what was to come later in her career. She is a strong person and will be around for a long time.Go Girl!

Should have thought about that before you F@@@ed with me) I love this girl's Honesty. That is what I like about Pink. She tells it to you like it is. Do what U do is also a good song.(Freak anyone else, Do what you want) So I gave this a 4 because Misunderstood is better but this c.d. is still GOOD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This entire disc is excellent and it proves that R&B/hip-hop newcomer Pink will have a bright, successful future! Whether you are a pop, R&B, hip-hop, soul or jazz lover, you will find at least a couple songs on this CD you will fall in love with. Me; I especially enjoy \\"Split Personality\\" because it's so insane and shows the real side of Pink. I also constantly listen to \\"Most Girls\\" because the song has a strong hook and bouncy beat, \\"Hiccup\\" because it's so catchy you'll never get that song out of your head and \\"Is It Love\\" because it may seem like a mushy, sugar-coated love song but instead talks about cursed love, losing one's virginity, hatrid and opening up. This is actually the first CD I've bought in a while that I listen to from beginning to end. Overall, if you enjoy the current explosion of R&B with a major pop flavor then you can definately get into Pink.

But when Pink opened at the NSync \\"No Strings Attached\\" concert, I got the urge to run out and buy the CD right away.

It was a family nickname from childhood. As a little girl, Pink was someone who would blush very easily- turning Pink. Production aside, this girl has something to say, and plenty of talent. Pink has a voice, a heart, and a brain. I've met her in person, and I've seen her perform live. She's going places. I can state the above with veracity, since I am related to someone who represents her business interests."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU TAKE HOME","review":"This CD has some catchy sounding songs and a strong vocalist. Unfortunately, like a party cake that is pretty to look at but dangerous to eat much of, it's filled from top to bottom with the kind of grief and discontent one rarely sees outside a therapy session. If the themes presented seem like fun then saying \\"CAN'T TAKE ME HOME\\" is easily the most merciful thing you're going to say to anyone. I listened to this thing while looking for a gift for a friend. I think giving a loaf of bread filled with gravel would be nicer--and a lot less damaging to digest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great","review":"Well if you listen to her new one, Missundaztood and then this, you'll find that this is boring compared to it. She stuck to 100% R&B songs, much in the same flavor as Destiny's child and Monica. It worked well but you'll never see her go back to such formulaic, standard stuff. Pink likes to shock people and blur stereotype lines, and she does so much of that on Missundaztood that it makes this one seem kinda... vanilla. But it's a delicious, tasty vanilla, an alternative to those who find the multi-textured and diverse rainbow sherbert flavor of her new album to be too different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms.Pink","review":"Pink is the best artist there is today. Britney Spears,and N'Sync need to get real and take a few lessons from Pink. Pink shows true individuality on and off stage. Listening to her songs make you want to curse out your boyfriend for all the nonsense he puts you through. Every time I listen to her music I get so hyped up I want to tell my man \\"I was in love wit'ya but the hell wit'ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right.\\" All I have to say is that Pink is someone that every girl should listen to because she will help boost up your self confidence and make you feel as if you are on top of the world. Pink is the best, and she is here to stay!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW it's amazing!","review":"This CD is awesome! Pink is an incredible song writer with an amazing voice! \\"Most girls\\" is my favorite, but the whole albums great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Disappointed","review":"I bought her album Misundaztood and was so upbeat about getting this album to go with it. What a disappointment! This album is very different with a very monotonous rap background music on almost every song. This album is not near as good, nor shows the talent of this entertainer that she demonstrated on other CD. If you like Rap music that is about the same in every song with just a change of words but with the same background, you might want to spend money on this album. Otherwise, buy Misundaztood, skip this one, and hope for better things on her next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Predictable","review":"This Disc is Very Boring.Pink has Leftover Toni Braxton Songs.She Sounds Like a 5th Member of Destinys Child.and that's not saying much.How Many Folks are Gonna Ride Timberland's Beats?

Her voice is great, it can sound hardcore and edgy on her fast songs (\\"There You Go\\", \\"Hiccup\\") and soulful and soft on her beautiful slow songs (\\"Stop Falling\\", \\"Let Me Let You Know\\"). The CD is filled with hyper, catchy hip-hop beats and silky smooth R&B melodies. My personal favorites are the #1 smash single \\"There You Go\\", \\"Hiccup\\", \\"You Make Me Sick\\", \\"Split Personality\\", \\"Let Me Let You Know\\" and \\"Private Show.\\" \\"Stop Falling\\" is also a very soft, beautiful ballad if you like those kind of songs. She really pours her heart out on it. With so much variety and personality put into her debut CD, Pink delivers big time! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This album is a declaration of independence and strength from a female artist. Unique yet wonderfull.

However, if you already know the basics of calculus and want to master the subject, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation","review":"This book is terrible and cannot be recommended. Many of the things it says are simply wrong, like the opening discussions of 'orders of minuteness'. This book gives a lot of disinformation in attempts to simplify difficult topics, when all that is needed of these topics are clear unthreatening explanations. It does not deserve the popularity it has received for the last century. For a much better book to help a struggling student of introductory calculus, I can to no end highly recommend How to Ace Calculus: The Streetwise Guide by Colin Adams, et al."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calculus From a Practical Point of View","review":"I like this book because I hate limits. From a strict mathematical point of view limits are standard for explaining calculus. But from a practical point of view (physicists, engineers, economists) the notion of the infinitesimal may be the most appropriate. It's worth noting that Thompson's degrees of smallness are an accurate reflection of the theory of nilpotent infinitesimals described in \\"A Primer of Infinitesimal Analysis\\". A combination of these two books might make for a great introduction to practical and alternative-theoretical calculus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Absolutely great book.

I purchased them after I lost my previous pair of TKO Fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems. I put on the Valeo straps and did one pull-up, and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in. My advice, this product is poorly made and cheap. A complete waste of money. Go with something better, and I would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric."},{"rating":"1","title":"One size doesn't fit all","review":"Maybe my wrists are small (~6 1/2\\" around), but the positioning of the padding on these straps prevents them from properly tightening around my wrist, so I can't really use them properly or comfortably.

It's difficult to get a good grip on heavy weight because of this. Also, the pad is too long so the strap can't be properly tightened around the bar because the loop hits on the pad.

There are some other good songs that should be on this album (even stuff with Gil Moore singing lead - like Fool For Your Love) but it's not in here.I'd recommend getting Just A Game, Allied Forces and Never Surrender instead of this album.

As it is, the handle must be held at all times or it pops off. Were it to fit INSIDE the holder, the tension would hold it in place until you wanted to release it. The depth of the basket cannot be adjusted for different thickenesses of meats/fish/veggies/etc. Locking mechanism to hold the basket together is awkward to release when the basket is hot. The nonstick finish is a plus. All in all, I will continue to use my old broken down basket that has an adjustable lid, handles that stay put until I want to remove them and a lid which is very easy to remove when it is hot from the grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ya Azim/ Ya Majid","review":"Here is Mevlana.

We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth.

There is a greater maturity in the work than before; Lentz has learned to use dialogue effectively and with good wit, especially with the difficult dialect and idiom of places as diametrically opposed as Bayou Cajun country and Boston, Massachusetts are. His capture of local colour really washes well; I thoroughly like the story line, but even moreso the underlying, gurgling innuendo and hidden asides. The setting in New Orleans works really well too, and moves the book along."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshingly different","review":"I was in search of a novel set in New Orleans and was pleasantly suprised to find that David Lentz (a personal favorite of mine) had wrtitten this gem.

I have to bend the box back by hand (which is way too easy to do) to get the door to close. I come home most days to find my mailbox open, full of snow, and my mail wet. The previous similar box it replaced (vandalized) did not have this problem. The box would probably be ok in a non-snow region.The mailbox arrives slightly damaged in its cardboard box -- the door handle is riveted on, and in any shipping (I bought mine at a hardware store), it gets squashed flat against the door as there is nothing in the package to protect it.I am replacing the box with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely overrated","review":"Rarely do I end up buying junk with all the researching I do prior to making a purchase, but this time I got duked.

If there's any kind of warping or anything, it's not going to close properly. I can generally get anything like this to work properly but this thing is just a pile of junk.

The acting was really bad, and while there were some scenes which were graphic, for the most part it just came across as stupid. What was probably most upsetting is that you don't feel any connection/sympathy toward any of the characters, which made Hanger very hard to sit through. Very boring, unfortunately.

Another section of road shown as dirt has been paved for years. I had planned to take another road shown as paved but was told by locals that it was not paved and only suitable for SUV's and pickups.

It made for a lot of fun and laughs. I suggest anyone that would like to do ab workouts to try this inexpensive wheel and see how well it truly works. It not only gave them something to do but was fun as well as physical. My son now has a great six pack going, and enjoys showing off his flat hard stomach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best tool for the job","review":"I got it today. Its a real hassle to assemble, I was very persistent and managed to put it together in a concentrated effort. It actually may be impossible for some users to assemble.The rubber tubes providing hand support and hold the central wheels in place are very difficult to put on. Also the central wheels are a little shaky since there is nothing really to hold them in place and their base is not very wide. This is a very strange design choice. I have seen other products that worked much better.Other then that it seems to be working ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"ab wheel","review":"i wouldnt waste your money it was a pain putting it togeather and it fell apart fast you want abs do sit ups cause this product wont help"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"You want core strength?

The wheel is also very small, and it gives little to no support of your upper body weight, and its very hard to maneuver.I bought it, rolled it once, and threw it in the closet so it could just collect dust.Its just entirely too difficult and the only \\"gain\\" in this workout is some sore knees and some back pain.

This wheel works very well and gives you a challening work out. As with all work out equipment, follow the instructions carefully to prevent injury.I was a little worried after reading other people's reviews that it would be difficult to put the handles on, but I had no problem with this. The company must have listend to your comments and added extra lube to make the handle grips go on smoothly.Over all, I find this to be a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valeo Ab wheel","review":"this worked pretty well the first time I used it. And it was nearly impossible to put the rubber grips onto the handle. BUT I figured that if you coat the metal in some vaseline, it slides right on and will eventually stay after a few hours. The key is to put a LITTLE cream or else it wont dry and keep sliding off. GOOD PRODUCT THO jus learn how to use it cuz u can strain ur back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Demon!","review":"everyone is right, it's very difficult to put together, and really may be impossible. My solution; Pam! I attempted to put the grips on and it wasnt working until I sprayed it with Pam. Then it went on pretty good.Otherwise, it's working great, i've lost about 8 lbs in a week and a half from it, I've changed my eating habits a little bit, but ot a lot. I still drink coke and 151 every night, and have snacks. i just added salad to dinners, which we bar-b-que, and drink more water during the day. The first time i used it i was sore for days, probably because i did it for 15 minutes. You should only do it for like 3-5 a day.well i hope this was helpful!i reccommend it, just used Pam, and dont do it too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Product","review":"Solid little product that works your abs, shoulders and lats. It allows you to strengthen muscles that you would not normally get to with free weights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality, Safety Hazard","review":"I purchased one of these Valeo ab wheels about a year ago. The third time I let my workout partner use it it, she fell and the spokes snapped apart, because the two wheels broke they each curved and my partner fell on her face. The quality of the plastic material the spokes of the wheels are made of could most definately be improved. My partner is a fit woman and only weighs about 130 pounds if that. I was shoked to see the condition of the wheels after she fell. I recently purchased a higher quality wheel with a solid center wheel and it has been wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It actually works","review":"I was skeptical of this, as I am of all exercise equipment. I didn't think such a simple thing could be so effective, but I figured it was cheap enough to give it a try. Now, let me be clear that I already had a flat stomach, so I don't know how well it works if you're out of shape. However, in my 20s, I had a six pack, but as I aged (I'm now 40), a thin layer of fat formed over it and made it smooth. I missed having that muscle definition so tried using this. You can really feel your abs working and getting sore. After just a few weeks of using the wheel once a day for 2 sets of 10-15 reps, I can already see and feel the difference. I'm starting to get back subtle ripples that I couldn't see before. The layer of fat is still there, and it will probably be hard to get rid of, but the muscle underneath is really developing. I can also feel that my abs are rock hard when I flex them. They were hard before but not like this. Just 5-10 minutes a day is all it takes to get results."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after light use","review":"Very thin plastic, I weigh 185 pounds and mine broke after about 30 , 1 minute, light-duty uses.

Perfect to keep in the corner and an incredible work out, forget the ab roller this is intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"Very easy to put together, and supports a fair amount of weight. Con: handles not cushioned so not the most ergonomic ab wheel out there but gets the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and disappointing","review":"Fairly cheap construction. At 6'2\\" and 230lbs the wheel did support my weight just fine, but you can just feel how cheap this product is. Thin aluminum axle, cheap plastic-y grips, wheel is too thin and provides almost no stability. I could barely use this product.It would have been nice if specific attention had been called to properly assembling the unit, as I didn't get the grips lined up perfectly and they're practically impossible to adjust once you've put them on.Skip this product, there are wayyyy better options for a good ab workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get the hang of it","review":"According to the instructions, this product can be used to tone the abs. There are several videos on the internet showing fitness instructors demonstrating how to use the wheel. I never could get coordinated enough to use it. I'm not saying it doesn't work. Just that I was not able to push and pull it as smoothly as it is advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure about this","review":"Looks like it might work but I need to have someone watch me for the proper form.

If u do get to roll back up and down like ur doing a push up then good for u, most likely u will get some abs, once again its not for begginers, u have to be trained to work this.

The product should sell for approx <$5 at most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ab exercise product ever!","review":"Amazon should remove this product from their listing. This is by far the worst exercise product I've ever purchased. What you see is really what you get. Quite literally, it is a red wheel with handles.

It is hard to do I will admit but once you get the hang of it it is a really good workout and you really feel the burn afterwards. Not to mention that it is not expensive and the shipping was fast and I have no negative feedback what so ever this item is very good!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for people who are not already in decent shape","review":"I bought this product because i want to get in shape.

The exercise also targets the triceps and shoulders. I would recommend this product for anyone who wants a good home workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as advertised","review":"the ab-wheel is very light and can feel very \\"plasticky\\" but it totally gets the job done. For the price (< $10), it's totally worth it. Best of all, you get the work out you want with it... a few reps and you immediately feel the ab core burn. However, i always feel that i'm not using this device correctly because i keep suspecting my posture. Having an experienced gym coach watch over you a couple of times to get the right form would go a long way to ensure you don't injure yourself and keep getting a good work out.assembly and use instructions were lucid and helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works but good form is a must","review":"This Ab wheel does work, but I want to emphasize that you must use good form. I found it helpful to press my feet up against the wall to help steady myself as I pushed out with my arms. Don't try to go too far out when first beginning to use the Ab wheel. It does require some patience as you get your flow. What I like about this Ab wheel is you don't have put anything together - no handle coverings. My boyfriend loves it and he has a six pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy ab wheel that really works your core","review":"I've been training regularly for 10 years and the ab wheel is still one of my favorite ab exercises.This wheel is sturdy and the two wheels make it more stable than similar products with only one. The bar in the middle is metal, so it won't bend or break.In case you're wondering how to correctly use this device, here's how: Kneel on the floor and put each hand on a handle. Slowly roll away from your knees in a straight line. Keep your head straight and don't arch your back--keep it straight too. Once you've rolled out as far as you can (this may only be a few feet if you're new to this exercise), reverse the motion and come back to your starting position. As you get better, you'll be able to roll further and further, until you can touch the floor with your stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Espected","review":"At first I was skeptical because It Look cheap but when you feel the plastic is not cheap , is actually well made and it was a good addition to my abs routine, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"good adition to my ab routine","review":"i know theres some people whining saying the handles are hard to put on. its common sense to put a little soap on the handles if its hard to get them on. i didnt think it was i didnt use any soap and i had them on in 3 minutes. theres also people whining saying the grip is rough on your hands. again common sense to put gloves on if its that bad. i dont think its bad i never use gloves with this.this is pretty new to me, ive used it for 2 weeks now. i use it in adition to ab loops that hang from a pullup bar. it takes strong abs and good pushup form before you should start using this. ive been doing 2 sets of 10 and i would do anymore than that. 2x10 works a fit person hard enough. ive noticed this is the key to getting definition down the middle of your abs. good product and really sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, so-so instructions","review":"As at least one other reviewer has said, if you push the handles on all the way then the wheel will sit snuggly between the handles (as in the product image) and will not wobble.My only gripe is that the instructions aren't that helpful. Assuming that this guy knows what he's talking about (and he sure seems to) then this video is the best introduction on how to use the ab wheel...[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but effective","review":"I've only had this a day but let me say that the simpler it is the less likely something will go wrong. There is some assembly required and you don't need any power tool or anything. The two wheels are separate, the metal bar is separate and the hand grips are separate. Take the metal bar and place it threw the holes of the two wheels. Then take the hand grips and slide them over the metal bars. Make sure the hand grips are both facing the same direction other wise you will have a hard time adjusting them later. That's pretty much it. Tried it out for 5 minutes and my stomach is sore. Easy and effective workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper quality leaves to be desired","review":"Like other reviewers, I noticed the smudges left on the page after erasing just once (I use 2B pencils for light marking). I ended up printing some staffs on laser printer quality paper using the same spacing and voila! Now if the manufacturer was willing to fix this issue by using higher quality paper instead of the cheapest recycled material, I wouldn't have to go through the trouble. The other alternative is to buy higher quality medium: Rhodia and Clairefontaine come to mind if you can find those here, the latter brand being somewhat more affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps an all time Triumph best","review":"Quite a Triumph fan I am, and was back in the day, and think that Thunder Seven was one of their strongest compilations, although I do strongly feel each composition they have created is well worth the time spent listening for 80s rockers and musicians alike.

Then I happened to be shopping for my baby shower stuff at babies R us and found this pattern and fell in love with it. This bedding excelled in quality, style, and price.

The fabric is high quality and it's sewn very well. There are different textures within the fabrics- like denim, a fuzzy cotton, plaid, different thicknesses of other fabrics. These textures along with the perfect combinations of colors really make this collection special. Light green, light blue and off white are the main colors, however the denim and some of the thicker stiching is dark blue, there is some red gingham and red stiching... mixing all of these allows you to add depth to decorating the rest of the room.The sheets are high thread count and wash well.There is also toddler bedding that goes with this set- it grows with your baby boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Everything About It!!!","review":"I love everything about this bedding set.

In ten (10) concise chapters the reader is presented with an equal number of practical lessons that are applicable to leaders (or potential leaders) within most any type of organization. Starting with an examination of the fundamental core values that drive President Bush, the authors develop a useful guide that is loaded with practical \\"real world\\" examples and references. I personally found the chapter on Intuitive Wisdom to be very useful and thought provoking.This book also serves as a powerful and timely corrective to much of the partisan nonsense that has been published in recent years regarding President Bush's capabilities.

We love your music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Song is a Hit","review":"Everywhere We Go is perhaps Kenny Chesney's most complete work to date, in my opinion its his best cd yet. Each of the 11 songs are hits in their own right. What I Need To Do is a great ballad which didnt do too well on the charts, but its a great song you will love. How Forever Feels is that fun summer time song that you know and love. You Had Me From Hello was the big hit of this album, one of his best ballads to date. Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me is a lovers plea, a very beautiful song once again showcasing his romantic side (like on You Had Me From Hello and many of his songs). Life is Good is a good song to listen to when you are feeling down. Everywhere We Go is another romantic song you will love. She Thinks My Tracktor's Sexy is a fun song to sing along with and dance, definately a standout on the album. Other mentionable tracks include the duet with Randy Travis titled Baptism, and the honest A Woman Knows. This is a must have you wont regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel this album needs help. Better music and some passion","review":"This album seems to be lost. It seems to be a shot in the dark. It has no place to go. It wants to be fun, its not. It wants to be romantic, its not. It is just there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pre-Coconut Kenny album!","review":"I have been a country music fan for about 10 years. I just got this album about a month ago...not because I didn't like Kenny till now, but because I already had his greatest hits album, which I think over half of these songs appear on. I figured the good songs from this album had to be on hits...and the rest were probably duds that never made the radio. Let me tell you...what a gem!! Everyone has heard the great hits \\"She Thinks My tractor's sexy\\" and \\"How Forever Feels\\". But I think the songs on this album that didn't make the 'hits' were just as good as the hit songs were! I LOVE \\"Life is Good\\", \\"California\\", \\"Everywhere we Go\\" and \\"I might get over You\\"...great album!! Even though these songs are 10 years old, I feel like I just found some brand new music from Kenny that I really love!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of the Year","review":"This is one of the best cds of the year. Kenny is great from the serious ballads like \\"California\\" and \\"Baptism\\" to the fun songs like \\"How Forever Feels\\" and the fan favorite, \\"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\\". Kenny has a well balanced album that never gets old no matter how many times you listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEART & SOUL","review":"KENNY CHESNEY has put out the best CD in his collection. From the beginning of the CD until the end, he has put everything into it...Heart & Soul that is. Kenny Chesney is such a bright Artist and performs with as mush enthusiasm as in the CD (Everywhere We Go).....GOD BLESS...KENNY CHESNEY as he is on TOP of Country Music, and deserves to be there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Release from Kenny Chesney!!!!","review":"This CD is one of the best country CD's I have ever listened too. Every song on this CD is great. The songs they play on the radio arent the only ones that are good. Thats one reason why I like kenny's music so much. He puts his full effort into every song he makes. This CD is a lot like Shania Twain's \\"The Woman in Me.\\" Both CD's have a good mix of fun songs with love songs. But its the fun songs I like the best. Not many artists..ie Tim McGraw or Alan Jackson would make songs like \\"She think's my tractor's sexy\\" or \\"how forever feels.\\" Kenny is a unique artist. I hope he gaines the attention he deserves soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Effort","review":"\\"You Had Me From Hello\\" is got to be one of the most enjoyable country songs I have heard. My overall rating reflects how much I like this one song. The rest of the album is fairly average with the exception of \\"How Forever Feels\\" and \\"Baptism.\\" I would like to hear more variability and emotion in the artist's voice; however, he does nothing particularly wrong. I hope he takes his performance to a higher level on his next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is how a country artist should sound!","review":"Kenny has done it again.he has a smooth sound,not a twangy sound.his lyrics are great,he is right on the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD stinks!","review":"I really enjoyed the song's \\"How Forever Feels\\" and \\"You Had Me From Hello\\" so I decided to get it. I'm sorry I did. This CD is really quite gross. From the spotlight on just \\"Baptism\\" to the sick suggestions of \\"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\\", I don't like this one. I am sorry I bought this Cd and through it and his music videos I have discovered that he has just about no moral sense at all. This is a definite no buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW","review":"I'm really surprised what people will keep buying. This album seems less like real music from the heart and more like a fill in the blanks. \\"You Had From Hello\\" is one of the most boring musical pieces I've heard in a long time. I cringe when I hear it on the radio and hide in shame when I realize that I bought the CD. The only solace I can find is in my Robbie Fulks CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"She thinks my \\"What\\" is sexy?","review":"I am very disappointed in an artist who has to stoop to vulgarity to get ratings. Particularly country singers. First of all when I first heard this song, I thought it was a joke. The words are particularly stupid. The tune is repetitious and boring. But when I saw the video, I was embarrased at the vulgar gestures at the end. The sexual overtones was not necessary to completely ruin the song. Does anyone else out there agree? GAC told me that \\"No one else had complained.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Tvaneste","review":"I still don't know how to pronounce the bandname, but I can define their work; excellent! The guitar and drum work are excellent, the symphonic element adds grandeur and power, dominating and crushing weakness in today's black metal scene. The atheistic lyrics are intelligently written, but the extreme vocals are dry heaving, while still good, need work.The Intro and 'Under The Black Raven's Wings' track leads and violates, eventually leading into elevating madness. \\"Birth of the Hero\\" is an anthem to evil, \\"Fire In Our Hearts\\" and \\"Godless Freedom\\" are mesmerizing. \\"Storm\\" intrigues and opens eyes with psychotic themes, and \\"Tears\\" closes the opus with majesty and honor.This album is comparable in sound to Dimmu Borgir's \\"Puritannical Euphoric Misanthropia\\" and Arcturus' \\"La Masquerade Infernale\\", but with more captivating song structures and more operatic themes.An album for any avant-garde black metal fan! Brilliant from start to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very misled!","review":"I dont do a lot of reviews, but first off, i buy a lot of compilations to get a feel for some stuff i may otherwise hear, and thats how i heard the song under the black ravens wings. i thought wow, this is pretty good, a little different than other black metal that i was hearing, so i found the cd and bought it. big mistake. the only song i could stomach through, was the one on the compilation. the rest was not good, and im being nice here, i dont like to bash someones music. i still listen to black raven sometimes, but i got rid of the cd pretty quick. i advise to listen to all the songs and then buy what you like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough","review":"The unit is very good for low budget. I use this on a gretch maple kit. The response is very good in the low frequency 63-120. I have to fight to get that snap on the high end. A little compression does the trick. Still effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sounding mic","review":"After our bass drum mic in our kit broke I wanted to find something else so we could continue recording. I decided on this one after reading the awesome reviews. I must say this mic has exceeded my expectations. Straight out of the box I was able to get a great bass drum sound. I seriously had to do no EQ modifications. It also sounds really good when I mic the bass amp with it. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Value","review":"This microphone is perfect if you are looking for your low end punch and don't want to spend high end bucks to get it. As said before, it may take a little tweeking the EQ to get it where you like it but is that not expected? Cheap Cheap Cheap and was delivered two days earlier than expected. Great sound for a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"total ripoff","review":"This product (it's not a book, not even a pamphlet, just a fold-up card with a lot of empty space) doesn't have the rules of girls' lacrosse, or basic game strategy, or anything else worthwhile for coaching lacrosse.

It's not a howto book, or a physics book, but an amazing list of composers and their ifluences, from Schubert, back in the 19th century, to Karlheinz Stockhausen, developing new composition paradigms for future composers.Beyond that, the book reviews various tools and methods develped and used throughout the 20th century and makes the basic concepts of contemporary tools clear.I recommend this book to every composer who would like to get aquainted with the great (although few) electronic composers of the past, their works and their working methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that i'm going to build a ship.","review":"I really liked the actual construction techniques demonstrated in the book.

The contributers are the leaders in the field and this well referenced and thought out book is certainly a must for people who are involved in diving research and development.The reason for only 4 out of 5 is that the book is probably too technical for the average person you need a reasonably good background in both physiology and hyperbaric medicine to get a true benefit from this book.Otherwise a seminal text in the field"},{"rating":"2","title":"They work okay for me.","review":"I take these (3) just before a workout so I don't catabolyse my muscles and just after a workout (5-8 pills) to recover and lower my cortisol. I drink a little green tea with them before the workout, to help them go down easier. Sometimes my stomach is just a little upset for a minute or two, after I've taken them, but it goes away fast. I'm used to them now, and I would miss them if I didn't have them. I take a protein drink after my workout with them, and there is no upset stomach at all. I've read that these BCAA's are very good for you, and I go with that. Again, they're not a miracle pill, but with everything else I do, they have their place and I think they're working well for me. I have a subscription through amazon, so it lowers the price. I'm pleased with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treat Your Best Family Member!","review":"Well, I've never tasted them. But my dogs love them, and pretty much everything else this company sells. Its also nice to know that the ingredients are the same quality that is sold for humans to eat, and the people who started the company really care about pets. Now if I want to eat some chocolate chip cookies and my dogs are watching and begging, I have something healthy and tasty to give them instead of trying to explain how I can't share because chocolate isn't good for them. They thought I just didnt want to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dog Loved Them","review":"I bought a container of these cookies for my mother-in-law. I figured they would be a healthy snack for her to munch on. She can't eat foods with salt, sugar, animal fat, artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives. The problem is that the carob chips really don't taste like chocolate. She put a plate of Carob Woofers next to the other desserts at our last family reunion, but nobody ate them except her dog. In her opinion, there are other brands of treats available with chocolate chips that taste much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"madonna is cool","review":"The original version is very cool and her voice is fresh and naked here without any effects on her voice.

Great CD, and Sasha is awesome!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna does it again!","review":"This song is a must have. Once again Madonna takes us there with this really groovy 60ish style song.

This year, she's going dèjá vu all over again. Hope you know what I'm talking about because she, Michael Jackson, Jennifer López, and Ricky Martin are praised way too damn much for their throwing off of their clothes just to be the most popular stunts in history while decent people like Céline Dion, Phil Collins, and Andrea Bocelli get treated like s**t. She can't sing. She must go. No offense to you fans who don't care. I'm just expressing my opinions.Goodbye for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will she ever learn to sing?","review":"It's a sad thing that we have let her get where she is when obviously she is totally overrated. She can't hit the simplest note and her lyrics are dull and stupid. She owes her success to her sexuality and the controverses she has created because it is evident that someone on his right mind would recognize that madonna as a singer is a good exhibitionist (if you get what I mean)/ As for the song: aren't this the vocals of a 6 year old girl?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bar none, the best Madonna dance song in years.","review":"I heard the radio version of \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" and liked it. I didn't want to buy the soundtrack to \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me,\\" so when I saw a CD remix single of \\"Beautiful Stranger,\\" I got it. The extended remix (Track 2) is the best Madonna dance song remix she's put out in years, and I think one of the best dance songs to come out generally. Track 3, the European radio version, puts the US radio version (Track 1) to shame -- it's much more hypnotic in the mix and sounds and gets you moving immediately. All in all, an unbelievably infectious dance song that for me puts Madonna back at the top of the heap. \\"Ray of Light\\" was the beginning of her comeback (not that she was ever really gone, but this is the Madonna I like to hear), and \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" is the promise of things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly enjoyable import!","review":"This one's a good buy, particularly if you're either a. a Madge fan or b. didn't want to buy the \\"Spy Who Shagged Me\\" soundtrack.

Good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the BEAUTIFUL STRANGER - Madonna","review":"Yeah! Madonna has done it again.

I have listened to other recordings of the Ceremony of Carols, but the Texas Boys Choir version reduces me to tears.

Nathaniel was virtually free of suspense: most of the scenarios that Saul tosses at us are suspense of the cliffhanger variety. That is to say that although there is suspense by virtue of the situation, the reader more or less expects the outcome of each and every situation. This applies to all elements comprising the conclusion as well. It simply isn't a very good book where the story is concerned. But, in order to balance out the review, the writing skill must be mentioned. John Saul can, in short, tell an unenthralling story incredibly well. The details are drawn out to the very last strand of hair, the pace of the story varies incredibly well and, most importantly, Saul keeps a consistent third person tone. Unheard of! If only the story had been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mess","review":"Nathaniel is one of the worst horror books I've ever read. The plot is great. The execution is terrible. Michael Hall is an annoying kid, and since he's the main character, the one we are suppose to fear for and identify with that'a flaw. He's supposed to be a preteen but reacts and behaves like a little boy. The womenfolk in this book are all ineffectual victims. There's suo much oddness and death in this town it's ludicrous that the cops and a possee of social workers don't make an appearance. The single most interesting character, including Nathaniel is Amos the grim grandfather who was not above killing to fulfill his vision of how things ought to be and he's one of the bad guys. This book was an all around dissappointment that has put me off Sual's books for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nathaniel","review":"Nathaniel was good Ghost storie. Like Anne Rice.

Orwell's talent amazes me in this classic about (on the surface) animals taking over the farm they live on.

It is simple to read, doesnt mix too many words and describes a worker's revolution gone wrong or right (depends on which stakeholder you ask this question to).The theme is comparable to communism, labour movements, etc. It is amazing how George Orwell has been able to see the future in 1946 itself and highlight the ills of communism, it you take that comparison.It is very illuminating to see how towards the end communism practices capitalism, trade, etc .. just like how the few surviving governments based on that model are doing :-)The choice of animals, dialogues, etc are very well written. All in all, I cannot recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Farm","review":"This is a good and entertaining book. I loved it.

The story centre's around several animals living in a farm yard, each of whom represents a certain socio-political aspect of society. For example, Napoleon the pig (ironic use of his name!) represents despot dictatorship, Boxer and Clover, the horses, represent the manual, unthinking \\"mass\\" needed by the dictator to physicalise the desired tyranical society, and so on. Orwell effectively structures his social microcosm in such a way that the danger of the dictated government are released in their full desperate and miserable potential, which in turn expands the political awareness of the reader. His decision to use anthropomorphism grounds the story, not relating it to any specific human codes of time or structure. In all, a completely chilling, yet absolutley necessary allegory we must not ignore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Farm","review":"animal farm was a decent book i mean i would probably recomend it to some people but not ot all it gets boring at times but all and all it is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Get the love","review":"First off, I didnt like this book at all, it was very depressing, very repetitive and told me nothing i didnt already know.I dont Get this book at all, nor do i get why so many love it, its just a depressing tale of corrupt people who get off on power trips while the masses are too dumb to do anything about it.

It tells the story of the Russian revolution (1917) and its aftermath through George Orwell's Trotskij-stained glasses. The analogies are so easy to notice that I, personally, got tired of reading the book after just a few pages. But the book isn't entirely crappy. It can be used as great entertainment for kids. Because however involuntarily amusing it is in this wrapping, the Russian revolution definitely was action-packed. You can also choose to read the book without considering the historical framework. When that is done the book gains a lot and actually ends up seeming quite cute.George Orwell is a great writer and he surely had great reasons for writing \\"Animal Farm\\". It can be read as an introduction to some of his other work.

The result of it may turn out very horrible and cruel.

The pigs snowball(trotskee) and napoeleon (stalin) run the overtaking, soon after they harvest nothing happens. Then trouble stirs, napoeleon has his bodyguards(4 dogs) remove snowball from the farm.Napoeleon goes bad and kills many animals on the farm for working with snowball in killing napoeleon.

This book was written by a insane man named George Orwell, who hated society, and displayed that by bashing humanity, and making people look like lower lifeforms than animals. He used pigs to potray govermnent officials (which isn't a bad choice if you ask me), horses for hard working people, dogs as SS troops, etc...

However the lasting impression is its excellent satire of comtemporary society in Russia under Stalin, and this has obviously made it a favourite for American high school indoctrination. It is not really a satire on other Communist societies and Marxist philosophy in general, but more a chilling criticism of the betrayal of idealism in Russia by 1945 with implicit references to Stalinism throughout the book. But whether you appreciate the political side of it or are looking for a great story it is either way an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly argued, but one minor flaw","review":"Animal Farm is a perfectly argued description of how revolutions decay and are corrupted. The pigs (the Russian Communist Party)gradually and logically become worse than the inefficient old oppressors. The flaw I see is that Orwell was still seeing Communism as a \\"revolution betrayed\\", not as something unavoidably and intrinsicly wrong and doomed - as I think T.S. Eliot said, it is almost as if Orwell believed the problem might have been solved by more public-spirited pigs. But despite this criticism, Animal Farm is not only a great book, written in a perfect and limpid style, but essential reading for understanding our world and the history of the Twentieth Century, as well as a timeless warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Awesome!","review":"Animal Farm turned what was one of the most significant events in this century and put it into a story even a 5th grader could understand while maintaining every bit of historical integrity.

The book was short, it was funny, and it gave insight into a complicated topic.Using an animal farm as the backdrop, Orwell shows the Communist Uprising and its way toward decline.

On the surface you may think it is just as the title suggests, a book about animals who take over a farm from their humans. However, if you look deeply, you will see that it is much more. Allegory upon allegory is subtley thrust at you, some I got, some only after my teacher explained things furthur for us. I read this years ago and still remember everything.

When I told my parents to buy it for me, I was surprised to see how short it was. I finished it in only two days Some argue that the book ends with pessimistic view. I say who cares? George Orwell was writing about how he feels about things in his time and decided to write this book based on that. It talks about how people take advantage of thier power (in this case the pigs). It's a short book that wont leave you unsatisfied and is kind of a moral type story. Now go read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding book that loudly states the hardships faced!","review":"A well written story about a farm taken over by animals. On the previously farm, Manor Farm, the animals felt that they are overworked, underfed, and treated unfairly. When the animals take over the farm and rename it Animal farm idealism takes over. A dream of a paradise of progress, justice, and equality for all was answered when animals acheive their dream. A well written fairy-tale story that deals with totalitarianism that is embraced on the newly developed Animal Farm. When the communism farm makes a drastic change to dictatorship the animals are forced to face with reality. This is an excellent written book, and is great for anyone interested in a book based on history.

The story is very good and it compelled me to read more about Orwell, Stalin and socialism. It does a very good job at describing how socialism can start out very noble and pure but how it inevitably ends up with corrupt, power hungry, hypocritical leaders. I read that Orwell himself was a socialist so I believe his intent was to confine the story to just Stalin. However, I interpreted the story as a condemnation of all socialism. A look at the societies in the world that practice it confirms that the wealth, affluence and power belong to the political class and not the working people. All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for animal lovers!","review":"Something the revolution brings forth new types of crooks.

This book is not difficult to read and even though Soviet Communism is not the threat it was at the time this book came out, as a historical work this book remains a worthwhile read. In fact, this book helps show how such a dysfunctional system was destined to fail! It is to Orwell's credit that he is able to evoke such empathy from his readers for farm animals. He succeeds in doing so. Sometimes an anology can highlight truths that a straightforward journalistic approach cannot. This is an interesting little book that will not require much time commitment to complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't read it","review":"OK, I shouldn't have rated it as I didn't read it but it was just not interesting to me as other events overtook the desire to read this book.

The characters and plot were well thought out, and were defined mostly by the communist take over of Russia. The representation of major players from the revolution was good for the most part, but was missing some major players. There were however some very memorable moments in this book. One particular one is when the windmill is destroyed. Overall the end result is that it is worth the price to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Farm: A Wierd Book","review":"In this book, Old Major puts the idea of rebellion into the animal's heads.

Napoleon fights Snowball and chases him out of the farm. But the pigs start to treat the other animals badly. The pigs make the other animals do all of the work. Then the pigs start to break the seven commandments. At the end of the book the pigs start using the ways of the humans, which is the thing they said they would never do in the beginning.

However because the storyline was so insanely bizarre in and of itself, it became impossible for the reader to tell when the events of the novel had an underlying message and when they didn't. It was easy to pick up, and the anctics of the animals made it a book that the reader wanted to finish, but Orwell's subtly expressed views of totalitarianism were totally overshadowed and ignored as the reader incessantly wonders, \\" Am I missing something here?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically great; Realistically no","review":"I found that reading Animal Farm was extremely boring.

The story of animals taking over the human race, talking, working and acting like humans crossed the line betweem ingenius and ridiculous. I see how Orwell tried to express his message across about how human civilization could be taken over, but he didn\`t express it very well in this over-rate and downright silly book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Farm was very eventful!!

Tyrants ban this book, and you can immediately see why. Tyranny survives on falsehood and deception. But literature such as this can pierce the truth better than sober historical scholarship. This exposes history's tyrants to be just what they are: coldblooded cynical liars. This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book I Recently Read","review":"This book takes place somewhere in a farm in England. The book starts with all the animals meeting together in one big barn called by Major, an old pig who tries to pass on his will to the rest of the animals (since he knew that he was going to die from age), telling them to dislike mankind. What makes this a four star book is the human characteristics and ideas(tactics) of each animal. Such lines like,\\"The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man agin\\" seems to be some kind of theme on humans. I personally like this book for its level of English and its nonfictional presence."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it was excellent!","review":"I have enjoyed this book very much. At first I really expected it to one of those fairy tail stories for younger kids, so I didn't really expect to like it very much. In fact the only reason that I decided to read this book is because it looked like it would be easy to read. I found out very quickly that it is very easy to read and comprehend. It is also very interesting. Your imagination can run wild while you are reading this book if you'll let it. George Orwell, in my opinion, is an absolutely wonderful writer. He shows exactly what he is feeling in his heart in a way that is very easy to understand, for people of all ages. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a book that will let you use your imagination, and help you to think like a kid again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bolsheviks are pigs","review":"Although he is very obviously anti-Stalinistic, Orwell doesn't mind voicing his own opinion on behalf of socialist reform. However, he brings readers to the realistic realization that even in a \\"classless\\" non-material society, the able intellectuals who crave power will take it.

(All credit for this review must be given to the honorable leader, comrade Napoleon)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Farm by George Orwell","review":"Animal Farm by George Orwell is a powerful testimony of how absolute power corrupts absolutely.The plot with the farm animals revolt to create the perfect society of their own.

Orwell's thoughts, shaped by his own personal experiences and surroundings, are evident is this piece. The horrors of a totalitarian regime areclear in the book. With the abundance of articulate symbolism and the convincing message, Animal Farm is a must read for all teen or older readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is good. Read it!","review":"Animal Farm is a very interesting book about how a group of animals rebel against their owner. The animals of Manor Farm believe they are being mistreated and would be better off if they ran the farm themselves. They successfully chase the humans off the farm. Over time the pigs become the leaders and grow obsessed with power and control. From that point in the story, the government of Animal Farm goes downhill. In the end, the animals are no better off than they were when the humans ran the farm.Animal Farm is an excellent book. It is sort of strange but there is always something going on which keeps the reader interested. I highly recommend this book for school reading, because there are so many different events and character personalities. It is easy to form opinions and come up with ideas for writing topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book i hope you read it.","review":"This novel is an excellent quick read that pokes at socialism and dictatorship. After the rebellion against farmer Jones all the animals thought they would have a better life. \\"All animals are equal\\" was the slogan the animals believed in until Napoleon the evil pig took over and led a harsh dictatorship. By the finial chapter the slogan was \\"all animals are equal, but some are more equal then others,\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to Animal Farm","review":"This is a great book. Very short and easy to read but makes you think about the past, present, and future. The US reminds me of an animal farm. They had a revolution, said we are going to be a free nation and not pay taxes. Now it seems we have less freedoms every year and pay more in taxes than when Mr Jones ran the shop. Seems a bit sad and hopeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"This was a really intriguing book, especially as it is so relevant to current societies. Well written, of course; I was thoroughly engaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"The typing in this book was wayyyy to small. You need a magnifying glass to read it! Don't buy it a total waste of money...I wish I would've read the reviews first!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This should not be sold as a book. It is totally unreadable because the font size is so small. Was it a mistake at the printing factory? They should be ashamed to sell it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"somtimes it's hard to follow","review":"i'm in eighth grade and reading this book.

This book shouldn't even be offered on Amazon. Am returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microscopic print!","review":"The font size used for this book is totally unacceptable. I printed out a sample line of text on my laser printer, and the font size in this book is smaller than Cambria 6. It is at most a 5, if not a 4. It never occurred to me to read user reviews on this book, because reviews generally focus on the content of the book. I know what Animal Farm is about. If I had checked the reviews, though, I would have seen the review by another customer who also rated this at 1 star because of the small print size."},{"rating":"1","title":"The print is so small it's unreadable - Do not buy","review":"The font size in this book must be 5 or 6. I have 20/20 vision and it is difficult to read, actually hurts after a few pages. I have no idea why someone would pring a book with such a small font.Do NOT buy this version of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature as a means of understanding history.......","review":"I believe that good literature can often provide a deeper understanding of the implications of history and political/philosophical ideas....Animal Farm is an easy to read fable which quickly conveys how the most well intentioned ideas can be turned into a means of social slavery in the hands of the wrong people (as they say,'absolute power corrupts absolutely')who coddle and finally coerce gullible followers.....a lesson on the vital importance of real democracy and the need for literacy at every level of society.So read the book, and save your hide. You'll understand that line....after you read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Animal Farm. It was very well written and the author, George Orwell did an excellent job with his complex plot. Animal Farm is not really about animals. Although all the characters are all animals, the underlying theme is a goverment's descent into Communism and totaltarian dictatorship.This story begins with the animals of Manor Farm overthrowing their cruel master and creating their own form of government. At the begining, all is fine and dandy until strange things begin to happen. The pigs, who are in charge of the barnyard government, slowly begin to twist the rules and the truth for their own benefit. Strange disappearances and executions lead up to the ending of this thought provoking book.I highly recommend Animal Farm. It's fast moving plot and underlying themes pulled me in until the last page. Its graphic images and an intense storyline are not for young readers. However, for anyone interested in politics it would be an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"This short book gives an insightful look into the harsh realities of communism through the entertaining metaphorical use of farm animals. This classic still has political relevance today, despite the lack of a Soviet power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Political Review","review":"I really enjoyed the book 'Animal Farm' by George Orwell. One reason I liked it is because of how Orwell uses animals to show the Russian revolution. Another reason is because he predicts the fall of the Soviet Union and how it failed. A third reason is because I like Orwell as a writer.The best part of the book is when Napolean the pig kicks snowball out of the farm and when they take over the Farm.The characters were the best story element in this book. They were well developed and were amazingly like their real life counter parts. Overall Animal farm may be the best thing Orwell ever wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live The Pigs!","review":"If you have a thing for democracy, you will enjoy George Orwells Animal Farm. Animal Farm is set on an English farm named Manor Farm, owned by Mr. Jones. The fable-like story concerns the rebellion of the farm animals, and is told entirely from their point of view. Though the book is filled with many different types of leadership;Kingship, Tyranny, Aristocracy, Oligarchy, Polity, and an overall Democracy. This book can teach you many lessons.The pigs as well as the other animals get tired of listening to Mr. Jones so they take it upon themselves to do as they please.Though quite scary to think that animals could actually take over anything but don't be alarmed, it's just a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Farm","review":"This novel was extremely interesting; the concept of animals overthrowing humans and later mocking them is extraordinary. Also, the relation between the test and historical events adds a lot. This was one of the best books I have ever read. I recommend this book to anyone! The characters are pefect aswell as the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"governmental animals","review":"I believe this to be an interesting book, but some of the allegory has lost its way. It is some what over symbolized, yet it still has a good story. I prefer 1984 to animal farm but I believe Orwell is a great author of political views but I restate that it is a little over done and the communism and all but that is my opinion But it is still a great novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mano a mano between Orwell and Steadman","review":"This is the best edition you're ever gonna get of the great Orwell classic. Not only the illustrations are superb, it includes an essay, by Orwell, about the freedom of the press which is truly a masterpiece amid today's abundance of intolerant politically-correct nonsense.And, take my word as a professional cartoonist for 25 years, RALPH STEADMAN IS GOD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I rate it as one of the top 2 books I have EVER read.","review":"This book is a MUST for every political science major to every psychology major in our universities. I have read this book once a year for the last 12 years and it still astounds me at the depth of the writing. This book is wonderful on so many different plains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational book that shows the rise of communism.","review":"I have recently read this book for my English class. George Orwell with the use of barn yard animals reveals the ruthlessness and control of the communist government in his own era. The book is very easy to follow and is very insightful"},{"rating":"2","title":"a superior satire, burlesque, prime parody","review":"Eric Blair (His assumed alias being naturally \\"George Orwell\\") evinces the immanent, imminent, intrinsic, exigent, and indeed ineluctable demise demonstrated by this true failed, yet wonderfully accomplished revolution (in fact a cyclical concept) in which the liberating pigs, who lead to free a farm of animals from their human oppressors, inevitably take the place of humans as a fascist oligarchy. An interesting book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinated story ...","review":"Animal Farm - a really fastidious and exciting book on which you can put yourself very good into the various characters. It was very pleasant to read. Especially the expiration of the Russian Revolution of 1905/06 was very good described. Once more our historical knowledge was tested and the speeches of the animals sounded very realistic, just as their doing was described with a breath of Reality. I normally dislike english books but this one fascinated me with its well-written story and the connections with the communism."},{"rating":"2","title":"All animals are equal; but some animals are more equal than others.","review":"Good book, very fast & easy read (you can finish in about two days.)In short: A book about animals living on a farm who can talk, and overthrow the farm owner because they view man as evil. They form a government where all animals are equal but soon after pigs take a leadership role. The animals under the pigs are completely naive and oblivious as the constitution of the government is pejoratively changed and stricter and stricter rules are enforced. As years pass, the pigs become more and more like humans and, by the end, pig and man are indistinguishable if not worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, not my favorite.","review":"Animal Farm is a pretty good book. Though it's meant to be a childrens book, it's still a little hard. My English class had to read it in the 9th grade, and after reading each chapter we talked about it and did projects on it. I found the whole time (about 3 weeks!) of reading this short book to be incredibly boring. I think though that if you read it in just a few sittings you will probably enjoy it more than I did. It's a lot like Charlotte's Web, and as I was reading Animal Farm, I discovered that E.B. White basically copied Animal Farm in writing Charlotte's Web. If you're a fan of Charlotte's WEb or just an animal and book fan in general, you will probably like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"This was a required reading book in 7th grade. Everyone groaned about it but I enjoyed it. The book was made less enjoyable beacuse we had to diessect every characters emotion and there every move.It's just such a great idea to take such a seroius issue and act it out with farm animals. The pig Snowball, is evil, like Stalin. It is a great satire. we watched the movie in class after reading the book. It was terrible. Animal ends bleakly and is very sad. The movie stars a dog of very little importance in the book. The movie ended reasonably happily as well. The deep meanings are completely lost in it.The book is a profound read. You may need to know who the animal characters represent according to their real life counter parts.Full of treachorous plotting, back stabbing, and intruige it was a memorable book if not quite a bit depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking...","review":"You may find it hard to believe that an English major never read Animal Farm. Yet, here I am. The book, while targeting \\"bad guys\\" long since gone, remains salient in a time when people are concerned about losing certain freedoms. It's a quick read (can be read in one sitting) and very thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book but a Little Hard To Follow","review":"This is a wonderful book that can be looked at in two ways: allegorical or as a barn-yard story. I, because I was only 13 when I read it, saw it as just a story, yet it still entertained me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Farm","review":"I think this book is good for peolpe who like Geagraphy,because it talks about an history.people who like geagraphy would like this book because it talk about that caminiseum and it also fun for people who like geagraphy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect story","review":"Animal Farm is a terrific book. I have read it in lessons and I think it is very readable. After I had begun reading, it drew me into excommunication. Orwell's examinations of the essence and the development of communism could not be presented more appropriately. He describes historical persons as animals and intends to copy events of the Russian Revolution in 1905/06.There are also serious political thoughts linked in a great story which is nevertheless entertaining to read, in my opinion.After all I think that it is worth to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A parable of the revolution ...","review":"Like the first books of Gulliver's Travels, where Swift's pointed satire on English-French rivalry have been lost in the striking idea of tiny people and giant people, so this allegory of the 'dictatorship of the proletariat' has quite lost its political point against the power of the story. The equation of pigs with the Bolsheviks, the pig Napoleon with Stalin and Snowball with Trotsky is ultimately quite unnecessary to enjoyment of the story - exactly like 'Gulliver's Travels'. Yet the point was not lost on the people of the 1940s, nor on the oppressed people of Eastern Europe and Russia, who read the book in secret. Nor was the point lost on fellow-travellers in the West who made Orwell struggle to have it published. This is the only English book (along with 1984) guaranteed to have been read by every Russian dissident. That in itself is a monument to Orwell. This book will last as long as Swift's, possibly longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny animal story","review":"A concise, palatable explication of how communism \\"evolves\\" (?) into totalitarianism. It entertains as it instructs and manages to evoke a sense of genuine anger against the oppressors that a drier treatment would not achieve."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Little Piggy Went To The Soviet Union","review":"This is a classic book and a must read for anyone who is interested in history or politics. In his work, Orwell talks about the life of a group of animals on a farm who decide to overthrow their master. After overthrowing they planned to start a new government which at first is based on the animals being represented equally. As the book goes along however one can see how certain animals abuse their power.This is a great book for many reasons but mainly because it is easy to read and understand the links Orwell is making to communism. Animal Farm is a great story and Orwell does a great job developing characters in such a short time. Do yourself a favor and give it a look"},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Farm","review":"I enjoyed reading Animal Farm very much. I found it amusing how pigs (of all animals) could rise above the rest to become dictators. George Orwell did a fantastic job in linking the pigs to communism. My favorite character in the book was Boxer, the horse. He was such a good guy (horse) that after the glue factory incident I lost all my respect for Napoleon, Squealer and the rest of the christmas hams.Since I finished the book I have not looked at any animal- tame or wild- in the same way. I was supposed to help my grandpa slaughter cows, but I just couldn't after what they did yo me favorite horse, Boxer. I have treated all animals with the utmost respect, with the exception of pigs. I have noticed that the ruthlessness of the pigs in the book, are not far off from reality. The pigs often ram each other created swelling in the belly.All in all, I tip my hat to George Orwell for his excellent job in writing this book for all the world to experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Farm","review":"Despite the way it's often talked about, Animal Farm unfortunately does not live up to it's praise. What could have been a very moving story comes off as being dry, flat, and ultimately forgettable. While the message behind the book is a valid one, I found myself feeling like I was reading the Reader's Digest version of the book when I read it. Orwell seems to give a fact-by-fact summary of the book which makes it extremely difficult to feel connected with the story, much less the characters. One really should feel something towards the characters - whether it be admiration or disgust, but I found after reading it I did not feel much of anything towards the lot of them. All in all, it seems that Orwell is simply trying to get his point across rather than actually telling a story. One's better off reading a history book, because that's basically all Animal Farm focuses on - which is unfortunate, because this could have been a really interesting and moving story, and it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Farm","review":"This book is a classic so ovbiously it is a good one. The thing is there are a lot of metaphores inside this story. As the story goes on I kind of got confused to what was going on. The animals make some \\"Animal Commandments\\" which I thought were pretty funny. It is very interesting to me how the animals all of the sudden become smart enough and decide to rebel from the humans. They later realize that it is hard to live without the humans but it is really possible if all of the animals work together.All in All it was an alright book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Farm-\\"What a Lousy Book\\"","review":"This book was about a farm called Animal Farm. The animals can all talk and they don't like to be pushed around by the humans. Because of this they turn on the humans and drive them away from the farm. Then the pigs take charge, and make up rules for the farm. These rules are called the seven commandments. One of them is Four Legs Good, Two Legs Bad. The whole farm follows these rules. The reason I rated this book so poorly was because it was boring. It took me days to finish even though it is a short book. If you like books with very little action but, a good theme then you might like this book. But if not, I don't suggest it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON''T READ THIS BOOK!","review":"This was the most wrose book that i have ever read.

So this book was realy boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!!","review":"For all of you out there that see this book as a classic, I'm sorry, but it was the most incoherent gibberish I have ever read in my life. I was forced to read it for an english class, and I found it nearly impossible to finish. It drags on and I don't think it sets a good example. It deters people from standing up for their rights, making it seem like revolution always ends in failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Scary - DO NOT READ!","review":"Seriously, this book is way too scary! I gave it to my 10-year-old to read and he was scared because of all the totalitarianism LOL! DO NOT READ!UPDATE: My 10-year-old was not, in fact, scared by this book. He was provoked by its critique of totalitarianism, however, as evidenced by several subsequent late-night conversations about Orwell's political and humanistic beliefs, and the nature of freedom.I thought my original review's sarcasm was easily detectable, that it would be clear that I meant to say something more along the lines of, \\"Every kid read this book because it is an accessible tuning fork by which they can learn about the dangers of totalitarianism.\\" I figured the \\"LOL! DO NOT READ!\\" would put a fine enough point on that sarcasm. Reading the comments, I can see I misjudged. Hope this update clears things up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snitch for Brit. Intel. s diatribe on russian revolution","review":"This is george orwells take on the russian revolution that tells lies and myths after another. I would suggest that others read historical tracts to reveal Orwells obivious bias and work for the british ruling class. He maligns the great achievements of the working class in the soviet union to animalism, also how human can change and create a better society. Eventhough the SU had its imperections and finally in the 1950s returned to capitalism(which they called socialism)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT go to the Animal Farm unless you have no choice!","review":"Unfortunately, this book was assigned for English class last year and I hated it!

So, if you are reading this book for English class or are about to, good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER RATED!!","review":"This book is, without a doubt, the most over rated \\"classic\\" I have ever read. It's not like there are multiple themes and ideas up for discussion here. The book has one point that it beats to death over and over again. Why anybody would ever need Cliffs notes to figure out what the book is about is beyond me. If you read the first 20 pages, you already know how the book is going to end. What, you mean the pigs gave themselves even MORE power? Shocking! I never saw that one coming! Save your energy for a book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be wasting you time!","review":"This book sucks so bad I couldn't even get through it. I quit reading it before chapter three. I would not recommend this book to anyone you will waste your time and in the end or whenever you throw it away you'll be asking yourself who would write a book with talking animals?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty [bad]!","review":"I didn't like this book at all! I don't care if it was supposed to symbolize history with the Russian Revolution plot but Orwell could've certainly done better to show this historical conflict in a professional and non-fiction type manner than having barn animals fight and kill each other. I wish everyone in this book died cause I didn't care one bit about any of the characters! Orwell didn't make this novel interesting and it seems like a first grader could read this book and like it because everyone at that age thinks that animals fighting is fun. However, I had to read this book in high school and why would I care about this ridiculous nonsense anymore? How dumb did Orwell think I was! I don't get why this book was even published! I advise you not to read this book you will certainly waste your time unless if you're into the silly plots that would never exist in the 21st century"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice work","review":"Animal Farm is a interesting-written book. Although i had to read it for school, as a homework, I partly enjoyed it. U can learn a lot about the russian revolution, if u look at the things, the animal do, a little bit closer. U always have to keep in mind that the actions, which happen, are based on a true story. If u read it really sober, it effects on u as a book 4 kids. But if u read it attentive and look on the background of the actions, u can connect the plod to the russian revolution and learn a lot about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different ways of looking at people, and problems.","review":"It was good because The animals showed real life situations, and different ways of dealing with it. I liked the book because, the animals had the own views, opinions and beliefs. The only reason I didn't like the book is we had to read it for school, and it really isn't going to help me grow in my education, the only history behond it is the Russian Revolution, so why don't we get to the pt. and read a book about the Russian Revolution? Instead of reading the book about animals. Otherwise, it thought it was ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books this century","review":"In Animal Farm, Orwell illustrates that the \\"classless\\" \\"utopian\\" society that marxist communism attempts to setup is unacheivable.

In my Language Arts class, at Shenandoah Middle School, we read George Orwell's book, Animal Farm. I think this book was very interesting. The animals on the farm are rebelling against their farmer, Mr. Jones. He is always drunk and never feeds the animals, so they are always hungry. They wound up kicking him off the farm and rebelling all of mankind because of their type of government-communism/dictatorship.

The book begins with an old boar named Major who inspires the rest of the farm animals to rebel against the farmer. Then Major dies and and the animals rebel.

George Orwell's Animal Farm is a satire of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. The animals revolt against the humans resulting in their short-lived freedom. For the pigs become the rulers, and become tyrants themselves. Napoleon's cruelty to Boxer represents the proletariat under Stalin. Throught the story, Orwell remonstrates against governments, especially those that are totalitarian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Farm By: Meagan Frye","review":"Animal Farm, a very intriguing novel by George Orwell, is one that I highly suggest to anyone who wants to read such a meaningful book. In an essence, it represents our world in the early 1940's, when World War II was in full swing. In this book, animals represent different human charcters and different characteristics people exhibit through their actions of war and tyranny. Napoleon, the pig that overthrew Snowball, symbolizes a dictator and represents a sort of dictatorship, like Adolf Hitler. Napoleon has a way, like Hitler, to brainwash his people to think he is the best. This book really got my wheels turning. This is an outstanding book for anyone who chooses to read it, so why are you waiting? Go read it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Accurate description of politicians .","review":"George Orwell did an excellent job in the way he depicted human behavior during the Russian Revolution and the behaviors of the character in Animal Farm. This was a simple and short book, that was one of the reasons I chose to read it. But after the first page, it's like you can put it down until you've read every page. The characters in the book were not unlike many politicians I have read and known about. For example, Napoleon, the pig, represented Stalin and the way he ran Russian during the revolution. This a great book and deserves to be read by anyone that can read. It's a masterpiece in disguise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small","review":"I don't know if there were warnings about this, but if so I missed them (so they were hidden). We were shocked when we opened the package, as the book was tiny. It was about 1/8\\" thick in TOTAL, with all the pages inside written in about 2-point font. We just wanted a normal size copy of the book for our son's school project. Instead, he had to suffer through an entire novel's worth of squinting. And, now we don't \\"really\\" have a copy of this classic. Very surprising and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was plain and simply boring!","review":"Those animals were very stupid.

Fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!!","review":"When I picked this book up for the first time my dad told me briefly what it was about.

The farmer is ousted off the property. From the initial communal society, a tyrant ruling class arises (the pigs).Very insightful and more than a little distressing. A fitting allegory to Russian dictatorships or (I'm sad to say) even the US congress or white house in many regards (which has evolved from servant to ruler status).Orwell's book seems like a concept and idea which should have been thought of and written by other authors in even earlier times. It remains timeless.Not as good as \\"1984\\", but important and worth the quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been there, seen that","review":"I came from a communist country, so the first few chapters of this book gave me good laughs --- because it describes the communist mentality so accurately --- until the story gets too serious to laugh about. There are so many to relate to: We used to sing \\"beasts of England\\"; we are constantly afraid that other farmers will come; Boxer was my role model in my teenage years,etc. I found myself keep fliping to the back cover of this book because I simply couldn't believe this book was written in 1946! And the same story repeated itself for another 50 years! This book is not just about USSR, it is a short history for every communist country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standing Ovation","review":"You don't need a thirteen year old reader to tell you that this book is a masterpiece.Orwell's imaginative and creative mind is well displayed in this brilliant novel portraying modern government and human characteristics.

The simple tale of communism, and takes place on a farm is a captivating story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for all Middle Schoolers!","review":"I read this excellent book, and wanted to read it again. It shows how people (in this case, animals) change during time, and how we need to pay more attention to the animals we love. George Orwell gives a world made of animals who want away from the world of man and their slavery. I think that George Orwell is a wonderful author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and interesting.","review":"This is a fantastic allusion for why you should be skeptical, if not mistrusting, of those who claim to act in your best interest and infringe on your freedoms for the sake of a greater freedom. Through almost absurd metaphors Orwell shows how the road to tyranny begins with unbridled trust and unchecked power.There are a number of great quotes and series of events that are memorable and will make you think. It's a very easy read: short and simply written - so regardless of your reading level, you should not have a problem reading this at a manageable pace and following the story line mostly with ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could this be literary perfection?","review":"What defines a good book? How about fluid writing style, a gripping plot, great social commentary, great action, superb dialogue, interesting and dynamic characters, a well presented environment? Well, most books, even my favorites, don't encompass all these qualities. I've finally found a book that does.Knowing nothing about this book, I wanted to start this small classic and finish up in a few days. Less than two hours later I wrapped this book up with my mouth wide open. I could not believe how good a book could be.Basically this book captures the flaws of communism and capitalism in a fantastic fairy tale about one farm rebellion and it's aftermath. It works as a great story, it works as a mirror to modern society, and it works as representation of the Soviet Union. Pardon the cliché, but it works on all levels.Basically, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Farm Review","review":"For my reading class I chose to read Animal Farm. The book is about a group of farm animals who take over Farm and over throw Jones the trayant farmer. Led by the pigs, the animals shun humanity and begin their own way of life. However, in time the pigs begin to obtain a power trip. They seem to establish a true dictatorship and as time goes on they become more like the race that they so despise.George Orwell sends a very clear message in this book. The message is that power brings out the pigs in us. This book is very true for almost any society today. Animal Farm is a very enjoyable, easy read. If you are looking for a book with a Deep meaning than Animal Farm is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are right wing, prepare for a left turn. . .","review":"This is classic Orwell, and a wonderful read!

The man gets some of the animals to help hem on the deal.But the animals won't let that hapen.There is many dramatic moves in the story.I hope you enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four legs good, TWO legs BAD!","review":"This was a very powerful book.... It is able to be connected with real life so well that it was kinda scary. An important thing to realize about this book is that when Orwell calls it a \\"Fairy Tale,\\" it is just that. I read this book for a summer reading project and I am having trouble catching the symbolism and other devices in the story. Beside that flaw I really enjoyed it. It is fun to go from an in-depth novel to a quick fairy tale. A real good summer read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Farm is a book that everyone ought to read!!!","review":"I was simply enthralled when I picked up a copy of George Orwell's Animal Farm. It was impossible to put down until I had read through it. Even though I read the book 3 weeks ago, I am living it every moment. I can not seem to keep my mind off it. I am in awe of the way Orwell can tell a tale on a simple level of literature, a satire on the russian government, and a guide to much deeper things... life's truths. Every person ought to read this book sometime in their life, preferably at an early age. In fact, they should read it the moment they become literate. Before that, they should hear it from someone else's mouth. If this isn't enough to convey my thoughts to you, let me continue. The pages of animal farm should wallpaper every reputable building. Due to time and space constraints, I must stop. If you only take one thing out of this review, let it be these 3 words. Read Animal Farm.

There are really two stories going on simultaneously in this book: that of the pigs taking over Animal Farm from the inside, and that of Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin - each of whom is represented by a particular pig in the story.

Already at the beginning you decided which animals you liked and which you had something against. When laws began mysteriously changing, and things started to become unfair, that's when you knew something was wrong. I would definitely recommend anyone too read it, because anyone who reads it will see the story differently from other people, so everyone can enjoy it. It&#65533;s very well written, and I will definately read it again when I get older, especially since I live on a farm."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's righteous","review":"Animal Farm is a OK book. I like snowball most because he was good to his animals. He is powerless to help any animal on the farm. Snowball had a good mind but he had no heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont care","review":"The book \\"Animal Farm\\" by George Orwell, was a great book. The book was about a farm that was taken over by the animals. When the animals take over they decide to keep it under control. The only problem is that it just like before only instead of the owner (Mr.Joans) it's the two young pigs napoleon and snowball. Another problem is napoleon and snowball are agents each other cause snowball wants the farm to be a democracy and napoleon wanted it to be a communism. This book shows great symbolism with animals and forms of government. It shows totalitarianism, communism, democracy, and anarchy. I think this is a good book for guys that are interested in destruction and action."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was TERRIBLE!","review":"When I was in 7th grade, I chose Animal Farm as a book to read from a reccomended reading list. This was a big mistake. In the beginning of Animal Farm it is happy. Animals overcome their master and they rule the farm. It eventually goes downhill from there. Pigs take over and eventually change the animal \\"commandments\\" that they animals had created after taking over humans. Pigs end up looking and acting the same as humans. The pigs abuse horses and other helpless animals. This is one of the most depressing and disturbing books I have ever read. I found absolutely no enjoyment or insight from this novel! Take my advice: If you plan to read this anytime soon, please burn it as soon as possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my goodness----just... No","review":"I personally hated this book. I found it thouroughly boring it's tone was intolerqbly bleak and epressing--and poor Boxer! This book was such a bummer. I highly suggest AGAINST reading this book.

This is an anti goverment film but all I hear is Total arin ism which gets to be useful when instilled in the drinking water of places like Africa. Well we gave them animals to eat and they just turned them loose in fields and never fed them and they died. This book is co-written I think by Gore and Moore, but who knows I mean anymore you cannot figure out who is who, but I am Cathy and I escaped from Taurine and this is my review of Animal Farm.

What a terrible and unrealistic story. I mean, how can animals talk? I have a parrot that talks but not in complete sentences. And besides the pigs run the show in this and if it really happened the cats would run things because everyone knows that cats are born leaders. Anyway, I wouldn't reccomend this book to my worst enemy.

Ughhhh! It gives me a head ache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"This book consisely and thoroughly addresses how the ideal of communism was abandoned (as in Russia and the USSR) in favor of monopolization of power.

The pigs take most of the power themselves, believing they are the best administrators of government. Eventually the power corrupts them causing them to turn on their fellow animals, eliminating competitors through brainwashing and bloodshed.In \\"Animal Farm\\" George Orwell uses the farm to symbolize the communist system. Though the intention of overthrowing Mr. Jones isn't inherently evil itself, Napoleon's adoption of most of Jones' principles and mistreatment of animals proves that communism is just another form of inequality. Orwell intends to criticize the communist regime using symbolism. The farm represents Russia and the neighboring farms are Germany and England. The pigs represent Soviets and the other animals are workers. The Rebellion can be classified as the Russian Revolution and the whip symbolizes man's cruelty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!

It bothers me a little that the one star review of this book was written by a kid who was forced to read this book in 9th grade; however, I understand. No one is going to like a book they are forced to read, but in the larger picture of the human condition and the social order Orwell is as important as Shakespeare in terms of far reaching themes and ideas.

The entire spectrum of assorted characters, from the sly pigs to the simple-minded horses, from the visionary to the myopic, are beautifully delineated. The heart-tugging trials and fate of Boxer, and of the \\"lower\\" denizens of Animal Farm cause ache and haunt long after the story ends.Despite its predominantly grim theme, the descriptions of the mannerisms and the likes and habits of its various characters do not fail to bring a smile to one's face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Idyllic Farm or Socialist Nightmare?","review":"This is not Old MacDonald's farm, but an inspired allegory of socialism Stalin-style.

Animals banded together for absolute freedom and naturally disintegrated for the stupidity of the extreme ideal. Orwell cleverly presents different stages of communism through the ordeals of the Animal Farm. Story is fast moving, clear and satirically funny.

If Orwell is trying to make a point that animals should be controlling everything because they provide much of it, he has done a terrible job. The reason that humans control this world is because we are the only life-forms that can communicate universally, which is taken away in this novel. But, after knowing it is a very bad point, the book is very clever with vivid verbs and a great flow.

Obviously, it is symbolic of society falling apart under a corrupt government(Communism), and the author uses animals as the characters in order to compare them to humans behaving like animals. That is really all there is to it, and, as I said, the symbolism is very obvious. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what the author is trying to say becuase he spells it out for you. The story itself is boring, lifeless and dispassionate. The animal characters have no sense of unique identity. It is just another story created for someone to get on a soapbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chain is long and has emerged from history","review":"Shakespeare wrote. Tolstoy criticized Shakespeare.

Although it has earned a reputation of one of our (20eth) century's most accomplished novels, I felt that the \\"Animal Farm\\" is a consistently overrated work. George Orwell's often cynical tone made me want to defend my own worst enemy - communism. Not only did he exaggerate and misinterprit historical events, which surrounded the Russian Revolution, Orwell forced me to believe that he was indeed unfamiliar with the system, which was ultimately the world's savior from fascism, a regime far more fearful. A series of mocking allegories and failed personification is, in my view, nothing more, than political propaganda of Orwell's era."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world was that?!","review":"Animal Farm is the weirdest book I've ever read.

Animal Farm was one of those we were forced to read freshman year in high school. A lot of my friends were proud to have read 'Animal Farm, because they actually made it through an entire book. But this short novel resonates even deeper when read with the eyes of middle age. Although written about Communism in the 1940s, it's really a blueprint for the stages of all who are corrupted by power at the expense of others.

The extensive and vibrant symbolism is, in my opinion, one of the greatest assets this work has to offer. The academic setting in which I studied this novel helped to unravel much of the mystery surrounding the plot and make the important historical connections between the characters and events. As I have grown older I have come to a new and deeper appreciation of the book and would definitely recommend to classical literature and historical scholars as well as to anyone with a love of literary symbolism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling.","review":"Enough praise cannot be put on Animal Farm.

You have to trade to win, and they have to trade to win. Based on the chaos of the open commodities market, this game has been wildly popular with our family and friends for decades. The retro tin, bell and cards are a welcome touch. We just wish the cards were a bit more durable as the frenetic trading tends to wear them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great party game","review":"Pit is a terrific party game, but make no mistake... it WILL be loud. Between the players yelling themselves hoarse and the (re-introduced) bell, there is no part of this game that can be described as subdued. Parents prone to headaches should give Pit to their child/ren's playmates as gifts. *evil grin*I rate Pit as low in educational value because, well... because there is none. It's just loud, crazy fun!I rate Pit as average for durability because it is inevitable that some cards will get bent/ripped/etc at some point.

I have gotten a lot of friends and family members to read this book and all have been very moved by it in their own ways, relating to different character.

The final product (once we added a photo and the footprint) was very nice. We had a little trouble with the \\"clay\\" used for the footprint/handprint. Instructions say to knead the material until there are no bubbles. Easier said than done. The rolling pin included in the kit just made a mess (stuck to the dough). I would recommend planning on more than 48 hours drying time. Even with little to no humidity in the house, it took 3 days before the mold was completely dry.

I had bought the Discovery store versions in 2005 and 2008 and this appeared to be the same but was not. I noticed the clay was stuck to the foil pack but it felt fine when kneading. Then when I started to roll it the roller stuck to the clay. So then after finding another roller and getting it ready, I tried to imprint my baby's foot. What a mess!!!! It was all over her foot.

Well, not only is the wood chipped but the glass of the frame has a scratch. I am so disappointed. $30+ down the drain. And no Father's Day gift. I would rate it 0 stars if I could.

The finished product is so nice! It makes a wonderful gift that looks more expensive than it actually is. The background for the shadowbox is a very pretty sage green, which looks quite nice against the mahogany wood. The molding material is very easy to use--we actually rolled it out three times (we weren't satisfied with the first two footprints and just kept rolling it out and trying again). It looked just as fresh and clean on the third try! Don't bother trying to use the rolling pin--I have no idea why they include it, because it is useless (kept sticking to the material). We used a clean metal spray paint can, and it worked like a charm. I can't get over how lovely it looks once it's assembled!"},{"rating":"2","title":"keepsake frame","review":"This product was great.

I was really disappointed and sad that I could not make them at that special date. Contacted customer service by email (which I got from Amazon reviews) and they said they were sending me a replacement. A month later, nothing. I contacted them twice again and no response!

Because we put it up in a much used doorway, we need to put it up and take it down quite often. It has been extremely easy to do that with. My only complaint is how quickly the foam hand grips has disintegrated. that will certainly shorten the life of the product, though we plan to enjoy it while we can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pull-up bar","review":"This is a quality pull-up (or if you're into less intensity workouts chin-up) bar. The main annoyance is adjusting the hand pads--it's doable but quite difficult--and you probably won't want the one on the non extendable side so close to the door side. Installation of the nubs to hold it in the doorway is not as bad.Anyway once the prepretory work is done it's a quite good piece of equipment. I grab the pads for narrow stanced pull-ups, while I hold on to the bar outside the pads for the wide stance. The latter can be difficult to hold onto, but I'm definetly not going to shift the pads back and fourth just to do different kinds of pull-ups. I can now do as many as 17 pull-ups without stopping, five more than I could when I first bought the bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the off center hand grips?","review":"Pretty cool.

Easy to install, simple to use.It took about 5 minutes to install the bar. Feels solid. Grips are a bit difficult to move, but are movable to a desired location."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"This product seemed great when it came in, but then you realize it is a complete disaster.Yes, they are movable. But, as has been said before, it is a total pain. And if you do, like has been said, your grip will be all wrong as one side is smaller in diameter than the other. And if you don't move them you will crash into the door frame, thus ruining your form.It does hold well. However, it wears out really quickly. So, after a few uses you will have to use a wrench to tighten it because the grooves inside the bar, which turn the threaded rod that spreads the thing out, will wear down completely.The bar, which slides over top of the threaded rod, will actually slip off while you are using it, which is dangerous. I have a nice cut on my arm because of it.Not recommended at all, junk junk junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but wider than I'd hoped","review":"I was planning on putting this in my closet doorway (std new-home construction), but it was about an inch to wide.

If you're tall, a standard doorway probably won't be high enough though...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient for home workouts.","review":"I like this bar, but it spins as I do my pull ups, regardless of which side I am hanging.

Otherwise, it's a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me!","review":"I received my order today and had it set up and tested in 15 minutes. (helps to have a screw gun). I weigh 205 and it has no problems supporting me.I'm not sure what all the complaints about the grips are for. I was able to slide the grip over just fine by moving it back and forth. Didn't take more than a minute or so to get it where I needed it.The only downside to this product for me...I realized how out of shape I really was when trying to do a few reps. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, But Bar Turns During Use","review":"This bar would be great if not for one serious design issue: It turns when you're using it. It installs by screwing/unscrewing the outer and inner bar sections, with the idea being, I suppose, that once it's snugly in the door frame it won't turn any more. it will continue turning no matter what, and in fact if you keep unscrewing it (making the bar wider) the sides of the doorframe can be literally be pried apart! Even if the frame doesn't budge, the bar will still rotate because the round ends fit into round support caps, which allow the bar to turn freely with any amount of force. There's no way to lock the bar from turning, regardless of which way you hold it during exercise. It's always either tightening, loosening, or turning in place. Despite otherwise solid construction and comfortable grip, I can only give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"My husband asked for a chin-up bar for Christmas so he was happy to get this. It has been great. He put it on the closet door and was exercising nightly for a while. He got results quickly. Even his family noticed a difference.

I bought this DVD to hopefully get my daughter to sleep through the night, but there really wasn't much explanation on that.

The DVD was very helpful in getting my baby to stop crying and to sleep much longer throughout the night. I have a better understanding of what my baby's needs are now and I feel better equipped to deal with his fussiness. The two things from this DVD that helped me the most are swaddling and shushing. I use these every day all day. If you think your newborn does not like to be swaddled, try it anyway. I had given up on swaddling my baby until I watched this DVD.

He actually went down for naps and nighttime sleep with minimal frustration. This is seriously a lifesaving DVD. I have made this my gift for all baby showers.

When our nurse came over to show us the happiest baby techniques it was like a magic show! He was a little fussy at the time, probably because he was ready for one of his many naps, and she performed the shoosh, shake, swaddle, and side calming method and he was out like a light in the few minutes it took her to just chit chat with us. As a gift she left us the DVD and CD. Life savers! My son is now 3 months old, pushing 4 and the techniques still work! The swaddling was a life saver! He startles in his sleep which invariably wakes him up. If it weren't for the swaddle neither of us would get any sleep! I've given this DVD to my sister who is due any day and my cousin who just had her baby boy last night!! I wish everyone knew about these methods, they would be so much happier!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"White noise really works on the most of human being. Think about the time you go to bathroom; fan noise or water noise makes you more relax and poop better than the time you can hear other people's voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"I read this book fully and was really on board with the concept of the fourth trimester. In fact, I still believe in it, but the methods just didn't work for us. Part of the problem may be that my baby didn't like swaddling. It didn't matter who did it, how well it was done. She didn't like being restrained by the blanket at all and she would fight until she got out of it. I got the impression from the book that all babies do like it, they just don't realize it. Well, I'll just have to agree to disagree on that. And shushing didn't always work either. But since swaddling was out of the question, and it was the biggest step, this could be why the rest failed for us.In the end, the only thing my baby really wants is to nurse 24/7, even while she sleeps. This is not unnatural, so I go with the flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get anything out of this","review":"I am sure this technique works on brand new babies.

It will also build up those arm muscles in a hurry. haha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful DVD","review":"This DVD was recommended to me by my son's pediatrician when we mentioned some bouts of uncontrolled crying.

I have a wind down routine then lay him down drowsy and he sleeps extremly well!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so helpful","review":"I bought this in hopes it would do what it promises.Not the case. I do see where harvey is trying to get the focus linked between a parent and the baby.Truth is - it hasn't worked yet, and the product that has a guarantee should really give instructions that cater to all types of babies, and alternate instructions if something particular isn't working.Not what i expected"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vidoe quality is bad.

This book may be ok for a 'normal' baby...but if you have a baby who actually has medical problems this won't work! I didn't like that it made it sound like all babies should be 'fixed' by these solutions or refer you to your physician if the problem continues.

Sleep was a huge issue in this house. Dr. Karp's methods are great. You just need to stick to them. I think there are a few different methods that work well, it's just a matter of finding what you are comfortable with and sticking it out. My best advice is watch this and then follow what rings true to you. Remember it is one thing to watch a dvd and another to hear your baby crying at 4 in the morning. Stay strong!! This DVD gives you much needed ammo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby is the best baby on the block","review":"Knowing the 5 S's even before we brought our baby home was a blessing.

But knowing these tips before you go into dealing with a baby who might cry, was an awesome help."},{"rating":"2","title":"good tips","review":"I avoided swaddling my daughter until I saw this DVD.

I took the class offered at the local hospital and didn't think much of it until I got my newborn home. The techniques in the DVD work like a charm! I would recommend this over the book because it cuts to the chase but shows you several times how to do things correctly. My husband says that if he ever meets this Dr. Karp, he will kiss him on the lips for everything he has done for our son. Now, I purchase them as gifts for every baby shower I go to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for new parents","review":"This is required viewing for all parents to be. It saved us so much headache and stress. This stuff works, and watching the video takes no time at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"new moms delight!!!","review":"Oh, how I wish I had had this information thirty years ago! When first grandchild came along, children required me to watch the video to see how they were handling their baby who was 3 days old and I was there to help for two weeks. The methods are absolutely amazing, they work, baby is happy, parents are empowered in art of child care which is so new to them. Baby feels secure, content, and so do parents (grandparents). When my husband eventually came to visit, he, too, was amazed at how effective actions are introduced on the dvd, and was an immediate enthusiastic pupil. I will give this as a gift to EVERY new mom at all future baby showers! Don't be obtuse or resistant, it's all practical methods that I think come from various cultures and presented as relevant for today. I NEVER write reviews, but this is just the most fabulous information for new parents for the trying times with new babies, I give it the highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The happiest baby on the Block","review":"I love, love, love this doctor!!!!

I also read the book, but the dvd was much more helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost too good to believe.","review":"As new parents, a crying baby is a stressful thing. I think a stressed parent passes that on the baby and it becomes even more difficult to calm the baby down.This DVD gave us concrete tools for helping a crying baby calm down and relax. Having these tools helps the baby, but it also helps us to relax knowing that we can handle it. I think that makes a huge difference in itself.Seriously, this DVD is downright amazing. You won't regret buying it for one minute. It takes one hour to watch, but it will save you hundreds of hours of sleep in return.And no, I am not being paid to write this. I'm just a happy parent with a 14-day-old baby boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"As a first time Mom, reding this book in advacne, and watching the video, helped me to calm my anxiety and take charge of the sleeping schedule.

I didn't get it until 2.5 months, so it wasn't as useful as it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","review":"We had instant success with these techniques. All babies are different (at least that's what they tell you) so I cannot guarantee success for everyone who tries the techniques, but it is worth the price to find out if they will work for you. It is basic enough that you might be tempted not to but the dvd if you've heard about the tactics, but I would still recommend buying it and watching the whole thing as you get a better grasp of the techniques by seeing them repeated over and over. Anything that can calm your baby like this is worth the money. P.S. I suspect the techniques work best on newborns - I cannot confirm effectiveness on older babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure magic!","review":"I just don't know how people survived without this. I can't imagine having to go through some of the stories I have heard. This is an absolute must have. The video is great because you can pause and rewind all you need to while you are practicing. Be sure to practice swaddling a lot while the baby is happy or sleeping hard, that way it is second nature when you are being screamed at.*EVERY ONE* needs to learn this info, so get one for anyone you know who has to deal with babies under 6 months any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Grandmothers","review":"I saw this author describe her techniques on Oprah and was so impressed I ordered the book for my daughter. She recently had her first baby and of course I wanted my grandson to have the best care. Little did I know that today's new Moms have access to mountains more info than I did when I had two children in the 70s. I was disappointed that she was not impressed with the book. She already knew most of what was in it. So if you're a grandmother who wants to learn for yourself it's a fascinating book, but don't buy it for a new Mom without asking first."},{"rating":"2","title":"It WORKS!","review":"We have twins - 8 months old now - and we used the Happiest Baby methods we learned from this DVD ***all the time*** during their first months of life. We swaddled them until around 6 months old. Dr. Karp's methods really worked for our little ones and made those first hectic months a bit easier. I definitely recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"it really works!","review":"Thank the Lord for this doctor! I know so many babies, including my own, who have benefitted from his wonderful techniques.

Good for grandparents too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"baby kryptonite!","review":"Our pediatrician suggested we get this video and we are happy we did. The techniques demonstrated in \\"The Happiest Baby on the Block\\" work! Our little fuss pot can get really wound up but the swaddling, swinging, shushing, and sucking combo knock him out. Our 4 week old baby calms right down with the shushing and sleeps better and longer swaddled. It was particularly helpful to see just how loud and vigorously the swinging and shushing needs to be to have the desired effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happiest baby on the block","review":"Every new parent, especially ones with fussy babies should see this and put these simple techniques into practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE for new parents!","review":"Thankfully I saw part of the DVD is a newborn care class that I took. I immediately went out and got it for myself so I could watch the entire thing. AMAZING! It worked. All of it. Friends, family, and other mothers were amazed at how quickly we could soothe my baby boy if he got upset. We rarely got past the 3rd \\"S\\". I now buy the book and DVD for everyone I know who is having a baby! This is a great way to eliminate the frustration of a crying baby. This should be REQUIRED for all parents of new babies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happiest Baby on the Block....makes happiest parents on the block","review":"This is one of the best gifts to give to a new parent.

My wife and I watched this video and found it to be very informative. A co-worker recommended it to us. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because we have not actually tried any of the techniques (no baby to practice with). I hope it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty helpful!","review":"The most useful thing we got from Happiest Baby on the Block is the swaddling. Our baby LOVES to be swaddled. She can be in the middle of a total meltdown and as soon as I start swaddling her, she calms right down. The sshh'ing is also helpful. She never really liked the side jiggling or even taking a pacifier, which we use as a last resort when she's really upset.One other thing I really like about HBOTB is the attention it gives to a brand new baby. I fully belive in the 4th trimester theory. By mimmicking the feel and sounds of mama's tummy, the baby feels safe, warm, and comfortable. Knowing I could provide that environment outside the womb for my little baby was very comforting to me as a new mom, especially since our baby was so fussy during her first 6-8 weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy 1 baby DVD this is it.","review":"This DVD was excellent.

Swaddling and shushing really helped my baby. I would recommend. Great examples with real families. DVD also came with soothing sounds for the baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot recommend highly enough","review":"We would not have made it through the first three months without this DVD. It's better than the book by far because it's hard to understand what he's talking about without seeing the steps in action. Took a few days to get the hang of it, but it was WELL worth the effort. Our daughter was sleeping 6+ hours a night by the time she was a week or two old! (It's been awhile, I can't remember exactly...)I do recommend getting a velcro-style swaddling blanket, as our daughter was strong enough and big enough to wiggle out of the regular swaddle blanket by the time she was a few days old.This is also a GREAT gift for baby showers. I always give it, even though it's never on the registry, and it's never a duplicate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very helpful","review":"This video really saved us. We were having a lot of problems calming our baby, and getting him to sleep. The tips in this video made a world of difference. We can pretty much ALWAYS calm him now, and that has really helped both him and us! People constantly tell us what a happy baby he is (always smiling and cooing at people), and I honestly think it's because he's secure now - his needs are met and he knows he will be soothed when he needs it. We didn't watch this until he was almost 2-months old, but based on the tips, we started swaddling him (which I previously thought he hated), and he started falling asleep on his own and sleeping for longer stretches. I highly recommend this video - it has helped more than anything else that we've tried/read/watched (and there have been a few)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"We purchased this DVD after it was recommended by our pediatrician.

I love that thing, my husband and I fall asleep to it as well, since baby sleeps in our room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use common sense and you don't need to waste money on this","review":"I thought there would be all kinds of tips I would get from this. But there were exactly 5 tips. All it teaches you is how to swaddle your baby in a blanket (which they show that to you in the hospital after you deliver your baby), how to rock your baby back in forth in your arms or in a swing, how to put a pacifier in your baby's mouth (this one made me laugh), how to Shusssh loudly in your babys ear so he will stop crying...that deffinately does not work, and to turn your baby on his side.

We have given this as a gift already because of the success we have had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for reflux babies","review":"I'm sure these techniques work great for most fussy babies, but for our little one who had both colic and reflux i'm afraid no amount of swaddling, giggeling or shushing combined could sooth her. While I will say the video gives a great demonstration for swaddling which we used successfully for sleeping each night. Relief from the constant crying only came after she outgrew the reflux/colic stage - after 3 months, then like magic she was the happy baby we dreamed of. Please parents of fussy babies, don't be discouraged, while these techniques can only help, they may not be the solution you're praying for, but like so many difficult baby phases, this too shall pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go buy it NOW!!","review":"After a blissful week one of life with a sleeping baby, week two brought a new baby all together. We called her our little monster. Well luckily, we heard about this DVD and ran out and bought it after two days of monster behavior. WOW, it works instantly. I am so impressed. The longest period of time she cries is about 5 minutes. It is truly amazing. We use the radio between am stations which also works wonders and have ordered a white noise machine that we are still waiting for. It is so nice to know you can calm your baby in any setting and not have to worry about a meltdown lasting what seems like hours in public. We also have been following a baby whisperer/babywise type routine which is basically every 2-3 hours feed, a little activity time up to 45 minutes and then putting her to bed before she gets tired ie at the first sign of fatigue and she is on a pretty good routine, which I think is great at just 2 1/2 weeks of age!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I had this DVD first time around","review":"This is the best $25 I think it have ever spent.The first 2 months of our twins has been easy compared to the first 2 months of our first daughter and I put it down 2 this DVD.You don't need the book, just get the DVD and watch carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn these tricks and sleep","review":"I wish I had seen this video when I had a colicky little one years ago.

I bought this DVD on a whim and it stayed in its wrapper for 2 weeks before we watched it. Our baby fussed for 2 hours at night, fighting sleep, but obviously exhausted, well fed, and wearing a clean diaper. My daughter fussed while we watched the video and we calmed her right there as we watched the techniques. We can get her to sleep in less than 5 minutes, rather than try to calm her fussing for over an hour, like we had done before.It really works! We are now the Happiest Parents on the Block!

The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD provided us with some direction on the day after we brought our baby home from the hospital. We were totally unprepared for our little girl not settling, and were beside ourselves, trying everything to no avail for 12 hours straight. After many tears and wondering what we had got ourselves in for, we did a search on the web for settling techniques and found Dr Karp's web site.We bought the DVD the next morning as soon as we could, and the techniques worked instantly! We have now caught up on some sleep, and are enjoying our little girl sleeping soundly and settling well. So well, that she puts her self to sleep most of the time.Thank you again Dr Karp for helping us through the first week with our new baby.

I made the mistake of not watching it right away, and after about a week without sleep, I brought it out and tried some of the methods on my newborn daughter as they were being taught. It worked. It worked really, really well. We got 4 solid hours of sleep that night (when you've got a newborn, you become thankful even for that little amount). It's a fantastic gift, especially for new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"(Hopefully) helpful for new parents","review":"This was recommended by a friend, and it does have a lot of good tips. We've not yet had a chance to use them in practice, since we are still waiting on our daughter's arrival. We have stocked up on swaddling blankets and bought a swing, because of the video's advice. I also read the book, but I think you can get just as much from watching this short video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me soothe my baby","review":"This should be taught at post-natal classes. The effects on the relationship I have with my baby are priceless.Thank you, Dr. Karp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great tips","review":"The CDs were great. The overall content isn't huge, but the tips are worth the 20$ you pay for.It helped us. I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic DVD, even for 2nd time parents","review":"Yes, the suggestions appear simple and common sense - However, we didn't know/didn't think about this with our first child, and this is DEFINITELY coming in-handy this time around. Of all the useless things you can buy before the baby arrives, this DVD is worth every penny. Even if you get an extra half hour rest, it would be golden. Highly recommend his swaddling technique too, it worked better then the velcro swaddlers we've tried and once you get a hang of it, much simpler (just make sure you buy good (large & breathable) swaddling blankets!! like aden + anais)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this DVD.","review":"My daughter had colic until she was about 3 months old. Dr. Karp's advice saved my sanity. It was the only thing that helped. The drops didn't help. changing my diet didn't help. The only thing that worked were the techniques reviewed in this DVD. I have the book but with a newborn, who can read? The DVD has an excellent questions and answers section and Dr. Karp's manner is very calming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"This video came highly recommended from a friend who is a new parent. It is absolutely fabulous - I am 7 months pregnant, so have yet to apply the (very simple) techniques learned in this video. One of my biggest fears is that I will not be able to calm my baby. It is amazing to see screaming babies in this video turn to relaxed and quiet in a matter of seconds (literally!). The video is giving me the confidence I need to be able to tackle being a new mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful!","review":"This DVD was very helpful, especially in learning how to do the techniques. We ended up buying one for our Doula so it could be apart of her library for other clients. It increased our babies sleep and by her second month she was sleeping through the night pretty consistently. The best is learning how to do the swaddle correctly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good guide","review":"I enjoyed what I learned from this dvd, but remember it is a guide..not the bible. The tips/tricks are very helpful, but each baby is unique and this may not work all the time for all babies. For instance, my daughter really doesn't like to be swaddled unless she's very tired. Overall, it's well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Dad from Western North Caroina","review":"Recommended by a good friend this DVD is faster and easier than the book. Wow full of hands on techniques you can start using on day one. First and foremost, Swaddle. Swaddling improves sleeping and calms the baby quickly and easily. This DVD can save you a lot of crying and distress and lets dad play an active role in baby care. I have watched it about 10 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"A brilliant DVD. I am sorry that I did not come back sooner to write a review as I know that there are probably many parents out there scouring the internet for a solution to their babies crying. This technique was a godsend and I am forever grateful to Dr. Karp. Don't hesitate, just buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be a required read for all pregnant women!","review":"This book is truly amazing. I felt as though it was a baby bible for the first 3.5 months of my little girl's life. I am so thankful to Dr. Karp for writing this book. After reading this my husband and I felt we had the knowledge and techniques to comfort our new baby. The strategies he outlines truly work like magic. The only problem is I didn't know what to do once she turned 4 months old! This is when the stragies should be basically removed. Since I have found another baby bible, Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child. I recommend both of these books to all parents to be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For newborns only!!","review":"I bought this dvd looking for a magic cure for my 10 1/2 month old who went from being an excellent sleeper to an over tired baby with sudden sleep issues. The picture of an older baby on the cover is misleading. The principles that Dr. Karp \\"teaches\\" in this dvd are all very simple and intended for new infants. Maybe I had an exceptionally good experience in my hospital after giving birth, but all of these things were taught to me by hospital staff, and in a much less redundant manner. I gave this product two stars only because it may be helpful for a newborn of first time parents, but as for myself, I am very sorry to have wasted the $20 bucks on this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work for my baby","review":"With all the great reviews I was sure this would work for my daughter. It didn't. I tried swaddling, rocking, shushing, and pacifying. Though I realize the \\"5 S's\\" take practice, after several attempts I just never got her to stop crying with any of the techniques. Though she may fit more into the \\"high needs\\" catagory than the colicky baby one.The one part of the DVD I did find helpful, however, was swaddling her and putting her in the swing. I'd get her to sleep 3-4 hours straight while I got some housework done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"Video and or music would not play on blue ray player. Could only watch on my laptop.Video was poorly made considering the cost, looked like one of my highschool projects. On the upside the information provided has proved to save our life when the baby gets upset!!! I would recommend watching but would suggest you buy a used copy or split with group of expecting moms. You only need to watch once or twice to get the idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Geared for parents expecting first child, newborns","review":"This tape wasn't helpful to us, our baby was four months when I ordered it.

It helped my baby sleep longer and of the 5 ways to soothe, a few will always work."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFESAVER!!!!!","review":"My baby wasn't usually too fussy, so when he did fuss it was hard to deal with. Using the techniques on this video, along with the calming sounds in the special features worked so amazingly well!!A must have for anyone expecting a baby!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would rate it 100 stars if possible!","review":"Our 6 week old is just as fussy/colicky/high needs as our first one was (everyone said it could never happen again!)- After trying everything again (changing my diet incase it was a nursing issue, the vacuum cleaner, wondering what we were doing wrong again!) I ordered this video. I cried when I saw his technique, because seeing the babies on the video reminded me exactly of my two girls, and I knew it would work for my 6 week old. Luckily I was right! She is happy, content, and we have no guilt or wondering what we are doing wrong as parents! Now we can calm her and satisfy her needs. We are so thrilled- I will ask my pediatrician to recommend this video to parents of similar babies"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is great - but the video is better!","review":"If you are a visual learner or are at your wit's end with a baby that who doesn't sleep - and therefore have no time to read - I highly recommend this video. It's wonderful to be shown exactly how to attempt Dr. Karp's techniques instead of trying to figure it out after reading the book. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, but often effective. Slightly cheesy guy.","review":"Dr. Karp gives the same 5-step program for hushing crying babies that he gives in the book. I think it is probably worth getting the DVD instead of the book, because it is useful to see the techniques demonstrated. He shows them repeatedly, different situations, different babies. He also shows the techniques not working sometimes, which is good - and then he shows what to do next. Karp has a slightly cheesy presentation, and always speaks in a soothing monotone that drives me a little crazy, but I got more value from this than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD","review":"Great ideas to use with infant. This was recommended to me while I was in the hospital after having my son. One of the nurses said she uses it with all the babies in the nursery. The DVD offers great tips on calming your baby. They have all worked for us so far!!!I only gave this 4 stars because I would have just rented this. It's not really something that you need to buy. Once you see it once you've got it all down. I would probably recommend getting the book if you have the time to read it. I'm sure there is much more information in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I bought it for my know-it-all husband for Father's Day. It amazed us both to find out how many misconceptions he had about the rules of his favorite sports! I did almost as well as he did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"I used this for several days then switched to a DietMinder journal. The Atkins journal doesn't have enough room to record everything you eat, let alone any reactions you might have to what you eat (cravings, bloating, etc). In addition, it has one of those cheap plastic binders that comes apart after a while. I highly recommend the DietMinder instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atkins Food Journal","review":"The Atkins Food Journal is great!! It helps to keep on track with the foods that you are eating and where you are at with your carbs for the day. Until I got the food journal I was writing my food intake on a piece of paper and it never failed I would lose the paper and not remember everything I ate!!

Give something a relationship somehow to something else and it becomes equal to it. What nonsense! Let a creation stand on it's on.This film is irksome, pretentious fiddle faddle and little more. I knew the drudge by the sound of a grotesques score crawling under my skin with the menu. Who cares whether it's homage-ish or not?

First it's an amazingly deft character portrayal of a man tormented by lost love played by Michael Shannon in a very quiet, subdued study. Actually, the entire flick is like his character - we only see the tip of the iceberg but flashes of hidden depth appear here and there.Secondly, a very original film style. Cool autumnal colors and expressionistic camera work, sometimes bordering on the feverish, give the film a dream like quality; as if we're living in the hazy twilight consciousness of the main character, who is rarely sober throughout the film.Add to this a classy cool jazz soundtrack and it's one melancholy moody movie. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"BO...RING!","review":"I wish I could say this movie was like watching paint dry but that would've been more exciting. It's just about an alcoholic private investigator (Michael Shannon) who follows a man with a kid. There's some spoilers there but not interesting enough to mention. The only positive thing about this was I didn't pay for it. I saw it on On Demand and fast forwarded through most of it.Save your time and your money. Watching a faucet drip is more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing......","review":"I agree with the other reviews that this book does delivera good explanation on classloaders, serialization, JNI andreflection. The explanation of classloaders is one of thebest I've read. The chapter on serialization goes intothe details on customizing serialization, etc. And theJNI explanation is fine.However, this book does NOT discuss component developmentin Java. There is no attempt to bring together theseadvanced Java topics and explain how they are used todevelp Java Components. In fact, outside of a smallexample in Chapter 1, there are no examples of componentsin this book.This book is misnamed. It should be called somethinglike \\"advanced java programming.\\" If you're lookingfor that book which teaches component development inJava, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be in every Jewish library","review":"I found this book during a Web search on astronaut Judith Resnik, who was the first Jew in space and the second woman in space.

Immensely entertaining, very educational ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best introduction to materials science I've ever read.","review":"This book, and it's companion, \\"Structures, or why things don't fall down\\" should be standard reading material for every engineering undergraduate. Mr. Gordon is the only author I've found that has a real practical insight into these arcane areas of science.

At any rate, while this is a more meaty role, and he makes a very dashing operative, the story is fairly idiotic and the production is second-rate. In fact, the quality of the video is terrible and you have to strain to see what is going on, ridiculous as most of it seems. The picture of Marg Helgenberger dragging a baby over and through the Afghan mountains while spouting flower-child preachings is enough to send you screaming into the night, to say nothing of anything else. In sum, a sad waste of Dalton's talents (can this be the same actor who played the definitive Rochester in Jane Eyre?) as well as Omar Shariff's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to think how it could have been...","review":"If you're a great Timothy Dalton fan ( as I am! ), probably you'll make it to the end of the film Eif not, I don't know if there's much I can guarantee.Altogether, I think the film could have been much much better. I couldn't get rid of the impression that I was watching some cheap soap drama, and it only made me wonder how Timothy could be happy being a part of it ( although not so much as I did when I saw 'Cleopatra'). Like another reviewer, I think he's sometimes inclined to waste his talent on some funny filmsEAs for the accent, I had a hard time convincing myself that he was a CIA agent EI wasn't sure if he was even trying to sound American ( Not having read the book, I thought he must be an American brought up in the UKE.With Timothy and Omar Sharif, I'm only sorry that the film had to come out this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book - the vhs tape is a waste of time and $","review":"Great book; lousy movie.British actors doing American accents, and doing them poorly.

We swear by daily doses of Vitamin C/garlic and echinacea at the first sign of any symptoms. And that's where Gaia Herbs steps in. This company has an herbal-blended product for almost every need. I like Quick Defense because of its high concentration of echinacea alkyamides, the main components that stop a cold in its tracks. The addition of andrographis, black elderberry and ginger is an added bonus. Used when needed and as directed, this product and other Gaia echinacea-based blends work very well.My only complaint about Gaia? It's expensive! For the money, I prefer using echinacea liquid herbal extracts. A one oz. bottle lasts much longer (usually an entire winter season), and again, there are several Gaia blends to choose from (I personally like Echinacea Goldenseal Supreme). Avoiding just one cold makes spending a little more worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaia Herbs Quick Defense","review":"In a league that cannot compare to the wonders ofOscillococcinum, Gaia Herbs are a good alternative supplement.Although we did not notice a significant state change post consumption, there are many beneficial chemicals in this product that would prove useful to aid in health.

One bottle is 20 pills and you need to take 2 pills five times a day. That is way too much pill taking for me. If I'm getting sick, the last thing I want to do is think about taking pills that many times a day. And it only covers you for one time of being sick.

The pills themselves went down smoothly and didn't feel like they were just sitting in my esophagus and there were no weird aftertaste belching.

After I finished the bottle, I still came down with a cold.It is really hard to say whether my cold was better or worse after taking the Quick Defense. The sore throat portion of the cold lasted only about a day, which is not typical for me (usually lasts longer). I then started getting very congested and went straight into the \\"cough\\" stage which lasted a couple of days. So the anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that this product did shorten the duration of my cold.I would be willing to try this product again. As such, I am going to make sure I have another bottle on hand.

Will not read any other books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jodi, Jodi, Jodi!!!!","review":"This book was not inspiring, enjoyable or bearable. The book should be called \\"Jodi\\". The book focused on her and her alone. Characters are introduced in this book and never elaborated on or broken down into detail. If there is an issue with another character it was never addressed well enough to be resolved. The whole MaDear incident was not realistic on how it was handled. There needs to be realism in a book related to religion. And for the record, the prayer group never \\"Got Down\\"!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulously Enjoyable!","review":"I love the YadaYada series. I think there's at leastone person in the YadaYada Prayer Group that someonecan relate to. I also like the way they keep it real.Sometimes, in christian fiction, we read about supersaints who never have an impatient thought and areclose to perfect. Yadda Yadda Prayer Group Gets Down Again wasn't afraid to deal withcultural and racial differences and how even asChristians we can struggle with prejudices andstereotypes and I think that's okay, as long as weacknowledge these feelings as being outside of thewill of God and pray for them to be removed from ourhearts. A good funny, thought provoking andspiritual book! You MUST read it!Reviewed by Carmen Copeland for The GOOD GIRL Book Club www.goodgirlbookclubonline.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets Get Down with Yada Yada","review":"After reading the first book, The Yada Yada Prayer Group, I was excited to know that there was a sequel. This book was also a good read and I would recommend to anyone. The problems and issues differ this time with Jodi, Nony, Ruth, Adele, Yo-Yo and the rest of the gang but their approach is the same in the long run, in the end take it to God in prayer and forgive yourself. I was a little disappointed that some of the storylines wrapped up so quickly but that just leaves room for Neta Jackson to give me 1 more to tale of drama and fun with the ladies of Yada Yada."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love theYada Yada Prayer Group Series!!!","review":"I enjoyed reading every book of this series. I just completed book 5 (the last of the series) and what a let down this has been. The book's characters are so lovable and I feel like I am missing my friends. Neta Jackson's characters are so different and unique. I related to all the characters and laughed and cried along with them. Even though these books have a Christian theme, I believe anyone would enjoyed this series. I even want my husband to read the series (he's too busy now, but is interested in reading them because he knows how much I loved reading them.) I hope my review has caused you run out and buy the complete series. I am sure it will give you lots of pleasure. Be sure to read them in order from the first Yada Yada Prayer Group to book 5 of the series. I went on Neta Jackson's web site and she said that she's working on book 6!!Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is about Jodi and the various relationships with the women in her prayer group. The theme of this book is aboutforgiveness. We see many examples of this through: forgiving the woman who robbed the prayer group, the mother of the boythat Jodi accidently killed, and MaDear and what she went through when her brother was murdered.I really enjoyed the book. It was very uplifting. I loved the humor in the book. And I loved the forgiveness theme.MaDear thought that Denny was the man who lynched her brother. At the end of the book, that situation was resolvedbeautifully.This author describes very well the relationships today between the various races. Jackson lives in the inner cities amongvarious races, so she brings her experiences into this book to describe how the various races fit in with each other.I look forward to reading more books from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treat Yourself!!","review":"My niece, Raecyne, recommended this book series. I enjoy the Yada Yada Prayer Group series so very much. Neta expertly crafts her characters so that you almost instinctively assign voices and faces to these characters. You feel as though you know these characters; you go to church with these ladies, they are in your choir or your small group. I told my niece that I am already lamenting my completion of the series. It will be like the feeling of loneliness you experience when you have to leave your church family and move to another location. You know you will miss these people who have meant so much to your life and your spiritual growth. Sounds like an extreme view of characters in a book? I challenge you to start reading the series. You will be delighted. You will also be challenged in your spiritual walk as the main character Jodi Baxter is challenged and grows spiritually. Treat yourself to the ladies of the Yada Yada Prayer Group!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yada Yada Prayer group Gets Down review","review":"This was a very good book.

The author could have explained everything in a book half the size. His explanations are not entertaining either.The author is obviously well versed in chaos theory but lacks the ability to write a good book. For a good read on a similar topic that is much better written try The Black Swan by Taleb or The (MIS)Behavior of Markets by Mandelbrot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essence of chaos book by E.Lorenz","review":"Lorenz did a great job when he wrote this book!The very first time when I heard of chaos theory was year ago while watching some old documentary about Nostadamus. In film was mentioned chaos theory and said that acceptance of it by many people could change whole look to life and so on. Movie left to me questions - what is that theory, what it's standing for.Finaly my interest lead me to this book and it clearly showed me what kind of staff is that chaos theory! That was and is really intriguing!Book is well written. There was of course some places that wasn't easy to understand. I myself have studied high math,encountered differential equations but anyway had some difficulties. That's why not 5 stars to book - it's really not for absolutely everyone although almost close to it. I couldn't stop it reading, I was done in two days.This book encouraged me for further reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the book if you're looking for a chaos primer","review":"If your interest in Chaos was piqued by Gleick's book on the subject, you may have found it unsatisfying. While it conveyed a enthusiasm for chaos, it only superficially answered questions about what characterizes a chaotic system. \\"The Essence of Chaos\\" is a much better book for gaining an understanding of chaos, mainly because it includes a discussion of the mathematics. Both authors strive to avoid mathematics as much as possible, but in the end, I believe Lorenz achieves a better balance. He only touches lightly on the math, but without that, it's impossible to understand what makes a system chaotic. He doesn't quite go so far as to show a practical application of chaos theory, but a clear and concise example of that probably doesn't exist yet. But, he does achieve the goal of demonstrating and examining the fascinating characteristics of a chaotic system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Introduction","review":"I read this book when it was snowing outside in the Sierras. I was immediately able to correlate this book with the chaotic snow fall.Extremely good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"snap opens too easily","review":"I was looking for an ID Holder that you can wear on your belt. It looks very stylish and it's handy because of the extra pockets for a credit card on the back side. The \\"leather\\" is very stiff at the beginning but gets soft very soon. However that doesn't prevent the snap from opening by itsself every time I bend over or sit down. That makes it pretty much useless, because now I have to worry about losing my ID all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a fake!","review":"Do not be misled the way I was.

This way, only a few paragraphs make an entire page, and you can call your pamphlet a book and charge a lot more! For the perfect example of this, see this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a review","review":"One might think the book was a bit too much.

It features a superb performance by a very talented group."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't impressed...","review":"I'm afraid the authors, while seeming to desire catering to the novice, merely came across as condescending with their choice of phrasing. The book is not set up very intuitively, nor does it lend itself well to general troubleshooting. The troubleshooting offered is positioned in areas of focus that would be difficult to determine without considerable knowledge up front, as opposed to assisting in isolating a problem step-by-step. Further, instead of helping identify parts, etc., the authors seem to assume that you have a thorough overall knowledge of your particular motor, and offer no path to that information. In its defense, the book does go into great detail about disassembling and cleaning or rebuilding different devices and systems. But again, it doesn't help you determine problems, so who'd know what to disassemble? Sorry kids, but major thumbs down on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummm..... small","review":"Wow, surprised on the size of this, not a big model.

The authors of the text help readers to understand that there is no magic cure for taking off the pounds. Instead, readers learn that subtle changes in diet and consistent exercise habits can make all of the difference. In an age of gastric bypass, freeze-dried packaged foods, and food deprivation as ways to weight loss, this book is a welcome alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can holder that does not hold!","review":"I was anticipating this because I have a BMW with flimsy cup holders.

In the last decade there have been many \\"consumer level\\" radios flooding the market; I have tested many, but then never come anything close to the claimed distances. These ones work well indoor and out. I have 8 of them and they get dropped a lot if crew members are not using a hand held mic. None have broken yet, but I would recommend a hand mic. I use a surveillance headset that Amazon doesn't sell. Amazon only sells the yellow ones- that is actually an advantage as they are much harder to loose than the black ones. I needed a black one and I just popped off the cover, and put 10 coats of BBQ paint on it, and it is holding up well: yellow is good. Note- don't expect to pull it out of the box and start using it well!

I have to say that I am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort. The group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music. The vocals tend to be oversung, or drowned out by the chaos in the background. Rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements, Rhapsody of Fire puts you to sleep with them. The group does stay true to their fantasy themes however."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE STORY OF HARRIET TUBMAN","review":"This book is my introduction of Black History Month to my fifth grade students. We read this book aloud and discuss it in detail. It tells the story of Harriet Tubman, a great, courageous black woman who was instrumental as a conductor of the Underground Railroad. The story begins with Harriet at age six and tells of the beatings and hardships she endured throughout her life. My students love this book because it is poignant, funny, and exciting. Harriet's life reads like a James Bond novel. She was a commander and a spy for the Northern army. She was a conductor of the Underground Railroad. She risked her life repeatedly to free her people and family from the bonds of slavery. Most of my students have never heard of Harriet Tubman and after reading this book have come to admire this wonderful black woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I teach 4th grade and always read this book as a whole class novel.

To my opinion it is the best song in the album, and one of Depeche Mode's best songs. The song had the sound of the classic DM - the sound that made these guys a legendary pop group.So when the single went out, I wasn't surprised, and I went to buy the cd-single the moment it arrived to the stores. I was dumbfounded.The single remix is the most evil thing someone can do to a tune! Instead of getting a brilliant DM track, you will get a boring rocky version that lacks all the darkness of the original version, and sounds like a bad cover from an unsuccessfull rock band.This song is fantastic, so go and buy the album. Don't waste your money on this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best Depeche Mode has ever offered","review":"Every mix of In Your Room is an aural delight and this is definatelly one of those rare CD's you are going to want when you get lost on that deserted island."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best single EVER!!!","review":"This is THE VERY FIRST review I have ever written here on Amazon. I have owned this CD single for about 7 years and let me tell you one thing....the live versions of Policy of Truth and In Your Room are good, the Zephyr and Jeep Rock remixes of IYR are very good, but the Adrenaline Mix of Higher Love is my favorite music track....OF ALL TIME!!!!Seriously...Francois Kevorkian went where no DJ has gone before and served up an abolutely fantastic mix of what was already my favorite DM song of all time. This single is one of the remaining few CDs I keep in rotation in my car(I usually use my mp3 player), because it's so incredible! If you are a fan of DM even in the slightest, you *MUST* buy this CD single ASAP! I mean like...NOW. It absolutely rapes all other DM singles in my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this guide!","review":"This book packed a ton of information into a great sized book.

Frommer's guide had great concise descriptions of the rides, shows etc. and had all the helpful information we needed. It also includes info on SeaWorld, the Univeral parks and other Orlando area activities--just a great all around guide! Everyone buys the bigger, more expensive guides (we have) but I think this one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are better guides","review":"I swear by Frommer's and this was the first time I was disappointed. My mom bought the Unofficial Guide To WDW 2006 and I borrowed it to compare. The Unofficial Guide is the way to go. This book was a waste of my money.

The lozenge was very effective at numbing whatever portion of my mouth was sucking on it, but provided little relief where it hurt on my throat. I even tried to direct the saliva as I swallowed so the numbing stuff would coat my throat. This was a little more effective, but not by much.Although it did numb the back of my throat a bit, the relief didn't last very long at all.

Released less than a year after 1986's \\"The Sport Of Kings\\", I sense that the band is mere fulfilling a contractual obligation, the band usually releases albums every TWO years. They would break up shortly thereafter.\\"Surveillance\\" is a rather overblown and uninspired effort, with only two really good songs being the straight-ahead rockers \\"Long Time Gone\\" and \\"Rock You Down\\". The more progressive numbers never seem to take off.

Here we see more keyboards and a second guitarist on some of the tracks.\\"Never Say Never\\" is almost a power-pop with a cool intro in the form of \\"Prologue: Into the Forever\\". One of my favorite Triumph songs in \\"Carry On The Flame\\" (that, along with All The Kings Horses, are really the same song). I like the intricate acoustic guitar work on the intro and the fade out. Those songs alone warrant the 5-star rating I gave this.\\"All Over Again\\" is a ballad. I've long felt like hard rock groups record some of the best ballads to be heard, and this one is pretty memorable.\\"Prelude: The Waking Dream\\" and \\"On And On\\" are also really the same song. There is some interesting synthesizer and keyboard work here, and Rik Emmett's guitar work is as good as ever.This was the last recording Rik Emmett did with Triumph - what a way to go out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to htier best effort","review":"No wonder Rik Emmett left theband soon after this album.

What I did like, though, was some of the casting, especially Whoopi Goldberg as the Cheshire Cat and Ben Kingsley as the Caterpillar.

This time around we have Whoppi Goldberg as the Chesire Cat, Martin Short as the Mad Hatter, Christopher Lloyd as the White Knight, Ben Kingsley as the Caterpiller and Miranda Richardson as the Red Queen!

I didn't expect anything when the movie was first broadcast on network TV, but was immediately hooked when I wandered into the room during the tea party. After watching too many cloying and dumbed-down Disney tales, this movie, with it's combination of almost surreal special effects (and what else would you want for Alice in Wonderland?!) and quirky comic performances, was a wonderful treat. My kids (12 and 7) love it, but then they aren't Disney fans either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown by Hallmark","review":"Hallmark Entertainment has made many movies from children's books, and this probably one of the worst. Based on both \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" this movie stars many of the familiar faces of Hallmark movies and children's movies, such as Gene Wilder, Miranda Richardson, Martin Short, and Whoopi Goldberg. The lead character of Alice is unfortunately played by an actress that is not so good. The movie revolves around her, and she seems to move from one scene to the next with little emotion or expression. Even the crying scenes seemed fake. Where is Dakota Fanning when you need her? The cinematography, costume and set design are spot on, as usual for Hallmark movies, but the soundtrack was unnoticeable. The only bright spot was the engaging song by Gene Wilder's character. All in all, quite boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Help!","review":"When I was a kid in the mid 80's I remember a tv version of Alice in Wonderland.

Here is what I remember from the end of it.I remmember that Alice had to go through a mirror and when she did a beast was behind her and it was about to come through too, but she screamed at it that she did not beleive in it and it went up in a puff of smoke.Please tell me if that is the right one?thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Indeed, you can wreck a masterpiece.","review":"If you hold dear the book, the Disney version, or even the 1985 Alice (with Carol Channing!), steer clear of this movie.Whereas the original storyline is deliciously impish, cheeky, convoluted, and whimsical -- this version is lackluster and flat, with two-dimensional characters and lackluster scenery, encapsulated in a blandly innocent approach.

The atmosphere in this movie is great, very magical, very good special effect. Great performance of Miranda Richardson, I thought she was very good in Snow White and Merlin but in this one her acting performance is the best. I love her scary Queen look and her weird creepy voice, it give me chill. Martin Short is very good as the Mad Hatter.

The story is entertaining and the Hollywood big-shot cast is quite funny. Although originally TV-ready this version may be frightening to young children...especially if they were expecting Disney. The strength of this production lies in the special effects...most notably on DVD. It is for movies like this that you bought a DVD player in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow & Boring","review":"This is one of those movies that really throws you for a loop; most fantasy movies don't have anywhere near this stunning or detailed sets and effects. Some of the costumes and props were very nice as well.I think they should have spent some money on a writer though. And it is very slow paced; I could barely sit and watch the whole thing so I doubt most children will.Despite the big name cast no one really delivers any kind of memorable performance. Miranda Richardson spends most of her scenes doing an impression of Madeline Khan's trademark whine that got old fast. I actually felt sorry for Gene Wilder; why he felt the need to do this compared to what he usually does...the rest of the musical numbers weren't much any better.It has it's moments but unless you really want to watch you shouldn't bother with this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately disappointing.....","review":"I had seen this version when it was shown on television last year. Despite a very talented cast and some very top notch special effects for a made for television movie, there were too many changes to the story that left me feeling terribly hollow afterwards. I don't know why the production team had to make such a drastic change to the beginning of the story. The fact they had to change the opening from Alice's sister reading to her to Alice preparing to sing for some recital just didn't set well with me. The girl they chose to play Alice did an exceptional job despite the weak script and one of highlights in the movie for me was Gene Wilder as the Mock Turtle. It was so nice to see him on the screen again after such a long time. I just hope in the future if Hollywood wants to do a production like this, they will stay true to the original story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

It was just an all around flop. I sat there the whole time wishing for it to be over. It was that bad. If you like lame made-for-tv movies that lack in acting and directing.

Are the writers afraid if one of the characters smiles it will ruin the story??? If there is a Season Three, I sincerely hope they return to the old format.

Add to that the fact that using them is better for the environment (regardless of what the wood sellers say) and you can't do better than beans. Using then in a gas grill is a breeze.

Mine broke just by accidentally slightly bending the cable while it was plugged in. 2) It sticks straight out of the side of the computer which makes it easy to accidentally bend the cable and also makes it harder to put into narrow spaces (e.g., entertainment cabinet).

He is an arrogant, mega super ultra jackass and pervert, but the only one that can save Meta-Rikana, and hook up with the hot priestess. It's an older title so don't expect crazy awesome CG or anything. The saving grace of this series is the abundance of hard core characters. The best part of this series are the awesome enemies Schneider has to kill. There is a lot of violence and nudity. So it's not for kids. It'd probably screw them up in the head.

It reminds me of a role-playing game with sexual undertones. The series is about a warlock who is summoned forth by his enemies to save every one from certain doom.As I mentioned, Bastard is like a role-playing game. It has a lot of the common role-playing or faerie tale elements within it such as a princess, a maiden in distress, sorcerers, knights, monsters, elementals, and a multitude of villains to boot.This DVD contains all six episodes of the mini series of Bastard. Bastard has a reputation for being the cheesiest anime every created. Despite it's reputation, I found it to be well worth it. The animation is fair and the music is not that hot but the slap-stick comedy and the plot make up for where Bastard lacks. If you are into role-playing I highly suggest you purchas Bastard because it is a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Bastard!! brings together some of the best elements normally found in different anime titles and puts them together as a powerful ride!Awesome animation, Powerful Magic, Incredible Monsters, well developed characters, action, adventure, a love triangle, sacrifice and most of all, a sense of humour, Bastard!! is definately one of my favourite all time anime titles.Reccomend the subtitled version over the dub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay the truth","review":"The anime is not that great. I think the story plot was good and I loved the fact that Darsh did not kill his old friends. But what about the ending, it def left room for more series. What will happen to the city?

Steinbeck later in his life made many a pronouncement concerning how it was the duty of the writer to capture the human spirit, in all its greatness and frailty. Unfortunately, in this novel I found few characters that even resembled human beings. It smacks of a young writer trying too hard; so packed with portents, symbols, mysticism, and pseudo-majestic dialog that I almost gave up on it several times. It reads almost like a book of the Old Testament.

Just like happens to every boys band, like new kids on the block. you will regret you liked nsync at that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS CD","review":"The Nsync No Strings Atached CD is a big waste of money. I used to be a big Nsync fan, but this CD was so bad I went back to the store to get my money back!I mean, what happened to them all of a sudden? One day they were the best group around, and the next:big losers.I will never ever spend another penny on any of their stuff again."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Boy-Band Fan","review":"I have to say that I have been adamantly opposed to the whole \\"boy-band\\" phenomenon for quite some time. And I've been quite vocal about it also. But when I heard \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" on the radio, I started to \\"secretly\\" like it. Then I secretly went out and bought the CD. Then I secretly started liking it. And last week, I finally gave up and \\"came out\\" ... I'm an 'N Sync fan. Musically, it's not the best. But you know what? It's fun, it's harmless for the most part (aside from the Digital Getdown, which was totally uncalled for). And it makes me happy when I listen to it. Where's the harm in that? Good job guys, and good on ya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE FOR GOD SAKE WE GOTTA MAKE SOME CHANGES!","review":"This is not music. Boys bands are not music. Britney spares is not music. Spice girls is not music. All this is something totally different. This is what 12 year old girls like because they are to young to appreciate music, which is fair enough.We gotta make some changes! It should be illegal to clasify all this rubbish as music. 'Music' needs to be segregated, south african style. Pop in one corner, music in the other corner. Radio stations, MTV, Amazon.com, record stores should not be aloud to mix the two up.I never want to hear a pop song ever again"},{"rating":"1","title":"A PEICE OF JUNK","review":"I have always hated N'sync and I always will.

I hear them being raved about so I thought I would borrow this from a friend. All I can say is that I am pleased I did not buy it. Bye Bye has to be the best song on it and I thought this was a poor attempt at BSB.how did it do so well in the USA, I think the UK chart showing was much more like what it deserved. this is a poor band with even poorer songs lets hope thier next effort is better or that they mean it when they say bye bye"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD Bites","review":"I am a ten year old kid who lives in Alaska.I think Pantera and Metallica rule.Down with boy bands !Everything on this CD sounds like Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music","review":"This CD is good but I am a little disapointed they did not put \\"Music Of My Heart\\" on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"\\"Bye, Bye Bye\\" is already annoying me, and the rest of the songs aren't a whole lot better.

They sing they same type of songs over and over. Justin is pretty much the lead singer, and well i think his voice is just plain annoying. It screeches and cracks.

I love \\"It's gonna be me\\", \\"Digital get down\\" and \\"Bringin' Da noise\\".The whole album's good. I don't know which of their albums are better. If you like Nsync you'll love this cd. If you like Backstreet Boys (like me) then you might think it's okay. This album is a little funky in the beats (unlike the last album). (Check out the rest of my reviews)"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD: A new lowpoint in music!","review":"I am a big fan of N Sync. However, this CD is definitely grade F. Their first CD was filled with sweet emotion, and great vocals. HOwever, this CD shows a true lack of quality and effort by these horrid group members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"Take any song by the Rolling Stones. Even take Emotional Rescue. Compare it to anything on this CD. If you have good taste, you will see that the Rolling Stones are beyond better than NSYNC.However, it's more than a little unfair to compare flash-in-the-panners with legendary rock 'n' rollers (I'll leave you to find out who's legendary and who's flash-in-the-pan). So take another band. Try the lesser-known Steely Dan. Even their fillers stand head-and-shoulders above NSYNC's work. Keep going down the line until you've found the world's most obscure garage band. Ya know what? Even that's better than this. Oh, by the way, this is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Bummed","review":"I am a HUGE 'NSYNC fan and when I heard that they were coming out with a new album, I was so excited and I couldn't wait! I'd heard that this new album was going to be a gazillion times better than the first one. Well, I bought it and I must say I wasn't impressed. I like 4 songs on the album and that's it. They've completely gone down hill. I must say that the slow-songs are WAY better then their older ones but I just wasn't impressed with their fast ones. I really wouldn't recremend this cd to you...unless you're an 'NSYNC lover and like their songs no matter what."},{"rating":"1","title":"A warning from one Mom to another","review":"This is not your typical 'Nsync album. Their first album was good. All of the songs were clean. This one is not. There are two songs that I will not let my kids listen to. And the rest of the album is not good either. I only listened to the album once. The one song that sticks out in my mind is Digital Get Down. It is about cyber relations. I am sorry but I do not want my girls listening to that. Too bad it could not have gotten a warning label for that.If you are looking for good singing and good music, go elsewhere. This album is full of computer enhanced voices. The songs are blah, the music is blah, the whole thing is just blah.I truly wish that I could have given this album no stars. One star is way too good for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN STINK","review":"n sync is just another baby band. They are such poseurs. One of the babies said he was going to pay Russia to go into space on one of their Soyuz rockets. Of course, it was just a publicity stunt. He was too scared and the Russian space agency is still waiting for him to say yes to the stupid stunt, which he won't, because he is a poseur like the other members of NSYNC.They do not play instruments, they do not write their own songs, the babies probably cannot even dress or feed themselves. They were spawned by the mega corporation \\"Disney\\", and they are one of the many contributing factors to the decline of this once great civilization.Baby Bands will fade in popularity like the leisure suit and the pet rock methinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"These fags should die, die, die","review":"Okay . . . . to start it off, I would like to state that this isn't music. It's not. Plain and simple. Synthesizers and other electronic instruments put together with their horridly silky smooth vocals is not music. It's such a shame that fags like these are polluting the radio air waves.Second of all, this recent flurry of boy bands . . . they're like fireworks. They explode at first then soon die down.Third, umm . . . let's see . . . what else . . . I know this whole review may sound judgemental and hateful, and you early-teen girls out there who like them for their looks and their dancy beat, but, plain and simple, they stink. Music these days has become so bad. We need to get back to rock - straight up good music. God save us from more bands like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is disappointing","review":"When I first heard 'Bye Bye Bye', I liked it. Then I thought: Well, they might have a nice cd which is worth buying. After borrowing the cd from my friend, I have to say that the songs lack originality and are boring. I mean, who will want to listen to a bunch of similar rap songs? I would say that Back Street Boys in comparison is better. I think I can understand why BSB is popular, but I don't understand this madness of buying a cd that isn't worth a lot.If you think I must be old, I am 14, 14 and I detest all the songs on the cd except 'Bye Bye Bye'."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT BLOW ME AWAY!","review":"Snync's new ablum just blow me away!

The Cd contains only 3-4 good songs and that I promise you song is a carbon copy of one of Richard Marx's old songs. N sync is losing the flow with this one, they don't have the dance energy as they had in the first one and none of their songs could compare to \\"I want it that way\\". all their songs dance songs except for bye bye bye sounds like remixes of giddy up.Expect to see the boys sing \\"bye bye bye\\" to themselves in 2 years or so. The same probably goes for bsb after N sync dissapears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the first, which was horrible!","review":"I know this will break a lot of hearts but these guys just cannot sing. There is not one song on this cd that isn't quickly forgotten almost immediately after a first listening. The ballad are boring and sound like millions of others done before, \\"Just Got Paid\\" actually hurt to listen to, and \\"Space Cowboy\\" was just too much. I really listened to this with an open mind, but musically this CD just doesn't work. I know it will sell millions and I know the guys are great showmen, but just please save the title \\"great musicians\\" for someone else more deserving."},{"rating":"1","title":"great expectations---even greater disappointment","review":"I had high hopes for this sophomore debut and they were all dashed the moment I got beyond track 1--the fun single \\"Bye, Bye, Bye\\". The remainder of \\"No Strings...\\" is a hodge podge of lame attempts at urban beats and luke warm romantic ballads. Their is little creativity or inspiration in this effort. Calling most of the tracks bland would be giving them way too much credit for most are simply three minutes of repetative beats and mindless lyrics. I loved the debut Nsync cd. It was fresh and full of energy. This album, however, is stale and a sad indication that \\"one hit wonder\\" may be how this band is known in the book of music history. One star is being generous. I want my money back, and Nsync should be ashamed for releasing such mindless and uninspired music to their many devoted fans who have waited so long for this cd. Shame on them! UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good songs attached","review":"I don't understand what all the hoopla is about. I listened to the whole cd and have to say it was a big letdown. Very disappointing record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Talk about attitude! There's alot of that on this cd. 'Nsync sounds very energetic. All the songs are standouts but the big ones are: \\"Bye Bye Bye\\", \\"It's Gonna Be Me\\", \\"It Makes Me Ill\\", and \\"This I Promise You\\". Their sophomore album is much better than their first. All the songs are very up-beat and the rythmn is incredible. This cd ia a must buy! You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Strings Attached--Demonstrates their musical talent!","review":"Excellent CD! The tracks have a kind of edgy sound and every track is unique. NSYNC proves that they have tons of musical talent and they will be around for a while!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Showing","review":"I had really hoped that with freer management and some experience in the music world, 'N Sync would have matured musically in the way so many artists do on their sophomore album. I'm afraid, though, that this album is just the same fodder for the radio as before, with a more hip-hop edge. Some of the songs (Digital Getdown, perhaps?) are just tiresome, and the ballads do not seem honest or fresh. I do not think this CD deserves the hype, nor the large fan following, that 'N Sync carries with its title. I regret having bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesone CD","review":"I love this album. The guys did an awesome job of writing some of the songs and producing it.

YOU GO BOYS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a zero star rating?","review":"Sorry, but this album is not that good. NSYNC is trying to hard to be someone they're not (and I have yet to figure out who that is.) \\"Bye, Bye, Bye\\" and \\"I'll Be Good For You\\" are the only songs worth listening to. If you want a real good album, check out \\"Millenium\\" from the Backstreet Boys.

Okay, so a couple of the songsare cute, and fun to dance to, but what about that Digital Get Down?JC wrote a song entirely about looking at a girl touch herself. I don't need to hear that, and I don't want to. The main possitive thing about this album is that they are still cute, but that is about all. 'NSYNC is so proud of this album, bu why? If this is really them,I'm not sure that I'll buy any more albums. 'NSYNC could, if they had stayed with the same, been around when we have kids, but if this keeps up, NSYNC won't be the number one boy band anymore. Anyone want to listen to the Backstreet Boys?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey amazon.com","review":"Okay for people who want really good music this CD will insult you will its dull lame lyrics and sounds. Remember that just because this CD sold a lot of copies doesn't mean its good. This CD has simple lyrics (take Bye, Bye Bye's simple lyrics for example), crappy sounds that wouldn't even qualify for music and of course those childish voices. Please don't make the mistake of buying this CD. Its just sad on how many people bought this CD. I pity anyone who likes N'Sync or any pop bands like them. That's just sad and I hope you people who like them will get well soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Try","review":"I thought this album was pretty good. It's extremely different from the others, though. It grows on you.And to whoever said that they were Justin up above in the reviews, nice try. You can't be. You didn't even spell *NSYNC right. It's not N'SYNC. And if you are Justin and don't know what your group's name is, I'd say you have a sad excuse for a brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on what you like!","review":"First off I would like to say that I take no position in the BSB/NYSNC war. I like music and both bands can produce some music that I like. I waited a couple of weeks before I bought this CD and asked around about the CD. The CD is really good...there are some bad apples that might spoil the bunch for you on this CD, but it all depends on what you like. I like \\"Bye, Bye, Bye\\", \\"It's Gonna Be Me\\", \\"It Makes Me Ill\\", \\"This I Promise You\\", \\"No Strings Attached\\", and \\"That's When I'll Stop Loving You\\"! This songs are really good, but keep in mind there are other songs on the CD that aren't good at all. I think the CD is good purchase, but it depends on what you like. The CD includes hip-hop beats, synth. in the background, tons of techno voice changes, and a rough, harsh overall tone! This might be the album for you...if you just like music and not involved in the BSB war, then this is a very good CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Backstreet Wannabes","review":"While some bands seem similiar to each other the way that Nsync tries to copy Backstreet Boys is just eerie. Some nsync fans will argue that it is the other way around but actually BSB has been around for a lot longer. Maybe that's why Nsync has been getting all this hype lately: they're younger. But that doesn't always mean better. Besides some really whiny songs (it makes me ill) all of these songs sound remarkably the same. Why don't you try Backstreet Boys instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate nsync","review":"nsync is what is wrong with music today.and i got a feeling that any 12-18 year old girl is gonna hate me for saying this about them but there stupid.really they are. have u actually listened to there songs ladies, i dare you to, and all of you will probably be thinking of as you girls who whorship these guys would say \\"there so hot\\",\\"i love justin\\" but really girls what does that say about there music. now granted i am a guy and that may be the reason why i find these punks annoying but all you have to do is listen to there annoying voices. but good thing i wont be able to complain about these guys much longer because face it there a boy band and as we all know boy bands never last for very long. just look at new kids on the block where in the world are they now."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP ME, I'M IN HELL ...","review":"...

I was wrong. They were better than I thought so I gave them two stars. I'll tell you why I gave them such a low rating. Well all the boybands have okay voices, but there lyrics are always about the same thing and it gets annoying after a while. Don't they have any thing better to sing about? I really don't understand the whole boy band craze. You know I really didn't like the CD. In my opinion I think that the boy band thing will go away in a few years, I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very UNATTACHED!","review":"I couldn't stand the cd, No Strings Attached. I think everyone went out and bought it after the 1st song was released (Bye Bye Bye), which was the only decent song on the album! Songs such as Space Cowboy (a song which makes no sense at all) and Digital Get Down (which should be rated PG-13; it's all about cyber sex) make you do a double take when you hear about 8 year olds buying this cd. The songs are creative, but almost too creative. When you hear the album, you can tell how hard NSync is trying to be the best compared to the Back Street Boys. But NSync hasn't been around as long as the BSB and has some things to learn about the music biz. Once that happens, their music might actually be worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG! NOO! DONT BUY!!!","review":"AAAHHH!!!! This record is probably on my top ten least favorite records list! Too bad (once again I have to say this) I can't give it 0 stars. Absolute and complete garbage. This is not music. There are no instruments, for a start, and each song is the same old lame \\"baby baby I love you\\" or \\"baby baby don't leave\\" or something along those lines. It's ALMOST comical, but I keep myself busy screaming and trying to get escape the torture when I hear any of these songs I don't have time to stop and laugh at their patheticness. heh. Definitely DO NOT BUY THIS CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the $$$","review":"I'll say right now I am REALLY not into pop. But, I have heard the entire CD and I'll try to give a non-biased review of the CD, actually backing up my points...For the most part, it's as though NSync can't figure out what they're trying to accomplish. They switch from the poppy, fun songs of \\"It's Gonna Be Me\\" and \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" to some weird dance songs like \\"Bringin Da Noise.\\" I can, however, give some respect for their acapella \\"I Thought She Knew\\" which proves at least some talent.This is one those albums that I get sick of after listening to over and over. In truth, some of the songs I could get into and they're great for just chilling out to. But if I want music to respect and truly enjoy, I want something more than five prettyboys dancing around onstage."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!!!","review":"I don't like Nsync at all, and my friend played me this cd when I was at their house, and it was terrible.

I mean come one, the backstreet boys first single off of Millenium was \\"I want it that way\\" (about them basically telling the girl that they were tired of her BS and that the relationship was basically over ) and N sync released \\"Bye, Bye, Bye\\" first.

Their new album is filled with many of the same whines as hers is - voices, themes(Digital Getdown), and the general feeling of ego before music!! Even if you liked their first recording, I would seriously consider renting this one before you spend your money on it - you've got to have a better way to throw away 17 bucks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for writing their own songs.","review":"Ok, The songs are total 0 stars, but I personally think it's cool that they write they're own music (even though they don't break out of the love, sex, the \\"band\\", and the occaisional money pop songs sceme), so they get the extra star. Ok, if I didn't know what \\"songs\\" they \\"sing\\" (it was forced upon me, honest!), I wouldn't be able to tell them from every other boy band in the universe, in fact, I thought they were The Backstreet Boys when first heard them. Ok, so maybe they do deserve 0 stars, even though they write they're own music. A tip for any members of n'sync who may read this: Justin, fros weren't made for white boys. J.C., yer not a rock star, so don't wear a rock star tshirt... AGAIN. All: do something more original with your songs, ok? That's all I gotta say."},{"rating":"1","title":"A couple good songs","review":"There are a couple good songs- \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" and \\"Its Gonna Be Me.\\" After getting the Cd and listening to the other songs on it for one or two weeks, it gets rather annoying.

I GUARANTEE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but good","review":"I have been waiting for months for the day this cd would come out, and I am not too disappoited with it. Bye Bye Bye, It's Gonna Be Me, and This I Promise You, I already heard and loved (o yeah, Max Martin rocks). But most of the other songs (with the exception of \\"It Makes Me Ill\\", \\"Space Cowboy\\", and \\"No Strings Attached\\") are just strange, not *NSYNC music at all. I don't know what JC was thinking when we wrote alot of the rest of songs. warn you: If you like \\"Bye Bye Bye\\", it doesn't mean that you will like the rest of the songs.

I can hardly wait to see the choreography for some of the new videos and on stage performances. Put this CD in your cart right now. I wasn't sure if they could top their first CD but they've done it. The first time you listen you may want to be on your feet because the beat will have you dancing in no time at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great listen.","review":"I was not an *NSync fan until their latest recording, \\"Celebrity\\" came out last July. I bought the CD the day of its release and enjoyed it so much that I bought \\"No Strings Attached\\". I was not disappointed. This album has uplifting, danceable songs (\\"Bye, Bye, Bye\\", \\"No Strings Attached\\") and sweet ballads (\\"This I Promise You\\", \\"I Thought She Knew\\") while also containing tunes that strike a middle ground (\\"It Makes Me Ill\\"). The remake of \\"Just Got Paid\\" is a commendable effort as well. The thing that is most appealing about *NSync is their willingness to experiment with their sound. The Backstreet Boys may be perfectly happy recording the same CD again and again, but eventually people will tire of that formula. The songs on \\"No Strings Attached\\" all sound different from each other, and most importantly, from *NSync's debut album. With \\"No Strings Attached\\", *NSync began to develop its own identity and sound that set the group apart from its competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD ever, Period.","review":"This is the album that busted up the record charts and made half the world Nsync fans. I think this is the best album ever made. I could listen to it non-stop. The music is so addictive you can't just sit there and listen. You have to tap your foot, or move around funky, or sing and dance just like the guys like I do. lol. But I HIGHLY RECOMEND this to everyone. I will ALWAYS LOVE this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"typical but nice","review":"Nsync's no strings attached labum could use a little work becoming unique and creative but still is very good. if at all, buy the album for the amazing last track ballad \\"I thought she knew\\" you'll be very pleased. this is a must have for all nsync fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Strings Attached","review":"N'Sync is so cool!!! This is a great alternative to dirty CDsthat has the beat you love!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"i think its the best out of all their cd's very talente singers my fav. song is this \\"I promise you\\" very pretty song it has special meaning and its a deep song"},{"rating":"1","title":"After this Album, NSYNC should be going \\"Bye Bye Bye\\"","review":"I didn't like NSYNC that much before the album, but they saidIt was going to be a new sound, so I gave them a chance. I justrealized I wasted 15.00 dollars on that CD for NOTHING! Yes, they do have a R&B beat to it, but that can't recover for the horribly cheesy, and immature lyrics that have carried over from there last album. And listen to \\"Bye Bye Bye\\", and the Backstreet Boys, \\"Don't Want You Back\\". Same message in the song..same beat behind it. And please..NSYNC fans, don't try to tell me BSB copied NSYNC with \\"Don't Want you Back\\". Yes, the names ARE similar, but the songs are totally different. I beat is different, BSB's is edgy, while NSYNC's is sugar coated. The lyrics aren't even talking about the same thing. Anyway, back to NSYNC. What is with that song \\"Space Cowboy\\"! My mother heard that, and began laughing hysterically, asking me what are you listening to. Well, trust me, if you're not under 15, don't go \\"Buy Buy Buy\\" this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Strings Attached","review":"This album is the bomb!

This is the kinda album a boy band needs to put out..hard hitting,funky,makes everyone want to dance cd. Although I am huge Nysnc fan, I know in 5 eyars they may not be around and same for BSB. BSB is trying to hards to gain adult respect but they are not going to get it, nr with Nsync and other boy bands, but Nsync packs this album with songs that their fans right now what to hear...If a boy bvand album is going to be accepted by male teens and adults, \\"No Strings Attached\\" is the album to pick up. Congraduations Justin,Lance,Joey,Chris, and JC...The fans are pleased! Cant wait to see you in concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'N SYNC is the best band out there!","review":"*NSYNC deserves all the hype they get over this album. Just because they are known as a boy band people don't listen to the songs with an open mind and diss them all the time. They really are great and this CD shows it. They are not totally pop like a lot of other boy bands, but they throw in a little R&B twist. They really do have a unique sound and the guys are REAL, unlike some boy bands who act fake. They show their true personalities in interviews and you can tell that they do. You don't have to know them personally to know that they are being themselves. This CD is their best yet and I'm sure the ones that follow will be even better. *NSYNC is the BEST!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nsync is N'credible","review":"After my 10 year old daughter received \\"No Strings Attached\\" for her birthday, I had to sit down and listen to the CD to make sure everything on it was appropriate for her. I was blown away! What a great CD! These guys can really sing and the songs just make you want to move! What a difference from the first album! Now I'm hooked and can't wait to hear what the guys have lined up for album #4! The only song that was a little questionable for the younger audience was \\"Digital Getdown\\"--I think it was a little too racy for the younger fans. (But I did catch myself walking around the house singing it!) I hope N Sync's popularity goes on long after some of the other \\"boy bands\\"(i.e. BSB!!) They deserve it! Actually I think that they are now beyond the title \\"boy band\\"--they've proven they are more than just another flash in the pan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Cd in the world","review":"Okay all I can say is that you parents out there who have little children should let them listen to this CD except for #8.

Well, sadly, there isn't any (except for two, hence the 2 stars). I am really surprised by this seeing that these guys are \\"clones\\" of BSB (and should at least have 4 to 5 really good songs and the rest being audible) and they have some excellent song writers with them, too. But, all in all, this album has very little longevity. And I'm surprised that Space Cowboy, with Left Eye's help, isn't that up beat and catchy. If these guys want respect, they should hook people with real music (and it doesn't hurt if they write some, too) and not their looks. And, I'm pretty sure it's not just me, but Justin T's voice isn't all that (it sometimes gets anoying). Okay job for the songwriters -- THEY deserve the credit despite how little it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Rating","review":"I think Nsync is a great band.

I think they should stick more with POP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong lack of Substance!","review":"I've grown somewhat weary of witnessing this rable of talent-less pretty boys lip-syncing and dancing about! I was under the assumption that some sort of creative genesis was supposed to take place when composing a song. Well, this group (as does the vast majority of today's pop icons) does not even write their own music. They sing what they are told to sing and live up to standards generated by fans 1/2 their age.Purchase this album if you wish to submerce yourself in nonsensical substance-less rubish!YUCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An adult N'SYNC fan speaks out","review":"As an adult interested in a large amount of music, I must say thanks to N'SYNC for a great new album. Everyone knows that the music isn't set out to be Mozart, but for an upcoming group it is wonderful. With harmonies that put the all in unison BSB to shame, and the ability to actually sing live, I loved it. I think the use of a number of different producers expanded thier range and displayed the talent this group actually has. This is the only \\"boy band\\", if you would call them that, that has the talent for staying power. Good Luck guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless dribble...","review":"Normally I wouldn't care what nsync is doing, but I can't help but be force-fed time and time again with the same MEANINGLESS DRIBBLE thanks to big corporate payoffs at MTV and others behind the scene.The name of the album is an oxymoron, for you all know deep down in your hearts, that the record company is milking these kids for EVERYTHING they can get.I have no problem with people buying or supporting nsync, as long as you don't live in denial of the lack of integrity these \\"puppets\\" display.The love of your life cannot be bought, and is probably right where you least expect it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"What was so great about boybands? Its 5 guys singing (very poorly singing) love songs (that they didn't write themselves) over a processed beat and synthesizers. Does that sound interesting? If you answered yes, then answer this: how about their concerts, where they lip-sync and dress up in silly glam costumes running around the stage doing their gay dance moves? Does that sound interesting? If you answered yes to all of the above, then I guess this is for you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Strings Attached","review":"Oops they did it again, hehehe ! (Sorry Britney)I love this CD, now while the previous one was a little better (to me!), I'll Be Good For You is my favorite song on here.

Wooo he makes my knees weak!Let's not forget Justin in Digital Getdown--baby baby we can do all that we want, we're gettin' nasty nasty, we're getting freaky freaky uh uh, baby baby we can do more than just talk 'cause I can hear ya hear ya and I can see ya see ya, baby baby we can do all that we want, we're getting nasty nasty, we're getting freaky freaky freaky freaky! -- Woo Hoo Justin, You Go Boy!They put this CD together and made it work!

A majority of the songs are lively with an upbeat style. I highly recommend this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"n'synch again","review":"Honestly, I liked this album better than their freshman one. This seemed to have a more mature flare to it. The R&B twist was great. I liked all the songs. One was a remake of a really really old song (Just got paid). The only problem was there were not enough songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listened to it twice...now it's gathering dust on my desk","review":"*sigh* How naive was I two years ago....I thought THIS was talent. The songs get boring FAST! Heck, I remember having to CONVINCE myself to like this CD when I first had it because of my crush on JC (thank gawd that's over with too). The way they organize the songs is also attrocious. Going from a straight up dance club song like \\"Brinin' Da Noise\\" all the way down to a ballad like \\"That's When I'll...\\". WTH were they thinkin???? However, I have heard they mature in their new CD \\"Celebrity.\\" Unfortunatly, I don't care enough to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter trash","review":"OK, so this is me venting:I find it absolutely appalling that such mass-produced garbage can sell zillions of copies while bands with actual TALENT are struggling to make a living.I hate the fact that America's youth automatically devours everything that they are force-fed by the media. Kids are learning to buy everything that has a pretty face (or five) on the cover. How unhealthy.Here's a thought, boys: Learn to play an instrument. Or at least write your own songs. I might not like your music, but at least you'd be respectable.On the rare and unfortunate instance where I hear a \\"boy band\\" song, I am literally unable to determine who's singing it. *Nsync and BSB aren't musicians; they're competing products, like Coke and Pepsi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gr8","review":"This is the only nysnc cd I've got, and i hafta say it is good. bye bye bye is an awesome hit.

Something RARE in the music market now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually laughed out loud","review":"After borrowing the c.d. from a friend, I laughed at how horrible No Strings Attached is.

I said that those copies would be at used Cd stores in no time. This is the pinnacle of bad music. I remember when they said New Kids On the Block were overpromoted and bad, well look at this group and the backstreet Boys. 10 Years from now they will be the most laughable bands in the world.

I loved their first album and I have been anxiously awaiting their sophmore album. Well, now that I have it i absolutely love it! It is so different from their first album, but it's great. I love all the songs on the cd. 'Digital Getdown'is a great song which surprised me both in the lyric's and in the middle of the song where they put some jungle beats in! I wouldn't be surprised if they used parts of this song at a rave. I also love 'This I Promise You' and 'It's gonna be me', as well as all the other songs on the cd. I can't wait for their up comming tour it's gonna be awsome! I would definately recommend to everyone to go out and buy this cd because I am sure you will love it and to go to at least one of their concerts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Ok but not as good as the other one","review":"I was really excited for this cd to come out, but when i got it today, i realized how bad it is. All the songs sound the same. There's only 3 good songs on it: Bye Bye Bye, Space cowboy, and This I promise you. The rest is just the same songs over and over with different words. But dont take my word on it. Go listen to it for yourself. All you *NSYNC fans that are writing great stuff about the cd, when you know it's bad, that's just pathetic. THE CD IS TERRIBLE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome cd! A must buy!","review":"This cd is as good, if not better than the debut album.

When I listened to the songs the music and the words I skipped 6 songs. I felt like i wasted my money but my daughter wanted it and she only likes half of the cd too. I can hear her in her room skipping songs. I can't wait for the awards shows to come out and see if any of the cd or the cd itself gets nominated for anything. I seriously doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"......Isn't that great","review":"This cd....isn't that great. The only song I liked decently was \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" they brag about how they wrote more songs on this album but the sound of this album is lazy. It doesn't have any real feeling in the songs. I say they should have spent a little more time on this cd before releasing it. It isn't worth buying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Down Right Awful!","review":"This CD is nothing what I expected from N Sync! The only good song- Bye Bye Bye is the only thing keeping the album about. It sounds like they just threw in all these stupid lame beats and then tried to put a song to them...GIVE ME A BREAK! Especially \\"Space Cowboy\\". If you like them yipping their butts off then you'll love it, but Lisa Left Eye Lopes shouldn't have even done a part in the song. After the first song the CD goes soaring into the ground. It's like an LP from outer space. Save your money and go buy some other CD! I've been waiting for this CD to come out, but now that it did, i am surprised with what came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This CD has some high points. The first time that I hear it I was going to review it with a 0 (God forgive me). But I listened to it again today and I must say it improved. Some of these tracks I couldn't even bear to listen to. However the ballads are these mens strong point. In this CD I see an attempt at acceptance and credibiltiy that they do not achieve. They became mega stars through dance pop and while I understand that they had to branch out this CD went from pop to two years later rock-ish. I thought that the first single, \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" was promising, and what I heard of \\"This I Promise You\\" was great before I bought it. The last three tracks are some of the best of this CD- only half of it is bearable. BsB branched out without losing their roots and it made for a great second effort while 98 Degrees did the same. Both of their second efforts were successful but I don't think NSYNC will have that off the music of this CD. Its just not as good as the first time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say CACA?","review":"THIS HAS TO BE THE LAMEST AND WORST ALBUM OF THE YEAR. ALL N'SNYC HAS ARE THERE STUPID LOOKS.

I love the way that there is a little rap in it. It make it a little different then there first c.d. the 1998 c.d. there is a lot more songs on it like bye bye bye and This I Promise you and even Space Cowboy with Left eye on that c.d. that is the reason that I gave it 5 stars because it is the bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Boys Turn Bad, (in a Good way!)","review":"I'm sick of everyone saying that these guys blew it this time around.

Yet they still linger beneath the surface, waiting to rise again. We have four who never used this horrid band as a catalyst to start something else, and then you have this yellow-haired clown invading the media worse than anthrax. And yet, you know that this single clown is going to keep reminding us that, yes Virginia, there were boy bands.As for the cd, please do yourself a favor and don't buy this crap.

First of all *Nsync can't harmonize, which BSB does beautifully. And it's mostly Justin that sings. All of the Backstreet Boys sing solo. Okay it's mostly Nick, Brian and AJ that have have solos but I've never heard anyone in *Nsync except Justin and JC sing solo. Plus BSB is more mature. The first single off \\"Black and Blue\\" was \\"Shape Of My Heart\\", which is a slow not so much of a pop song. The first single off *Nsyncs new Cd is \\"Pop\\", which is, of course, a pop song. I bought \\"No Strings Attached\\" because of \\"Bye Bye Bye\\", I'm sorry I did. The CD is a total flop. I know I'm not buying \\"Celebrity\\". So now you now how I feel.

They have also pulled in some styles from their debut album, such as their 5-part harmonies, and their ballads. I love * Nsync, and this album is great.

When i read the professional review, I was shocked at the fact at how biased the reviewer was to the Backstreet Boys. I think *N Sync, on this cd, have proven themselves as individuals, and not just followers of the Backstreet Boys and the rest of the \\"boy bands\\". This cd has a new sound from their old one...partly because they did things the way they like it, it's not your normal \\"bubble-gum\\" pop they are so often labeled with. I recommend this for all listeners, because you will be able to tell how much heart and dedication *N Sync has put into each and every song. I think this cd will prove that *N Sync is not just a flash in the pan, and that they will be around even after this teen pop faze is long gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is stupid","review":"*N Sync is the stupidest group I have ever heard. All their songs are idiotic and annoying. \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" is the worst song ever(Not as bad as anything by Britney Spears). I can't believe that people actually like this stuff.

I would suggest buying some REAL music by someone like Eminem."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd is absolutely terrible","review":"i have to say i havent actually heard the whole cd, but thats only because its so awful and repetitive, i couldnt stand to listen to the entire thing without losing it. anyone who thinks that the boys of nsync have any musical talent what so ever have problems and need to try listening to some real music. i have pity in my heart for all of you losers who gave this cd a 5 star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, just, yuk!","review":"As many of you know, all the rock reviews I write I give 3-5 stars on cuz none of them are as bad as this. Maybe I hate a couple songs but I have actually listened to this CD. From all the singles, I knew they were a pretty terrible band. But I've learned out there while liking the bands Incubus and Papa Roach while having their CDs, I know a lot of people out there that hate those bands because of their singles. But I listened to it. It all sounds alike on how they want a girl back and stuff like that. All like the singles. Besideds, the fans only care about the singles anyways. Supposedly JC and Justin wrote some of the songs, but they have no experience in it whatsoever. The band knew each other but still had to get formed together by some guy. That's pethetic. This band has had no struggle whatsoever as people or as a group. I'd give it a 0/5 rating if I could.

And one more thing, I thought they were a group--5 guys singing and sharing songs, BUT the whole cd was like JC, and the blonde curly haired dude, uh, what's his name?? not important-- oh wait, Justin. It was like JC and Justin's album, with some vocal assistance from the other not so well-known members for the group. It's just an annoying CD. I like NSYNC, but this could've been a better CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk. Period.","review":"My sister has this CD. Not a sound made by these so called men sounds close to good.

It is simply impossible to use N'Sync and variety in the same sentence.This has got to be songs that were left over from the last album. If they wanted to keep the fans from the last album by staying with the same sound, they have done that. The song titles even show that this is essentialy the same album as before and as before only two of the five members sing! By way of comparison, The Backstreet Boys song \\"Show Me the Meaning...\\" features ALL FIVE members singing solo at some point! And the comparisons don't end there. The five part harmony of BSB is far superior, N'Sync's sounds a little muddled and sometimes sound off key!I guess, to make up for these short comings, the \\"Bye,Bye,Bye\\" music video had to be made into a mini-movie because the song was lacking!Welcome to the new age of the bubblegum popstar. God have mercy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible album","review":"This album is simply terrible. The songs are very boring, uncreative and cheaply written.

And anyway, whoever writes these jokers' lyrics needs to be fired, 'cause all of the songs are virtually the same!! The top reason I despise this form of music is the fact the singles are played twelve times an hour. Don't people get tired of that ? Oh well.

I think that it's right that if good bands last a long time like this one. But once a couple of years gone by and they don't look so hot, popular, especially new they'll begin to fade. All I'm saying is that they will last a very long time but not forever. All songs are good but not great but I still urge you all to try it out and buy it. I have my own opinion and you have yours.

Why I wasted my 14 dollars I am not entirely sure but No Strings Attached will not be likely to be nominated for album of the year believe me. the songs are too didgitalized. In almost every song there is a distinct digital tinge to their voices. I enjoy hearing people not computers singing. the ballads are too syrupy. much props to Richard Marx though who wrote the only song on this album that really made sense. Thank you for that. Also, again, the two guys with the most nasel voices sing nearly the entire album. If that bothers anyone else please tell me. Anyways you guys are really cute but sweeties looks aren't everything.

'N Sync represents everything that is wrong with the music industry. I remember a time when \\"bands\\" didn't have to dance around on stage lip syncing. Back in the good old days, band members actually played instruments and wrote their own music. (See the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Beatles, Queen, Led Zeppelin, etc.)With their second album \\"No Strings Attached,\\" 'N Sync provides more of their trademark: synthesized, danceable pop tunes. Musically, it's nothing special, but MTV propoganda should help it achieve multi-platinum status.There's a big difference between trendy music and good music, and No Strings Attached is clearly just trendy. If trendy is your style, then go ahead and buy this, but five years from now you'll be asking yourself, \\"What was I thinking?\\" Just ask your older sister about \\"Hangin' Tough\\" by New Kids on the Block."},{"rating":"1","title":"bye bye bye: lack of substance cd YUCKKKKKKKK!","review":"this is not the n sync that i've known before. they know that their newest album is bad that is why whenever they sing a song from the album, they were only choosing the dianne warren song and the richard marx song. you guys don't have the voice to sing hip hop so stay with your ballads. the cd is sooo baddd that i want to sell it back. i can't believe i waste my money for this considering that i had been waiting for this album for a long time. also justin, give the other boys the chance to shine. you think you are the boss in the group all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Bad Album","review":"N Sync's sophomore album shows a lack of quality throughout almost every track. The vocals sound strained during most of the songs, possibly due to digital enhancement. It was very hard to determine if there were also any actual live instruments used, most sounded like they had been produced by a computer. The new R&B/Rap approach taken to some tracks also seems to be taking a step away from their current teeny-bopper style. All in all, the songs, vocals, and engineering all fall flat and sound extremely hollow.

And the nkotb lead singer which had range and actually sounded like a real singer.and nkotb werent manufactured they had talent. nsync are totally manufactured and have no talent.If you think nsyncs lead singer justin and the other guys in nsync sing better than new kids or other 80s pop bands your ears and your brain are not working properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is dumb","review":"nsync to me is a great group but this cd they made me to hate them i say its a dumb cd dont buy it ok i was a big fan but i am now the last fan to vote for them"},{"rating":"1","title":"This has so many strings attached, its not even funny...","review":"Ok, \\"Bye, Bye, Bye\\" and \\"Its Gonna Be Me\\" are ok, but their voices on all of these are so computerized you can tell!

Too upbeat for me, I'd listen to Britney Spears over this. The only reason this got so many good reviews is because they are *NSYNC. Not because they sound good.

No Strings Attached is a phoney account of a boys undeniable love for another girls (or boys) yearning. (isn't that what all the songs are about?). Love has many faces and an innumerable and immeasureable degree of facets to explore. Nsync does not delve into the depths of love, they skim the surface in a disposable kind of way, rehashing the same love games and going through the motions over and over until we all had enough. One dimentional in it's approach, will No Strings Attached be an album that will defy the unforgiving course of longevity? No. With such remakes as Johnny Kemp's \\"Just got Paid\\", and a slew of other monotone embelishments, Nsync fail to hold a note, even if dropped in a bucket.

These boys are SO talented and this album really shares their nasty side (\\"Digital Get Down\\"), their sweet and sensitive side (\\"This I Promise You\\", \\"I Thought She Knew\\", and \\"That's When I'll Stop Loving You\\"), and of course the usual boy band appeal in \\"It's Gonna Be Me\\" and \\"Bye Bye Bye\\".

My friends and I were hoping that with all this hype that this cd would be different than there first. But they have proved this wrong.

When an artist or group changes it's complete sound to match what is popular at that time is a SELLOUT! Because they are selling out, they have no trademark sound, and no passion is put in the songs.

THe rest, well it seems like they don't try to rhyme or make good lyrics at all, they just produced a cool beat and then just talked normally with no rhythm or rhyming or anything that even the bsb or 98 degrees could've done with such a kickin' beat, so they get 1 star"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's been worth the wait!","review":"It is about time that NSYNC got their CD out. But trust me, it is well worth the wait! This CD is packed with excellent songs. I also like the way that NSYNC is trying songs and styles of singing that other boy bands haven't yet. They are definatly talented. If you had any doubts about this then go out and buy the CD. It is definatly worth the money, and I promise you that you will be happy with this CD! Happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This album is very good! Their harmonies are very well blended, and it is definiltely worth the wait! I highly reccomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!","review":"i thought that the nsync was a poor excuse and a waste of a cd... it was one of the worst cd's i have ever heard and ihave been a die hard nsync since day 1 so you dont know how long i waited for this cd to come out and it was such a dissapointment. I recommend not wasting your money on this terrible cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their BEST","review":"I bought the new NSYNC cd last night, and it is AMAZING. i was blown away by the awesome beats, lyrics and their beautiful voices. \\"i thought she knew,\\" a song sung completely accapella, is very VERY good, and \\"digital getdown\\" is a interesting dance song. Their collaboration with Left Eye from TLC is very cool, and i thought the rap fit in wonderfully. i think even NON-nsync fans would enjoy this cd, it rocks. guys will feel for these songs, because they are realistic, and the slow songs arent sappy at ALL! GREAT CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"I know I already did A reveiw, and I know this one will be even more unpopular, but Listen to me--This is a new Cd! That is all it is. And all it changes is that 'N Sync has 2 Cd's and not 1. It doesn't change 'N Sync's personality, it doesnt change Backstreet Boys' personalities and it sure doesn't change Backstreet Boys' music. These songs are pushovers and hopefully won't ever show up again. So explain to me why exactly BSB fans suddenly hate Backstreet Boys. Last I checked, Digital Get Down didn't tell people with this Cd to abandon all other groups. The CD certainly isn't worth that"},{"rating":"1","title":"BYE BYE BYE......AND GOOD RIDDENCE!!!","review":"N sync, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees. Why do this all sound familiar? Oh yeah now I remember. New Kids on the Block ten years ago. Yeah they had some hits themselves but after their third album bombed, they was never heard from again. Do these boy bands today have any idea how bad they sound? I guess a producer can do just about anything when they turn the music all the way up and the vocals down. When the sappy bubble gum music die out (AGAIN), are these no talented-can't sing-no instrument playing, dancing morons going to wake up and smell the coffee? I guess we won't know until two years from now...when they're on VH1's Behind the Music, Where are they now?...or the E True Hollywood Stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"nsync has no talent no matter what anyone says","review":"nsync has no talent no matter what anyone says. they cant sing, they cant play insruments, they only co-wrote a couple of songs on here. and trust me any nsync fan thinks that they are the best thing that ever happended to music. well there not. there the worst thing that ever happended to music. face all their fans just like them for justin and jc ."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY the record sales !","review":"hey NSYNC you maybe going up the charts but you need to be more mature on your songs ! and stop trying so hard ! BSB & Westlife got my vote !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do I begin...?","review":"Even though they did break the sales record, it doesn't make the c.d. any better. I actually felt sorry for N Sync when I heard the songs \\"It Makes Me Ill,\\" \\"Digital Get Down\\", and \\"It's Gotta Be Me.\\" How embarrasing! And please, ladies, put your hormonese on \\"hold\\" and actually listen to the c.d."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"I was REALLY disappointed when I found out that \\"Somewhere, Someday\\" and \\"Only Through Heaven's Eyes\\" weren't on this cd. Those two songs are really beautiful ballads that show NSYNC's true talent... I like the song \\"This I Promise You\\", but it lacked the quality of \\"Somewhere...\\" and \\"Only Through...\\" \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" is a catchy song but it gets old REALLY FAST... The rest of the songs are so computerized and they all have this annoying wannabe-techno sound. Well, I know that NSYNC is going to make even more money when they come out with an import album with the only really good songs- \\"Somewhere...\\" and \\"Only Through...\\" I am a 14 year old girl so don't get me wrong here, I'm not some anti-pop-music person... I just don't consider this that great... but no one will listen to what I say... all the die-hard fans would still buy this cd even if it was just blank airtime... All I can say is that for me, it's \\"byebyebye\\" to NSYNC..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Work.","review":"Now don't get me wrong, I like N'SYNC, and some of these songs are good. But alot of these songs were a big disapointment, and I did not like the rap songs at all. Plus, what happened to \\"Music Of The Heart(From \\"Music Of My Heart),\\" and \\"Somewhere Someday (From \\"Pokemon: The First Movie)?\\" If these songs were on this CD, it would have been a lot better. Still buy this CD if you're a die-hard N'SYNC fan. But if you just like some of their songs, this CD might make you glum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put this into your shopping cart","review":"This is a great CD with a bunch of hip-hop and dancing tracks. It will get you up on your feet in no time. No Strings Attached also really showcases their fine musical talent. A must-have for any N'Sync or non N'Sync fan. Congratulations to the group on a job well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep trying N' Sync","review":"N' Sync's new album is definitely many steps behind their debut album... proving that this boy band lacks the talent that other bands like the Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees have. The major quality lacking in this album is a solid ballad... the ones on the album are decent, but not worth hearing over again. The album's saving grace is their hit \\"Bye, Bye, Bye\\" and another song with a great beat: \\"Gotta Be Me.\\" Nevertheless, think twice before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars","review":"I can't believe you people listen to this music.

It has a couple good songs but the rest stink and sound like they tried to copy their first album. And I waited all that time for nothing!You think since they stalled the debut of the album that it'd be good. Too bad it's not!No I'm not a 50 year old who hates pop music and listens to Bruce Springsteen all day. I'm a teen and usually listens to Pop music.Sorry N'Syncers! It's just not all that that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Away from \\"pop\\"","review":"I think pop isn't really the correct label for 'N Sync anymore. Their music is more about their dancing. If you listen to this album, the majority of the songs are dance tunes, where the guys can easily choreograph to. The three slow songs in the album, \\"This I Promise You\\", \\"That's When I'll Stop Loving You\\" and \\"I Thought She Knew\\" are great. The last one shows their great harmonies because it's an a capella. This is definitely different from when their released their debut album because not all the songs sound as much alike anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rox!","review":"Its so awesome. It's really really good! its really a lot better then the 1st album. U really should get it caz it ROX! hey everyone from waynflete and CMFG u rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing great","review":"I never liked all these little boy bands and I never will. I don't think I'll ever know why so many people love N sync. Yeah they're cute but what else? Some of their songs are okay, like \\"Its gonna be me,\\" but the other ones i'm sick of! Like, after hearing \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" three times I never wanted to listen to it again! I'm soooooooo sick of these guys. The only 2 other decent songs on the cd are \\"This I promise you\\" and \\"digital get down.\\" Other than that, i dont know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon was Right! 'Nysnc Isn't as good as they should be!","review":"I am totally agree w/the Editorial Review, 'nysnc isn't as good as Backstreet boy in terms of voice and their songs' topics are lame! \\"Ditigal\\", and some R&B wannabe.... COM'on! give me a break! \\"This I promise you\\" is the only acceptable song among the rest. I was planning to download their mp3 songs on the web (for a sampling purposes ONLY of course) but u know what, their \\"talent\\" just killed my interest.

I agree with the person on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nsync better than bsB !","review":"Not in a million years. My friend Marketta bought the cd and I borrowed it. There were a few good songs but you cant compare any of the songs to Backstreet Boys \\"I want it that way\\". The songs on \\"Millennium\\" were songs that adults and young people alike can enjoy. Anyways BsB isnt selling out like Nsync, Nsync has a movie to do, McDonalds commercial and now according to MTV they are gonna have lip balm. Does this remind you of the Spice Girls? Anyways BsB arent sellouts and if Nsync wants to last they better not worry about how much money they make and study more on music. On their next cd all the members should get solos like BsB did on theirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"nsync rules!","review":"nsyns is #1!they are the bestest band in the world! all the songs on the cd are great!number 6 this i promise you is so so so good , and so sweet!i love nsync ecspecially justin timberlake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"embarrassing","review":"My family are thoroughly disgusted by the lack of talent....if they weren't made by the founder in orlando, florida (also did Backstreet boys, LFO...etc) These lip syncing irregulars remind me of Banarama...and other lip syncing sucesses....burn the CD before other girls ages 10-18 throuwup...........terrible album"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Strings Attached","review":"NSA is an awesome CD and well worth the wait. If you like *NSYNC you'll love this CD. This sound is a little different but it makes it better. *NSYNC is by no means second to BSB.

Thanks - this is a great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I was surprised by the album after I bought it. At first I thought they were trying to replicate other peoples songs, like Destiny's Child and Michael Bolton, but the more I listen to it the more I like the sound. I really love the love songs, \\"That's when I'll stop loving you\\" and \\"This I promise you.\\" \\"It's gonna be me\\" is a great song to really jam to. Really all the songs make you want to dance whether your out on the floor or in your car. Great CD. I think Amazon was a little critical. I am a BSB fan but I think N'Sync's new album is too diverse to even compare it to BSB. Too different talents. Buy the CD.

It somehow does not feel very innovative. It's sounds like they just tried to emulate some of their earlier hits and see what direction they took.

Now we all know."},{"rating":"2","title":"After All These Years","review":"I still love this CD. I mean i put in it my computer and I still remember every word to every song.

First of all, their \\"dancing\\" gives me the willies. You knowthat \\"Space Cowboys\\" song where they try to miserably immitate Cypress Hill? It is so cheesy. The front of there Cd lookes the like the guy on the far right is trying to show off his new deoderant to the guy next to him, (I don't know what their names are, thank god) and they look they are marionetts. I like punk rock, pop rock, and metel, so obviuslly this would want to chuck their stupid cd into the toilet.

The upbeats are somewhat familiar with nothing really interesting to hear about. Either the concepts were the same, or the arrangements were. What was disappointing in this album was the fact that there was a lack of serious topics. There were too many songs about things little kids would sing about. It gets pretty dull. I gave this cd 2 stars because the ballads were pretty beautiful. The a cappella was amazing and showed me that NSync weren't just another boy band. They should do more ballads next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best by far!!!!!!!","review":"I have to admit, I feared I would be disapointed, after Millenium, but No Strings Attached is the best album by far!!!!

This is a great CD and I would advice anyone to get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype - too little substance!","review":"I like good music. I don't go crazy over a band because of an over-hyped image. I listen to music for the music, period. This CD is okay but not in the league with the Backstreet Boys. As the prices of CDs keeps going higher (even though the cost of making a CD is dirt cheap), I believe that the quality of ALL the songs on a CD should go up as well. This CD has just too many filler songs that are just bland. Save your money.

However, no matter how much I tried to convince myself that it was worth buying, I just could not like it. I have to admit that songs like \\"Bye Bye Bye,\\" \\"It's Gonna Be Me,\\" \\"This I Promise You,\\" and \\"That's When I'll Stop Loving You\\" sound fairly nice, and few boybands could do acapella as well as they did on \\"I Though She Knew.\\" But what are the other tracks about? Every time I listen to the CD, I have to skip the songs for they seemed harmful to my ears.One thing I have to commend on the guys is that they wrote some tracks themselves. Although they don't sound very good, at least they were willing to create something on their own. Besides, this one sounds much better than their next album \\"Celebrity.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I find it hard to believe that this CD has such an awesome song as \\"This I Promise You\\" and the rest is, well, not good.

On most \\"songs\\", it sounds as though the boys are chokeing while singing, or haveing a seisure of some sort.

No matter how much I try to listen to this album, it doesn't work out for me. Most of the songs are totally written like garbage. It's true that \\"bye bye bye\\" can not compare with \\"I want it that way\\". *N sync might as well be going solo. It's just Justin and Jc show. With their new album celebrity coming out, they still look like teens and \\"pop\\" sounds pretty cheesy for the promising hit single for the album. To the fans of Nsync: it is the backstreet boys who broke away from the teen industry. BSB looks more different, their songs sound more like adult contemporary nowadays. N sync has to mature in order to stay within the charts otherwise expect a vh-1 show, \\"where are they now?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disgrace to music","review":"let me just put it this way...i personally think that Nsync should go Bye Bye Bye. This I Promise You for sure. NSYNC [StinkS]!! but i have to admit, if they actually played their own instruments, wrote their own songs, didn't lip-sink in concerts, didn't do their little ... dances, didn't perm their hair, and didn't wear rouge lip-stick, i might just give them 2 stars. I just have no respect for this group, honesty. Theyre not even worthy of be called a band, cause if my senses are correct, in order to have a band you gotta play instruments, and not use computerized sycnopated rythms. the message im trying to get across here is that i HIGHLY DISLIKE nsync. Teen Idols???? yeah right..VIVA ROCK N' ROLL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...","review":"I think this pretty much sums up the similarities of NSYNC's music.

I bought this CD for my niece and I listened to the whole thing and I wanted to skip every song. I thought that if I listened to it a couple more times that the songs would grow on me. BIG MISTAKE! The songs began to annoy me even more. I think they tried too hard to distance themselves from the \\"boy band\\" sound that they forgot what real music sounds like. The songs are too digitalized you can't hear their real voices and the songs begin to sound repetitive. Some of the songs are even innapropriate like \\"Digital get down.\\" The only song I really liked was \\"Bye...,\\" but now that one is beginning to annoy me. Even my niece, who is a really big Nsync fan, only likes about four songs on the album.

Then my parents got me the CD for my birthday. So I sat down and listened to it, and I have to say that I liked what I heard. I did get a bit tired of the songs because they play them ont the radio so much, but all in all, I liked the CD. It's different from their old CD, but you can still tell that it's them. They also had alot more say as to what went on to the album this time, and I think that they did a great job with the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"'NSYNC STILL SUCKS!!!","review":"This CD SUCKS. Well, the group itself SUCKS. They can't sing, nor do they look good (they're extremely OOGLY). They're vocals are even worse. I never did like them. I never will like them. If you want to hear some great music, buy all of Boyz II Men and 98 Degrees CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE TURN IT OFF","review":"ok, so it's nsync, but really i just don't see how they have sold so many copies of this. i do not hate nsync in fact, i pre-ordered NSA and couldn't wait for it to arrive. but the music just doesn't live up to all the hype. it is almost like they tried WAY too hard to out-do labelmates, the backstreet boys, whose latest cd millennium is a much better bet. truthfully, i wouldn't suggest wasting your money on this album, you'll get limited use out of it (until the next bsb cd). there are i guess 5 out of 12 songs that I can stand, but trust me, they are all very corny and come across as a bunch of 40 yr olds trying to get that one last hit, well technically, that is what it is. sorry guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whasup, *N Sync?","review":"I don't know what happened but *N Sync lost their groove. I was previously impressed with their self-titled album but this one is just not them. The sound effects of this were too digital and not sincere. I think the group is trying to hard to sound tough and edgy. Why not be sweet, talented, singing angels?At first the first two songs were literally great. But then, they got way too overplayed. The whining of Justin and JC are too off key and what happened to Lance, Joey, and Chris? This CD was entirely the Justin and JC show.Do yourself a favor and don't buy it. I have better experiences with Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaaaaaaaaghhhhhhh Trash Trash Trash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This Cd is just another Jive from Jive records in attempt to stab the pockets of teenage girls This Cd shows again and again that in todays music industry will do anything to turn a quick buck .

If you could avoid this cd please do for your sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Lou Pearlman Doesn't Think They Are Any Good","review":"No Strings? No discernable talent. No listenable music. No nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"ewwwwwww...","review":"when i heard this cd sold 4 million copies, i thought it did FOR A REASON! i just got it today and it's a HUGE disappointment. The songs are very monotonous and they all sound the same. *NSync have tried to change their style from pure pop to rock/techno and have miserable failed at it. the only two songs that are good are not because of their vocals - but because of the instrumental sounds. And they dont even PLAY instruments... i don't really support this NSync- BSB rivalry, but i have to say, BSB is MUCH more polished."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mammoth classic from a band to be FEARED.","review":"NSYNC's second album broke first week sales records that NOBODY ELSE can top. This album had the group at the TOP of their game, and Justin Timberlake wowed the crowd with his stage charisma and blazing talent. This record continues to sell strong, moving at least million units a year. Also, special congratulations to Lance Bass for coming out of the closet. It takes a REAL MAN to be honest about yourself, and I totally respect Lance for that. Five stars.

These boy band lovers say classic rock fans are caught up in the past well at least my favorite band is still together. And so is a lot of other classic rock bands. They think NSYNC is so cool because they have had two hit albums. Well I'll tell you somethin' about Styx. THEY WERE THE FIRST MUSICAL ARTISTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD TO HAVE BOTH 4 & 5 CONSECUTIVE MULTI-PLATINUM ALBUMS! AND THEY ARE ALSO THE ONLY MUSICAL ARTISTS TO HAVE TOP 10 HITS IN 4 DIFFERNET DECADES THE 70S, 80S, 90S, AND 2000S.

Same songs on a different album and not surprisingly the voices all seem the same. These guys better make all the money they can before their looks go Bye Bye Bye and we start hearing \\"paper or plastic?\\" Why did I let my kids get it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mature music fans be weary...","review":"When you compare this cd to its success the actual cd comes in at 2nd place. Hype has fueled this mega hit cd in many ways. This cd is definatley not for the mature music listener, but is quite sutitable for the youth. It, infact, is a perfectly produced piece for the young masses. Although, I think that anyone truly into music will find little in the cybersex driven lyrics, and the nice, but quite frankly weak ballads. Many teenyboppers would argue differently. Yes, it may be a hit on the charts, but to anyone mature music listener you will be safer in treading in the shallow waters of the other boy band's- the Backstreet Boys'- Millennium, which offers a more adult look a pop music...however weird it may sound..."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for Bye Bye Bye","review":"I'm sorry to all those *NSYNC fans out there. But this CD wasn't what I expected it to be. After hearing \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" I was like \\"I got to get their album\\" and couldn't wait for it. When I bought and heard it. I was so dissappointed that I returned it back. I thought that these guys were going to be in a fast tempo based album. However they couldn't sing fast tempo songs. Stick to your ballads boys. Once again one star for \\"Bye Bye Bye\\". This CD is strongly recommended to NSYNC fans not for other people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NSYNC LOVER","review":"I just love Nsync's new album.

Despite the sales, it deserves no recognition."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to real music?","review":"When I turn on the T.V. I usually manage to turn on a boy band. I have to think to myself, where has all the talent gone? Todays artists such as NSync are unable to comunicate skill to me and many others. Their lyrics (If you can call them their lyrics) show no meaning. They are shallow and completely superficial. I worry about today's youth listening to this music. It is not right for today's younger society to think that selling sex appeal is a good way to make money. So all of the critics out there you have a parental label on some CD's, you should put one the boy band alblums reading \\"Parental Advisory: We are selling your child the idea that sex appeal is a good way to make money.\\" But instead, there are \\"No Strings Attached.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"it's supposed to be zero satrs","review":"Hand me a barf bag! This is so bad! They better come up with another CD quick if they want to win anything! BSB still seem to rule even though this album has sold more but hey who can blame the guys if they weren't put together right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"N Sync is ... pink bubblegum teenybopper [music]....The music is bland, tasteless and hasno theme to it whatsoever. I don't call this music. Real music is ... stuff that has power. This CD does not have that. I put it on for 2 seconds and I couldn't stomach it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"I am not really a fan of Nsync, but since this album got so much attention I decided to purchase it. In my opinion, the two songs they play on the radio are the best ones. Most of the other songs sound similar and just like one continuous song. Some of the songs are even quite cheesy at times and the singing is kind of annoying. Perhaps this album was rushed a bit to compete with other bands. They should have spent a little more time on it. I think I'll stick with BSB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shut the F#@k up you.....","review":"Shut the F#@k up you whinning little bi@#ches. Stop complaining that they don't sound like they did on the first CD...like a bunch a pansies. On this album they sound much better, mainly because it sounds more like a hip hop/R&B CD rather than sappy pop music like every other 5 thousand boy bands. This album is the Sh!t"},{"rating":"2","title":"N Sync Second to None","review":"I just LOVE this album; it's a great mixture of absolutely many, many styles. Bye, bye, bye is a great song, yet I don't find it the best on the album. All songs bring a different \\"feel\\" to you when you listen to it. The vocals by Justin and JC are so reckognizable yet they've grown from the first album. Fat beats, combined with touching melodical moments make this cd a true collector's item. I'm not kidding. A song like \\"No strings attached\\" is just amazing; the ballad written by Richard Marx, \\" This I promise you\\" has so much emotions and feelings in the vocals that is sends chills down my spine. If you don't already own this album make sure you get it soon. It'll enrich you musically no doubt and remember N Sync are second to none; the Backstreet Boys may truly take a step back and observe true artists..."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME...BSB IS NO COMPARISON","review":"All I have to is say that this CD is worth buying all the songs are very appealing and fun to listen to. The stereotype of being a \\"boy band\\" does no even fit NSYNC, but I couldn't say the same for BSB. I'm really sick and tired of all you pathetic \\"teenie boppers\\" out there who say that NSYNC has absolutely no talented and always casting them in BSB shadows, all I can say is that NSYNC is A LOT more creative, talented, etc. then BSB will ever try to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should I dance or gag???","review":"Simply put, No Strings Attached, with it's blend of kinda funky- white boy R&B, and a few sappy ballads thrown in here and there, is nothing more than a waste of your money. The beats that seem fresh at first, get boring a few tracks later. Poorly done vocals, covered with computer generated noise, do not do wonders for these 5 either. Frankly Pinoccio did have a better sound. N Sync will tell you that with this album they are free to do what ever they want, nothing to hold them down...... These guys should consider getting reconnected to those strings before they become REAL BOYS........... When Hammer said \\"you can't touch this\\" many people were instant fans. I don't think you'll hear too many admit that today. Soon we will put N Sync in the same column. All you die hard fans think about how that will feel in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst cds I have ever heard","review":"My sister bought this cd the day it came out and I have had to listen to it every day. I can't stand it! it is one of the worst cds ever along with Backstreet boys, Mandy Moore, and 98 degrees.there is only one kindof good song on this cd which is BYE BYE BYE. If you want good music go get a Dave Matthews band cd or a Guster cd. Now that is good music. Trust me this is a terrible cd. If you are just buying this cd for BYE BYE BYE then just go and buy the single! That is the only kindof good song!So trust me don't buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this become the fastest-seller in history?","review":"No, I have not brought this album and I never intend to. However, I have heard it in several music stores and I think it's very bad. I'm sick of the three songs that they've released.They aren't even very good singers. Justin sounds like a rat screeching and JC sounds like a very bad Elvis. I have never heard the other three sing, probably because they can't. The songs are very poorly written and arranged, each one sounds alike.I don't understand their appeal. Could there be 2.5 million teeny-boppers in love with them? I categorize them with Britney Spears as the least talented of the teen scene, but are the most successful because of their looks (what looks?)If you want some good pop music, listen to Backstreet Boys, Christina Aguilera or 98 Degrees. They at least sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introduce yourself to new music if thats even possible","review":"nsync, backstreet boys, britney spears...all modern day popularity poppy bubblegum teeny bop music and this cd is no exception. try listening to real music like minor threat, millencolin, nofx,fugazi you might like it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What it Should Be","review":"I was a little disappointed in this musical rendevous with NSYNC.

From fast, up beat \\"make you wanna dance\\" pieces, to slow, \\"bring a tear to your eye\\" love ballads. Their voices are like ingredients to a gourmet cake. With Justin and JC's melting voices as the \\"icing\\". Even if you are a so called \\"Boy band\\" hater, just give them a chance. They have totally surpassed that image, and have really come out as genuine artists on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is great!","review":"This cd is great! I wasn't a big 'N Sync fan, but I really liked Bye,Bye,Bye when I heard it on the radio, so I went out and bought it. I not only love that song but a lot of others. I thought that the next best song was This I Promise You, and i also liked It Makes Me Ill. I am now a great fan, and think everybody would love this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A friend bought this CD for me, and I wasn't expecting much when I listened to it...After listening to the whole thing a couple of times, I'm glad I had such low expectations, because it's definitely not a great CD...it may be a slight musical departure from their first one, but it's still not very good. The slow songs (\\"I Thought She Knew\\") are boring and forgettable, and their upbeat tunes are annoying! Take my advice and spend your money on something more worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new C.D. no strings Attached Rulers","review":"This is the the best C.D in the world because it is from N'SYNC the they ruler the world and I love Justin Timberlake and I till poeple my lest name is Timberlake because I love him so much I me so in love with him he is my baby and N'SYNC Rulers."},{"rating":"1","title":"*N SYNC...LONGEVITY!","review":"This album is not what I expected from *N SYNC! They are 1 of my favorite groups, but if they want to have longevity then their music has to mature and it hasn't! The songs that the guys co-wrote had next to no meaning! Their fans are going to grow up and if they want to keep those fans then they have to mature in their music.

I would not recommend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bomb Diggity!","review":"I like this cd a whole lot. It's one of those types that you don't skip any song on it. I like (I thought she new) because i love when the guys sing acappella. Their voices are just so awsome, and when they sing acappella it's just like a hummmmmmmm! It puts me to sleep every night! I can't wait to see them in concert again. And the songs on the new album are so fresh and tight, that you can't label *N sync as a boy band. Their making there own music and it's good music. Their not like BSB or LFO, or anyother band like that, because *N sync is just *N sync and they have their own style. Besides their just as human as the person reading this.

If you like music that you can dance to and have fun with, this cd is for you. Nowadays people take music SO seriously, that bands tend to make music for the grammys instead of for the fans. It is refreshing to finally hear a new sound that is just for having fun. This cd has surely made me a fan of Nsync's."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"NSync the band, who put themselves together unlike the Manufactured Backstreet Boys, should be extremely proud of their latest CD. The tremendous selling of No Strings Attached on it's first day should speak for itself. These guys have a lot more going on for them than just their voices. This CD really shows their range in style and vocal accomplishments. Acouple of ballads and lotsa dirty funk! Keep up the good work guys you're getting a standing ovation from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where in God's Name is 0 stars","review":"Could this CD be any worse. The CD has nothing except the semigood song, \\"Bye Bye Bye.\\" But even that is not that great. The only reason this CD has a 4 star average rating is girls out there drooling over the boys here and in Backstreet Boys. If you listen to this CD you will here bad music, bad lyrics, but just plain badness. Let me put in plain words what I am saying. This CD bites the dust just like their first CD and just like all Backstreet Boys CDs. Stay away from these so-called musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"How in their right minds would listen to these nut cases????","review":"Ok some of their songs are ok. Yeah right!

It was a waste of money. This album SUCKS! Everybody is already so tired of the first single 'Bye Bye Bye',and somehow it got to be number one. I think these guys need to seriously think about their next album and do writing on it instead of the stupid songs on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn the C.D!","review":"This is one horrible c.d. that it probably fun if you sprayed acid in your face.

Their stuff is a lot more hip and funky than it was on their first CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love this album....Well, I like it....Okay, i hate it","review":"Actually, I've never listened to it. And neither should you. If you want an experience comparable to listening to N Sync, I'd be happy to perform unanaesthesiated dental surgery on you. Please don't ever try to tell me this is good music. The record sales of this album will surely prove to be one of the major embarresements of this generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A discrase to music","review":"First I would like to say that five guys that don't play instruments, dance around the stage, and don't sing good lyics (in my opinion they didn't sing anything at all) is not a band. Thety are barly a music group. Them, like many other groups of the late 90's (the begining of the dark age of music that we are in now as i like to call it) only got popular becasue MTV said you should listen to it. WELL DONT. The music sucks and every time I here Bye Bye Bye I play someone ramdonly come up to me with a gun and pull the trigger. Im glad they broke up (not supprises there.) If you want good music then travel back a bit to the 60's and 70's and listne to the exellence of the music then. The Who, The Beatles, and Led Zeppelin are good places to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"a new low for commercial music","review":"Calling this a bad cd would be an insult to bad cds everywhere. The complete lack of quality and original ideas is impressive. I did not think that it was possible to produce an entire cd as a showcase to lack of musical talent. The worst part is this cd will sell millions and will be the anthem of brainless morons who have given into mindless corporate music."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprise surprise","review":"i've always considerd Backstreet to be the superior boy band but now i feel nsync have outdone that. This cd is great, the songs are easy to get into and are so catchy! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Disapointed","review":"Sorry guys, but I feel that this CD didn't live up to NSyncs potential. While most of the songs were absolutely great, I was not impressed in the least with Digital Get Down. The content of this song was very, VERY inappropriate for many of their young fans. I also had a problem with all the digital enhancements and background vocals that were obviously not performed by the guys. You have such great voices, let us here them like you did on the first album. I'm still a huge fan, but I still listen to the good old first album and am hoping that that their next release will be more like the first. If any of you guys from NSync read this, please take to heart what I said, and consider it for the next album. Let us hear your beautiful voices, which is why many people buy your CD's, and keep it clean. I know many parents who took your new CD away from their kids because of Digital Get Down.

That's one word to discribe this album. It's incredible! The songs are great, catchy and fun to listen to. The lyrics stay with you all day until your friends finally tell you to shut up.

Their lack of true spirit in their voices definitely shows on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst thing I have ever heard","review":"These five babies are a disgrace to the music industry. While some of the beats \\"sound good\\" the lyrics are horrible, no depth and no real feeling in them.

This group once again proves my theory that people will buy anyting id it is promoted by someone who looks good. Why do you think NSync is so sucessful? IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MUSIC, IT'S ALL ABOUT THEIR LOOKS LOOKS LOOKS! WITHOUT THEIR LOOKS THEY WOULD BE NOTHING BECAUSE THIS MUSIC IS THE MOST TWO-DIMENSIONAL THING I HAVE EVER HEARD!Please please please..dont give any more money to these greedy, calculating record company puppets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"When I purchased this cd I knew I would have made the right choice for great music to listen to while on the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't that great.","review":"My sister just recently got this cd and kept me awake last night even thought it was played in the other room. Now, I don't know about you, but i don't like being kept awake at 1 AM by 5 handsome males crooning about their new and lost loves. As jealous as i am for their looks, fame, and fortune, i guess it's better than being kept awake by my sister's previous obsession, hanson. So thank God for N'Sync."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Step up for Nsync","review":"Nsync's latest album is a vast change from their first. Not only have they cut the strings from their old record label, but also the \\"bubble gum flavor\\" that was on their debut cd. \\"Bye, Bye, Bye,\\" is only a taste of what you can find on the album. Being partial to ballads, Nsync doesn't disappoint; \\"This I Promise You,\\" \\"I Thought She Knew,\\" and my favorite \\"That's When I'll Stop Loving You\\" are filled with passion and love. Another fantastic song is \\"I'll Be Good For You,\\" it has a great beat (and was co-written by Justin Timberlake). \\"Space Cowboy\\" is an awesome song that I can bet will be one of the upcoming singles. With Lisa \\"Left Eye\\" Lopes from TLC onboard this song is funky, funky, funky. Overall I highly recommend this cd with the variety of songs it appeals to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRAUD","review":"okay this is official, nsync's officially over. thank god. i used to be crazy over 'em, but now i'm 14, i got over 'em. and i kno wat REAL music takes, obviously these guyz can do NOTHIN'. it's a waste of time listenin to this crap. DO NOT BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst music ever created...","review":"Hmm...I wonder why you can get this CD for $0.46 here? Probably because it's degrading nauseating boy band pop junk! \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" probably has to be the worst song ever created, and this is coming from someone who once sat thru a whole Bruce Willis album. Fortunately, *NSYNC are no longer around annoying us with their crap. Where are they now? All I know is one of the members thinks he's Michael Jackson.Your better off buying something by The Beatles, Johnny Cash, MSI, The Smiths, Rancid, The Cure, Sonic Youth, or anyone with talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regurgitated, talentless trash","review":"They don't write any of their own songs, they sing with little or no emotion, their voices are annoying and whiny and there is no attempt at creating variety. This cd sounds almost identical to every other cd put out by a boyband in the last ten years. Screw this manufactured pop sludge, it's even worse than turgid boring hip hop and irritating RnB.Why can't you kids listen to something decent for a change, someone with real talent. Someone who actually writes their own songs and isn't cobbled together from Reality TV winners, for example Red Hot Chili Peppers, AC/DC, Offspring and Led Zeppelin just to list the variety of bands with more ability!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrate crap!!","review":"I can't believe my generation is so ga-ga over such sugary bubblegum crap!!

I didn't enjoy thealbum. I happen to be a big nsync fan. This is very dissapointing tome. I was excited about the album when I read the goodreviews. Could it be possible the fans are writing good reviewsjust becauase they love nsync so much they don't care what the albumsounds like? Maybe it's because their standards for quality of musicis low. I'm picky about the music I like. When I heard Bye Bye Bye, Ithought it was a great song, though not timeless, like NSync saidit was. It's the only good song off the album.

I have listened to your music as long as i can remember.The song I like most out of all of your songs has to be \\"This I Promise You.\\" I have no idea why it is that song. I just like that song the most out of all of them. OK THAT IS ALL LATA JENI C.

This CD is really good and I actually really enjoy listening to it. This I Promise You, Bye, Bye, Bye, Just Got Paid, Bringin' Da Noise, & Space Cowboy are some of my favorites, but all of the songs are really good except for maybe one or two. N Sync can actually sing pretty good and they are very nice.

The album as a whole shows that these guys really do have talent. They wrote and produced many of the songs. They also sound great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speaking of Sellouts...","review":"This isn't another one of those reviews that are aimed at only badmouthing a boy band, so please don't immediately label me as such, k?Now that I've got that out of the way, onto the review. I think that 'N Sync's new album is not all that it is cracked up to be. It may be the best selling cd of all time, but it does not deserve it. The beats are all the same, and the songs are limp crap, although somewhat catchy. Songs like BYE BYE BYE redeem this cd, but only barely. Songs like YIPPE YAY or whatever it is make it worth putting back on the shelf and never disturbing it again.I give them kudos for trying to venture out into new realms of music, but I give them an F for results. 'N Sync should stick to what they know best: jumping around in music videos for songs that are completely manufactured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who do they think they are?","review":"Oh. my. freakin. gosh. Who the heck does N SYNC think theyare? Holy cow, they should know by now that their main listening group is girls UNDER the age of 18! Do they *really* need to hear songs about cybersex? Get real! Who wants their kids listening to songs like that? All the hype was for no good, because this song (\\"Digital Get Down\\") brings the WHOLE album down. I have hardly any respect for the boy bands, but compared to this album, BSB and 98 Deg. are angels. Spend your money on better things and keep your standards higher than a bunch of guys trying to make money off of hormone-driven teens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!!!!","review":"Please don't buy this.

Bye Bye Bye is a good song because it has good lyrics, It's Gonna Be Me is fair, because the beat isn't as good as it could be.

Not all the songs are godd but there are some phat ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"BACKSTREET'S BETTER","review":"I like N Sync and everything,but I'm sorry. This Cd is NOTHING compared to Millenium. The songs are gibberish and inappropriate for the kids it's geared towards. Digital Getdown is trash. {and you wonder why the youth of america is screwed up!) At least Backstreet Boys are mature and their material can appeal to adults. The only reason it sold so much is because all of the young little girls wanted to be the first in line to get it so they can hear Justin's oh so sexy voice. Give me a BREAK! Please,lock these guys up. And they're supposed to be Christains! Excuse me,I didn't know Christains grabbed themselves on national TV(referring to the video Bye Bye Bye) Please,get Millenium before this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"N'Sync is quite possibly the worst thing to ever hit music","review":"Yeah, that's right. Horrible, mind-numbingly horrible. If they learned how to play instruments or something, then they might have a fighting chance as a descent band. Do not buy this CD. It will only encourage them.[tom]"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money","review":"After all the hype about this cd I really expected something good, what a let down. I wish I could get my money back. The lyrics in some of the songs are terrible. They are not for little kids to hear. These guys should be ashamed of themselves. Their first cd was pretty good but on the second they went down the tubes. If they continue to sing like this they will be gone in a year or two. They need to stick with what they sang on the first cd. I have noticed that the professionals in the music bussiness have given this cd a very poor rating which it deserves. The only good ratings are from the teenagers and a couple of adults but they are basing their opinions on the fact that five cute guys with some fast music are singing not on the depth of the music and the words. If they don't change we will be saying bye bye bye to NSYNC because this type of music from them will get old fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this 0 stars I would","review":"COME ON, PEOPLE! Please wake up. This album isnt worthy of use for a game of frisbee. It LOOKS likes something my dog would barf up on the dirt. Hold your money too, and just hear me out. Its not worth the plastic its recorded to. If you have never bought music before, don't be stupid and ruin your opinions forever. Get something actually worth listening to, that actually incorporates talent, and is actually MUSIC. Bands I reccomend:ToolKornSystem of a DownBlink 182 (earlier albums)Jimmy Eat WorldThese bands have some TALENT. Please don't skew your musical opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My Goddness!","review":"This cd is awsome. I like it even more since I went to their concert Friday in Denver. If you like pop I suggest this cd. But if you do get it I recommend skipping number 8 Digetal Get Down. This song is so inapropreat and disgusting they are turning like every other band. Disgustingly minded. Other wise Nsync is still #1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bye Bye N'sync","review":"I bought this CD,(and yea, I am a guy) after my friend recommended that it is not a simple band boy CD, and that the songs had an urban-pop appeal. I can listen to anything, but I cannot listen to 5 guys, that have no hint of talent. Lance and Joey cannot sing, and Justin's voice, is so whiny, that you feel like hitting him with a broom. The only good songs are: it's gonna be me and of course, Byebyebye. But other than that, this is a hormone produced CD.If it wasn't for the girls, that can't get a man, and feel like they have to chase around 5 guys, just to fill themselves up, then N'Sync would have bited the dust. At least BSB can sing. What has music come up to? Just for the looks not the music. These girls just blind themselves and believe every song, should go Platinum. For some real music, try Brian McKnight, Mariah Carey,Boyz 2 men, or Santana"},{"rating":"1","title":"whatever","review":"After my lil' insane kid sister brought this stupid album and blasting it. All I'm gonna say is, it's poison. N'sync's music is plain meaningless like the rest of the teen markets. Except unlike backstreet boys or christina aguilera, THEY CAN'T SING. And this album proves that. It's also ironic and funny to see them straining really hard to copy and beat bsb too. If you want quality music, get goo goo dolls or alanis morrisette.

Unlike their best-selling (10 million and still counting) debut, here the boys are more hard-edged, more hip-hopped, more tough...tunes framed, of course, with hammering dance-floor beats. (This attitude is reflected in the CD's title, a blatant reference that these dudes ain't no puppets.) And it all pays of. Sort of. The opening cut (and first single) \\"Bye, Bye, Bye\\" is a synthesized paean all about lovin' and dumpin' 'em, and the gals who croon and swoon at \`NSYNC's every move will love it. The best cut is the most quiet, the a capella \\"I Thought She Knew.\\" Listen while they're hot, before the new kids on the block come along."},{"rating":"1","title":"NSYNC can do better than this.....","review":"This cd, i guess, you can say is not that \\"good.\\" Though, this cd has about 1-2 songs that i like....\\"it's gonna be me\\" and \\"this when i stop loving you.\\" Not to dis Nsync but they don't want to be said that they are a boy band, but this cd just proved that they are. For example, \\"Digital Get Down\\", what kind of song is that??? It is nasty and hideous for little kids to hear..don't get me wrong, i like pop music and all, but i just think NSYNC get do much much better than this...and if you notice, all the songs that they wrote or co-wrote is just not good ...Like..\\"Space Cowboy\\"..just hearing the title doesn't sound appealing, but after hearing the song,i didn't like it all...Well, all i have to say, IS hopefully the next cd..is way better than this...just HOPEFULLY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD AT ALL","review":"ok, this album is just awful. The bland ballads (this i promise you is an exception) are terrible. The vocals are all weak and whiny, and nothing special. I don't know why i even wasted my time listening to this garbage!

I give them credit, for what they do, they do better than I could if my life depended on it. As a fan of heavy rock & metal, (Metallica, Pantera, Skid Row, etc) you've gotta admit it was really brave to even try this, my friends would kill me if they knew! The dudes should however try to do something a little harder just so more people can get into them.

I went to the Backstreet Boys concert with my daugher. And now I love them! Their music is alot better to listen to.

She even posted a message in the Kids Reviews page, saying it was \\"da bomb\\". I'm not so sure I can say the same, however. The music sounds like it is more geared towards pre-teens and teenagers. The majority of the music sounds like hip-hop. I am actually more into the ballads and mature music of the other CD. But if you are an N'Sync fan like my daughter and some of her friends, this CD is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something to Be Embarrassed By when You Reach 30","review":"The fawning pubescent (and even older) girls and ladies over this generic bunch with its banal music has done to Feminism what George W.

This CD is terrible, they are total wannabes! The lyrics are stupid, the beats are flat, the voices are out of sync. What does this FORMER *NSYNC sort-of liker have to say?

I used to think this way to, but I have opened up somewhat to all music. I took a look at N'Sync's new cd and was presently surprised. If you want a light hearted, hip hoppy disc which will make you want to dance, this is your cd. Songs like Bye, Bye, Bye and No Strings Attached are nice tunes, and I Promise You is a very good song as well. My advice is, don't buy the stereotype, give it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Strings Attached!","review":"No Strings Attached is the best c.d. in the world!

Every song is great. My fave song is \\"IT'S GONNA BE ME\\" Besides having great voices, they are all hotties! You will never get sick of this c.d. They have one accapella song on the c.d, it takes a lot of talent to do that, and they have it! There is a lot of up-beat songs, like \\"NO STRINGS ATTACHED\\" and some slow songs, like \\"THIS I PROMISE YOU\\". I recommened this c.d. It is definitely worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but the Backstreet Boys are way better than this!","review":"I bought this CD...and the next day returned it for my money back! I'm a BSB fan, but hey I kept an open mind and tried these guys. They just don't have the vocal talent like BSB does. Their voices don't blend for one thing, and what's with Justin's whiny voice? Seems to me the record company just wanted to put out some 'swill' they knew would sell. Sorry guys, this just doesn't cut it. They don't have the class, the vocal talent, nor the songs to back themselves up. I recommend Backstreet Boys 'Black and Blue' and 'Hits Chapter One', they have much more vocal talent and the songs are better written and executed.

Now bye,bye, bye is the only one where they took a concept but there are many others where they just took the beat and I give them some props for writing the songs but now it is time for them to find their own beats and for their writers and them to find their own concepts on their CD.

These guys have worked so hard and they have really accomplished something with this album. The song are well written and they deserve at least some respect. I strongly suggest that you give this album a chance and if you don't like it that is perfectly fine, but don't judge just by who they are. It should be judged as how good of artist they are or not!

This is a good cd to play at a dance or party. I wish I could rate higher that five cuz if I could I would rate it a 100. WARNING: Don't listen to it constantly cuz if you do it can get sorta boring.

But being a fan of all kinds of music, N'Sync is trying to hard with this new hip-hop sound. They have to face the fact that their songs from their debut are so much better. All of these beats in their news songs are too forced and choppy- they're not as fluid as songs like \\"I Want You Back\\" were. I'm not that big of an N'Sync fan as it is but this album is definitely something I would buy.

Songs penned by the young writer are the strongest on an already strong album that is both new and refreshingly earnest. *N Sync's harmonies are as tight as ever, especially on the a cappella \\"I Thought She Knew\\" and Richard Marx's \\"This I Promise You.\\" The dance tracks are addictive, with hooks that linger in your mind, helping you dance through the day. NO STRINGS ATTACHED is a good album. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of 2000","review":"On *NSYNC's sophmore album (not including the Christmas album), the group shows an edgier, more R&B influenced side and it works very well. With hard hitting rifts and a stronger sound, not to mention the exceptional vocals and arrangement, *NSYNC scores big on this album. From Bye, Bye, Bye to It's Gonna Be Me, to the even more inspiring tunes of Space Cowboy, It Makes Me Ill, and even the title song, this album will have one dancing as the energy level will keep you going. Excellent album and a must buy for any fan of pop music"},{"rating":"2","title":"NSYNC Steps It Up a Notch....And THEN SOME!","review":"This album truly shows that these five guys have talent that will stand the test of time! With their artistic freedom to boot, their own song writing talents Shine as well as their tight perfect harmonies prove a total blend of balads (like \\"This I Promise You\\") all the way to other edge with \\"Space Cowboy\\". Do not pass up this Complete Album.... THANK YOU NSYNC FOR ANOTHER EXCELLENT RIDE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Get Better Than This!","review":"NSNYC pushes every musical button on this CD. Power harmonies, great arrangements and infectious rhythms. You can't help but dance to this CD. Every song is unique and the ideas are fresh. This is a giant leap forward and cannot be categorized as sappy boy band material. Worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taken to the next level","review":"Personally, I think this CD is HOT! I've never really enjoyed pop before I heard Nsync on their last cd, which I thought was cool. However this CD is NOTHING like the last one. The ballots still have the Nsync flavor but the uptempo songs have more of a R&B style to it, which I LOVE! THE BEATS ARE SOOOOOO TIGHT! Anyway, just when I thought Nsync could not get any better, they took it to the next level. I really love this cd and I HIGHLY recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lack of emotion and effort reflected in this CD","review":"I am a big fan of N Sync. I was stunned at their capability in their debut album. Their voices in their debut album was amazing, though this album is certainly an exception.Though I looked forward to buying this album, I was definitely dissappointed. Their lack of true feeling is strongly reflected on this album. Their lack of creativity is also shown. It seems like they just want people to hope that they are good, not actually knowing that. I strongly do not recommend this poorly-efforted and produced album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort Of Farty","review":"This album (even though I admit these male forms of idiocy have a minuscule amount of talent)was a lame excuse for any form of quality music. This is simple bubblegum pop music and all these manufactured bands(includin' Nsync) will blow away in a year or two. These fans claim these dudes are timeless and extraordinarily talented. Honestly. What a load of wasted plastic, paper, and fifteen dollars and ninety-five cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah! What is this?!","review":"If their is one CD I don't like in this world, this is it!

This was one of the best stocking stuffers in years! Pretty sure it went out with the gift wrap, but the expressions and laughs were totally worth it. Bought one for each daughter. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical fan","review":"As a 24-year-old male, I'm probably not what you'd consider the group's typical fan. I have to admit, I'm impressed. *NSYNC's second release is packed with up to fifty percent more flava. \`No Strings Attached' won't disappoint fans of the group's now-familiar sound, but there is less of the dreamboats-doing-ballads format and definitely more of an urban R&B edge on this mostly uptempo album. That I appreciate. It's not high art, but it's a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter dreck","review":"I'd like to hit one of these guys in the face with a red-hot frying pan. Unbelievably bad. Spengler was right, we're doomed."},{"rating":"2","title":"N Sync No Strings attached rules You have to buy it!","review":"This album rules. the songs are so catchy. They guys sing great on it. So if you want good parting music buy this CD. You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grouchy parent","review":"We have loved previous song hits, and I learned ALL the words along with my 8 and 6 year old girls. But this CD left us flat. The first 5 or 6 songs were loudly orchestrated, rap-strong, lousy tune and words. I rushed to buy it for my girls, but they shut it off before it was done. Next time, I'll listen first before jumping at N'Sync."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the last!","review":"*N SYNC really dominated the music world with this CD!! The last CD just introduced them as a group and this one really defines them as one. It has a lot more up tempo beats, it's edgier,and JC and Justin's voices come out really well in the ballads. Do I need to say anymore? I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will be forgotten by BSB's next album......OR NOT!","review":"Proud male fan of NSync here! No Strings Attached is by far their best album. I got it in October of 2000, about 6 months late. But it was worth it. From the amazing ballads like This I Promise You and That's When I'll Stop Loving You, to awesome up-tempo songs like It's Gonna Be Me, my favorite off the CD, and the title track, NSync sets themselves apart from all the other \\"boybands\\" out there. NSA is one of my all time favorite CDs, and I will be waiting to get their new release, Celebrity, when it comes out on July 24, 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"\\"No Strings Attached\\" is an Excellent CD the boys promsied a good cd that you don't have to skip the bad songs this cd dosen't have any bad songs on the album my favorite song beside \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" is Digital Get Down that is a funky song and so cool I hope to see them in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Strings Attached is awesome!","review":"From the moment I heard the first few notes of \\"Bye, Bye, Bye\\" to the very last note of the a capella song \\"I Thought She Knew\\" I knew I was addicted to this album. The one thing that I love the most about this album is that every album has a different feel to it. This album definitely sets them apart from the \\"boyband\\" stereo-type. This album is phenomenal and incredible! Congrats and props to the guys of *NSYNC for putting together such a great album! This is only the beginning of a promising career, and I can't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these guys","review":"I was very surprised at the cd when I first heard it.

These guys stretched their talent to different realms, putting them in a different category than the typical \\"boy band\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"I loved Bye Bye Bye, It's Gonna Be Me, This I Promise You, and No Strings Attached, but the rest was just so-so."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the cd","review":"I love the song digital get down it reminds me of my online boyfriend he lives in alaska i live in oregon, I started to cry when I heard it , I love you cory!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then I thought","review":"My friends finally got me to listen to this cd and even I have to admit that it was better than I would like to admit. The songs are a different sound coming from a vocal group. I didn't think it could work but they have proved differently. I can admit when I'm wrong. They surprised me. Nice job guys!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible compact disc!","review":"To say this cd contains music, would be a lie. You cannot say that Nsync is a musical group. Do they play any instruments? I didn't think so, and as far as I'm concerned the term music means to play instruments and create a sound without help from any computers. Pop music will fall, and real music shall rise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME!","review":"O.K., I may of said in my review for Celeberty I just love this album, but that was before it got so worn out, I started hating it. It had so much hype, you just had to go out and waste your hard earned money to buy it. I mean just because Bye, Bye, Bye was one of MTV.com's 100 greatest pop songs, doesn't mean the whole album is great. Believe me, if you want to buy an N'SYNC cd, buy Celeberty, you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd to Backstreet Boys? Not in this Lifetime!","review":"This was, still is, and always will be a groovy CD. It has a great mixture of slow songs and dance tunes. It also shows how talented these guys really are. Backstreet Boys didn't even come close to beating *NSYNC's record of 2.4 million copies sold in 1 week. They barely managed to sell 1.6 million. People are still talking about No Strings Attached, while BSB's Black & Blue is yesterday's news. This CD would be a great addition to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Backstreet Boys Attached","review":"First and for most I would like to say that Nsync will never be number two to the bsb in my thoughts they r far better then the bsb they have better sound and vocal ability and this album should by all means seperate the two groups Nsync being more creative and vocally talented and as the records have shown Nsync was not forgotten when the bsb cd came out if anything the bsb were forgotten I mean u see who has the record right!!! So it's just comments like what's his name wrote that make people who don't like Nsync look like idiots. So Nsync will keep doing what they need to do and thier loyal fans will keep supporting them like we need to and to all u people out there who have negitive things to say about Nsync all we have to say to u is Bye,Bye,Bye cause It's gonna be Nsync at number 1 not the backstreet boys cause like they said thier battery is running out and so is thier career!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAAAH! HELP ME! THIS CD SUX!","review":"ok,iwas never a fan of boy bands,ive always hated the backstreet boys etc.but when a supposed friend said the cd would change the way i thought about those things i decided to give it a try,result:possibly the worst album ive ever heard. They have two styles of song: fast and \\"funky\\", and slow and corny. That's what makes up the whole album. They are just a bunch of crappy singers trying to make money and attract 7 year old fans.i am a fan of rock[and a little rap does me fine]so i never thought i was going to like this,i was right.this album is a bunch of tracks which could otherwise be described as torture to the ear drums. honestly, if you want to help yourself through life listen to staind, disturbed, mudvayne, hedpe, slipknot, korn, deftones, nirvana, papa roach, RATM, limp bizkit, linkin park.........the list goes on and on. Take my advice and save yourself! RUN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One less *Nsync Fan.........","review":"I am totally switching over to Backstreet Boys, when I heard \\"It's Gotta Be Me\\" I couldn't take it any longer. But BSB on the other hand are more grown up and more deticated to what they do. So I would difenitly get Millennium for BSB than No Strings Attached from nsync. And plus I have seen them BOTH in concert and Nsync are pretty good etc, but they don't get it their all, BSB on the other hand put all they've got into it when they sing in concert. Nsync might have better dance moves, but BSB have better every thing else! You'r lucky I didn't rate this 1 star becaue the second star just stands for how much worse they are than BSB."},{"rating":"2","title":"another cd out there","review":"well, i really don't listen to this boy band pop pallozza trash out there so let me get to the point, take it from me, a non-nsync fan, this CD is great, it's different, and actually has songs with a meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've Done It Again!","review":"These five talentless guys have managed to once again make me want to barf. My friends and I were hoping that with this album NSync would change and maybe actually sing well. But they are obviously incapable of that. The song \\"This I Promise You\\" has potential for a very beautiful song, if someone else sung it. I do not recommend this cd unless you're in need of a good coaster"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great CD From Nsync","review":"Nsync did it again. The new CD is GREAT. Its way better than the Backstreet Boys Millenium CD. I think they will be around for a long time no matter what any reviewers say. And I also think people should stop comparing them to the Backstreet Boys, cause guess what their not the Backstreet Boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Followup! :)","review":"This is a good cd by the boys and definitely a good sequel to the last NSYNC cd, but they seem to want to have more of a rap sequence in this cd, but otherwise great cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*NSYNC ROCKS!","review":"their new Cd is awesome. You guys are great. My favorite song on the album is Bye, Bye, Bye. I also like This I promise you and Digital get down. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes Yes here we go, N sync has got to go!","review":"In this album expect to find black wannabes that can't rap, find remixes of old songs that they can't sing well in, and finally don't watse 13 bucks or more buying this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Great Album of the 21st.

Great job guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The one word that sums up this cd is BIG disappointment. I was big in N'Sync fan till this cd. Some of the songs are really dirty. I wish N'Synce would have kept their clean imange. Cuz of songs like \\"Digital Get Down\\" I won't and can't get this cd no much how I want to. I'm christian I can't listen to most music. At one time I was proud to say that I could listen to N'Sync and not have to worry about sex songs. But that's all changed. If N'Sync is reading this please go back to the clean songs, you're killing one of your biggest fan. I've been in tears more then once as I stare at picture of you guys. Please, I miss the old boys. Please come back to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFFERENT BUT GOOD","review":"First thing i want to say is, that person that said nsync sing through their dose need to get their hearing check because they song good.Ok,this CD is defferent from their first one but defferent does not mean bad.There is something for every one.One of my favorite is \\"That's When I'll Stop Loving You.There is alot of dance beats on it so if you like to dance get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"greetings from michigan","review":"I don't care what others are saying about n'sync, I like them and so does my 5 year old daughter and 2 year old son.

Justin and JC shoul stop hogging all the solos."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best *N Sync CD yet!","review":"I think that this CD shows how much talent these guys really have. Even though some of you may not like \\"Digital Get Down\\" that dosen't mean you have to dog the whole CD. My personal opinion is that the guys did a great job and at least they have the guts to do what they want to do and not what is expected of them. So if you guys see this I love the CD and don't listen to all the other bad reviews on here because those people don't know excellent music when they hear it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*NSYNC RULES!","review":"I think that this CD is great! It took their music to a whole new level. This CD really shows that hard work and perseverance they had, even through all the record label mishap. Anyway, this CD is the best one I have ever gotten. STAY *NSYNC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice","review":"Before you go out and buy this album, you should consider what it consists of. It also depends on what type of person you are. There are the screaming fans who buy their music through anything, and would do so if they began singing country or rap, just because its 'N Sync. And there are the people that just liked all or some of their music for its style. If you are one of those, you should know what you're getting into, since they're songs are not pure pop anymore. They have become more R&B with some rap, and if you're not a fan of this music, you shouldn't get this album, since this is what you'll get. So before you go out with a smile on your face to buy this album, make sure you're not about to become disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It made me ill","review":"Ugh.I wonder how many N Sync fans are secretly disapointed after listening this album. It's basically just 5 wannabes trying too hard to make a good album. Sorry, N Sync, but you failed. \\"Digital Get Down\\", \\"Just Got Paid\\" and \\"It makes me ill\\" are just a few of the mindless songs on this album. Do yourself a favour and don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, no better group!","review":"I got this CD the day it came out and I listen to it almost every day. I also own the Backstreet Boys album, Millenium, but it isn't nearly as good as 'N Sync (any of their albums). I can only listen to some BSB songs once, but I can listen to 'N Sync over and over. I especially like the songs \\"This I Promise You\\", and \\"That's When I'll Stop Lovin' You\\". I think that the guys in 'N Sync have a unique talent of sounding awesome together, something the Backstreet Boys don't have. All guy group fans should own this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"Is there something wrong with me? I'm 36 years old and I absolutely love this CD.

I could take 5 guys out of a highschool chior, dress them up, through some lame lyrics at them, and they would have as much or more talent then Nsync. Since they don't write there own lyrics, it doesnt take a scientist to figure out everything they sing has no real meening to them. Sure mabey on this albume they wrote like 1 song(WOW) but that isnt nothing to get choked up about, face it, grow up.......there FAKE"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Creds Attached","review":"Thousands of teenies scream their names and swoon at their pitiful ballads. What happened? To be certain, they are still talentless and pathetic, but now they're trying to get \\"creds\\". Oooooh. I'm scared, as I have a right to be. There are only 3 halfway decent songs on this album. I would find them decent if there was \\"no screeching attached\\". \\"Bye, Bye, Bye\\" is all right, except for the obvious fact they the music seems to be taken straight out of Backstreet Boys' \\"Don't Want You Back\\" and Jay-Z's \\"Can I Get A...\\", while the content again descends from \\"DWYB\\" by BSB. \\"This I Promise You\\" does have potential... with another vocal group. Ditto for \\"I Thought She Knew\\". Wait a second. Doesn't 98 degrees have a song called \\"If She Only Knew\\"? Congrats to *NSYNC, for they have proved that longevity means nothing to them by abandoning their soft-rock ways for ill-conceived \\"credibility\\". It's so obvious that they haven't done their homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find Your Own Identity Please","review":"I guess this is just the way it is. For every Britney, there is a Mandy, and for every Backstreet Boys, there is an *NSYNC. But what seperates the Britney-clones fron *NSYNC? They actually have some originality to their albums! Every song on \\"No Strings Attatched\\" has some reference to a Backstreet Boys song, in fact the only song I can find any originality in is \\"Space Cowboy\\" and only then because the great Lisa \\"Left-Eye\\" Lopes is featured alongside the Backstreet...I mean *NSYNC. While like the Backstreet Boys second album, \\"No Strings Attatched\\" does sway from the first album material, the *NSYNC album lacks that extra spark \\"Millennium\\" had. If you buy this album, you're buying into *NSYNC, you're going with the hype, and while there's no escaping the fact this album will be big, it just won't be as fun because musically, this album is a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad...","review":"Our teenage society has reached a new low. 'N Sync has slipped into the always sad category of self-parody. The album is called \\"No Strings Attached,\\" While they are the epitome of corporate puppets, a fact that is obviously oblivious to them. I am a 15 year old male, so I am around a large percent of the peppy teenage girls who listen to this drivel, and they have my pity. By wasting their time on the untalented, ignorant, immature \\"band\\" who makes this stuff, they miss out on a lot of beautiful music. If you wish to escape the fridge buzzings that these little boys, ahem, \\"co-wrote\\" listen to some Radiohead, or old Pearl Jam, or Moby, or Portishead. But for your own sake, stay away from this.

I can't stand them, and they are nothing but wannabes that are trying to act and sing Black when they are not. Don't care how many albums they have sold and how many singles have gone to number #1, this does not mean talent. Just Look at this day and age-talent has nothing to do with selling albums, and selling albums has nothing to do with talent, as evidence by groups like this. It's all about packaging-attractiveness, good looks (though I don't think they have this, though some idiots out there do), and the right people behind you, the most imporant. A bunch of phony jackasses, all of them!

ORIGINALITY...... thats what they need.. I can't stand listening to the way this cd reminds me of the last song or song on another cd. Its disappointing to think that this cd is popular due to the fact that all the girls like them and they have 2 singers who can actually sing.

Bring da noise? Please, more like bring the pain. Of my ears that is. This is easily the worst album I have ever suffered through. I will give them credit for Bye Bye Bye, Thats When I'll Stop Loving You, and This I Promise You, but in the future I suggest they stick to more of this style of material. No matter how hard they try, they are never going to get past their current listening audience. So stop trying and do what they do best is what I suggest. Just got Paid? I think not. Go ahead and pick it up if you are a die hard fan (Female, age 9-14) But still prepare to be disappointed after their last effort. Maybe they needed those strings to be attached afterall. Overall a very, very poor effort by a group of guys who are capable of much more. Stop trying to be something you are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loss of Effort","review":"N'Sync's new album lacks harmony.

However, being the open-minded person that I am, I decided to give it a listen before completely disregarding it. After listening to the entire album twice, I must say I was surprized. Nsync really exceeded my expectations; No Strings Attached was not merely bad, but rather downright terrible. Many of the beats sounded much too similiar for my liking. Then there was the brainless lyrics of songs such as \\"Space Cowboy\\" with it's seemingly endless, extremely annoying \\"yippy yah yay\\" chorus. Also, I really think that the subject matter of the song \\"Digital Getdown\\" is inappropriate for Nsync's target audience of young teenage girls. Of course I can't say that the CD is completely worthless...I'm sure it would make an excellent coaster...or perhaps a frisbee. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't even compare them to Backstreet Boys!","review":"I just think that people should give Nsync the credit they deserve. They are a million times better than the Backstreet Boys (whose songs DO all sound the same) and they can sing...I mean really sing, which is far more than I can say for most of the boy bands out there. Their dance moves are incredible and, like someone mentioned in another review, they sing live at all their concerts, simultaneous with their dancing, which is no easy task, let me tell you...and none of that wack lip-syncing or cracking voices that goes on at Backstreet Boys concerts (Nick has been going through puberty for a while now!). They put on a real show.

(\\"Digital Get Down\\") I was actually going to buy this CD until I listened to this track in a music store, and it disgusted me. Who in the heck does this group think their core audience is? How irresponsible of them, not to mention nauseating. I've noticed other reviewers are saying that those of us who object to this song are overreacting. Sorry, but I cannot agree. If these songs are supposed to be an extension of who this group is, there is no way I would purchase this recording for a child. (Yes, based on the strength of this ONE SONG.)

One quibble: it appears that MetalMike overdubbed pretty much all his solos as what is heard consistently fails to match what he is seen playing. It's very distracting, and definitely takes away from the overall experience. Fortunately, Roy Z's playing seems to be flawless and up to his usual high standard, and there's no evidence of any post-production fixing by him. The whole band is firing on all cylinders and Rob sounds phenomenal, too. If I could have changed anything, it would have been to add a few more Resurrection songs, as well as Sun from Crucible - very disappointing that one didn't make it into the setlist.

Read book #1, then go down to your local video renting store and check out the first video in the series and you'll see what I mean. The videos are pretty good though, beleive me.

It's just a show that the writers, publishers, and executives thought from out of thin air. The show has boring plots off an alien topic with the name \\"Animorphs\\" tacked on. Wait a minute, the name Animorphs is the name of my favorite book series. Sorry, but I wanted to illustrate how the show has almost nothing to do with the books. Why doesn't Scholastic have a TV show where the characters are animated yet actually look real (not like the blade ship from the first TV show episode). It sounds crazy, but if it looks good enough (easy with the modern technology available) they could follow the book series without limitations that occur with filming real people as well as follow the script and events better.

Ax and Visser three are always in human morph. The hork bajar look right but they don't move anywhere. They just stand there.

It's just horrible - everything sticks to it, even when I use low heat and lots of oil. Now I know why Le Creuset says the pan gets better as you use it more, as it will get a special \\"patina\\" - probably meaning that this skillet sticks badly.

Nothing sticks if you follow the instructions (first add oil or margarine, heat pan on medium or lower heat before adding food). I have fried chicken in it, cooked eggs, made stir fry, and more and it's simply wonderful. Medium heat works fine even for frying chicken, and there's little spattering at that temperature.

I originally think it would last a life time. It only last a few months. The handle got very hot so you have to be careful. The non-stick works well for the first month. However, the surface turned black after a few months and became sticking even more than stainless steel.

I found very disgusting that he pretended to be the masseur the heroine was expecting. It wasn't sexy at all.It seems that the novel supports this idea: if you are a woman and love your career passionately, it must be because you have a psychological problem. Apparently, it is great if your dreams get shattered. So you can devote yourself to what seems to be the natural destiny of women, marry and have children.Not to mention the topic of the gay dancer (it is not stated, but it is obvious). Of course, it must be a tragic figure. Really? New York, 1983? And the dancers had to be in the closet?I don't find a good reason to publish again this not-so-golden-oldie.

You stuff the camcorder into it and film through the rubber. Over time I would expect it to get scratched up to the point where the video quality would suffer even more. With proper care and feeding it should live longer though.I would pay $20 for this product and be happy with it, at it's current price though it's getting sent back. At this point I think my solution for a dust/splash shield will be to buy some good quality sandwich bags and a lense filter.The bottom line is if you need something waterproof, spend the extra money to get a good product that will last.

Yet his basic goodness will restore your faith in humanity. The theology is not shoved down your throat, but rather is grasped between the lines. All the characters are memorable.

There *is* action and drama, but it has a gentleness and \\"next-door neighborly-ness\\" that makes it so easy to relate to.

In this volume, she has one of the characters say \\"My grandpa said he never met a Catholic that knew pea turkey about th' Bible\\". Now, this book was written in 1995; I might have expected such an anti-Catholic remark in a book from 100 years earlier, but I was surprised and put off by this sentence in a book from 1995. I guess a cozy little town peopled only by Protestants might appeal to a certain demographic, but it seems a rather closed society to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is Christianity...","review":"In the interest of full disclosure, this is the only book in the series I have read. As some escapism fluff this book hits the spot, but as some model of Christianity its falls woefully short. As an example, the Miss Sadie character pays an exorbitant sum for a wedding reception for a secret relative while treating her black maid pretty shabbily. Why would Luella want to sleep on a couch at the foot of Miss Sadie's bed in the worn out mansion? All the characters from lower socio-economic groups seem hollow, but I guess that makes it easier to swallow the social injustice.I guess the lack of four-letter words and premarital sex makes this a \\"Christian\\" book. It certainly isn't the behavior of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series INCOMPLETE for Kindle ... Don't Start Series!","review":"If you have a Kindle - Best not start this series. The third book is not available for Kindle. Why only some books in a SERIES is made available is beyond me. Either pass on the Kindle or Pass on the Series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced!","review":"After I purchased this item from Amazon and gave it as a gift, I found the exact same thing, brand new, at an outlet bookstore for $20 less. Make sure to compare prices. I was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading the reviews, I was hoping for a really nice, light read. I found the two main characters in the story to be very self indulgent and whiny. From the titles I assume that they eventually get married. I have to assume that later in the series both Cynthia and Father Tim become less consumed with their own feelings. Maybe some heavy editing would have helped the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this series so popular?","review":"On the recommendation of a relative, I read this book. Wow. It feels like it was written by somebody's maiden aunt. In fact, the entire town seems populated by old ladies, males included. The boy in the story came across as written by someone who never has contact with anyone under 50. I like a cozy story as well as the next person--but I do prefer that the characters act like adults and don't spend their lives dithering around ineffectively. Stay far, far away from this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story - Bad cover","review":"The story is great, but the book cover could really use some major improvement. When it arrived, the cover was already curled up before I took it from the box. Since I've been reading it, the cover remains curled and seems to get worse with time. I usually pass my paperbacks on to others for their reading enjoyment, but this one is a bit embarrassing to pass on due to the curled book cover. So, it will probably go into File 13 or collect dust somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was so good that I didn't want it to end!","review":"As with each of the two previous Mitford books, I was completely involved personally in the lives of the Kavanaughs and the other residents of that delightful little community!

I was terribly homesick for Mitford in the few moments that it took me to grab the second in the Mitford series. Upon my return home, I took the phone off the hook, drew the drapes, and once again I entered Mitford, alternately smiling, chuckling, guffawing, and even shedding an occasional tear. How Jan Karon can cause the gamut of such emotions in this reader is beyond my understanding. How thankful I am that she has used her God-given talent to transport me to the wonderful, wacky world of Mitford!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitford is Like Coming Home!","review":"In this continuing book, (sequel), of At Home in Mitford, Father Tim's attractive neighbor Cyhthia Coppersmith is at his door, pursuing Father Tim with hot casseroles. Then, his cousin Meg has moved into the rectory for the long haul, disturbing his whole household! Dooley, the boy Father Tim has taken under his wing in the first story, is still living with Father Tim and causing problems in school. They can't seem to locate his mother, and his father is a terrible drunkard.This book is truly as enjoyable as the first one was, and well worth the reading time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Matchmaking in the Church","review":"Boy, do single pastors relate to this. While single, remember very well the continued efforts people of the congregation would attempt to fix you up with someone they just knew was perfect.This is so humurous and entertaining, with wonderful cast of characters. Buck and Puny and Emma and Dooley and Miss Sadie and Luella.The contrast and play between Edith and Cynthia is a stitch. Father certainly has his work cut out for him.This is just another gem in a series of gems. Delightful, at times, oh so true to life, stories. Can we ever get enough of this, Mitford fans?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Karon books are fantastic","review":"I received the first in the Mitford series in August and before I was even halfway through the book, I went online to Amazon and ordered the whole series plus the cookbook. These are outstanding reading about everyday life and people. No sex, no violence, they are just super reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first book.","review":"In this second book of the Mitford series, Jan Karon reintroduces us to our favorite cast of characters and throws in a few new ones. Father Tim is up to his eyeballs with his dog and Dooley, the boy we met in the first book. Add to the mix a rich widow who makes no bones about the fact that she herself has her eye on Father Tim. The whole mix makes for another wonderful adventure in Mitford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets even better!","review":"I read this as soon as I finished Book I, and was not disappointed. The story of Father Tim and his neighbor Cindy continued. Karon portrayed the pitfalls of falling in love can be just as difficult at 60 as during the teen years. After a rocky beginning, the couple begins to cement their relationship through a series of beautiful letters over a period of months when she goes away to New York.Other characters' stories also continued. Although Mitford is a 'feel-good' read, Karon doesn't shy away from difficult situations and near-tragedies. She's a gifted storyteller. As someone who grew up in the Episcopal Church, but who hasn't returned to it in decades, it was nice to revisit it through the eyes of Father Tim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"Awesome book series!

This is a great book to peruse if you are hell-bent on finding insipid mis-information about Japanese culture. with flights being ~$500 from NYC (round-trip) go see for yourself that his strategy preys on western ignorance and is really a self-exoticized version of what is not really happening in Japan.

He absolutely loves the knives. He raves about the balance and how easy they are to use. The knives are sharp. He also loves the look of the carrying case. I don't know anything about knives, but he especially loves the knife he uses for slicing cheese. Soft cheese residue does not clog up the blade while he is slicing.

Each essay is usually only a few pages long so it is an easy book to find time to read.He is a great writer, with a wonderful sense of humor, but he delivers some amazingly creative insight and makes you look at your world and what you believe in in a completely fresh new way.I would highly recommend this book since it is a sampler of his best writings, with a mix of new and previously published material. You will not be disappointed, this is a wonderful read and a great gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite Entertaining","review":"The cost of entertaining today is getting more expensive all the time. So why do you have to spend a lot of hard-earned cash on lace doilies that can get stained and that you have to wash each time you use them. Get these exquisite paper doilies and put your worries away! Chafing dishes can be centered on the large ones, while gravy boats, butter dishes, or condiment tray can be placed on the medium-sized doilies. The smaller ones can be set on your table as elegant coasters under your stemware. The best part: after the evening in done, and the table is cleaned up, instead of spraying spot remover on your expensive linens, you simply throw these away! No muss, no fuss...leaving you more time to enjoy with your guests."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointing storyline...","review":"while Ms Basso's writing style is good, the storyline-the heroine gets with her best friends husband 8 years after she's killed, and she was killed because she was mistaken for the heroine. Well, it was just kind of distasteful to me.Also, the idea of the heroine, a spinster, tracking down and seducing a rake to win a bet for her brothers-then lo and behold, her reputation is ruined by this-a bit far fetched and implausible too.Sadly, I'd say skip this book.2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"Son really likes figuring out the diagrams and making up his own connections.

I prefer her second record, From Stage to Screen. However, I must admit that I am blown away by this singer everytime I listen to this CD. It is definitely a \\"resume\\" type of record highlighting her strengths as a character singer. Some notable renditions are \\"Who Will Love me As I am\\", \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\", and the two songs from All that Jazz. I am not so fond of the song \\"The Story Goes On\\", however, i learned to appreciate it after hearing Carol O'Connor's version. Another good song (on another CD) is Kissing You, a \\"must-hear\\". If you are tired of those \\"lyrical singers\\", sopranos, and Broadway vocalists (which seem to sound all the same), try the lady from down-under. Note: Time Heals Everything is nice as well, but her version of the song in the Mack and Mabel CD is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Song List!","review":"Caroline O'Connor is a wonderful find! The song list on this album covers all my favorites from the last dozen or so years and she does justice to all of them. Caroline tries to do them as originally inteneded rather than \\"jazzing them up\\" which would have diminished the album. Great stuff - keep it coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No nonsense","review":"Ritchie's First Steps is a good no-nonsense introduction to learning Latin. Each chapter contains a short explanation of an aspect of Latin grammar, followed by vocabulary and exercises. There is no \\"enrichment,\\" meaning no \\"let's make a toga\\" or \\"Gaius and Claudia's Day in Ancient Rome.\\" The book is intended for language-learning only, developing in a way that is logical, but which does make some demands on the learner's intelligence. The compact format would probably be most effectively used by a learner who already knows a Romance language and who also has access to a tutor or some other person who is able to answer questions. Still, for what it is, this is a very good book and it is encouraging to see it back in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"MTX is a great motorcyle game","review":"this game is great ist easy to controll your bike and create trix.its fun as you start a career and earn money and new bikes to make it to the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable collection","review":"I picked this collection up so that I could figure some of these songs out. Its a highly enjoyable record that offers a variety of sound. Usually, I associate hokum songs with sexual innuendo, and there's some of that here too, but there's also songs of gambling and a couple that play out more like comic skits/ musical sampler.The rough, scratchy sound of some of the songs, a result of their having been lifted from worn 78s; really attests to just how rare the tunes are. One must wonder how many songs of the era are now lost forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I remember this song","review":"it was a group of 4 women sitting in mens shirts and lingerie singing about putting the X in your sex.

I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Study of War Neurosis","review":"I found this book to be quite informative and useful in my quest to gather information for a research paper on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Although PTSD is a relatively new term, only about 15 years old, this book gives a good overview of symptoms suffered by WWI soldiers of what was called at that time War Neurosis. Various treatments, Dr.'s opinions, and the general attitude of military administrators were also discussed, as well as some personal stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only great book on Tahiti","review":"This great book has been translated into German and French but has never yet been published in English for general sale. The facsimile edition offered here is excellent and amounts to a rare book.

Too much; it's a real groover; just funks along and makes you want to get up and dance!That's one of the many criteria I apply to Price's music. If it just makes me want to get up and dance; if my daughter and I can just sway to the groove, then it makes the cut. You have to appreciate obtuse and sophisticated bass to really like this cut, but if you are a musician that understands what it takes to produce this kind of music, or if you really love Prince and really love Funk, then I'd recommend this CD just for this cut alone. It's not a must have, but for me, it was an important member of my collection. Now I just need to go back and grab the cut off the real CD instead of the MP track; since the fidelity is probably better on these sub-terranian bass lines.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I adore O(+> but no","review":"This is not acceptable, from a true but honest and unblinded appreciator of the genius of O(+>."},{"rating":"2","title":"sadly he is gone","review":"but as long as there are book dealers willing to part with good literature i'm glad i had the chance to buy this"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEXT PLEASE-","review":"If you want to get an idea of the types of animals that are available to photograph at the Triple D Game Farm, then buy this book.

A rather tame and bland affair from one of my most favourite singers sees him drifting into mediocracy. There are 2 CD's here with the acoustic sessions easily the better of the two. The highlight of the album is 'Silver Hearts on Chains' written in collaboration with Eddie Reader, who also shares some background vocals. A beautiful song of lost love and a life wasted to alcohol. Destination, Every Song Is A Cry for Love', 'Turn on Me' and the title track 'Homebird' are all good but do not do enough to lift the album. The voice, as always, is superb, production is a little too 'clean' for my liking (almost like listening to backing tracks)...I felt a little short-changed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LOT of cutters but no real handle.","review":"You get a lot for your money here and they work just fine; just keep in mind that if you can cut with both sides then both sides are pretty sharp.

She has never complained of it being uncomfortable. She seems to fit in the seat just fine and she is small for her age. We needed a carseat with a harness that did not take up alot of room for a small car with 2 carseats. We never had any trouble. The strap that allows you to tighten the harness is really easy for us to tighten. (In my sons carseat, we have to take him out of the seat to tighten it). We have no wear on the seat, and we have had it for about 2 years. We have not had to wash it yet so I can't comment on that. And it was easy to install. I'm always looking for the perfect baby/child equipment, and I have been through more than a few carseats. I think this seat is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's just ok","review":"I have a few problems with this seat. The first weekend we used the new booster seat my 3-1/2 yr. old had an accident. I had to take the entire thing apart just to wash the cover. It took me at least 45 minutes to put the thing back together. Installation is difficult because I use the latch system and the strap is sewn in so you cant tighten the latch as much as you would like to. The rear strap is too short and extremely difficult to change the length. It takes me forever to install to my satisfaction adjusting here and there. The headrest is in a weird place. The strap which you pull to tighten the five point harness always gets stuck. I would buy a different brand next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"I labored long & hard over which to buy. My oldest daughter is a very tall & thin 2 1/2 year old.

And with the addition of our newest baby, we are looking to move her into a convertible booster.PROS: Easy to climb in & out of, the seat belt guides for when you use the car's seat belt is nice(the main reason I bought it).CONS: The headrest is uncomfortable, the hard rivets in the back of the seat are uncomfortable, the chest buckle is RIDICULOUSLY simple to undo, but the BIGGEST FAILURE of all is the LATCH system: there is a tether that is sewn into the middle of the LATCH belt. Thereby, inhibiting the ability to tighten it down. We have a 2001 Nissan Quest minivan & this car seat was unsafe in our van.

My daughter loves it and was totally comfortable on the first 5 hr flight and the second 6 hour flight. We even used it in the terminal as a place for her to sit! I have had no problems installing it securely either in the airplane or in any of our cars, with or without latch. It does not budge not one inch and doesn't seem to be top heavy if installed correctly as some other consumers have stated.

They are shaped exactly like the Safety 1st carseat that my son had prior. The only difference seems to be the cover. My daughter was only in this seat for 20 minutes and started crying because her back hurt. My son couldn't get comfortable either. The covers on these have a big wad of stuffing at the lower back, then a seam, and then very little (if any)stuffing up to the headrest, which is ridiculously overstuffed. This put her back into a very uncomfortable curved position. My son couldn't get comfortable either because of the stuffing at the lower back and the headrest.

I wrote the company and they said that the oxidation was normal, not a defect, just scrub it off with an SOS pad. No way I should have to scrub a pan with an SOS when it just came out of the dishwasher.

We had been buying a new nonstick skillet once a year since forever because no matter how expensive they were they still needed to be replaced about once a year. We were tired of filling up the landfill. Unfortunately, after about 4 months, our Scanpan skillet got sticky. Our morning eggs stuck worse than on our $20.00 cast iron skillet. We had followed all the directions, but still . . .We sent it back to the company (fortunately, we had saved the box and the receipt) and for a $10.95 shipping fee we got another. It lasted for about 8 months before it got sticky. Yes, we can send the 2nd one back too - again, and again, and again. This isn't what we had hoped for when we spent nearly $100.00 on this skillet! The land fill gets fuller and fuller and we're spending as much as year as we did before when we bought the cheap $20.00 pan from Costo.Yes, it's nice and flat and heats evenly, but that's about all I can say for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apparently They know quite a bit","review":"For an EP this CD has quite a bit. 6 Songs that range from upbeat to reflectiven and very well might I add, some bands can't get that on a full album.

It was a shame because I am deeply intrigued by the topic and was looking for something that would further explain some of my questions. It's likely I took on more than I could chew as the average layman, but I was under the impression upon buying it that a science-minded person could decipher 80% of it.

This is cutting edge theory and the theory will indeed evolve as paranormal phenomena are studied more extensively. Before any scientific theory needs to be developed, observed phenomena, to be explained by such theory, must be verified in replicated experiments and/or measurements. Such verification indeed exists. To get added perspective on how the scientific method has verified paranormal phenomena exhibited in controlled experiments, any reader with a skeptical leaning needs to read some of Dean Radin's books, in particular, \\"Entangled Minds\\".

Once I read Furies of Calderon, I had to continue immediately on to Academ's Fury, and plan on reading Cursor's Fury next. The plot is very easy for me to get involved in, but then has twists and turns that I wasn't expecting. I like all the characters in the book, and am intrigued to find out what some of their next steps are. My only problem is that they are too captivating, leaving me thinking about them at work, driving, cooking, everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best series' I've read this year!","review":"Jim Butcher is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. He reminds me of the Joss Whedon of the book world. I have devoured all of his Dresdon Files novels, and was expecting something similar when I started the Codex Alera series. Boy was I wrong, and glad to be so! If you are expecting a Harry Dresdon style series, take a minute to cleanse your pallet and you will not be disappointed! This is a whole different world, a whole different time, and a whole different and exciting story. If you like science fiction and fantasy, sword and horse stories, strong well-defined characters full of determination and raw emotion... then you will love this series. Things are never as they appear, and the surprises just keep coming till the end. I recommend this series, and this author, to all of my friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I enjoyed this a lot - very different from the Dresdon Files, but well written and entertaining"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausting...","review":"I actually liked Butchers writing, and thought the overall story line was good, but had to give up this read because I became increasing tired of the non-stop violence on his poor characters. They rarely get any rest or sleep, are almost constantly getting beat up, raped, buried, strangled, punched, burned, stabbed, and attacked by magical creatures (furies) who seem to have no will of their own and are just plain nasty. I gave it up during the rape and domination scene - it was just too much! Give these poor folks a few hours of sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this book really a dare?","review":"I read that this book was a dare to the author to take the worst ideas one could come up with dealing with fantasy and make them good. Well I read this book and I agree and disagree. It was said that he was challenged with the ideas of Pokemon and the Roman Civilisation. I thought that the pokemon aspect of the book was gods awful. I hated the whole notion of 'furies'. The Roman Civilisation however I thought was a pretty good idea and played out fairly well. This book didn't work for me though. I didn't care for the overall storie, nor the characters, nor what happens to them. It was almost a struggle for me to finish. I will not be picking up the second installment, and I would not recommend this one, the first. There is plenty of other books based on bad, or overused ideas that come out much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just not for me","review":"I like Butcher's Dresden books as an interesting diversion, so I decided to give this series a try. Honestly, I never made it to the end of Book One.I think one thing that's missing here that Butcher managed to instill in the Dresden books is that I never really cared about the characters in this series. Every night, sitting down to read, I'd heave a sigh and pick this book up before finally admitting to myself that I just didn't care about these characters, didn't care whether they lived or died, and was really starting to root for the latter to happen so that it would just end.His writing is still good, but not nearly as snappy as in the Dresden series, and the dialog seems stilted. Okay, sure, older times, more formal perhaps, but I don't buy that.Wife loves this series almost as much as Dresden, so maybe it's just not the genre for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely not fun","review":"If you watch low quality anime you see the same pattern repeated in this book. Good guys have some power and no luck, bad guys have a lot more power, have all the luck and are completely ruthless and arrogant. Good guys find someone who is destined/fated/prophesied/whatever. Deus ex Machina and the good guys win one small victory. And just like bad anime, there's more intrigue than resolution in order to keep the series going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential but not up to his usual caliber","review":"I am a huge fan of his Harry Dresden book- they have a lot of the elements that this book lacks, which made this such a disappointment. The biggest flaw is that he spends far too much time on action scenes and not nearly enough time on character development. There are too many people skipping in and out, and you never get to know any of them, which makes it hard to care when they are fighting for their lives for the umpteenth time. And against who- there are so many bad guys you can't keep them straight! He writes good action scenes and describes an interesting world, but when you don't care about any of the people who live in it it gets boring.I hope that in the second novel he takes more time to develop the people since it started with such potential. In the meantime, start on the Dresden file novels. Witty, full of action and suspense and GREAT characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than what you would expect from an author this good.","review":"I don't know what happened. I wasn't expecting Harry Dresden when I picked up Furies of Calderon, but I was expecting something equally fun, witty, interesting, and--well, good.The narrative is flat. There is none of that wit that Butcher is capable of. The characters are uninteresting. The plot takes far too long to get set up.It feels like something that a 15-year old wrote. When I think about the talent the Butcher has of putting out a Dresden novel year after year--and they're all great--I look at Furies of Calderon and think he did himself a great injustice. The plot is fine, it's just that the narrative as a whole is completely lacking his usual skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really bad","review":"The Dresden Files prove that Butcher can write, worldbuild and direct compelling characters. This book has none of these qualities - the action and world are full of holes, with paper-thin characters acting in improbably, unbelievable and cliched patters of interaction.The only reasonable explanation I have is that the books have been written by someone Jim is close to and that he has lent his name to them. If you enjoy the Dresden files and the works of authors like Hobb, Rothfuss or Martin, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile, misogynistic, and contrived.....","review":"This author has some latent hostility towards women. Things start off fine as a sort of cookie-cutter high-fantasy in a male dominated culture where most women seem to be slaves, sex objects, or man-less feminist stereotypes. Then all of a sudden it's time for the gang-rape scene. One of the main female characters is forced to watch while another is drugged, gang-raped, and then tortured with a magic dog collar. Classy. All of the \\"drama\\" leading up to the climax is is so forced that it makes no sense. If you replaced all of the bafflingly mean, obtuse, sexist, and poorly written characters with normal people who acted sanely, this story would only be about half as long. The author had such a ridiculously thin plot to work through, that he was forced to pad this story with inane confrontaions and nonsensical arguments to fill the pages. I find it sad that this garbage passes for \\"popular fiction\\". What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic fantasy action","review":"Being a casual fantasy fan, I'm not going to pretend to have read all of the classics, but I do know that I liked this series. Butcher spins a wicked yarn that introduces intriguing characters, has lots of sub-plots, and includes a ton of action that all comes to a great climax. This is the case with each book of this series. I found his base premise of everyone having control of \\"furies\\" which gave them powers to be original (as far as I know) and interesting.I originally read these from the library, but will definitely be buying them all. They are worth re-reading. Being a fan of the Dresden books, I am definitely concluding that I am not only a fan of Dresden, but of Butcher's writing. Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got me hooked on the series","review":"I just finished reading this book last night, and have to say that it has rekindled my desire to read AND write (rare in any book). I have read most of the Dresden Files series and my parents recommended this series also by Jim Butcher, and thus far I have been blown away by this world he has created. The system of magic is very interesting, and I'm curious where he will go with some of the characters and plot developments that twisted within this excellent novel. Planning to start on Academ's Fury today, absolutely addicted to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible prose destroys a decently realized world","review":"This is my first Jim Butcher book, and it will be my last. His prose is simply terrible. I understand that fantasy fans have low expectations for writing quality, but this book is in a whole other category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to description","review":"I bought this book for over $100 dollars and they said it was new, with a couple rips in dust jacket; I got it and it has had something either spilled on or left by previous owners hands, plus some bent pages. All in all this book was deffinetley not new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Verbose And Slow","review":"To begin, I will not compare this series to the Dresden Files. The two series are meant to be completely different and it is unfair to the author to create an association between them.I did not enjoy this book. The writing is overly verbose, distracting from the plot, and tedious. The action takes 200 pages to develop, and even then, barely anything has happened.Also, I can't get over the fact the the character Fade is a poor imitation of George R.R. Martin's character Hodor from A Song Of Ice And Fire. Butcher also uses the name Valerian, also from Martin's series.If you're looking for good fantasy, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"I read this book about a month ago, and I have a difficult time recalling the story line. What I do remember, however, is that the author likes to use some of the same descriptive phrases frequently, which makes me grind my teeth at a certain point.I thought the world Butcher created has potential. The characters seem stiff and un-convincing, but that may change after he has some time with them over the next few books. I wouldn't buy another in this series, but I would check them out of the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough 5 star reviews on here...","review":"I finished the first two Dresden books while on vacation because I simply read them too fast, which is always a good problem to have. So luckily for me I went to the closest book store only to find out they didn't have Dresden book two, BUT they had book one of his other series. Curious. Once you start the book, meet all the characters and figure out the world you're hooked. Atleast I was, I've since gone on to read book two which is just as good.Fans of fast moving high fantasy or Jim Butcher should pick up this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"So enjoyable! I just finished this book tonight and I cant wait to start on book 2. I absolutely loved this book. Non stop action/ fantasy, humorous.. and a little romance to go with it. All you could want in a good read. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FURIES OF THE CALDERON (CODEX ALERA)","review":"Typical Jim Butcher writing where you find yourself not being able to put it down, and if you do put it down, you can't wait to pick it back up again. Once you learn the charactors you become drawn in deeper and deeper to each of their story, and wanting to know what's going to happen now, but then you're transferred to another story with every bit as much intensity, and in this book there are quite a few well written and intriging story lives that you travel back to and from, so the whole story is told at the same and right time. If you're a Jim Butcher fan, and I am, I believe you will thoroughly enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entire series is good","review":"This is one of the few series I can think of where each book is a good, solid addition. Each book has a satisfying ending (it doesn't feel like a chain of to-be-continued), yet the plot of each book builds upon the previous ones. I often thought \\"oh I know where this is going,\\" but the author frequently surprised me.This book actually isn't one of my favorites in the series. By itself, I'd give it 4 starts, but I feel like the series is so strong that it's worth giving this first book a little extra generosity. If you like the book sample, you'll like the rest of the book. If you read this book and think it's pretty good but not great, I encourage you to give the next one a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"Since I enjoyed The Dresden Files so much, I gave this a try. I was bored. I give two stars. One for trying, one for making me wish it was better. I suspect this would have been better if written right to the 10-year-olds, and not as adult fiction. Yes, that is how thin I thought it was. Sorry, Mr. Butcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Your Schedule","review":"Once you begin this book, it does not take long to get obsessed. Though this book does serve as a self-contained story, the characters and setting are so interesting that one cannot help but be tempted to tear right into the second book, then the third, then the fourth... It is well worth your time! FOR CALDERON! FOR ALERA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit simplistic, nothing new.","review":"Jim Butcher has said that early on in his writing career he failed at writing \\"sword and horse\\" fantasy novels. This series proves that maybe he hasn't really overcome that failure. His system of magic, furies, is terribly inconsistent, and things are routinely done that goes against the rules that he has laid out. And as he has proven in his better series \\"the dresden files\\" he continues to have absolutely no idea how men and women interact with each other. This deficiency is painfully obvious, and makes men of his intimate dialogue scenes nearly unbearable. Not only that its tough to say whether its an homage or just his writing, but the writers that he claims are influences seem less like influences and more like source material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apparently, the universal sign of a character's nervousness in this book is licking their lips.","review":"There's nothing else to say about this book that hasn't already been said. I decided to pick this up after reading the first of the Dresden Files and enjoyed it quite a bit. It does it's job well enough in introducing a new world and the characters are likeable. I'll be reading the rest of the series.One thing bothered me though, just a minor gripe. It seemed like every time Jim wanted to convey uneasiness or anticipation in his characters he would use the action of them, \\"licking their lips\\". It's used so often that I started to laugh about it towards the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Book. Gets better with each book.","review":"This series is great. The first in the series was a bit confusing because you are just expected to follow along without much knowledge or description of how this world works. I think the second through the fourth are my favorite. The series gets better as it builds. I will definitely read this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I loved this book. I've read the whole series 3-4 times now. This book has a few slow spots, but it's an excellent beginning to an amazing series. While the pattern of talentless farm boy succeeds against all odds has been used before (Belgariad, Xanth), this book still does a good job of introducing the characters and makes you want to keep reading the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great change of style","review":"It amazes me how many reviewers try to compare this to the Dresden novels. Personally I love to see a writer who has something different to offer, and I wasn't disappointed in this book.I admired Tavi's struggle to adapt to an environment where he clearly does not fit in. The mechanisms he had developed to not only cope but conquer that environment rang true (in the context of a fantasy novel of course).The idea of the furies was something I hadn't come across in any other novel to date and I found the premise fascinating and refreshing.I have now read the whole series and enjoyed the development of the story line and characters in general but, because of the newness of the premise in this first book, it's my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"The characters often seem cartoonish and the dialogue is wooden and fake. I had to put it down after one of the characters said, \\"Oh Goodie,\\" at the thought of having a chance to kill something. I mean, come on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly explained and lacks great conflict.","review":"Whenever Butcher is attempting to explain the plot through his characters' dialog it comes across as forced, unnatural and illogical. What the furies are and how they function are not clearly explained in the beginning so that the reader ends up attempting to infer much about them without ever having a clear picture of them. Many elements in the story are very illogical such as the romance between Bernard and Amara and Fidelias' betrayal. The characters have no great appeal and rarely experience any great internal conflict and their actions are very predictable. The overall conflict of good and evil is fairly basic and has no unique element to make the story fresh and colorful. Although Butcher uses the abuses against female characters to help his readers see the evil of the antagonists, he makes no similar effort to show the protagonists as great or likable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Let Down!","review":"All I can say is that I was truly dissapointed in this book. I have read fantasy/Sci-fi nearly all of my life and this was a waste of $8.00 and change. The Author seems to write like this is his first novel and he is trying really hard to throw every possible situation and character definition into 500 pages of dribble. The main character, if you want to call him that since the book is so choppy, is well built I suppose. But it also follows the same pat design of so many other GOOD novels by GOOD authors (ex: Eddings and Feist). I am not comparing those two authors to Butcher since that would be like comparing a kindergarten play to Broadway. It is even so embarassing that one of Butcher's place names is the same as Eddings in the Belgariad. I suggest to save your money and time by not purchasing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unreadable","review":"I've enjoyed Butcher's Dresden series and relished finding 'Furies Of Calderon' to read on a business trip. After three valiant attempts at reading it, I had to put it down. Within four chapters, Butcher throws two fistfuls of characters at the reader who are invested with innumerous cheesy magical powers, but this reader wasn't able to care about any of them. It takes a scorecard to keep track of all the characters and their gratuitous powers and a scorecard isn't supplied by the publisher. How did this get past the editors? So screw it. Save your money and skip this title. Butcher didn't care about the story or the reader in this one. You won't miss anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the review - Jim Lays an Egg","review":"I enjoyed the first half of this book but just got tired of the non-stop action.

Weissbluth gives excellent advice (our son now sleeps!) but I would suggest buying this book OR Healthy Sleep, Happy Child but not both, there is too much overlap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art imitating life","review":"Thing I liked the most about this movie is that it shows the bad guy does not always get it in the end.The character of Kat is completely amoral and a user.When she didn't get her way,she became petty and vindictive.This is a great indie movie to watch simply because it goes against the traditional Hollywood ending where the good people win and the bad ones get their comeuppance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked nice but...","review":"Looks pretty in the picture and when received, but it is stiff and was not possible to position it so it didn't look twisted when being worn.

And a bite valve that has a cover to block out dirt when hiking. It has d rings if u need them and more of the tube has insulation on it than other brands. Cons: when compared to equivalent blackhawk products you realize some deficits. It sits fairly flat but spreads out a lot on a Molle vest. The fact the bladder doesn't pull out means it is harder to dry (especially if it is attached to a vest). And u cant add an insulated pouch. The Molle strips don't even compare to blackhawk speed strips.My suggestion. Don't get it if you have it attached to a Molle vest. Otherwise it is fine for throwing in a backpack or on a belt. Dont forget to get a drying hanger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its gotten bad","review":"Look, im an open person, and I generally love spoof movies. Dont be a menace, Scary Movies 1 and 2. But ever since 2006, when they released Scary Movie 4 and Date movie, which were complete trash, I've given up. These movies seem to be made for young children, and Pop culture references are funny, when well written and craftily designed. But these are not and they are terrible. They need to stop making these movies, but they turn a profit, so it continues. Epic movie, Date Movie, The Comeback, This, and Superhero movie, are all trash, and they are making a Scary Movie 5 and Date Movie, This needs to stop, sorry im not in 8th grade anymore and these are not funny. David Zucker has really lowered the bar, Airplane, Naked Gun, and even BASEketball were funny, this is just trash"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY PAY TO SEE THIS C R A P? !","review":"Even with a running length of a little over an hour 'Meet The Spartans' runs out of steam after the first couple of minutes. I can't believe anyone paid to see this film without demanding a refund. Ok I know most of these films are only mildly funny anyway, but this one is really lame even for these types of films.

Thanks to those who do this.The 1.85:1 video quality was very detailed, but had a fine grain, and I don't understand how such a recent movie could have grain (I thought they filmed all new movies digitally). There was so much detail, the skin of the people, and there was a lot of skin in this movie, looked gross with all of the imperfections. I only give the video quality of this movie an 8.2 on a 10.0 scale.The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was adequate; nothing special.The movie only lasted about an hour and 10 minutes. The credits started at a hour and 8 minutes. When I watched this on satellite a year of two ago, I thoroughly enjoyed it. This time I found it boring, and don't even remember seeing half of the look-a-like characters that were in the credits. Maybe I was just tired when I saw it this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its just for laughs","review":"This movie really is hilarious--I definitely laughed out loud. I loved the guy who played Leonidas--he acted so seriously, like the Leonidas in 300, which made him even funnier. The key here is that you HAVE TO HAVE SEEN 300 to get all the jokes. All those folks who bashed this movie obviously didn't see 300, or Stomp the Yard for that matter (funniest scene)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Funny!","review":"They of course make fun of the movie \\"300\\". Even though I liked a lot \\"300\\", I appreciated the way \\"Meet the Spartans\\" made fun of it.They made fun of the movie themes, characters, and story line. They even made fun of famous celebrities such as Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Linsey Lohan, and others. They mocked the movie in every way possible, and they did a great job at it I must say.The movie is a Must See!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Bad","review":"Those who haven't seen the movie \\"300\\" probably won't get most of the jokes in \\"Meet the Spartans,\\" and those who HAVE seen it probably won't get them either. That's because for any audience this is one of the worst, most jaw-droppingly witless parodies in motion picture history (and that's saying quite a lot).Suffice it to say that this slapdash mixture of gladiator-movie cliches and truly lame pop culture references has enough homophobic jokes to set the cause of gay rights back a good quarter of a century or more (OK, these Spartan warriors like men; we get it, we get it!).Indicative of the movie's utter failure at pacing and timing are two scenes - one at the \\"pit of death\\" and another featuring a step-dance competition between the Greeks and the Persians - that drone on for a minor eternity. But then the whole movie goes on too long - 86 minutes too long to be exact."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies Ever Made","review":"Words fail me.

However, too often, it is too over the top to be funny. Rather than being subtle or witty, it hits you over the head with its jokes until they get annoying. For example, the first time the soldiers use a \\"blue screen\\" army, it's kind of funny. When that same trick is used several times, it's kind of boring. Too bad - it actually had a surprising amount of potential to be a truly funny farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be an option for no stars.","review":"Clearly this movie deserves not even one out of five stars. Horrible trailer, and an even worse movie. They even have some fake ugly Megatron looking thing playing that creepy looking dude from youtube in it, when that video wasn't viral for being funny, it was viral for being extremely disturbing.

Unfortunately every thing worth seeing is in the trailers, and the rest is basically unbearable.I'll give them the one star, but just for about the first 5 minutes. There was a few chuckles around the pit scene, but that's pretty much the highlight of the movie. It's a damn shame too, because they had enough of a set up to do a decent spoof of 300. Instead they turned to humor that appears to be written by kids 14 and under.....Not much there.

It's even difficult to put into words how bad this film was. It is supposed to be a comedy but it sure isn't funny. It's not intelligent humor, or bathroom humor or slapstick humor or satire or...whatever kind of humor is left. It's not even silly. It's just some kind of rambling exercise in how not to make a movie. Even a take off on another movie or movies has to have some level of coherence. Look at Monty Python and the Holy Grail. That was totally silly, but it at least had some kind of plot to carry along it's nonsensical way. 'MEET THE SPARTANS' does not even insult the viewer's intelligence. It just assumes the watcher has no intelligence. And, oh my god, Kevin Sorbo. Somebody must have something on him to get him to be in this mess. No way would he do it for the role or the money.

If it weren't for Carmen, I'd been totally bored. I really can't believe that Sorbo was in this one.It does have some \\"entertaining\\" moments, but they are far and few between.If you just don't have anything on TV, or TIVO, then RENT it.

In fact, just don't have ANY expectations of it, and I am sure you'll be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!!","review":"Do you know the saying less is more? I am so glad Kevin Sorbo was in this movie or I would have totally wasted my money renting it. I found the endless gay references were getting tiresome and just weren't amusing at all. I am usually not bothered and sometimes amused by crude humor but this was on a level where I just kept finding myself completely grossed out. Perhaps I'm am getting more delicate with age but this is just ridiculous! It seems as if people are not given credit for the ability to find subtle humor amusing. Usually Lampoon movies are more silly and have more slapstick but this was more along the lines of yucky and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so funny","review":"The humor is kind of lame and sometimes doesn't make sense.

Editors and contributors seem to have little knowledge of the theological reasoning behind Church teaching or the function of Chruch hierarchy. Arguments on abortion, birth control, and women's ordination are one-sided, and do not reflect the beauty of the Church's view of sexuality, such as John Paul II's Theology of the Body.

This lively album is a mix of swing and rockabilly that packs quite a punch. Although I doubt any modern swing fan would be unfamiliar, he is recommended to fans of the Cherry Poppin Daddies and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. Indeed, he was doing it long before these other bands, and he will survive the demise of the new movement. Setzler, solo and with the Stray Cats is rightly considered the father of modern swing. Stand out tracks include \`Rock This Town' and \`This Cat's On A Hot Tin Roof'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great neo-swing with rock mixed in for good measure","review":"This album is very popular with neo-swing fans but what I like most is the guitar work. Brian sounds like he could have been a student of Danny Gatton, although I have no idea if they ever even met. His style flows seamlessly through genres from swing, jazz, rock, and country. He has a nice voice and would have potential as a crooner if he got some formal training. Even as he is, I was quite amazed to hear the Sinatra influenced crooning style against other gritty vocals that recall the Stray Cats. I had to check the liner notes to see if it was the same person. This is swing with an edge with broad appeal. I would have given it 5 stars if Brian were as good a singer in this style as Harry Connick Jr."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Listen!","review":"I bought this CD to replace the cassette version I already owned years ago.

I was fortunate enough to catch a live performance in San Francisco on August 15th, and the CD was nearly as good as the performance. (Nothing could top that show, though!)

However, it's not for everyone. IT IS NOT ROCK. It's a swing/rock/jazz/orchestra hybrid that works really well. Even if you don't like saxophones and trumpets and such you will probably still like this album because it is guitar-oriented. Especially of note are the songs Rock This Town, This Cat's On A Hot Tin Roof, and the excellent instrumental Sleepwalk. The only thing I don't like about this is that some of the lyrics are really corny and subpar (especially on Nosey Joe and As Long As I'm Singin'), but such is the nature of swing music.

The rockabilly-swingin' hits just keep comin' from The Brian Setzer Orchestra and \\"The Dirty Boogie\\" just proves that. From \\"Switchblade 327\\" to the classic remake \\"Sleepwalk\\" and the ultra-popular \\"Jump Jive An' Wail\\", this guy knows his sh---stuff!! One listen and you'll be hooked. Buy the CD, what more can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Upbeat and Bright!","review":"This is even better than Guitar Slinger. Song number 6, Jump, Jive an' Wail is, in my opinion, the epitome of modern swing.If you want a song that's a bit slower, number 9, Since I Don't Have You, is outstanding. This CD has something for just about anyone. The vocals are wonderful, showing his impressive range.I love the bright brassy sound, especially as a former trumpet player. This CD is a blast to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALLBUM IS HOT!","review":"I saw the Brian Setzer Orchestra last week live which was an awesome experience, but if you don't have the chance buy this CD! Every track makes you want to get up and dance. Setzer just keeps finding new ways to show off his stuff. From the rockabilly three piece Stray cats to a seventeen piece orchestra he makes the conversion flawlessly.Everything from the saxaphone to the bass sound perfect.The bright horn section is the highlight. Fun and varying lyrics about all different subjects keep the album interesting and unique from start to finish. My favorite song is Jump Jive 'N Wail. This track will make even the most full fledged swing hater tap their toes. Keep on crankin' out the great stuff Brian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good Music!!","review":"I picked this up at a local Salvation Army for 2 dollars. Boy was it worth it! Listening to it now I would have paid full list price. Once in a while I would find out that my mom had taken it to listen to while cleaning. This is a great up beat album to listen to. This is the kind of music you would hear at local carshows over the loudsystem. Brian Setzer's cover of Santo & Johnny's Sleep walk is outstanding! I also love his version of Rock This Town (Originally done with his preceeding band the Stray Cats). I also love the mellow grooves in track 12, Hollywood Nocturne."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great set by a master of rockabilly lounge music","review":"This guy is cool, and I love swing dancing to this cd, though I've never seen him in person, this cd shows loads of energy and a charismatic voice.

I love her version of Rosemary Clooney's hit \\"This 'Ol House\\" and his fun verssion of Prima's Jump Jive n wail, and a great duet with retro 40's babe Gwen Stefani, Your The Boss. A perfect cd in every way. Buy it today. I must warn you though his follow up to this cd is Vavoom, and it is terrible. But this cd is HEAVENLY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn Good!","review":"Brian Setzer has an ability to bring back old jazz tunes to make it more modern. Basically, he knows how to rejuvenate jazz, and give us some thought that jazz is still alive today.

Its an staple in my car's cd player. I love 12 of the 13 songs on the CD. And almost all of them are both great to dance to and listen to. If you don't own any swing CD's and you want to buy just one for DANCING, get this CD. No question. For listening, I would recommend Hipsters, Zoots and Wingtips, but this CD is still great to just listen to. This CD is definately in my top 5 CDs of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing This Town","review":"This is the best record of The Brian Setzer Orchestra! Jump Blues and Swing of course. Great! Cover \\"Jump, Jive, An' Wail\\" of Louis Prima is great, \\"You're the Boss\\" of Elvis/Ann Margret (Viva Las Vegas movie) is better than original (Gwen Stefani sings great), \\"As Long as I'm Singing\\" is an old Bobby Darin song, \\"This Cat's on a Hot Tin Roof\\", \\"The Dirty Boogie\\", \\"Let's Live It Up\\" and \\"Hollywood Nocturne\\" and \\"Switchblade 327\\" are his originals, while \\"Sleepwalk\\" (orig. Santo & Johnny), \\"Rock This Town\\" (orig. Stray Cats), \\"Since I Don't Have You\\" (orig. The Skyliners), \\"Nosey Joe\\" (orig. Bull Moose Jackson) are very good covers too.Some excellent musicians are featured here (Tony Garnier - stand-up bass, Mark Winchester (ex.

I've always love the Stray Cats but knew very little of the BSO before this release. Then BAM! \\"Jump, Jive & Wail\\" was released as a single, & it smacked you right in the face. You were forced to hear more, as 2 million sales indicated. Fantastic! Brian sounds as great as ever, & his backing 16 pieces orchestra is tight! All of the songs are great, so basically they are all highlights. Even Gwen Stefani ads vocals to \\"You're The Boss\\", in her early No Doubt days. If you are a music lover & you plan to buy a new cd, make this your purchase...it's fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Setzer Swings and includes west coast beach influence","review":"With a variety of styles (one arrangement brings visions of the Beach Boys and a little Do-wap) blended into strong swing arrangements.

If you are a swing orchestra fanatic or new to the style, this is a great listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I've bought in many years!","review":"If you like Guitar Slinger, you will enjoy this CD even more! The variations of notes he uses really blows me away! They are very creative. Being a musician myself, I look for things like that. A great song is \\"You're the Boss\\", in which he has Gwen Sephani, from No Doubt, do a duet with him. Her voice adds so much to this song. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes the combination of rock-a-billy and swing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Altogether great album for old and new fans of big band.","review":"This album is a great mix of original big band sounds and new, 90's sounds. It's a perfect mix actually. Cherry Poppin' Daddies, on one hand, is all 90's, but Glenn Miller, on the other hand, is all 40's and 50's. The Brian Setzer Orchestra combines the best of both styles and in a peppy, sophisticated, musically aggressive yet refreshingly innocent sound that makes Dirty Boogie one of favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing album","review":"From start to finish, this CD is a work of art. The production is amazing, and the musicianship is unparalleled. Brian Setzer's voice is in top form, from the soulful crooning of \\"Since I Don't Have You\\" to the raspy wailing of \\"This Cat's On a Hot Tin Roof\\". And it goes without saying that Setzer is one of the finest guitarists in popular music. Blistering leads with his signature Gretsch sound abound, while we're also treated to more understated instrumental gems such as \\"Sleepwalk\\". Setzer was always a talent to be reckoned with, but his work with the Brian Setzer Orchestra shows him maturing into a seasoned musician and singer whom I certainly hope will continue releasing albums in this vein. If this album doesn't sweep the Grammy Awards for 1998, there is no God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite swing, but still very good","review":"Ever since I first heard \\"Sing, Sing, Sing\\" I've been hooked on big band swing music. My foray into the many neo-swing bands is still in its early stages, but this CD was a good investment. A lot of the tracks are more jump blues than swing, but with the exception of \\"You're the Boss,\\" every song is solid and has a great sound. If you're looking for a pure swing album like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, you might be initially disappointed. I was. But as I became more attuned to the style of this album, I've enjoyed it more with each listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect CD for those with high energy seeking minds!","review":"This CD will replace your morning coffee if you let it. \\"Jump, Jive an' Wail\\" stimulates you up and out of your chair.

Full of energy, I have never been into this kind of music until I saw that Gap commercial and spent an hour in the music store immediatly after searching out this CD.

It will make you pull your hair out and want to chuck the controller into the TV. And it never get's better. You can't excel at this game. You can practice moves in the sparing area as much as you want but when it comes to the real game, you'll never get a chance to use the moves you've practiced and in the rare instance that you can use the move, IT JUST WON'T WORK!!!!

This game gets real boaring after awhile so this is an okay game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead or Alive 4","review":"This is the worst fighting game I have ever played.The graphics are nice, the controls are simple. The frustration level is through the roof. At many points you may as well set the controller on the floor as you get locked into seeming endless combos by your opponents, unable to do anything. They will constantly grab you, constantly counter you, and there's not a thing you can do to stop it.

But now in part 2 the curse travels outside the house. So now you can become cursed by coming into contact with a person who was a friend of a person who's cousin's boyfriend's mother was in the house. Not really...but it does seem that just about everyone gets cursed in this one and it's rediculous.The Grudge 2 falls far below its predecessors. The plot is inconsistent. The acting is so bad that it's disgusting and is apparent from the very first scene of the film. The cinematography is bad. The scary scenes are predictable. And there are plenty of horror movie cliches, too! I kept watching this film - which seemed way too long - hoping it would get better and it just doesn't. This movie was a total disaster and I really feel like I wasted my time and money renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor rehash of the first film","review":"Sometimes it's best to stop when you are ahead. I loved the first film. It was very scary, in my opinion, one of the scariest films I've seen - even more so than the first Nightmare on Elm Street and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But this film uses some of the same gimmicks to get scares as the first film. So naturally, seeing them the second time isn't scary. The movie is also a bit incoherent. It jumps around a bit in time and plot to the point that it's hard to follow. It leaves you thinking, \\"what's going on?\\" I love Japanese horror and some of the American remakes, but this one is one to skip. Go watch The Ring, both American and Japanese versions, the first Grudge film, the American version, or any of the numerous other films of this sort out there - The Locker 1 and 2, Pulse, Pray, and Dark Water (all the Japanese versions) are more good ones to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a grudge...","review":"You know?

At least the first one had the sweet security camera scene. Not at all up to par with the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man,this movie sucks.","review":"Don't believe the hype. This movie sucks. Nothing happened. The ghost of a boy and a lady showed up every now and then,then the movie ended. I'm not one to usually complain about or laugh at cheap effects. I actually think that the so called low buget 1980s movies look a lot more realistic than todays CGI. But I just had to laugh at the sound that the ghosts made. I imediately reconized it as a sound I used to make with my mouth all the time as a wee lad."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Terrifying Than The Ring? Not.....","review":"Although I didn't find The Ring terrifying, this movie surely isn't terrifying at all. But I guess you can't expect much horror in a PG-13 rated movie. It has also been compared to the movie 28 Days Later which is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar tries to give a shocking performance in this movie but fails terribly. She moves to Tokyo to continue her nursing career and learns about mysterious deaths and she tries to find the source of the deaths. All I can remember about this film is the stupid looking child who once he opens his mouth and you are witness to it, you die. We find out the child is a ghost who died a terrible death and now is seeking revenge. No blood, no gore, not scary and overall disappointing. I hope they don't plan to make The Grudge 2.

I will watch one, and then if I am alone or walking around my house at night actually start turning on lights, getting that creepy feeling.

Also we have the freaky phone calls, and the curse that will never end. All the screen writers did is changed everything over to Japanese; thinking no one would recognize this movie as being The Ring. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but after viewing it, I wanted my 1 1/2 hr back.

With the exception of the haunted house which was identical, the set was highly gentrified in the US version (large high-rise apartments, plasma monitors, flat-screen TVs, posh hospital and detective office,etc.) which took away from the original's dark feel.

IF YOU REALLY FEEL AS IF YOU'VE EARN THE MONEY YOU'VE WORKED FOR!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"The simple fact that the leading character is Sarah Michelle Gellar should tell you enough. This movie is pure crap. There is not one part in this movie that is scary...I was laughing and fast forwarding the DVD most of the time because I was able to anticipate every seen and grew tired of it dragging along. Boy did this movie just suck. Don't listen to all the losers who think this is a good horror movie. Trust me, it blows."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie sucks","review":"I cannot believe that some people like this movie. Like the title says, \\"The movie sucks.\\" I'am not going to give you a deep and well thought out review, this movie doesn't deserve that. Instead I'am going to give you a list of why this movie sucks.1) It only gives you cheap scares, which aren't very scary, that does not have any lasting effect.2) The story line sucks. It tries to draw the viewer in by making it into a tragic love story that isn't very well done.3) There is very little character development.4) It's VERY boring.I'am now tired of wasting my life on this movie. I will end by saying if you want a good movie, don't look here. Instead buy the japanese version. It's about 20 times better that this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your Time..","review":"This is a boring repackage of a Japanese horror film. Apparently, children hiding in a closet and catatonic old women are scary in Japan. Sarah Michelle Gellar should have stuck with Buffy. The \\"Hush\\" episode of Buffy is scarier than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the movie you saw in the theater.","review":"To be honest with you, I didn't like THE GRUDGE 2 (That was my friend who wrote the previous review, sorry). I rented the unrated director's cut on Friday. I was expecting a better movie... and that's not what I got. The cover says \\"Contains scenes too scary for theaters\\", that is a boldface lie. They cut out the scene where Kayako's face presses up against the plastic. They don't even include it in the deleted scenes, they just erase it like it never existed! The new material isn't even scary, it's just a bunch of stuff you don't care about. So really, I don't even reccomend any version of THE GRUDGE 2, in fact I think it's all utter garbage. But if I were to reccomend a version, it would be the the theatrical."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This movie scared me horibly and I couldnt sleep for weeks.The plot is phenomenal.

I mean come on do people really think that meowing kids, and Japanese women in every picture of one guy is really scary....I have seen Disney halloween movies scarier than this. poor special effects as well.....there is a part with some gost or zombie girl is crawling down the stairs of the house....it looks like somthing you would see in a 50's king kong or godzilla movie. I thought this movie would be better but the truth is the scariest parts were all put in the advirtisements on TV and those weren't even scary. If you want to see a scary movie watch George Romero's movies. like Night of the living dead or the recent movie Land of the Dead"},{"rating":"1","title":"You will have a grudge against the producers","review":"This was pretty bad - I have to be more than a little irritated to take the time to write a review. First, the thing was in the model of a greek trajedy. It was just a series of bad things happening. It did not seem to matter if the characters were courageous or ingenious. It did not matter if they ran from the problems or faced them - there was no hope.Second - the flashbacks were badly done - it was never clear whether you were looking at past or present, and the plot was a hairball. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I'm a big SMG fan and so I watched this. Too bad I didn't read some of the reviews first. This was a big stinking waste of 2 hours of my life. It was the most disjointed movie I've ever seen; we leap from one silly, nonsensical part to the next and it is as disjointed as the goofy ghost-girl that pops up to drag people off to whatever lays beyond the mirror.Maybe if I'd watched them in order this would have made sense, but now I'm not even going to give the first one a chance because this one was so terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Imitation","review":"A sub par imitation of the first one and in some places, \\"The Ring.\\" Note to the director: Neither eeriness nor creepiness can replace an actual storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Offal Is This?","review":"This movie stank.

I finally figured out where I was supposed to follow the story about 3/4 of the way through the film. A lot of scenes dragged on, and there were times I had to stop the DVD and say I'd come back later to finish. Usually, when you have big name actors in a horror movie (Sarah Michelle Gellar is no Tom Hanks, but she is pretty well known), there's usually more of a fixation on the actor and less with the story of the movie. Some other good examples of this would be Scream (Nev Campbell, David Arquette, Drew Barrymore), I Know What You Did Last Summer (another with Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Jennifer Love Hewitt), and House on Haunted Hill (Tey Diggs, Chris Kattan). I do give two stars for the great cinematography. That's about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another American blunder","review":"If possible this movie is worse than the Ring 2.

Freaky movie!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound System Not Good for UMD Movies","review":"The Grudge is a 4 star (out of 5) movie, but for the PSP... the sound system must be higher quality. I bought this for 20 bucks at a store, because I was going on a trip soon. I tried the plane's, my own, and the PSP's headphones and none of them produced good sound quality. The games get good sound quality, while the movies are so much lower, that sometimes you can't hear what they're saying. It's so annoying. Get it on DVD, and you'll at least be more satisfied than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still have goosebumps..Grudge 2 rocks!!","review":"I never write movie reviews, but had to let everyone know what a profound effect this had on me. This is an excellent sequel to The Grudge. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning up to the last frame. The film was directed perfectly and the music score was super.For those of you who had written bad reviews, sorry...the curse is now with YOU!!!See this one as it is on my top 10 list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commendable movie, uncommendable ending","review":"This movie was undoubtedly quite creepy, and had some positive fear-producing features that few or no other films possess. For example, the film had a neat scene where a man is watching a security camera tape in which an entity forms a few feet away from the camera and then advances until its eyes appear right in front of the screen. Another good part is when a jaw is found in a cellar and a man confronts the girl who has lost the jaw. The only negative factors in my opinion were that the acting was generally kind of lousy, and that the movie ended on such an undecided note (the creature's face being zoomed in on). Regardless, though, this movie is definitely to be classified as a thriller and I would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grudge 2....total junk!!!","review":"How can so many people rate this movie a high star?!?It overused the same ghostly scenes from the Grudge and it was extremly predictable. You already know how it will end when you watch the first twenty minutes of it.I mean, it showed the same house that was \\"burned down\\" in part one, and had the same effect as it: people visit the house, then they are cursed. Nothing can beat the original. nothing. You are wasting your time with this movie, seriously.If you did not think this was a bad movie then answer this one question: why was that man eating breakfast at the table killed, along with the others when they never visited the house AND (mind you) they were in CHICAGO, not JAPAN?!?!?!?! wow, do NOT rent this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stinker","review":"I didnt have very many high hopes for this movie and so I wasnt disappointed. With the rash of Japanese Remakes, this one just falls in line with all the others. It replaces the general skin creeping suspense and overall unease of the original with \\"Gotcha!\\" moments. There are no scenes of blood and guts in the original but Hollywood felt compelled to add them for the remake. WHY?? Blood and Guts do NOT make a horror movie!If you want a scary movie, Get the original Ju-On. They are ofcourse very similar but Ju-On will have you pulling the blanket over your eyes and pulling the covers far back before you go to sleep.From now on Ill be skipping the American remakes and just sticking with the original J-Horror movies, Dark Water, Eyes with out a face, A Tale of Two Sisters etc Hollywood will ruin them all sooner or later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffy Does Tokyo!!!!","review":"It took me like, 3 days to finally watch the whole movie. I kept falling asleep or would just shut it down due to boredome. The story was contrived and dull, it seemed like they just wanted to make a \\"Ring\\"-type movie, hoping they could bank off it. The special effects were totally subpar and this film was NOT scary!!!!!!!! It was actually funny. I burst out laughing when the creepy crawly ghost thingies made \\"scary\\" noises. I can picture the filmakers getting all excited and caught up \\"Yeah! this will get 'em, that's sure to freak 'em out!\\" NOT. Instead of being disturbing, the frog like groans reminded me of a 10 year old trying to annoy his parents. Totally lame! Nothing could save this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh .... Well .... Okay","review":"The Grudge has maybe two or three good moments, but they are quick frights and hardly enough to sustain a full length feature. Reccommended for SMG fans and those afraid of close-ups of young Japanese children."},{"rating":"2","title":"ju-on , ju-on 2, the grudge","review":"the grudge (the 2nd re-make of ju-on) i liked better then the first re-make of ju-on, but nothing beats the ju-on 2 re-make. the ju-on 2 re-make was the scariest movie i've ever seen! i was told that their was independent versions of ju-on and ju-on 2 that came out before the movie budget re-made ones and that they are the scariest of them all.but you've gotta see the originals, 'cause they tell even more of the story, each re-make tells the same story but from another characters point of view"},{"rating":"2","title":"scared the s*** out of me...","review":"The people who are giving this movie a bad review are just crazy. This was one of the BEST and most satisfying horror movies I have seen in a long time, if ever. I cannot remember a movie that has freaked me out more and left me afraid to get up at night to go to the bathroom. I knew that \\"she\\" and the little boy were just waiting for me. The sounds and visuals are fantastic and overly effective, so much so that it still stays with me even months after seeing the film. This was a great horror movie and one that, because of the scares, I will not have the nerve to even watch again anytime soon. Even the TV ads for it bother me. It's a must see, but only if you have someone to sleep in the same bed with you after seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. There is zero plot and no story line. The acting was terrible, but what can you expect from Buffy the Vampire Slayer?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scary flick","review":"I won't tell you about the movie plot, everyone else seems to have that covered quite nicely. What I will say is that this rates as one of the scariest movies I own, I don't understand what all the negativity is about, I'm guessing the people who didn't like this movie shouldn't watch horror movies, and certainly shouldn't rate them. These are not meant to be logical, they're not meant to be philosophical, they're not meant to resemble reality in any way, shape, or form, they're meant to scare the crap out of you, and The Grudge does just that. Enjoyed it tremendously, 5 stars. -kd5-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Japanese version?","review":"This is one of those rare occasions when the remake is almost better than the original. Don't get me wrong, I liked the original Japanese version it's just that I felt the story dragged on a little longer than it needed to whereas this version cuts out certain scenes from the Japanese film which realy helps in holding your attention to the film.While this is not your typical horror film (high body count, blood etc) this certianly is a scary film (loved the scene with the woman coming down the stairs in the Japanese version I felt that scene slightly overplayed itself)Buffy is great in this film by the way and if you liked the Ring you will enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected","review":"The previews for this movie looked like it would be a good one, but I was very disappointed. It was slightly boring and just when you thought something unexpected would happen, not much did. Then you would think as least the ending would finally make up for the slack and it was also disappointing. So, I suggest save your money for a better film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT MOVIE!!!","review":"Hello my name is Sarah and this is a very scary and interesting movie. I loved this movie it had a great meaning to it. Then it made me scared to be alone in my own house. Buy this movie and you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of gotchas, but not much else","review":"The violent circumstances of a Japanese family's death have given rise to a curse in which all who enter their old house are stalked and killed by demons representing the dead family. That's not much of a plot, which is why this isn't much of a movie. In scene after scene, we watch a hapless person bumble through an abandoned area, slowly coming to the realization that they are not alone. They all eventually succumb to the fear that envelopes them, and the demons manifest themselves in a variety of creepy ways before dispatching the bumblers. The production values are high, and the scenes are very creepy/scary/disturbing, which is saying something. But any attempt to inject reason or logic into viewing the movie bursts the bubble, and ultimately, there's just not enough to sustain a feature film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I Could Give It A Zero Star!","review":"Is it me or were the previews for this movie better than the movie itself!I went and saw this movie last night for free, and I think I want my money back! This was an absolutely horrendous movie. TERRIBLE! I know it came out on DVD this week but I'm here to tell you DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS! It isn't anywhere near as good as the first one.1. Too many subplots. They somehow interwine in the end but nonsensically.2. This movie isn't scary at all! The scenes that were scary in the original are used again in this one, i.e., the Grudge coming from the a shadow in the ceiling, the ghost under the cover, and the little boy making the cat sound. All the same scenes, just a new movie.3. And finally there were quite a few unneccessary scenes and unneccessary charachters.This movie was terrible. Borrow someones or rent it before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down!","review":"I had watched Ju-On The Grudge, the original japanese version, and I was creeped out by it.

I'm glad I saw the original version first, and a word of advice: buy the original Ju-On version, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it didn't sell in Japan why bother with it here?","review":"The story was hard to nail down, so I'm still not quite sure what the grudge was supposed to be. The story bounces around so much that the viewer is never really aware of who's who and what's going on. Confusing story telling to say the least.Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing. The only thing remotely scary about this movie is the sound the thing makes, now that was creepy. Watch it if you want, but don't say I didn't warn you. Some may love it. I'm a spooky horror movie fan from way back, if I didn't like it you can bet it's not a great movie.

I pre-bought 2 tickets to see this at a local theatre back in November. I then secured a babysitter and told my wife we were going out. She was delightfully surprised and she asked what I was taking her to see. I said, \\"lets just go, it was #1 in the theatre in it's first week of release.\\" Let me just say that roughly 10 minutes into the movie, she hit me in the arm, because I picked out a bad movie. I told her we could just leave and go to dinner. She said, \\"maybe it will get better\\" It didn't. Afterwards, when walking out of the theater, another couple was blabbing about how bad it was and we commiserated together and all 4 of us stated what a colossal waste of 2 hours it was.The acting is pitiful. There isn't a single noteworthy exchange of dialogue between any characters the entire feature. The only reason I am writing this is to save 2 hours of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror Flick","review":"An American nurse comes to work in Tokyo.

Now, the hollywood producers are running out of ideas and have to borrow (or buy) ideas from other foreign markets and re-produce it to fit the American audiences. The funny thing is: American audiences seem to like it and do find it fresh. Personally, I do find it boring and predictable, not something new or interesting. I have seen them all. Not much for me to say about this film. How come people can give such a long review!?!?!?

It's also one of those movies that is hard to describe the plot without giving spoilers, because it jumps back and forth through time, making it next to impossible to follow in a logical sequence.There weren't any real surprises-- plenty of people following the old dictum of going through \\"That Door\\"-- you know the one where everyone in the theater shouts, \\"Don't go through that door!\\" The people also climbed stairs and went into dark rooms without turning on lights-- plenty of people just begging to be victims.This would probably be a good date movie to watch at the drive-in theater but watching it on the home DVD player just didn't deliver the expected chills and thrills."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch it alone...","review":"This movie has an interesting style of story telling. It has what I like to call trinity sight system. It tells three separate stories in an out of order sequence so that in the conclusion of the movie they all lead into each other finalizing the story.I watched this movie by myself late at night and boy can I tell you the chilling effect this movie gives a person while they're alone is intense. It's a lot more intense than the previous movie because now the curse poses more of an overall threat. But you will have to watch the movie to find out how so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre writing, directing, and acting","review":"Japanese films have a long tradition of ghost stories, both played for scares and morality lessons. The new wave of ghost stories have caught on in the West but the results are bumpy. Grudge 2 doesn't have the surprise factors that the first movie did and has to rely on other devices to be engaging. It fails. Many of the scenes have the actors slowly walking around dark rooms and then finding something, maybe a ghost, maybe a body, maybe someone just hiding. Sound familiar? It has all the conventional scenes of horror films and none of what made Grudge a thrilling scary ride. I prefer mystery to horror and gore so I liked the Grudge well enough. However Grudge 2 oculd easily be skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will put you to sleep or make you laugh","review":"This movie really does suck. It is a very boring uninspired remake with lackluster acting, zero story, a few moody camera shots that were done much better in Ju-on. This is very much the definition of what sucks in American Cinema today, lets take an overall good foreign film, redo it with an American cast, squeeze out any out the chills and originality and make it a nice boring safe flick for the kiddies.PG-13 is destroying the horror film!Don't buy this tripe don't even watch it unless you're twelve.Watch Ju-on, a genuine horror film with some sincere scares, not this sanitized butt wipe version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A PATHETIC RING WANNABE THAT BEGS A SATIRE","review":"THE GRUDGE was predictable and trite with the scariest thing about this movie being Sarah Michelle Geller's acting. The ghosts, as the movie progressed, took on an almost silly feel. I half expected a bathroom scene with one of them jumping out of the toilet!Add to all of the nonsense the fact that the viewer can never quite figure out what the ghost does to people. Does it suck out all of your air? Does it eat part of your face off and leave you a wandering zombie? Does it breathe on you after a lunch of really strong garlic bread and onion rings? Or does it just have a really big frog in its throat and is frantically begging for someone to perform the Heimlich maneuver?At least in THE RING the demon's doings were consistently evil. I can't wait for the satires and parodies on this one. The filmmakers should have a total heyday!THE HORSEMAN"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"this was a waste of time this movie sucked good thing i did'nt buy it i saw it on TV and this was boring corney movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused bad and boring","review":"If you havent seen the movie - DONTThis film was bad enough to be bad, but not bad enough to be funny. (except now whenever I burp... If youve seen the movie you know what Im talking about.)I probably should have seen the japanese version instead. One of my co-workers suggested that this film had good cinematography - so I gave it a chance. I cant say I was impressed. Too dark for the small screen - I think I enjoyed one shot in the entire film.the film was a mess. It wasnt scary it was random. theres no sense of build or suspense. Was the story non linear? Or did it have bad continuity? Perhaps I lost interest and it just seemed to jump around.There were some shots that seemed to reference carnival of souls - which was cool. But that cheesey low budget film from 50 years ago was a much more masterful horror movie than the grudge."},{"rating":"1","title":"They American-ized it!!!!!!!","review":"Yes, I'm aware that that is not a word.

Disturbingly BAD.I can't believe they brought the plot to the U.S. The original was great set in Japan. I don't think there would have been a better way to remake a Japanese film. But, dragging the curse here? That's just sad.If you enjoyed this film, I will never understand why. For me, it pretty much ruined everything that was great about the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD SEQUEL!","review":"SO WOW, THE GRUDGE GETS TO GO TO ALL OVER THE WORLD TO KILL PEOPLE,(WHO CARES)! PLUS IT HAD THE SAME SCENES FROM \\"PART ONE\\" LIKE THE INFAMOUS PART WHEN THE GRUDGE GOES UNDER THE COVER IN THE BED TO GET THE VICTIM! JUST SEEING THAT SAME SCENE TWICE BUT JUST IN ANOTHER MOVIE WAS AWFUL! NO BLOODY KILLING SCENES AT ALL, JUST PEOPLE GETTING PULLED INTO THE GROUND QUICKLY LIKE A LOONEY TOON RABBIT HOLE! I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DIRECTOR IS TRYING HIS HARDEST TO KEEP THE MOVIE ALIVE,BUT IT SHOULD OF JUST ENDED WITH PART ONE! PART ONE WAS GREAT,BUT THIS ONE IS A LITTLE ON THE CORNY SIDE!THE GRUDGE 2 AND THE RING 2 SHOULD OF NEVER BEN MADE! ONLY A 9YR OLD SHOULD BE SCARED BY THIS GARBAGE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Unlike other reviewers, I expect to be entertained when I see a movie. Whether I rent the movie or see it in the theater, I am paying my money to see the movie. I don't intend on wasting my money on a movie that I approach with low expectations.I rented The Grudge thinking that it was a good caliber horror movie. It stunk. The movie is poorly made and is not scary.Compared to another similar movie, The Ring, this movie is not even in the same ballpark. Don't waste your money or time with this let down of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow","review":"Yet another overrated movie. I fell asleep watching it, even after trying to watch it twice.Annoying actors, annoying noises (loud noises that are supposed to scare your average teens), and it had a stupid ending. Chinese-buffet-horror"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grudge","review":"I thought this was a great movie, but I give it a rating of 4. Some things that I really enjoyed about this movie is that it makes you jump and the people who are supposed to be scary, are scary unlike in some movies where they're supposed to be scary looking but they aren't. One thing I didn't like about it is that they cut off what's happening to show something from the past. It confuses you becasue at first you think it's still part of the part you were just watching. This movie is about a Chinese family. The father finds out that the wife likes someone other than him and then he kills her and drowns the son and his cat. From then on, anyone who walks in that house they lived in, is haunted and killed by the boy and wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I ran to see this movie seeing as how the first one was really good to me. After watching it i walk out like, what happened? I am confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me please? No where near as good as the first grudge. You can buy it but don't say i didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sludge","review":"This was the second worst film I saw in the theaters in 2004 (the worst was Van Helsing). The Grudge was VERY boring. The script was horrible as was the directing. It was poorly acted (and I'm sad to say that because I really do love SMG). Very few scary or even interesting moments. If someone else hadn't paid for my ticket I would have been VERY sad that I wasted my time and money with this thing. Barely worth a rental much less a purchase. These PG-13 \\"scary\\" movies and remakes are watering down the horror genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled again!","review":"I was fooled again into thinking that someone could make a scary movie in modern times. I saw this at the theater and as I had expected, but hoped against, I was so ticked off at the stupid ending that it ruined the entire movie, in retrospect. Just like \\"the ring\\" was pretty scary up until the end, this movie follows perfect suit. I dont recommend it unless you are into this sort of thing. And to think they are thinking about \\"Grudge Part 2\\". I wont be fooled again, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sequel to a japanese movie since The Ring","review":"The Grudge is a movie about a kid who is really dead but I think very lonely. The first time that you see the kid he looks so innocent, then towards the end he looks very, very deadly and I found that very clever and interesting. This DVD has got a behind the scenes featurette, looking upon the movie. This movie and DVD makes you jump in most scenes. What I don't like about it is that you know when something is going to happen just by listening to the music. It starts low, low, low, then LOUD and something happens. Other than that if you are a horror fan and like to jump out you're seat you will love this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad movie, just doesn't make sense","review":"This movie wasn't bad. I had scary moments. But overall it made no sense. It's like the girl from the Ring gets up, walks around, scares people, the end. No real reason for killing people, no method, no back story, hardly a front story really. It's over and you're thinking \\"Why did any of this happen?\\" Also it seems they ran out of money as the movie ends in the space of about 5 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"the grudge","review":"it was a very awsome movie. very scary after it was over i felt like i was going to throw up. when it was over it was 1:00 at night. if your a horror fan then this is the movie for you. i got it on christmas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely frightening","review":"This is an extremely entertaining movie for those that wish to be scared. Quite similar to The Ring but I have to admit that in overall Grunge is even better (I loved The Ring). The main difference between the two movies is that The Ring contains more plot while The Grudge concentrates on scaring the XXXX out of you. There are some very memorable scenes in this movie. Particularly unpleasant is a surveillance camera scene with a Japanese police officer seeing the ghost looking at him through the camera (reminds of the \\"girl going out of the TV screen in The Ring). Sarah M Geller is probably not \\"optimal\\" as the leading actress in this movie, although this may depend on the fact that I always associate her with the \\"less serious\\" Buffy series. Highly recommended to people with strong nerves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I sure miss the day's of old fashioned special effect's. This computer animated garbage has gotten way out of hand. Is there no more talent left in the movie industry? I'll take \\"Clash of The Titans\\" stop motion animation over CGI anyday. Was the little Asian boy supposed to scare me? He needed a good solid kick in the a**. This movie sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish There Had Been A \\"No Star\\" Rating","review":"Even if you can see it for free, this movie is a massive waste of time. Wooden acting, confusing \\"new\\" details that don't mesh with the original story, too many attempts for a quick scare."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was a joke","review":"Are you kidding the creators of this movie should of got a sticker that said im special because me and my cousin could of made this movie in the basment. if anything that was good about the movie was the very begining i wont give anything away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not compare to the original at all","review":"This is a remake of the Asian film Ju-on and sadly, does not live up to the original at all.I'm a horror buff of over 3 decades and to me, Ju-on was intense and genuinely scary. In fact, it is one of my all time favorites...With this in mind, I found the remake very disappointing. It seemed that everything that made the original so chilling was either changed or omitted. The parts that were changed were done so with special effects that were, I suppose, to give the film a more polished look. For me, this only served to make the film predictable. This, along with changes made in the storyline (to make it more mainstream?) took so much away from what could have been (in my opinion) one of the scariest films in years.The original, subtitled version is certainly in my top 10, if not top 5 scariest films.Ju-on (The Grudge)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha?","review":"This is supposedly the story of a curse that is born and keeps on being reborn, when someone dies in great rage and extreme sorrow. According to that, I'm the best candidate for the next \\"Grudge\\", simply because of the pain and sorrow induced from watching this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NEED NOT BE A SCARY MOVIE","review":"THIS MOVIE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING SCARY, IT KINDA JUST WAS A MOVIE...... THERE WHERE A FEW SLIGHTLY JUMPING SCEENS AND A FEW THAT MADE YOU GO HUH, BUT NOTHING THAT MADE ME HAVE ANTHING CLOSE TO NIGHTMARES OR SLEEP WITH THE LIGHTS ON. IT REALLY COULD HAVE BEEN AN ACTION/MYSTERY MOVIE WITH A PREDICTABLE ENDING THAT DOES NOT LEAVE YOU WANTING MORE. WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT ON CABLE/DISH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of time and money","review":"You would think that a movie coming across the Pacific would be a good thing. I mean, c'mon, they've given us this such as manga, DDR, karate, etc. etc. You would think that they would master in horror as well. Let me tell you this movie was nothing but predictable. All I ever did was laugh at how stupid it was. This movie was truthfully worse than Cursed, and that movie was a jokefest. Sarah Michelle Gellar - horrible acting on her part in this movie. I loved her in Buffy, but here, she was not to much to praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"I imagine that this is the movie equivalent of a urinary tract infection.","review":"I think I would have had more fun if I had been slamming my head against the wall for 2 hours. I watched it on HBO, so I didn't pay money, thank god.It's a dumb cliché horror movie with the old haunted house thing going. The interesting thing is that it alternates between dumb pseudo-expository scenes that reveal trivially small amounts of information, but the backstory is so obvious, aside from a few TINY details, that it HURT MY BRAIN.Not to mention I like movies with resolutions. I will refrain from posting a spoiler, but if you want horror films to have a little bit more than just a few startling moments and then bad acting and obnoxious CGI ghost things and a complete lack of a resolution, which is one of the most important parts of any story, than I guess this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe The Hype","review":"I had great expectations for this film but was sorely disappointed. The story jumps time periods frantically that you never really get attached to the plot. The story is also a bit vague. The actors are poorly cast (sorry SMG) with Grace Zabriskie giving the only inspiring performance (as per usual) as a bed ridden invalid...and that ain't saying much. What was up with the frog noises? How did all these Americans end up in Japan and find such bad luck? The film requires an extreme suspension of disbelief that just leaves the viewer bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't it scare me this time!!!???","review":"The curse of failing to succeed with a sequel is what happened to The Grudge 2 juse like The Ring 2. The film is not scary anymore because they are so predictable and the scary stuff is so much like the first film. So when the story is not as interesting as the first, it just won't work. It was still worthed for me because I was interested in seeing Jennifer Beals and Hong Kong's Edison Chen. They both tried their best to turned in a good performance for roles that are so mediocre. I really liked the first Grudge and was very scared by it, but this sequel just didn't have the same impact as a horror film. The scary images just got a bit annoying somehow. How many times can you find screaming ghost boy and crooked ghost crawling to be a scary thing to watch?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Director's Cut is GREAT!","review":"I caught the theatrical release of this film on HBO and loved it! Definitely a must-see for any fan of Asian-style horror, creepy atmospherics, and nightmare imagery.What really surprised me, though, was how much BETTER the Director's Cut is. The ending in this version is absolutely terrifying and macabre, much more so than the PG-13 release, and easily on par with the chilling climax of \\"The Ring\\". (It's not surprising they had to tone it down for the MPAA.) If you saw this in the theater and liked it, you have to check out this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense, Horror","review":"This is not your usual Horror film, filled with blood and violence. This takes me back to the time where you sat in a dark theater. When you and your date would jump at the same time. And you would see some people covering their eyes, so as not to jump the next time.Yes this movie is a supernatural tale. And it is scary. There is more then one part that will make you jump. And that is what I like about this movie. It can scare you without all the unnecessary violence and blood. The level of expectation is kept up throughout the whole movie. It kept my suspense level almost peaked the entire movie.The story is well written. It gives you time to think. And the horror seems to never end. Just keeps coming and coming...it will keep you on the edge of your seat.I would recommend watching this in a dark room with friends. Those who scream and jump will just add to the suspense for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meow..","review":"This movie is like the ring to me. Both were unninteresting and not scary. Besides the shining and certain exceptions, I usually don't get scared during unrealistic horror movies. This one isn't scary, and tries to scare you by randomly showing someone's eye on the screen. That's not what I call scary. The plot centers around a haunted house in Japan, and everyone that enters this house shall die. This is due to some curse and of course when Sarah Michelle Gellar goes inside it, she's got to find a way to save herself. And of course, her boyfriend wants to die too so he goes in also. Just like the boyfriend in the ring. The movie isn't particullarily scart, and if you dissliked the ring like me, you won't like this. But if you liked it, you'll love it. Oh, and by the way, the little boy that makes cat noises (Meowwwww) isn't scary! That's got to be the stupidest thing ever! I found myself laughing every time he'd Meow. Well, anyway, that's all I've got to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST HORROR MOVIE!","review":"OMG it has an unrated version! and i cant wait to buy it on dvd! it has more scary parts that wasnt shown in the movies! and it has an olternate ending and cast intervews! like sarah michelle gellar! who im in love with. :)*Buffy*"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE DISSAPOINTING AND STUPID","review":"Wow, what a total let down! The fact people think this film is scary is rediculous. The special effects were a direct rip-off of \\"The ring.\\" The story? Was there one? Not in my opinion..Just a bunch of flashy imaging. The entire film was a boring, stupid, mess. I guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror film I have seen in years. And that Buffy chick? Well, she's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented..No, wait, that would be an insult to BARBIE!

The Grudge fails not because of the narrative structure, but because we never settle on whose story this is. It is distributed too thinly among too many characters. Despite the fact that Gellar gets top billing, it doesn't seem to be any more her story than any of the other characters.Still, there are some effective images (and sounds!)--they would be very much more effective, though, if the writer had allowed us to develop a connection with the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scary at all and almost boring","review":"okay I saw this movie after have heard good critics about it.But,well after have seen it, I wonder how you can love it or be frightened by it.It is slow,the story is a classic in horror type movie, and actors don't really elevate the level.I used to have a weakness for horror movie but I'm not crazy about it, and to be honest this one sucks...It's not gore at all and you can presume that the realisator atempted to build a frightening atmosphere but it doesn't work on me : pointless story and the end is stupid( can't find another word...)I rate it 2 stars because I don't like to give just 1.trust me you can skip this \\"kind of\\" horror movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Comedy...","review":"I give it 2 stars just because it had me and my friends cracking up when we went to see it, but as a horror film (the genre it was intended) it is an absolutely terrible waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie indeed did have suck and such","review":"I liked how it took place in Japan, Chickensaurus.

SCARY. and then I lost it; didn't know what was going on. No more Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It seemed. What the are you doing here. Over here. Bill Pullman, the President and Lone Star -- I think his career is going down the crapper if this role is any indication. But that is about it. Quite Frankly with Steven A.

This film has the same cheesy lighting and imagery that 'the Ring' did. The main terror in this film is bottom line, a naked asian boy who meows. That scares me, but not in a horror way.

The previews seemed awesome and I totally looked foward seeing it. After the first half hour I was bored. It was an extremely dull movie with a simple, simple story line thrown in with special affects and loud music. One thing I hated with the movie was that it jumped around showing the different affects that the grudge affected all of the characters. I'm sure that the japenese movie is highly more eventful then dull 1 hour and 45 minutes was. It was truly a waste of $7.00 (canadian)."},{"rating":"1","title":"frighteningly bad","review":"I did like the first Grudge. Granted, it was a tad confusing at first, but once I figured out what was happening,I liked it.However, The Grudge 2 is just awful. It comes across as having been made for no other reason than to makea sequel. The underlying premise is weak, and from there it just goes downhill.The characters are lame, the story is lame, and the acting is lame. And the non-linear story telling approachonly adds confusion. The story comes across as somewhat unfocused and tends to jump around. Too manydifferrent characters and sub-plots going on also. It didn't come across as a \\"complex\\" story, just muddledand lacking direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie is a Clunker. Please Don't Hold a Grudge","review":"Supposedly the story of an American nurse living in a haunted house in Tokyo where she is exposed to a mysterious curse that locks a person in a powerful rage before claiming their life and spreading to another victim. Well, that story line is so hard to follow in this nonesensical jump-out-of-the-dark scare 'em up that I don't even know myself why I started the review that way.Let me start again: This is a movie that has Buffy the Vampire Slayer and a lot of scary images that literally pop out at the viewers with a loud, bassy BONG. The story line is hard to follow, and after watching I had to read the back of the DVD case to see what this flick was supposed to be about.There...that's a better start to the review. And a good way to end it. Don't buy this; rent it if you must (or catch it on cable), but don't say I didn't warn you.

The US remake is, I believe the Japanese word is \\"gomi\\". Please excuse if that isn't spelled correctly. It means junk.

It took most of the movie to even find out there was a curse put on the house.Now, my sister-in-law thought it was very scary, so go figure.Personally I was bored and frustrated with this moive and was glad when it was over, but you decide.

I figured if I like it I would invest in a more expensive model. In hindsight I should have just saved my money and buy a better model. Buyer beware!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Software doesn't work for XP","review":"I think the people that are giving this product 5 stars must work for Bushnell of the software company. It absolutely doesn't work. Don't buy this if you're doing so for it's digital camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage for photos","review":"Complete crap. The installation as mentioned in many other reviews was next to impossible. I bought my mother this before she went on a trip to Alaska, thinking she could bring some nice close up shots to complement her other digital camera shots. But that was not the case, after spending hours trying to get it installed on XP the files were not even the right format. The picture quality was horrible. This product is a joke, I wish I could get my money back, the only good thing about it is that the binoculars work. Better off just buying a pair of those, skip this product and save yourself a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! What a loser!","review":"Either I got a defective camera/binocular or they're all horrible. Several of us tried using it to get a picture with any decent (even for email) resolution and were embarrassed by the horrible results. It's a nice little binocular but a horrid camera. Hopefully others fared better than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"No updated drivers","review":"The binoculars worked fine, but I have no idea how the cameral worked. We have 3 computers (laptops) with 3 different operating systems - windows 2000, vista & windows 7. The drivers provided on the CD would not work with any of these. I called Bushnell & was told that there were no available updates. So unless you have a very old computer, I wouldn't buy this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dislike!","review":"This product was out of date....camera did not work. Contacted the Bushnell company to speak with customer service and they said that this was a discontinued Binocular because of a defect in the camera. Seller DID return my money. Am VERY SATISFIED WITH SELLER AS FAR AS RETURNING MONEY but the PRODUCT itself DOES NOT need to still be available to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Got this as a present. Right off, the drivers would not install, the link to get updated drivers did not work. I emailed them requesting support, never heard from them. I am able to take \\"pictures\\", but they are distorted and of poor quality. If you can't do anything with them, what is the point. Same your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it a bird or a leaf.","review":"I love this idea. Take a picture of what you see thru a binocular. However, this camera has it's limits. Not only could I not review the pix (til I got to my PC), the image was NOT what I saw. The yellow bird in the tree, became the tree with a yellow leaf, maybe.The binocular is Great: small, powerful, easy to focus. The tech support thru Bushnell was terrific. Making the PC recognize the camera took one phone call. The op manual needs HELP, or maybe I'm too much of an novice in this field."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Was hoping to use this item to get some good shots of birds. Unfortunately, after trying 100 shots (and download to the PC) was not able to get a single decent clear picture. Too low a resolution... too fuzzy... Not sure if this is because I couldn't keep that little unit still or whether the default highest resolution just isn't enough. We already have a 3x digital camera and several decent pairs of binoculars, so will try to return this unit since it just doesn't work as a camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not appropriate for hunting","review":"The product seemed to be good quality. I bought one to use while hunting, to take a quick picture of that trophy buck that walks by during bear season for example. Only one thing wasn't appropriate: It beeps every time you turn it on, off, change functions, or take a picture. And there's no way to switch off the sound. So that makes it a bad choice for hunting, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned product - regretfully","review":"My wife purchased at Best Buys and gave the binoculars to me as a fathers day gift. I loved the concept and as an avid hiker and birder was anxious to use them. All pictures came out fuzzy and trees were a grayish green with all other colors a sickly sepia toned. I tried various ways of holding the camera to reduce the fuzziness and by holding it at chest level (box camera fashion) seemed to help - but obviously couldn't focus on the subject. After trying it for 3 days I decided to return it to Best Buys. They would not refund but did provide store credit. If Bushnell can fix the camera I will definitely buy the next generation model."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor assembly","review":"Had to return the rack. A cross piece was improperly placed preventing the unit from opening completely--The product had potential: good wood, good idea. I could have repositioned the cross piece-- I see it now in the photo of this review-- it's just to the right of the blue mug handle, but why bother when my wife coincidently brought a similar item back from Sweden with nicer brass brads.. (My purchase was meant to surprise her..) So we were both surprised.Bravo to Amazon which continues to be such a convenience: returning the rack was for free (which I was unaware of until I started the process).

Very good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution for spouses wanting to read this book","review":"I saw that there were 5 - 5 star reviews of this book and they all seemed to say similar things - it's written from the experience of someone who was married to a sex addict and gives great information for those who might suspect they are etc. I know I'm married to a sex addict but this book was very difficult for me to read and not helpful at all. I was hoping to get some great advice and hope. This book made me think things might be going on that probably aren't and just made me depressed more than I already am. Maybe from the standpoint of someone who specializes in therapy for those recovering from being married to a sex addict the book is helpful but it was way too depressing with way too many details for me (her husband was actually quite cruel in my opinion). Just a warning to someone suffering the affects of being married to a sex addict and is looking for some therapy and hope in a book - I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back In Time!","review":"I've been a fan of progressive rock ever since the early days of FM. Listening to this CD brought me back to the first time I listened to King Crimson's first LP as a teen. The Flower Kings have simply taken this type of music to the next level. I've been reading about the death of prog-rock for some time but after listening to this CD I know a lot of people still enjoy it. So if you love King Crimson, Camel, Gentle Giant and/or Kansas just listen to this and add it to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make Way for Westlife","review":"If you want a boyband with truly beautiful voices and gorgeous ballads than you want to own Westlife. Vocally they are the best boyband out there. The album consists mainly of romantic ballads, and fun midtempo ditties. Highlights include the undeniably beautiful \\"Swear it Again\\"\\"Fling Without Wings\\",\\"My Private Movie\\", and \\"No No\\". All songs are perfectly sung and the harmonies are stunning. Even the cover of Extreme's \\"MOre Than Words\\" is a winner.

The vocals are great and that creates all the songs to take off. With this cd Westlife proves you do not have to have the dance/bubblegum style that all the american boy groups (except 98 degrees)have. I would just like to congraduate this group on a great job and keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yo, get this album NOW!","review":"I've been a Westlife fan since NOVEMBER, when I first saw them on an MTV special called \\"TOTAL GLOBAL REQUEST\\" (by the way I'm from the U.S.) So after I saw a clip of \\"Flying Without Wings\\" I begged my parents to get me the album! So for Christmas I got the UK version of the album and let me tell you (yeah you! ) the album is awesome! My favorite song is \\"Miss You\\" and \\"What I Want Is What I've Got\\" which isn't in the US album. I prefer the UK or ASIAN album because there is 17 songs in it. I also got the US album to because of the new song \\"MY PRIVATE MOVIE\\" which is also an awesome song! I've listen to my Westlife albums everyday since I got them (AND I'M SERIOUS). I'm not sick of any of the songs yet! So that means the albums rock! GO GET THE US/UK/ASIAN ALBUM NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Westlife deliver soothing tunes","review":"i live in asia so i have the asian version of the album. all i have to say is the songs on the album are very well written.

When Westlife first came out with their first single \\"Swear It Again\\" in Manila, i liked it but just really loved the album after hearing their fourth \\"Seasons in the Sun\\" which sadly is not included in their US Release. So my advise would be to get the Asian or UK version which has all the 17 songs and a different cover, the one with a blue background and 5 heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, It's just another boys-band.","review":"Well, over all the music is good and very pleasant to listen to. There are some good tracks such as Fool Again, Flying Without Wings, and If I Let You go. they also did a good number on the cover tunes such as Seasons in the Sun..

I really liked their sound so I did some research on them and read some of the lyrics to several of their other songs. I decided to purchase the album, and when I listened to it, I knew I had gotten my money's worth! Although many of the songs have similar sounds, there is something different and enjoyable in each one.

YAWN! Yes, they have had lots of number ones, but they get praised for everything, and everything they do seems to turn to gold and they are very big headed.

All of the songs are great especially, \\"Flying Without Wings\\" and \\"Fool Again\\" and also another great song \\"More than Words\\". Any great addition to someone's collection. If you like songs that make you feel mushy and lovey or just want to pretend that five hot british guys are singing to you, buy the cd. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the European Version","review":"The American version is missing some of the great tracks. When I was in Manila earlier this year I saw their video \\"Season in the Sun\\" and got really interested and decided to purchased the album.

Mariah Carey loves them, and all i can say is that girls got taste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One long power ballad to me","review":"While Westlife has some good voices, I just don't like this album as much. It felt like one endless power ballad to me. Nearly all the songs copy the same cliches found in every late-80s heavy metal band power ballad by Bon Jovi, Winger, Poison or some others. Seemed like orchestral arrangements on most of the stuff Most of the ballads were surprisingly bland. There's one or two uptempos, but that's about it. At least Ruben Studdard remade one of their songs, Flying Without Wings, and made it sound better than them. They're not as exciting as Backstreet, not as chance taking as NSYNC. More than Words and Swear It Again were quite good, but they're the only 2 good songs on an otherwise flat-sounding album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I own both the US version of the CD and the UK version I wish that they would have kept the same songs cos they cut 4! The album is great! The songs are more laid back (they are like ballads). My favorite song has to be \\"If I Let You Go\\"...it's the best and the song is so true! Also \\"You can't Lose What you never had\\" is good! What the heck they are all good! They have had 4 number one singles in the UK! I hope the lads make it to the States soon to do some touring cos I can hardly wait to see Bryan in person!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad to see Westlife here in America!","review":"I have had the imported release of this CD since January, and I absolutely love it. However, there are 17 songs on it, and I don't understand why there are only 13 on the American release. That's a bit unfair, because people buying this release will miss out on 4 great songs. But don't let that stop you from buying this album, it is still fantastic, and places Westlife in the upper echelon of guy groups. With so many wonderful songs, it is difficult to pick a standout, but I would have to say that it is the beautifully done ballad \\"Flying Without Wings.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD! Gonna Be As HUGE As Backstreet Boys!","review":"Westlife is a great group. These guys have talent and a lot of charisma. The songs on their cd \\"Can't Lose What You Never Had\\", \\"More Than Words\\", and \\"Flying Without Wings\\" are the BEST songs on their cd.

The book is, of course, slanted a bit to favor her office, particularly in its canonization of D.A.

Because of the poor reliability ratings I have babied it all its life by storing it in a remote cupboard in a Crown Royal bag.

I had only seen the ones you have to pull the roast out of the oven, stick in, wait for it to get to the temp as the roast loses it's heat, then put back in the oven. I thought that was the only way. Then she brought me this. Right away I said no thank you because I didn't like that you can only select the meat you have and it determines the temp. After I read the package more carefully, I saw that each meat has extra settings of rare, medium, well done which then adjusts the target temperature. I still wished that I could manually set in my own temperature but I don't have to wait for the alarm to beep. I'll watch the temp climb until I'm ready and then remove it. I made chicken today and it worked great. I love having it on the counter and it's magnetic so it sticks to the stove or fridge as long as I wont trip on the wire lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"Had my polder thermometer lasted longer than 6 months, I would have given it a 4 or 5 star rating.Having a probe with a cord is a great idea. It is very convenient for monitoring temperatures in ovens or smokers if you don't want to raise the lid. Combined with the temperature alert feature (you can set a temperature to set of the alarm), the polder is very handy. Unfortunately, having gone through two probes, it appears that they are too delicate for this kind of use. It is very easy to damage the cord and then you will get wildly off readings.My other criticism of the polder is the time that it takes to react to temperature changes and the length of time it takes to get an accurate reading. My Taylor instant read obtains a reading in a few seconds. The polder often takes much longer (15-20 seconds), which can be an issue when checking steaks on a very hot grill.In summary, don't buy this device unless you want to buying replacement probes frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"polder thermometer","review":"I bought this product around christmas last year.

First, the pre-programmed temperatures in the thermometer are way too high - probably government recommended temps... Anyway, the first time I used the thermometer was on a prime rib - the calibration was definitely off by alot - I set it at 110 degrees to be on the safe side and the entire prime rib was medium well done when the thermometer beeped. Then, the second time I went to use this thermometer, the entire LCD Screen was messed up and unable to be read. Pretty Much a waste of money for this item.

This condition begins before inserting the probe into the food or oven. It never registers the internal temperature of the food.I would have reported to Polder, but I don't know how to contact them. I note the precise similarity of the Polder & Taylor thermometers appearances & Taylor's reported defect in another review on your site. Are they the same manufacturer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"When it works it's great, but...","review":"But alas it worked for too short of a time! I will join the chorus of customers who liked the concept of the thermometer but were frustrated and disappointed in its longevity.

After having enjoyed many of these I had high expectations of 'A Game for the Living'. Sadly, I was disappointed.Unlike Highsmith's successful formula of writing tense thrillers about accused murders undergoing extreme apprehension about being caught, 'A Game for the Living' is a simple whodunnit-type murder mystery. It involves the murder of a \\"loose\\" young Mexican woman, and the friendship of her two lovers as they try to locate the killer. I found the story to be banal, with no suspense build up. It is hard to imagine this book was written by Highsmith.Bottom line: skip this book, buy one of Highsmith's (much) better works such as 'The Blunderer', 'Strangers on a Train', and 'This Sweet Sickness' (..to name a few)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fusion software is horrible.

Everything I ever read on alcoholism was AA oriented, and I thought the only way to quit was to spend the rest of my life in smoky church basements telling my problems to strangers. This book was the voice I'd been looking for, that let me know that there were other ways to think about alcoholism. I don't mean to knock AA because it has helped so many people.

Buy the Rational Recovery book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still too big","review":"Trimpey spends too many pages talking about how bad AA is. His AVRT method replaces AA's Higher Power with \\"the Beast\\", a demonized personification of \\"the addictive voice\\", which is hardly a new idea, and should be familiar to anyone who has been to church or AA meetings. He does provide some good advise on how to stop drinking and some sound cognitive principles for disputing the irrational thinking that leads to drinking, although it seems that he has since rejected the \\"rational\\" parts of his own book, which does not leave much. What is good in this book gets lost in the virulence of his attacks on AA. Many of his arguments against AA have merit, but he could have left out several chapters and let people make their own judgements about AA. Those needing help don't need to \\"take sides\\", they just need help.

The focus is on Whodunit and not the detective's dysfunctional life or menangerie. The descriptions of a World War II military hospital are detailed and even shocking to modern notions of good medical practice. We've come a long way. The characterization is thin but believable. Unfortunately, the rest of her mystery novels seem to be out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book from Margaret Thornton and Amazon","review":"Margaret Thornton is an English author who sets her books during WWII and the years just after. I was in my early teens during the war, this is a period I remember well and always enjoy books from that time, not stories from the battlefront, but from the homefront. Very few are by Margaret Thornton found in the US, in the libraries or bookstores I was so pleased that I could order them from Amazon, without paying huge sums for the shipping from England.\\"Wednesday's Child\\", Lorna, is born on Ash Wednesday, 1953. Her mother is afraid that the old saying, 'Wednesday's Child is full of woe' will come true for her, and it seems to. Much of the woe is of Lorna's own making. Her mother is deserted by her father, Derek, after a bad marriage. After bringing up Lorna alone, she remarries and Lorna resents the step-father and step-brother. Lorna makes many wrong decisions, but finally finds life if not all Woe.A good story of a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Best one yet.

Naked women adorned only with the random animal bone all laughing and looking off toward some distant place. It evokes a forgotten and ancient time when sexuality and spirtuality were not seperated but celebrated together. This group of New England women developed a true love and admiration for African tribal drumming and song and it comes through on this disc in great form. The drumming is both insistant and inviting calling the listener in to experience the swirling currents of sensuality mixed with mystical aspiration and longing. To this Inanna also ads a dose of fun and playfulness lest we take all this way too seriously and it become some kind of evangelical call for paganism. They are not calling for conversion but they do want you to experience the same thing that they did years ago----the infectious, emotional, physical, and otherworldly power of tribal music."},{"rating":"2","title":"My drummer wife","review":"Arrived early and intact.

Throws veggies & fruit back at you thru the intake slot (duck fast) and flings pulp all over the walls & ceiling (good exercise cleaning up). Seriously, my kids & I had a real giggle trying it out. But what I really, really didn't like is probably true of all juicers - 98% of the input came out the \\"pulp\\" slot and 2% came out the juice slot. The juice was tasty, but most of the food I paid for was wasted. So I think I need some other kind of appliance.Otherwise, this seems to be a fine product, for what it does, if that's really what you want to do, which is why I gave it 4 stars even tho I will try to sell the one I bought on eBay."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST want I wanted!

The plot plods, the characters are wooden stereotypes the philosophical discussion is asinine (and endless) the action scenes are dull and the dialog sounds like something from a schoolboy comic from the 50'sCharacters act, react and speak in a fashion divorced from ant kind of reality, but this is not in any way interesting, just more bad writing.

Unlike other authors in this genre, Baum does not portray the nation's leaders as purposely perpetrating evil on its citizens, knowingly perpetuating the War for their own benefit. Rather, he shows that underneath the utter failure of our drug control policy lies errors in judgement and poor political choices--foremost among them the choice to view drug addiction as a moral evil rather than a neuropsychiatric disease. Furthermore, Baum's scholarly, analytical tone prevents this book from seeming like most others: a bitter, indignant plea for marijuana legalization. An excellent excellent history and summary."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book thoroughly exposes the hysteria of the drug war","review":"This is one of the best books written on a subject that too many Americans are not adequately aware of. I just finished it over Christmas and I couldn't put it down. This is a book about hysteria and social manipulation. About greed, extraordinary deceit, and lust for power and control. The Drug War is of the same evil thatbrought the world the Nazis and other murderous, intolerant regimes. The same propaganda techniques are utilized. \\"There must be one public opinion for all.\\" said Hitler's propaganda chief,Dr. Joseph Goebbels. Indeed. For those who feel that honest discussion and debate is missing on exactly what the drug war is accomplishing and where it's heading---this book will provide a lot of answers. It is extremely hard hitting and right on the mark. An excellent piece of work that will upset and amaze you, illuminate you and hopefully move you to demand a more sane, rational, and honest policy on drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real truth about the phony war on drugs","review":"An excellent overview of the mentality that put millions of poor souls in prison to make them hardened criminals.I trust this information will help to end the misguided war on drugs so we can focus on healing the damage that has been done.

I loved it.... it was unbiased and covered all the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argument by Anecdote","review":"This book will not change one person's mind. Sticking to anecdotes, eschewing statistics and analysis, Baum strives to create an atmosphere of sinister conspiracy. But the simple fact that political spinmasters were involved in creating and selling the drug prohibition policy does not hopelessly discredit it. After all, politicians had to sell the Civil Rights Act, the New Deal, involvement in WWII, emancipation of the slaves, and everything else the government's ever done.Like most people who'd be motivated to seek out a book on the War on Drugs, I am sympathetic to Baum's general idea-- the War on Drugs goes too far, and a little treatment would sure go nice with, or maybe even in place of, locking up tons of people, many of whom are black. But to those of you looking for a balanced, informative overview of the history of the drug war, keep moving. This ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several Seconds Wasted","review":"So I ordered this cd without having heard anything else by The Plain White T's other than 'Hey There Delilah', and to be honest with you, I wish I'd just bought that track on iTunes and saved myself a few quid (not to mention the time spent listening).What you get here is nothing like the smash hit single 'Delilah'. No, all 'Every Second Counts' offers is kind of what you'd expect if you mixed 'Jimmy Eat World' with 'Fall Out Boy', and then made it even whinier! I'd just like to point out that I love Jimmy Eat World and have a fondness for Fall Out Boy on occasion, so for me to dislike this cd, is a surprise. I just can't get past the ridiculous lyrics (e.g. hate is a strong word, but I really really really don't like you) and extreme whining.Gah! Just put the cd in and program it to repeat 'Hey There Delilah', which incidentally is a bonus track - hmmm"},{"rating":"2","title":"Originally written before \\"Hey Delilah\\" went big...","review":"For their major label debut, the Plain White T's deliver an album loaded with catchy hooks, relatable lyrics, and smooth rock melodies.

I enjoyed the pacing of The Deep Blue Good-by. It starts out thoughtful, McGee studies his clients, and we get details on the brutality of a Mr. A.A. Allen [Junior]. We learn a bit on who McGee is and why he lives out on a boat taking in some early chunks of early retirement.About halfway in I knew McGee and Junior were on a collision course but, before I realized it, MacDonald had hit the gas, and from there out it was just a sprint to the end. Before it all started going to hell, with me furiously flipping pages to keep up - there was a little time to enjoy some of the Florida setting. The best Florida writers have a way of putting me back down there. MacDonald's description of a sudden afternoon rain storm did just that.

John and his wife were close friends with my in-law's, and when I lived in Sarasota Florida I had dinner with John and his wife regularly. An extremely interesting man. So you see I am prejudiced. But none the less the writing has been an example for the rest who have continued and expanded on the form. And his character Travis McGee came along at the right time to capture a generation. I for one am glad to see this series come back in print and be available thru the new technology, because my old paperbacks are begining to become very hard to read. And I also noted the new introduction by Lee Childs, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"great american writer","review":"Got started with the Travis McGee series 20 years ago. Didn't read them in order, but suggest others do. My favorite is The Green Ripper, and thought the only one a little lacking was Freefall in Crimson. But just want to say, when you finish all the McGees, go immediately to his other novels and short stories. Some are clunkers-- Man of Affairs, Border Island-- but some are unbelievably great novels of the crime/\\"pulp fiction\\" genre. The Empty Trap; April Evil; On the Run; The Girl, the Gold Watch and Everything; Linda (found in Border Town Girl), and on and on and on. Also short stories-- Good Old Stuff, More Good Old Stuff (Seven not as good) and the sci-fi-- yes, that's right-- sci-fi stories from very early in his career are in a collection, too.

Every single song is phenomenal. It contains some of the best songs WP has done in the studio and the sound quality is amazing. With songs like Hatfield, Henry Parsons Died and Diner we're given an example of WP's songwriting and story telling prowess. They display their amazing percussion abilities on Pickin' Up the Pieces. They're one of the few bands that have been able to successfully blend Country, Southern Rock, and even Jazz. They're able to package it into, what I consider to be, the best example of the Jam band potential. Widespread is definitely a Jam band. However, Everyday elevates them to the same level as many of the bands that influenced them (i.e. The Doors, J.J.

I did so because Elaine Showalter's on-line notice made me think that, perhaps, interestingly, beneath Mrs. Cheney's political stances lurked a more liberal, variously sympathetic soul. I do not think such is the case. The lesbianism in the story, while positively presented, is forced by circustances so contrived and characters so one dimensional that they undercut any sympathy the author might intend. The presentation of the West is risible.Heterosexual relations in _Sisters_ emanate from shallow cruelty and shallow desire. This combination may be a starting point for analyzing Mrs. Cheney; however, the lack of depth means one can go only so far. For me it is not worth the effort. I had hoped to find a more various and complex second lady, or possibly to be entertained by a skein of unconscious and/or hilarious revelations--but all I felt was boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"YES!

Her story is a powerful metaphor for the battle between the syncretistic/animist urges basic to man's animal nature (as represented by a ragged but tenacious feral dog), and the purifying revelation of an angry and vengeful Christian God. Never before has a political satire used the mysteries of female sexuality to such elaborate ends, and the mixture of slap-stick and black humor that forms the Sapphic sub-plot's unforeseen climax is a potent one the philosophical underpinnings of which unexpectedly fly in the face of traditional Republican values. Sadly the sloppy, \\"deconstructionist\\"-inspired style makes much of this nearly impossible to extract, and it is only the roughest outline that emerges through the first several readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, Real Conservatives Believe in Lesbian Love?","review":"Love it!

I also agree that the side display is difficult to handle because the only flat surface to hold it contains the display.

By that time the heat is out of the grill and your hands are getting burned from the grill. I would strongly recommend avoiding this product.

After that album he left the band to pursue a solo career. He took about a year and a half off and released his self-titled debut in 1977. The album is definitely scaled down compared to Lamb, but of no less quality. The album's signature track is the elegant \\"Solsbury Hill\\" which has an understated string section that lifts the song along with a beautiful guitar melody. Orchestral sounds permeate the album especially on the powerful \\"Down The Dolce Vita\\". The album's closer \\"Here Comes The Flood\\" is a great track and sets the tone for subsequent work by Mr. Gabriel. A stirring and strong debut from a complex and intriguing artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclecticism that reveals a promise","review":"At (then) 27, Peter Gabriel has shown with this record that he needed to leave Genesis in order to express completely his own creativity (a warning that was shown in Genesis' \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway). As a consequence, we have this eclectic album, which shows Gabriel triying to look for a style to be comfortable with. From the Genesis-like \\"Moribund The Burgermeister\\", to the psychedelic beauty of \\"Here Comes The Flood\\", passing through the Paul-McCartney-like \\"Solsbury Hill\\", the 'Bolero' of \\"Humdrum\\" or the bluesy \\"Waiting for the Big One\\", this great album shows the develop of one of the most creative songwriters of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Direction and a step back","review":"This is in many ways a new direction without the influence of the creative ability of the other four members of Genesis.

This album though may well be Gabriel's best, it is at least my favourite, not that Gabriel did noy have other high moments but he would never achieve , nor the rest of Genesis what was accomplished with the Lamb. However Slowburn, Solisbury Hill, Moribund and Here Comes The Flood are all excellent examples of Gabriel's talent. More than anything else Gabriel went back to the realms of Selling England By The Pound if one was to compare the overall theme off the album. All in all a very good album but in someways a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Names Added Recently","review":"This review is not so much about the music, which is exceptional for all three of Peter Gabriel's first three solo albums, but about the titles added later, presumably without Gabriel's permission. \\"Car\\" \\"Melt\\" or \\"Scratch\\" did not appear on the original LPs. This is obviously a marketing ploy, as if the albums needed it. Call me a traditionalist, but that's the first thing I noticed about these three \\"remastered\\" re-releases. Those albums didn't have Roman numerals attached to them, either. They were all titled very simply \\"Peter Gabriel.\\" And that's the way they should remain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Solo Debut","review":"Few artists have stretched the boundries of recorded media with such integrity as Peter Gabriel. Bob Ezrin lends his distinctive touch to this Floyd-like production. Gabriel successfully delves into styles ranging from barbershop quartet (Excuse Me) to the nearly anthem-esque (Here Comes the Flood). If you haven't heard this, folks, you owe it to yourselves to pick up a copy. It has to be among the greatest solo efforts ever recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Known Fact: Part of a trilogy","review":"I don't have much to add to the excellent reviews posted here. However, one thing I have not seen mentioned is that this album was conceived as part of a trilogy of albums by two other artists, all intended to be simultaneously released. Unfortunately, the other two albums were released in such a time-delayed fashion that most people would never know they were meant as a trilogy. The other two albums in the trilogy are \\"Exposure\\" by Robert Fripp (released in 1979) and \\"Sacred Songs\\" by Daryl Hall (released in 1980). If you get this one and want to complete the trilogy, you should pick those two up as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven but strong debut from P.G.","review":"Peter Gabriel's solo debut is probably best known for the fantastic single \\"Solisbury Hill,\\" which is an allegory to his split with the band Genesis. Other first rate songs on the album include the rockin' \\"Modern Love\\" the original version of \\"Here Comes the Flood,\\" and \\"Humdrum.\\" The rest of the material is spottier, particularly the awful \\"Moribund the Burgermeister.\\" Overall, it is a strong album for Gabriel fans and fans of art rock in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I am here listening to it with my son","review":"Back in the 70s, my friends and I were still gauging the transition after Gabriel left Genesis.. The Lamb gave us the ultimate surreal rock opera, imposible to break down, either you get the whole story or mutilate it... Gabriel was the man of a thousand voices and he proved it.. then, there came this first solo album.. back then I thought he was going to put more prog into it.. it was difficult to digest.. its a collage remainding us that Gabriel is a voice..Now after almost 30 years later, Im listening to it with my son who likes the modern Gabriel, to me its a priceless experience, the album is timeless"},{"rating":"2","title":"B.O.A.T (Best of All Time)","review":"I was a big Genesis/Peter Gabriel fan growing up. I've seen them a dozen times in concert. In my humble opinion, tracks 6-9 on this CD are still the best \\"album side\\" ever put together. I could listen to it over and over, it's so moving. The front side is not as strong, but still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good cd","review":"This is a very good cd. Starts out with moribound burgmeister, kind of orchestral in parts, then goes into a slow down and then picks up again. Solsbury Hill is my favorite Gabriel song great opening with 12 string guitar and excellent story line. Here Comes the flood is better on here than 16 golden greats..a little longer version. Dolce da vita is kind of hard rock with backing band in it. Modern love is a straight ahead rock song."},{"rating":"1","title":"AFter the Crash, What Next","review":"This book is typical of Berst..bombastic and a rehash of what everyone else was saying before.

First -- everything seemed to be called an \\"objective\\". It seemed like there were \\"objectives\\" within \\"objectives\\". The book would be more clear if this was changed to be more meaningful and understandable, Also -- WAY TOO MANY forms and worksheets for the practical person to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good preparatory information for building your 100-Day Action Plan","review":"One of three books I purchased in order to prepare my first ever 100-Day Action Plan. The information was well organized, clearly articulating eight major components of an action plan. Especially useful was the detailed information regarding strategy, vision, communication planning, and crisis management, to name a few. The only thing missing? A couple of examples of real 100-Day Action Plans. Without examples, I felt I needed more research to feel comfortable about putting together a detailed plan. I also recommend \\"You're In Charge: Now What?\\" to supplement your knowledge if this is your first 100-Day Action Plan.Sam Frazier"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for upper management positions","review":"Don't wait. I recommend you read this book long before you actually try to get your first upper management position. If you really are a procrastinator, and have applied to be a new VP, either coming in fresh or moving within your large organization, this book should be on your reading pile after your first phone interview at the latest. By the time you reach the face-to-face interview stage some of the plans and steps the author outlines will already put you ahead of your competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"For most senior leaders only","review":"This book may be good for new leaders at the C-level or otherwise most senior levels.

The book also includes practical and detailed templates and tools. I've had 3 previous transitions in my career and I always felt that it took too long to get organized and up-to-speed. With this book, I was better prepared for this transition before I even started!

Very complete with lots of examples and tools. If you think you need to recalibrate your view on leadership, start here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prescient Look Back","review":"Vidal was 20 when he wrote this coming-of-age novel, set in a post-war America when the word homosexual conjured netherworlds of perversion and depravity. The feat here isn't the author's frankness or even the skill he uses to convey the character's self-lacerating observations(and what a bunch!). Maybe déjà vu is the word for it: Vidal's hero grows in increments until what emerges is a clear-eyed, honest look at one man coming to terms, a coming out whose hills and valleys remains emotionally indistinguishable from the lives of gay men today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bracing","review":"An interesting---even bracing---view in this 1948 novel about gay life in America, and the obstacles and subterfuges that had to go with it then, if one was to have intimate relations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ham-fisted and completely lacking in nuance","review":"[...]In \\"The City and the Pillar\\" Vidal makes every symbol a bludgeon and beats his readers over the head with it. (Hint: the pillar is a phallic symbol!)The structure of the novel is practically outlined in bullet-points before each chapter. When, at the climactic moment he tells us that the circle is complete (actual phrase!) and that this is the climax of the novel, I threw the book at the wall.The book might be appropriate as a Young Adult novel for a struggling gay teenager reading years below his or her grade level, but I'd hesitate there too. It's got all the nuance and subtelty of a YA novel, but it really does try to be an actual piece of literary fiction. Shame, because it could almost be a decent after-school special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid Music","review":"I have been a fan of Tom Yoder for a long time and this CD is truly a jem. Anyone who is a serious guitar player should give this CD a listen. This is truly spendid music. I can't wait til he makes another CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songwriting from a master player","review":"Tom Yoder is a gifted guitar player. A very small percentage of players can ever hope to achieve his level of technical mastery. Of course, there are many great guitarists who don't write great songs, and ultimately, the song is what matters. With this CD, Tom has proven that he can write beautiful songs. Many of the songs on this CD showcase his chops, and yet are not merely excercises in technique. Michael Hedges had this talent, as does Al Petteway. Tom Yoder has it too, in a big way. Congratulations Tom! And thanks for the great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love of Limericks","review":"The Limerick form (remember \\"Hickory, Dickory, Dock?\\") is given free reign here, with results both titillating, delightful and raucous and is, at times (most times) full of a scandalous repetoir of exuberance, life, and witt. If you don't have a favorite Limerick, you soon will."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY","review":"If you appreciate limericks... good, bad... clean, dirty... you must have this book in your library. If you can't find plenty to laugh about, do not call yourself a limericks lover! The book also gives dates that the limericks were first published, and you'll be amazed at how long the Man from Nantucket has been hanging around."},{"rating":"1","title":"not at all what product description promises","review":"I bought this product for my son when he was about four years old. The product description makes it out to be such a wonderful product that will spark interest in science in children. The loudspeaker feature supposedly lets the child listen to \\"crunching\\" sounds when the insect is eating and/or supposedly enables to listen to the \\"tap, tap\\" of insect footsteps. It is nothing like that. The only noise we heard was slight static and the noise our hands produced when we touched the container. Additionally, the lid is supposed to magnify the insect for easy observation, and details for the insect's features. Not true! There is a magnifying effect when looking through the lid, but nothing like the product description makes it out to be.This product was a disappointment and not worth the expense at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored me to tears from beginning to end.","review":"this song was charted in the top 20 for New York dance station KTU. I usually like what they play, so I bought it. It's atrocious. There's no catch to the vocals that makes you want to sing along, and there is nothing compelling about any of the mixes that make you want to dance. It has a dated freestyle sound with CHEESY, highpitched female vocals. AVOID THIS ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"This stuff was easy to apply and didn't change the finish of my cymbals. Only time will tell if it protects them from getting a patina and fingerprints. It does say on the bottle that you must apply it regularly, which I will do.I don't like cymbals with a reflective finish but I also don't really like a patina either. I like a nice satiny bright bronze finish. I worked hard on some used cymbals I bought and got them looking really good and wanted a way to keep them looking good. Hopefully this stuff will do the trick. I wiped it on and polished the cymbal like instructed which was pretty easy. When done the cymbals felt like they had a slick finish, similar to but not the same as, the wax finish on paint. When handling the cymbals the fingerprints seems to wipe off very easily unlike before the were treated. If the finish of the cymbals changes with time or if fingerprints begin to leave marks I will update this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"For shame","review":"These books are great and the movie made a joke out of them.

Otherwise, I would stay away from this. The content is strictly entry level. The art is done on the cheap. There are no references, and no in-depth coverage of anything. I was hoping for good coverage of major Gods & Goddesses with perhaps classical art depictions of same. None of that here. If you're looking for an electronic reference on the subject of classical mythology, this is not it. Save you money and buy a book unless you want something stricly juvenile in its orientation. I give it two stars (being generous) because it might be a decent introduction for some kid who is book-averse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melting handle","review":"I purchased this pan to try out the glass ceramic titanium surface.

It has turned out to be a complete waste of time. The dialogue is unbelievably juvenile and the plot tests the willing suspension of disbelief to the fullest.The 'efforts' of Chris the American collaborator of an Indian firm manufacturing plastic buckets to step in and 'help' in overcoming labor problems at the Indian factory are so thinly stretched as to want to throw this book away...and to think that trees were felled for printing this!The book is replete with beaten-to-death misconceptions and generalizations of Americans and Indians.

I consider myself a huge Zappa fan (I own at least 30 FZ albums), and I like a wide range of his material, from the Flo & Eddie stuff to the '88 big band stuff. But the Synclavier material is pretty much unlistenable for me. It baffles me that Zappa thought the Synclavier could replace actual musicians. He had some of the best musicians in the business and he wanted to replace them with a computer? What was he thinking? This album is nothing but Synclavier music and inane, incomprehensible spoken word tracks. If you think you need to own every Zappa album, make sure this is the last one you buy.

Well, long story short, you can NOT use the light with the 'regular/original' pixters! It does NOT state anywhere on the package exactly what pixters they are compatable with. It only says that it can not be used with all pixters, and that statement is not very visible!

Besides, the process for warranty replacement has less appeal than a root canal. It's a joke.YOU REALLY OWE IT TO YOURSELF to check around on the Internet for consumer feedback/reviews on this overpriced and overrated cookware.

Instead, most of the pages in this book have half a page of blank spaces. The information provided is not in-depth and not well organized. Illustrations are done poorly with poor print quality. It is easier to find information through the software's help system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized","review":"The tutorials in this book are poorly organized. Lesson 1 started out with a very simple part and it was half done all the way till lesson 10. It is not rocket building, it is just a rectangle with a hole through it. The author throw in two other parts in the first 10 lessons. Instrustions were either missing or difficult to understand. Not worth the money you pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for solid modeling beginners!","review":"The book is poorly organized, missing instructions, and difficult to follow. It is too incomplete for beginners & too elementary for intermediates & professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"With such great reviews and such a great reputation, I tried the very tempting cover recipe Devil's Food Cake. I followed the recipe with precision, sifting, weighing, mixing and the cake was just average. I used my precious Droste cocoa powder and the overall flavour was just mediocre. It didn't have an intense chocolate flavour you'd expect based on the picture (but that could be just my own expectations).I also tried the cocoa genoise and was very disappointed with that too. I found the mixing times were off - she indicated mixing for 3-4 minutes for the eggs to triple in vollume but it actually took double that.The book did provide some insight to the science of baking, describing each ingredient and their purpose, the lackluster cakes proves to be a disappointment so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four recipes all failed","review":"I am getting rid of this book. I followed the recipes exactly but got very poor results. The eclair batter was too thin--the eclairs were flat and impossible to fill. The pastry cream recipe should be called \\"pastry sauce\\"--also thin, never set up. The almond paste pound cake recipe fell. The white cake recipe had a very nice texture but shrinks a great deal as it cools. Overall I was very disappointed with this book. It gave me the worst results of any cookbook I have tried in recent memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jam Rock, Southern Style","review":"Listening to this album puts it all into perspective.

Cale's \\"Travelin' Light.\\" The final track \\"Me and the Devil -> Heaven\\" is a fantastic closer. The emotion in JB's tortured voice is palpable.Pick this up for a perfect introdution to what has become one of the finest bands out there today."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found Space Wrangler to be the most enjoyable WSP album.","review":"WSP, in Space Wrangler, combines excellent instrumentals, such as Take Out and the instrumentals of Driving Song (best song on this album) and combines them with the excellent, sometimes playful lyrics (Cocunut).

However, I was quite disappointed. The cover and title led me to believe there would be a much richer content, like the reputation and feel of the historic city. Instead I found more of a 4th grade \\"arts & crafts\\" theme. (C'mon, really.....dough ornaments, orange clove pomanders, gingerbread houses???) Many of the photos reminded me of an outdated late 1980s/early 1990s decorating style. (Ronald Reagan and Wham! called....they want their era back!) This book was a genuine disappointment. I would love to read one with more \\"grown up\\" entertaining and decorating ideas that seamlessly meld the Williamsburg of old with this century's take on freshening up the look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I've gone thru two of these thermometers and NEVER got an accurate reading from either one."},{"rating":"1","title":"human engineering","review":"needs to have more wight on base and large suction cups on base to be secure while in hoz,or vertical use.it also needs lower temp setting for extra rare meat,and the addition of a fish temp setting for various thicknesses of fish,then you,ll really have something//////"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alert does not work","review":"The Alert has two modes (Low & High), evidently useful for holding an item in a temperature range...In any event, the alert worked only on the first use, and has never worked since.

You folks have helped me use my Polder for over 3 years now without one problem. I don't wash my probe....I sanitize it with rubbing alcohol after it has cooled enough to handle. If there's any residue on the probe I gently remove it with a butter knife and then clean it with the alcohol.

The temperature probe is unable to tolerate the high temperatures of an outdoor grill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better.","review":"I rely on my digital kitchen timer/ thermometer on a daily basis, even when not cooking. I was excited when I bought this to replace the last one, but I was disappointed with the quality of this one. The buttons are sluggish. The timer count-down does not continue once it reaches zero; you could not see on this one how much time has past the preset point. It is handy when you know it's been 1 or 3 minutes past the set time, so you could adjust your cooking time. It has a clock mode but I already have 2 other clocks in the kitchen (on microwave oven and radio) so I don't need it. Finally it does not have seconds setting, or at least 1/2 minute setting, which I also use a lot. It works, but its design is not great. I will keep this one, and hope it breaks soon so I can get a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really excellent product, but a few little nits","review":"This is an excellent product. It makes roasting meat as easy as 1-2-3. Products come out of oven cooked exactly right, as faster than use of other thermometers, as you don't lose heat by opening the door to check the temperature. Really helps to prevent overcooking things like turkey, roast beef, etc.Tou can also time something while using the temperature probe to cook another thing.So, why only 4 stars? Two reasons:1. Setting temperature to alarm at is not intuitive.2. Probe is not water proof, and if water gets into the stem of the probe, it's dead.But I still love the two I have, and if one breaks, I'll replace it with another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Mine broke THE FIRST TIME I used it. Don't buy this! If I could give it zero stars, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basic timer","review":"I have a older model of this time. It is great for timing stuff all over the house. It is easy to use, small and light weight. Take it anywhere where you need to time something. I don't use the temperature setting. You are better off buying a good instant read thermometer anyway to take temperature readings. Besides you need a flat or metal surface near the oven to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polder Cooking Thermometer/timer Model 362","review":"This product appears to be manufactured to guarantee that the purchaser must buy new probes at a cost of $...each. My probe became inoperative after only two uses. That is unacceptable!!! Now I understand why other forums show so many buyers of replacement probe(s)-- this is a great way to generate an income stream. Gotta give Polder five stars for their marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is a poorly constructed thermometer. After one successful use, the LCD screen showed only occasional lines, rendering it unreadable.If it worked, it would meet a real need.

If the screen went during the cooking, I would have probably ruined an expensive cut of meat."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I used this thing once and it broke.

Frankly there has to be a better product out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I trust this thing as much as a novelty fire extinguisher!","review":"I used this as a thermometer for steaks, roasts and such, and it worked 'OK'. While homebrewing some beer it was submerged in the boiling wort and 'kinda sort of worked' after that. We put it in the freezer to test it and my freezer was a whopping 67 degrees for a couple hours, luckily none of the ice melted in these temperatures. (Did you pickup the sarcasm? I hope so! Moving on.) The more I read about the digital thermometers, I find out most can't be submerged in liquid.I do like that you can set it to a range and it will beep when you leave this range, but I think I have to resort to a trusty analog thermometer for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Worked relatively well about four times. It was kind of twitchy in that it would sometimes leap around +- 10 degrees. The fifth time I used it, it started acting weird; cooked items would heat up then start getting colder as they cooked more. Finally, after screwing up a batch of home-brewed beer, I noticed it was showing room temperature as 105 degrees when it was 68.Don't waste your money, this thing is terrible. ...

Ordered a new probe, but that didn't work. Now, it's just an expensive timer. Would've received three stars, but the Polder site and service not helpful. Will try the Taylor model, good luck with analog Taylor thermometers. Once you get used to these types of thermometers, it's hard to go back. The precision in cooking, especially for chicken and pork, can make a big difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"KER-STOP","review":"It was working great for about three months but now whenever I put the probe into the unit, without placing the other end into the meat, it states the temp is either HI or LOW (i.e out of range).

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"never had a problem","review":"I'm not sure exactly what went wrong for the other folks here but I've never had a problem. My kids even use it as a toy.

But inevitably the probes fail. You will think its your fault and probably buy a new one. But the reviews show that the probes are not up to the temperature extremes they will be subjected to in a grill or an oven.One solution I've tried that works pretty well, is to keep your receipt, and when the probe fails, take it back where you bought it for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak magnet","review":"Works great except the magnet is too weak. When sticking on both a metal pot rack and an oven, the thermometer will stick but when you push the buttons just a little too hard the thing will go crashing to the floor. I'm on our 2nd unit and it still works but the clear face is broken off. One more drop and that will probably be it, so I try to keep it sitting on the counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complex for a family of engineers","review":"My mom has this thermometer, and every time she tries to use it for holiday cooking, she can't figure it out and hands it to me. I have read the directions over and over, and either it simply doesn't function right, or it is so complex that three engineers and two product designers couldn't figure out how to make it work. In short, very bad design. I have two other thermometers similar to this in my own kitchen, one with a pager--super handy!--and one by Pyrex, both of which are fantastic additions to my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great tool when it works","review":"I really like this thermometer when it works.The first one failed after a few months. I figured it was just a faulty one and ordered another. The new one failed even sooner. I sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"good easy cooking","review":"I love the accuracy, and the convenience of having the sensor in the oven with the readout outside the oven. The problem is with the temp probes are not sealed from water or cooking juices and they can get down in the probe and destroy them. The probes can be purchesed seperately at most cook ware stores. The instructions caution you to not immerse the probe; translate this as handle carefully and plan on relacing the probe every so often and have an extra around for the failure. It is not if but when it fails. Even with the sensitive probes I would not be without one of these in my kitchen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasts","review":"I have purchased this item twice. The first barely made it through a grill season and the second proved even less hearty. The grill gets too hot for the wire and it burns through leaving two pices of probe wire. There is no way to use this with a grill and get sustained use from it. The same is true of all brands.. Models sold as \\"wireless\\" are not wireless in terms of going from the meat to outside of the grill. Somebody needs to figure out how to make this tool without the probe wire. That said, before it becomes useless, it works really well. Maybe the idea is to buy these by the case?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to Thank You!","review":"WOW!

It's the theme song to \\"Roswell\\" and I couldn't get it out of my head. On a whole the cd is very good. It's obvious Dido has a R&B background. \\"Here With Me\\" is intensely passionate, the vocals incredible. Also, \\"Don't Think of Me\\" stands out as a very sassy message. Vocally it is very sweet and melodious with a mean-spirited, 'who's-sorry-now' message a la Natalie Merchant's \\"Jealousy.\\" Can't be enough songs like that. Why there are no single or radio plays is baffling. Clearly that's where Dido need s to be. An hour with this CD is time well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy voice, acoustical and electronic sounds","review":"I love every song on this album. There is a wide range of music - the songs are sweet and soothing, but also have strong captivating beats. Dido's voice is wonderful - it fits well with the acoustical guitar. \\"Here With Me\\", which is also the theme song for the WB's \\"Roswell\\", has a good rhythm and builds up nicely from start to finish. \\"All You Want\\", \\"Thank You\\", and \\"Isobel\\" are my favorites along with \\"Here With Me\\". \\"Take My Hand\\", the bonus track, starts out slow, picks up and becomes a song you might hear in a club. I cannot say enough about this album. I have played it for a lot of my friends, and they all liked it and had all positive comments. If you like the singing voices of Jewel or Sarah McLachlan, you will enjoy Dido."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO! The Brit I hope never quits.","review":"As a DJ in college, I was introduced to Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan. Add to the ranks Dido.Dido is intelligent, passionate music. A breath of fresh air into the Jewel-like posers and coffee-house musers, Dido stands head-and-shoulders above the rest.Her music is great, but have you heard her speak?

If you like this I highly recommend checking out the soundtrack to \\"Sliding Doors\\" on which her song \\"Thank You\\" appears and her early pre-solo work with the group Faithless. My favorite track is the song \\"Hunter\\" about a girl affirming her independence, which is a great anthem for me being a chick on her own. Other highlights: \\"Here With Me,\\" \\"Thank You,\\" and \\"No Angel.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!!","review":"I was in the record store in need of some soul-soothing music, and remembered seeing Dido on VH1.

There is a very romantic, soulful, and honest quality to her music, and I expect great things from her in the future. Not many people know of her, so if you get this CD, you're being let in on one of the best kept secrets around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of an 'Angel'","review":"How does that old adage go--good things come to those who wait? That would certainly be the case with Dido. I remember the first time that I heard 'Here With Me'--long before it was ROSWELL's theme song--on a modern rock station in '99, and thought, what a cool song. Too bad it took Eminem sampling 'Thank You' to make people sit up and take notice--this album is deep with great music. Her voice is very reminiscent of Ruth-Ann's(from the group Olive), and her music is somewhat along the lines of Sarah McLachlan, only slightly less pretentious. A very strong effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Dido!","review":"\\"No Angel\\" is a great solo debut by Dido, who has already appeared on some Faithless songs. And obviously Faithless had a lot of influence on her. Especially in the second half of the album electronic sounds dominate the songs. Personally I think the CD's first half is better, because the accoustic guitar which is mainly used here goes great with her beautiful voice.The best songs are \\"Don't Think Of Me\\", a touching ballad, and \\"Thank You\\" which, as you all know, has been used as a sample for Eminem's \\"Stan\\". But Dido has more to offer than background vocals for a rap song. Her voice stands out in the wide sea of hardly talented one-hit-wonder-popstars, and the music, too, is not mainstream, what makes this album very refreshening in these days.I hope to hear more from this truly talented singer in the future. Next time, perhaps with more accuoustic instruments and less electronic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"No angel , just human","review":"It was clear from the beginning that Eminem's princess Dido had a lot more to ofter to the music world than just Stan' s refrain . In her first offering \\" No Angel \\" she sings about emotional suffering with all the simplicity of a human creature ( \\" ...i just want to feel safe in my own skin \\" ). \\" Here With Me \\" ( one of the most tender songs to have ever hit the top 5 ) , \\" Hunter \\" , \\" Thank You \\" and the melancholic \\" Honestly O.K \\" are just some of the highlights yet the track which , at least in my opinion stands out is \\" Don't Slide \\" with it's sensitive and at the same time intense character . Nothing would have been the same ofcourse if it wasn't for Dido's warm , beautiful voice which is so affecting . An overall remarkable debut album withought doubt ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic and Beautiful","review":"When I first got the CD, I'd heard both \\"Here with Me\\" and \\"Thank You\\" and loved them. Eventually, I got the CD, and...I couldn't stop playing it for a long time. Where has Dido been all this time? This is talent at its best. From the longingness of \\"Here with Me\\" to the insecurity of \\"Honestly OK\\" (my favourite track) to the angst of \\"Don't Think of Me,\\" the CD is sheer brilliance. If you haven't bought this CD yet, go do it! I'm definitely looking forward to hearing more of her work in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six stars if possible....","review":"I got this CD for one song (Thank You), and I'm very glad I did. I instantly loved it. The best songs in my opinion are \\"Hunter\\", \\"All You Want\\", \\"Thank You\\"(which I'm listening to right now), \\"Isobel\\", and \\"Take My Hand\\". All the songs are good, but those are the best ones. These songs stick in your head, and you can't forget them. They are wonderful, wonderful songs. I first heard \\"Thank You\\" on the radio, and I couldn't forget it. So I asked a friend of mine who it was by, and ended up buying the CD and falling in love with all the other songs.

There are some exceptions, but very few. I bought this after hearing the few seconds of the vocal she provided to the song 'Stan', which was the stand out track on the album. But enough about him, Dido is incredible. One problem, nobody in Europe has heard of you, so get over here quick!The music is haunting, and every track is a winner. There is no filler on this album, which means although ultimately shorter than most, it is far more memorable.All I say is please come to Europe, flex those vocal chords in a few clubs in Amsterdam, London, Dublin. Then my friends will have heard of you, and won't keep saying I bought a CD by the dog in the Flintstones! NOBODY HERE HAS HEARD OF YOU! YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT!

I bought it- as did many others- solely for \\"Here With Me\\" & \\"Thank You,\\" but this album has far surpassed my expectations. A blending of sounds from Sarah McLachlan to The Cranberries, \\"No Angel\\" is not only a musical enjoyment, but a lyrical one as well. Introspective without being morose, strong without spewing venom, her words are as thoughtful as the catchy tunes that carry it.I have been listening to \\"No Angel\\" rather nonstop for a week now & like with many great albums, I keep finding a new song I decide is my favorite, only to find yet another the next day.Truly, truly, truly good. I am so pleased with this purchase. :)I highly recommend. (FYI: I would give 5 stars, but I reserve such ratings only for my most favorite & long standings artists)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice, bad music.","review":"First of all, don't get me wrong... I think Dido has a wonderful voice, she clearly has talent. However, after listening to her CD a couple of times I began to notice that her lyrics are kind of cheesy and stupid. The fact that she doesn't write any of her own music was very apparent, and she sounded emotionally flat to me. Dido music is like a bright shiny apple that's rotten all the way to the core. It's music with no soul. Try Ani Difranco, Fiona Apple, or Tori Amos instead... they actually feel what they're singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 14 bucks.","review":"You know how you buy a cd after you hear and love one song from the artist,and when you play the whole cd,you find youself only liking that one song? Well,this cd is a perfect example. It has one great,insanely catchy track,\\"Here with me,\\" while the rest of the cd is a forgettable,sappy combination of Sarah McLachlan and Portishead. This cd suffers from two many cooks;there's about thirty (!)musicians,mixers,and producers listed in the credits.Plus, Dido herself(the lead singer) didn't write ANY songs at all;every song is credited to usually two or three hack writers. Again,the opening track,\\"Here with Me,\\" is great, but every other tune is mostly generic trip-hop, with pretty bad lyrics. I'm glad I only paid six bucks for this cd(I got it used). I recommented just buying \\"Here With Me,\\" if it's ever released as a single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dido deserves to be a star","review":"I saw the video on MTV2 for Here With Me and immeadiately went out and bought the CD. I am a huge Sarah Mclachlan fan and now Dido runs a close second. From the lush, transporting nature of \\"Here With Me\\" to the fun and sweet \\"Thank You\\" to the rythmic and electrifying \\"Take My Hand\\" - Dido, with her brother Rollo, show they know how to make an album that is both diverse and at the same time unified by its sheer quality. Awesome. Everyone should buy this CD. Its that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile female vocalist bound for success","review":"I was fortunate enough to get an advance order of Dido's debut album, \\"No Angel,\\" and frankly, it took me away. This album is excellent, period. I would give this four and a half stars if I have the option to. What is remarkable about Dido is her ability to combine her classical and electronic influences, weaved with her lush McLachlan-like vocals to generate an innovative, refreshing new sound. \\"Here With Me\\" (track 1) is a grand pop symphony that immediately engages you into her sound. \\"Thank You\\" (track 6) , also featured on the \\"Sliding Doors\\" soundtrack, is my favorite track. It's just a nice acoustic melody that's pleasant to the ears. \\"Honestly OK\\" (track 7) may be the most progressive track. The beginning sounds like The Orb's \\"Fluffy Little Clouds,\\" but once Dido's vocals weaves through, you're taken back down from the stratosphere. If radio stations catch on to Dido's first single, \\"Here With Me\\" - watch out, she may be the next big thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful voice...and a wonderful CD !","review":"I first heard about Dido listening to the Eminem CD, song n# 3 STAN. I bought her CD right away knowing that it would be great. Well, such songs as Here with me, Don't think of me or Thankyou make her a star rigth away. Where did she get that voice ? It reminds me of Portishead and Louise Wener the ex-Sleeper female singer. It's definitely a great CD and it's worth buying it. Long live Dido !"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Angel","review":"This is absolutely one of my favorite cd's ever. Dido's songs are beautifully and emotionally written and contain themes that everyone can relate to such as love, friendship, and broken hearts. I bought No Angel after hearing \\"Here With Me\\" twice on the radio and instantly fell in love with it. I've passed it on to friends who have passed it on to friends and everyone thanks me for getting them hooked on this extremely talented artist. If you have a chance to see Dido live, do it. The music is absolutely enchanting. It was a surprise to hear such a rich sound coming from this small person but she was incredible. So buy this cd right now, you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Angel","review":"Dido's pretty interesting. I bought the cd after seeing her vid for \\"here with me\\". It's a great song that almost makes me cry! Her lyrics are brilliant and moving and she's very unique and creative. All the tunes fit nicely together also. Unfortunately, they all sound alike to me! They all seem to have the same meaning and message and all sound pretty much the same. Her voice is also hard to hear and understand although, it's not a complete waste of money buying her album :) Ya won't be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"the mysterious voice from eminems song stan is reveiled. The only song i like by eminem is stan so i wanted to find out more about dido. i love this c/d sooooo much it has music for every mood i go through. she has such a wonderful voice. i love it i love it i love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dido Is The Finest New Star","review":"When I first heard a Dido song, I thought it sounded a little like the Cranberries, with Haunting vocals and a soft touch. Now I know she has her own style. Every Song on this Cd is beautiful, memorable and are a sure fire stress release. I play Dido at work everyday and we are always being asked who it is. You will not be disappointed with this Cd. Standout tracks include \\"Here With Me\\" and \\"Hunter\\" of course. Buy and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"no angel is heaven","review":"The first time i heard the first single Hear With Me, i fell in love. i knew i had to buy this wonderful c.d. I listened to all the songs right away and i loved them all. My favorite song off No Angel is All You Want. I love this song and i cant get enough of it! My Lover's Gone is another great song that makes everyone get a little misty eyed. I will STRONGLY recommend making Dido's No Angel apart of your collection asap. Dont delay Buy Today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEautiful music and voice!","review":"Dido's cd is wonderful. The songs are poetic and beautiful, and her voice makes this cd a must-buy. Her songs deal with themes of loneliness, deception, love, and life, and almost all the songs show some trace of other singers, such as Sarah McLachlan and others that she has been compared to. Dido should not be known as the girl in Eminem's song or as the one who plays the theme of Roswell. She should be recongnized for what she is: a great solo talent that is here to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Thank You\\", a great song!","review":"I have trully enjoyed the song \\"Thank You\\". It was in fact, my reason for wanting this CD. I have not been able to really get in to any of the other songs (probably because I have the repeat button set to \\"Thank You\\"!) but do find that Dido puts me in mind of Sinead O'conner and/or Cranberry. Both of whom I have \\"tapes\\" (for those of us that can remember those) that I still listen to. I would recommend this CD to just about anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD NOW","review":"I bought this because of Stan on the Eminem Marshall Mathers LP (Thankyou is the original) and have found the CD amazing. There is not 1 bad track on the album and it was well worth the wait to have it shipped to the UK."},{"rating":"2","title":"...And talented to boot...","review":"I bought this CD based on Dido's previous work with Faithless, a great band by the way, and the \\"Here with me\\" track that I heard on MTV last year. I wasn't disappointed. All that's great about UK trip-hop is featured here along with some strong songs and great voice. Best track by a whisker is \\"Hunter\\" but the excellent \\"Thank You\\" (featured on \\"Stan\\" by Eminem) and \\"Don't think of me\\" push them close. Get out and buy this record - you won't be disappointed! (And Dido's even better live!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"the karen carpenter of the decade!!! AWESOME !!!!","review":"being an englishman myself,its hard to find that right blend of jazz,vocal and rhythm without having to turn on the radio....I actually heard this on a friends car CD.....I just had to go out and buy it. If you are in your 30's...you will remember the vocals of karen carpenter....well dido is worthy of being compared with her....I'm flying back to england just so I can see this lady in concert....she is that good.you really need to be on that plane,in that venue....."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIDO ROCKS!","review":"Unsurprisingly, I was introduced to Dido with the theme tune to the teenage show Roswell. If only the programme's quality reflected that of this astonishing album. Again unsurprisingly, Dido's style has had comparisons made to artists such as Sarah M and Tori Amos, but her groundbreaking debut certainly earns her an identity of her own. Like no other, Dido manages to encompass pain and longing into tracks such as 'Here With Me' and 'My Lover's Gone', while exuding warmth from ones like 'Thank You' (featured at the end of the film 'Sliding Doors'). On top of which, Dido is British, and, being a Londoner myself, it is refreshing to hear some homegrown talent for once. This album comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE","review":"FOR ANYONE WITH A GREAT LOVE OF AMERICAN ALTERNATIVE COMBINED WITH AN APPRECIATION OLD CELTIC TRADITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, THIS CD WILL BE A UNIQUE ADDITION TO YOUR COLLECTION. IT BLENDS CELTIC STRING/MELODIES W/CONTEMPORARY LYRICS TO CREATE AN EXTRAORDINARY BLEND OF PURE INNOCENCE MIXED WITH PURE EXTACY TO INFUSE A PERFECT SENSE OF WELL BEING! PLEASE ALLOW YOURSELF INDULDGE! YOU DESERVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly Music For \\"No Angel\\"","review":"In my old neck of the woods, I'd actually heard Dido on a alternative radio station out of Austin with the hauntingly beautiful, ethereal \\"Here With Me\\" track, but my family back in NM knew the song only as the \\"Roswell\\" theme. So you can imagine my surprise when I came back home and started rifling through my Dad's CD collection; there she was. I immediately popped the CD into a player and was totally blown away. Her wry lyrics on \\"Don't Think of Me\\", and deceptively complex harmonies on \\"Thank You\\" make this album a real find. If you examine the other lyrics and songs closely, you'll see they come from a wise heart that knows the ebb and flow of love, and that it doesn't have to come only in saccharine pop-tart flavors such as Britney or Christina."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I've listen to it all the time and I'm still not sick of it. If you like Sarah McLachlan you will love Dido. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one word....Awesome","review":"I never heard this artist before until I bought the Windows 98 SE upgrade and it included a sampler cd with the song and video of \\"Here With Me\\". I instantly fell in love with the song. After hearing this song (I play it constantly) and reading some of the other reviews on here, I know I'll be buying this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dido's greatest album","review":"Love this album especially the \\"Here with Me\\" (a big Roswell fan) and also her voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE that Dido","review":"OMG, i love this CD. one of my all time favorites. i know most of the songs by heart, i sing along to Dido, when i'm laying in bed with my baby, and i sing the words to him. it's a very sweet moment - i just love the words. and it's very calming and soothing. i like to play music to fall asleep to at night. this is a great CD. profound and beautiful. thanks Dido!! (your mother didn't really name you that - did she?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best NEW Artist","review":"First of all let me correct the last reviewer in that DIDO ARMSTRONG wrote the songs on this EXCELLENT cd. She kind of reminds me of JEWEL. I didn't think much of it when I first got it but everytime I listened to the cd I liked it more and more. She should win BEST NEW ARTIST. Can't wait to see her this summer. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful debut","review":"I only wanted Dido's cd because of the Roswell theme and \\"Thank You\\". I listened to the cd a few times and I thought it was okay, but then it was like someone switched a light on and all the songs started sounding so awesome to me. \\"Honestly OK\\",\\"Slide\\" and \\"I'm No Angel\\" are a few of my favorite songs on the album. I would highly reccommend this album to everyone who loves chill music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Great Buy","review":"A lot of people told me I shouldn't buy this CD, they told me it was all depressing and got old after a while. However I decided to check it out for myself and definately disagree. I've had it for about two months now, and I still enjoy listening to Dido. She has a great voice. Some of the songs get a little bit old, but for the most part I'd definately recommend this album. Some songs I enjoyed include: \\"Don't Think of Me\\", \\"Thankyou\\", \\"Isobel\\", and \\"I'm no Angel.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I first heard the song, \\"Here With Me\\" and I had to have it. It didn't come in a single so I brought the album...and I love it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"sensual Voice with lyrics to live by","review":"I loved the first track as soon as it was on the radio. Then, I heard Dido acoustic on the radio live while she was visiting a local radio station. I knew I had to have it. Her voice is awesome. Every song on this album is terrific. I can play it over and over and never get sick of it. Her crooning ballads are not overly sentimental. The music exemplifies her vocal talent. A must buy for anyone who likes Sarah McL, Fiona Apple and/or Natalie Imbruglia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Dido","review":"I don't know what I expected from this album, but I certainly didn't get it. Although Dido may appeal to others, she didn't with me. Her lyrics were well written, but Dido just seemed to talk her way through the songs. The music didn't seem to have any beat and was kind of like a mix matched bunch of tunes that you can't straighten out in your head. I must admit I bought it for the Roswell theme song \\"Here with Me\\". That seemed like the only worthy song to listen to. I don't mean to make Dido sound like the worst artist in the world; she has potential. But she did not win me over with \\"No Angel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"no trip hop","review":"please drop the trip hop comparison; the mere suggestion of it would have been insulting to people like massive attack and portishead. quite soothing most of the time, dido sings quietly with a hint of lethargy. this collection of pretty and laid back songs are inoffensive, if not prosaic. her singing works wonderfully on the faithless cds though. check out 'sunday 8pm' and the new 'outrospective' by faithless. dido works well in the context of a group and clearly she is a team player."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet voice for delicates songs","review":"According me, DIDO is a great singer.I've discovered her with the title \\"Here With Me\\", in the TV serie \\"Roswell\\".I think she is on a way that put out her very far away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to jump off the bandwagon on this one","review":"The song Here With Me compelled me to get this album though I wish I didn't. The songs all sound the same: same boring synthesizers and dull vocals. There is no range at all on this CD and the lyrics are basically all about lost love. Dido has a lot of potential but I think this release is boring, uninspired, and not too different from what's already polluting the air waves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be great -but it isn't","review":"Intoxicating rythems, inspired lyrics, and great music are what is getting more and more people hooked on Dido (pronounced Dye-Do). But it's who sings the lyrics is the problem. Sung in an airy, tight voice that makes Brittiany Spears look good, this CD would be one of the best if it was sung by someone else with a decent voice. Also, the total absence of energy from the singer is very noticeable and dosen't even come close to the passonate singers such as Celene Dion, Whitney Houston, etc. Most poeple admit that they hated Dido to start, but that she has grown on them. I, personally still think that she is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Means a lot to me","review":"This album means a lot to me since my grandmother died of cancer of the bowels. She went to doctor about a year ago, and the doctor said that she only had about six months to live. The songs remind me of the time that my husband walked out and left me with three kids, two dogs, and no car. I mean, how could anyone do such a terrible thing? Sure I got married when I was 17 because I was pregnant with my oldest son, Teevon, but I was in love just like these love songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Sleep...(I Blame Eminem)","review":"I understand why so many people like Dido..She is beautiful, has a decent voice, comes across as a decent human being and is inoffensive...This album is the same - 'inoffensive'...some might say, bland...The tracks that work for me are 'Thank You' (used on Eminem's 'Stan'), but is done solo here and it works, 'Hunter' and 'Here With Me'...The rest just disappear into the background like a passing car...Nothing much happens, nothing inspires...I really want to like her, but it's all been done before..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dido - the great rip-off","review":"In a time when generic, uninspired rip-off bands are called \\"fresh\\", \\"unique\\" and \\"original\\" it should be no surprise that someone would get around to ripping off Sarah McLachlan. Dido is that rip-off.Her vocal style, the musical style, everything, is evocative of Sarah McLachlan. A pity, too, because she has a good voice and could stand on her own without resorting to mimicking a greater performer's style."},{"rating":"2","title":"First half better than second","review":"The first half is REALLY good, so it gets 4 stars. And the second half isn't THAT bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Sarah McLachlan? I don't think so!","review":"as if anyone with a brain thinks that Dido is better than Sarah McLachlan. Hmm, Sarah's voice actually has RANGE and she writes her own songs and plays guitar and piano which is more than i can say about Dido (wow, she can play the recorder, good for her). Dido's voice is boring and she has to rely on other people to co-write her songs with her. how can anyone compare Dido to Sarah, who has been around since 1988 and actually has a career? Dido hasn't proved herself yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity","review":"I discovered DIDO when she performed with EMINEM on Saturday Night Live. I was in the other room when he came on, but when I heard her voice I thought I was hearing an angel and ran in to see her. She has the most serene voice I've ever heard. It is absolutely beautiful.I went out the next day to buy the CD and I don't think a day has gone by where I don't listen to at least one song. My favorite is \\"Don't Slide.\\" I played that for a friend who was going through a difficult time and tears started streaming down her face..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Woman Band, You've heard the music and the Critics","review":"We Love this album office (fingers crossed for the sophmore effort). So as a child she steals a violin and has become a musical genius. This album is phenomenal, ridiculously good, there are not enough words to describe. Her use of electronic sounds is beautiful, and is the perfect compliment to her voice. Shear beauty, and extremely radio friendly, she is bound to become a new star in the nations eyes. I know you've heard this music, or at least a couple of thses songs, but even if you aren't a music collector, or lover, you should buy this anyway. This is a CD for everyone. Check \\"All You Want\\" out if you haven't already heard it. Buy it, and there's nothing you can do but love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique find","review":"There is NO comparison! Dido is her own unique entity. Her voice has alost a haunting, calm about it (if you can imagine that). Her sensual tones remind me of Sade, but let me tell you, this woman is singing all on her own. She is singing in no one's shadow. I first saw Dido on SNL singing with Eminen and was taken aback by her voice. The song THANK YOU is one that moves me the most. You will be enthralled by her style and so glad that you bought her album. Absolutely Fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy one album this year....buy this one!","review":"It's no secret that Here With Me is in the opening credits for the hit WB show Roswell. The only problem with that was, I had no idea what the title song was! So, what to do when you're dazed and confused about soundtracks to popular tv shows? Why, look them up on EGroups of course! So, i joined a group of fellow roswellians JUST to find out who sang the song in the opening credits. It took all of two seconds to get the answer. I bought the album that day, and when I got home, I listened to Here With Me on repeat for 1 month straight. After that, I listened to the rest of the CD, and it's been the only thing in my CD player for the past 3 months! I'm telling you, this is the greatest album I own, and I owe it all to those loveable human aliens in Roswell, New Mexico! Well, not really :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Angel","review":"This album is wonderful. Dido is one of the most sincere female vocalists of all time, right up there with Billie Holiday, Cher, Stevie Nicks, and Macy Grey. Her style and sound greatly differs from these divas, but Dido is definitely spectcular. She makes the listener feel every word as she sings it -- it's impossible to ignore the emotion in her voice. This is one of the most compelling and expressive collection of songs I've ever heard. No Angel comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes Angel.","review":"I suspect this debut is something she will always have a hard time matching, because it's so good, and it seems to really touch alot of people. Dido says that she makes music that she wants to hear, and she's clearly not alone. I think this appeals to so many people because the music is a mesh of pop, folk, and electronica, and of course the voice and the lyrics are a plus too. \\"Here With Me\\" is a popular favorite and good opener, and no matter how many times I hear \\"Thank You\\", I always love it. That song just puts me into a trance. The rest is all very good, and it all leads up to my favorite song \\"Take My Hand\\". It starts very mellow, and builds up to a great beat, and is really quite an emotional and lengthy bonus track. So I say that a day without \\"No Angel\\" would be hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic album","review":"I found out about this album from the Roswell website and discovered that it wasn't available in the UK, so had to order it especially from Canada. I purchased the album specifically for the Roswell theme tune \\"Here with me\\",but having listened to the album repeatedly since receiving it I have come to the conclusion that all of the songs are just as good. Another favourite track on this album is the song \\"Hunter\\". I recommend this album to anyone that loves the series Roswell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew me away","review":"Like many people what drew me to this cd was \\"Here With Me,\\" the theme from the show Roswell. But I was totally blown away by all the tracks especially \\"All You Want\\" and \\"I'm No Angel.\\" Dido has a voice that borrows its lilt from the Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan and its dreamy smoothness from Sade. With an overall sound that resembles a soft core version of trip hop's Morcheeba, this is the type of soulful pop that should be dominating the radio waves. Most definitely the best cd I've bought all year."},{"rating":"2","title":"E-motional !!!","review":"I found this CD to be very emotional. I purchased this CD while I was going through a dark period in my life. It brought out a lot of feelings that I had kept buried. Every song touched my heart. I pray for the forgiveness of all the people I may have hurt along the way. Dido is a wonderful artist. I love the classical music influence included in her No Angel CD and hope it is part of her new release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, I'll Be Like Everyone Else.","review":"No Angel is one of those CDs you play over and over and still hear something different each time. It has a sound of a mature singer who's dealt with her fair share of love interests gone wrong and bumps in the road. Dido, a former member of alternative group Faithless, debuted solo with this CD and it was the best choice of her blossoming career.The tropical sound to most of the songs incorporates a rythmic Carribean feel to the alternative rock that is Dido. Her voice creates an unusual atmosphere, ethereal and fanciful. Dido has a real career ahead of her and I can't wait for the next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great special editon cd by Dido!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this cd when I first heard it, but I wanted the videos and the extra stuff which is great by the way!! I highly recommend this cd to all Dido fans, but if you can I would try and find this cd cheaper as I did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just \\"Thank You\\"","review":"Dido's case reminds me a lot of Jewel in more than one respect. She's a fabulous female composer and singer, to begin with. But most important of all, she rose to true fame almost two years after the release of this her debut album, 'No Angel' (1999).As for comparisons (they're inevitable in today's crowded arena of female vocalists) the style of the sister of Rollo (leader of Faithless) stands somewhere next to Natalie Merchant, Alanis Morrisette and Sarah McLachlan.Contrary to popular belief, the single \\"Thank You\\" exhausted now after so much airtime, and a very popular version of it made in collaboration with Eminem is far from being the best track in the album. The opening track (\\"Here with me\\") exhibits an unusual force, and the softer tunes, \\"My Lover's Gone,\\" \\"Slide,\\" and \\"My Life\\" are by far the best works in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous vocal brilliance","review":"I only bought \\"No Angel\\" two days ago and already the CD has been played a thousand times. Everytime I listen to it, something new grabs my attention. This girl has amazing presence. I first heard her when I saw Sliding Doors (which incidently has a great soundtrack) and I loved that powerful and yet simultaneously sweet voice on that track - and when I heard \\"here with me\\" on Roswell, I had to buy it. Every song adds something great to this album. I love the haunting vocals on Hunter and the sweet but depressing lament of My Lovers gone (which sounds very celtic in style - very nice) I would recommend this album to anyone who likes to admire powerful vocal talent - this girl is going to go far."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply wonderful","review":"I bought this cd for the Roswell theme and was pleased that it also has the music from eminems \\"stan\\".The whole cd is amazing.I also had the pleasure of seeing her in concert at the Showbox in Seattle last week.Incredible show!!!I'm just in awe of this woman.Talented,beautiful,inteligent,funny and that voice!Breathy and powerful at the same time.How does she manage that?A must have cd for anyone who likes music.If you get a chance to see her in concert don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"All tracks are bonuses!","review":"I bought this CD mainly for the first track and figured if I liked any of the other songs, I could consider them bonuses. Well, I like them ALL. My favorite has turned out to be MY LOVER'S GONE, which has a nice Medieval-meets-alien feel to it. I'm a novelist and I love to have \\"mood music\\" playing in the background while I work. This one gets a lot of play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One CD","review":"As an employee in a major music retail chain, I have to recommend Dido's \\"No Angel\\" as THE one CD to purchase from now 'til eternity. Dido is not my favorite artist, but she does an excellent job of putting well-crafted diversity of emotion on her breakthrough album. There is a little bit of everything on this album, which makes it great for every possible mood you experience. Like I said, if you purchase only one cd between now and the time you die, it better be Dido!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I have heard","review":"This CD is brilliant.

I haven't been able to stop listening to it! I highly reccommend it to anyone who likes Alanis Morrissette, Sarah Maclaughlan, and Paula Cole. This CD reminds me of them. There are a few weak songs, but the majority of them are worth putting on repeat.

(yay it's on again tonight! One of my many favorites) After the second episode I recorded the opening with my vcr, just so I could play it over and over again. Then this afternoon I decided to figure out who the song was by. I went to the WB message boards found a post asking the same question and looked up the artist on amazon.

Couldn't find anything recorded in England but then bought it through Amazon. Wonderful: I love everything about it and can't wait for it to be released in England so all the people I have recommended it to, or lent it to, can buy it for themselves! Hope she records some more."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUCH A GREAT CD!!!","review":"I first heard Dido on the \\"Sliding Doors\\" soundtrack. I fell in love with her song \\"Thank you.\\" A few weeks ago, I heard a gorgeous song on the radio called \\"Here with me.\\" Unfortunately, I didn't hear the name of the artist. I went around for a week hoping to hear the song again or find out who sings it. I finally had to call the radio station and ask who it was, and lo and behold, it was Dido whom I already loved! Needless to say, I bought \\"No Angel\\" as soon as it came out and I love it. My favorites are \\"Hunter,\\" \\"Don't think of me,\\" and \\"Take my hand.\\" I really recommend this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Solid Debut","review":"I've been looking forward to this album since I first heard \\"Thank You\\" on the Sliding Doors soundtrack, and much to my surprise Dido's debut album \\"No Angel\\" is very good. Amidst a sea of anonymous Lilith Fair sound-alikes and recent one-hit wonders, Dido's refreshing tapestry of electronic beats effortlessly blended into more traditional melodies stands high above the rest. If I had to compare her to other more established artists, I'd say her music resembles that of Sarah McLachlan with a twist of Everything But the Girl thrown in for good measure. My favorite tracks right now are \\"Hunter\\", \\"Don't Think of Me\\" (both great breakup tunes), and \\"I'm No Angel\\". I don't know if this album has what it takes to make it big in the mainstream, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. A very solid debut indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for relaxation.","review":"Insomnia bothering you? You'll never have a problem again after paying $ for this CD. No Angel by Dido is perfect for relaxing. Featuring songs such as; Here With Me, All You Want, and Thank You, her soothing lyrics will reach the depths of your soul. Ignored by record labels in her home country Dido looked abroad to gain attention. Due to the fabulous taste of the producers on the WB show Roswell her career began to soar. Then soon after even Eminem was using her voice (Stan). Dido's scintillating blend of music not only shows high class but also tantalizing style. Still early in her career already she is being compared to singers like Sarah Mclaughlan to Jewel. Watch out ladies this girl is sure to be some fast competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"make room for dido","review":"amazing. if i had to put it into one word, thats it. i always listen to rap music, never once have i listened to another genere of music in depth like this. a few of my friends have introduced me to her and i was like wow shes really good. when i heard a track called \\"thank you\\", i knew that eminem had sampled it for a track on his album called \\"stan\\". and thanks to dido, that song is probably his most popular song to date. but thats not all shes worth let me tell you. her voice & inspirational lyrics will bring up comparisons to artists like Sarah McLachlin, The Cranberries, and other soul artists, but she has a certain edge to her that will keep her ahead, mystery.the theme from roswell is also on here, and none of the songs are lame. not convinced yet? well then pick up the album and become convinced because she will take you away, like she did to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music for a Relaxing Day","review":"I ordered this CD with just the reviews in this column to go on. I had heard the song \\"Here With Me\\" on the show \\"Roswell\\" and had always been intrigued by who sang it. Finally I started hearing it on the radio and found out it was an artist named Dido. I listened to some samples of the other songs on the album and decided to go ahead and order it. I'M SO GLAD THAT I DID. This album quickly became my favorite to listen to in the car and at work. Her enchanting voice captures you with it's first syllable and you won't quickly be let go. The first few tracks are the best in my opinion. Then as the album goes on I do think the later tracks are a bit weak, but her talent shows promise. I can't wait until she makes a new album. I'm interested to see in what direction she heads to next. I encourage everyone to order it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen for a Long Time!","review":"Though this is Dido Armstrong's first album, she sounds like a seasoned artist. Her music is Lilith-esque, soft and well rounded with a penchant for higher meanings. Those meanings are put forth simply and clearly without, as in some cases, becoming childish. There are few albums that I can listen to the whole thing. No Angel ranks up there with one of the few I listen to all the way through, and its as good as Fumbling Towards Ecstacy-Sarah McLachlan, Harbinger-Paula Cole, When The Pawn,Blame it On Me-Alana Davis, End of The Summer-Dar Williams, Walking Wounded-Everything But The Girl and John McArthur's, HIDDEN. The tracks on the album are not only beautiful, but addictive, and once you hear them you'll never get them out of your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Britainia","review":"Unbelievable, this girl is HOT. I predict she will be around for a long time....... and shes Britsh, makes me proud. Unable to get a publishing deal in the Uk she had to go to the states and I am glad she did.

Outstanding tracks for me are Thank you, Hunter and Slide. You go girl!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, angelic and moving","review":"Here with me, is the song generally heard on the radio but chances are you heard Dido on the introduction to the WB's Roswell and her editted version of Thank you on the movie Sliding Doors. She has a sound that almost echos in a haunting sort of way that encourages you to pay attention to every sound she makes. A great CD for those who enjoy Sarah and Tori."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I really enjoy her music. All the songs on the CD are enjoyable to listen to with lots of emotion not only in her voice but in the music. The songs are not obnoxious or lude. I like the subjects and contents of the songs. The songs are rich and I find that they invoke emotions, memories, or day dreams to the rhythmn of the song. Thats why I rate this CD a 5. I wish she'd produce another albumn. My favorites on the albumn are My Lovers Gone, Isobel, and Take My Hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"Dido is simply incredible. Her unique voice is relaxing and calming. I can't imagine anyone not liking dido. Dido is really for everyone whether you're into rock music or classical music. For example, I, a Limp Bizkit and Blink 182 fan consider Dido one of the greatest singers. There is not one song on this cd that i don't like. they are all unique and emotional, I've even cried while listening to some of the sadder songs. Dido's song THANKYOU has an awesome beat and great lyrics. THANKYOU is also in Eminem's song STAN, Dido and Eminem (although it sounds odd) are fabulous singing together. This is perfect for listening to after a hard day, it will cheer you up. Trust me, this cd is certainly worth buying. DIDO ROX!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dido is Amazing","review":"I first heard Dido when i was drunk and the song \\"here with me\\" just stuck with me.

If not for being hooked on the weekly series I doubt I would have stumbled across this jewel, but I am so glad I did. (See - television IS good for something!) Very few artists display such versatility and soul in their first CD. I hate to compare her to anyone, but when I try to describe her to others, I say she reminds me of (okay, yeah) Sarah McLachlan, Julia Fordham, Enya, and Suzanne Vega. Her voice is like silk, her lyrics powerful and her music is absolutely haunting. \\"Here With Me\\" alone is worth the price of the CD, but it's just the beginning of a stream of sensual songs, my favorite being \\"My Life\\" - the best slow dance song EVER.

After the reviewers there generally said it was better.....hah couldnt be worse.No Angel, no passion, no strong songs, no emotion, no insight, no sign of life. Ok My Lovers Gone is starting to get there. But its all too much for Dido and she slips back down the slope into the bland pit again.I know Eminem is fond of trying to steal choruses from outrageously anodyne stars, Sir Elton and Dido are two. I suppose its his way of being ironic, who next, Donny Osmond or Barry Manilow?All I can say is if there was a talent/emotion/invention fight between the Red Team; Dido, McLachlan, Dion, Carey, Enya and the Blue Team; PJ Harvey, Amos, Orton, Nova, and we'll throw in a gamble Pink.

Try this book, you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"I grew up watching the movie for this book over and over and over. When I realized it was based on a book I immediately went and bought it. The author helped in making the movie so many of the lines from the book are in the movie (I could hear the characters voices in my head as I was reading).The book revealed so much more character depth and the fact that I am now older allowed me to see more than just the entertaining story. There is a lot to be said about one's quest and path and the journey along that path. It is the monomyth yet with more insight.In addition to this it is just a good story. I rarely read books more than once but this is one I most certainly will revisit and read to my children (when I have some)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic fairy tale","review":"The Last Unicorn is generally a good book. It's a very typical fairy tale, though, and anyone who does not enjoy old-fashioned books will either be dissapointed or bored. It's a good book for pre-teens, as younger children usually cannot understand the story and older ones tend to scorn the usual fairy tale. All in all though, I enjoyed the book and, if you explain the book to your children, may be a good book for bedtime reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Absolute Favorite Book","review":"This is the type of book you think, \\"What if I had never discovered this story? I can't imagine my life without it.\\" I read this novel over twenty years ago, and I can honestly say, I love it just as much today as I did the very first time I read it. It's a fairytale for all ages, and if you want to fall in love, this is definitely your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS THE MOVIE.","review":"First of all I would like to say that the movie version of the book is great. The book however is not so good. The book begins very slowly and I lost interest, so I stopped reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"The book got off to a rocky start. It became better during the part where the Unicorn meets the wizard. Then, almost a chapter later turned on a downhill course. I stayed up reading it until midnight hoping it would turn out better, but I was thoroughly put out with the end. Sure the wizard has a happy ending, but the Unicorn is forced to go around the world for eternity, knowing she is different from the rest of her kind. I found it a waste of time and wonder why many think that it is \\"'Extraudinary'\\" Unfortunately, 1 star is the lowest rating on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"This is the most beautiful story ever written. Every child, and adult for that matter, should read it or have it read to them. The movie is wonderful too, but it's only a sampling of the touching and truthful language of the book and misses important pieces of the plot that add to the beauty and inspiration of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaks your heart while making it soar...","review":"I've now read this book twice, and I've started to read it a third time. I never ever read books more than once, even when I think they are excellent. This book never fails to make me cry, even though it seems to lack great tragedy. This book is simply so beautiful that it makes you cry. On the surface it is a child's story, but beneath the fairy tale exterior lies a testimonial to truth, love, life, and lost innocence. Do not read this book and let the deeper meaning evade you. If you enjoy this book I highly reccomend the animated movie version of it, which is also remarkably beautiful, while leaving out some important details. Also, I'd like to inform other TLU lovers that a live action movie is in the making and will be released in Fall/Winter 2003. This version will not be made after the original animated movie, but will be more thoroughly based on the book itself. I, and other fans, are eagerly awaiting its arrival."},{"rating":"2","title":"ladder to the last unicorn","review":"I'm not typically a fan of science fiction or fantasy. Generally I think this plane offers enough material for me in my quest for readables. This book however, is a delectable indulgent, lonely, beautiful experience. It took me years of reading between the lines of the movie before i finally opted to open the book and I was predictably smitten with the prose form. Within the book i found a thousand treasure troves of what i had loved and sought after from the film through childhood and adolescence. Each familiar character and scene commands new evaluation in the book. There are many scenes and subtexts and sensations not present in the film which I now deem essential parts of the whole. I recommend slow digestion with a calm mind and a willing heart. its a book worth committing to for a deeper understanding of that other plane so rarely glimpsed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Highly Recommended","review":"A mythically beautiful Unicorn, as all Unicorns are, embarks on a quest forothers of her kind after overhearing a conversation between huntersrelegating her species to extinct/legendary status.

Beagle's prose blew me away. He uses the most gorgeous, enchanting descriptions without losing pace, and is the most cliche-free writer I've ever encountered. This book is older than me by a decade, and yet comes across so fresh and new, you feel as though you're witnessing a miracle. I recommend this book for anyone who loves fantasy, and especially for anyone who wants to write fantasy. Peter S.

But still beautiful.Peter Beagle can't really be compared to any other author -- people who write negative reviews of TLU seem to have been expecting something different, more of a standard fantasy, or something like LOTR. (Don't get me wrong -- I love LOTR. But just because it's fantasty and TLU is fantasy doesn't mean the two are going to be anything alike.) The only other author I can think to compare Peter Beagle to at all might be John Crowley. Very unique, moves at his own pace, has a very distinct style (of writing and of plotting and characterization). If you love him, you love him, and if you don't like him, well then, you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A world-opening book","review":"I read the Last Unicorn when it was new and I was 18. I had never read such an illumination, a fulfillment, an enlightenment. It helped me grow. And then there are the small moments - the butterfly, fluff-headed yet brave and of inestimable help; the Mr. Gick moment; the cat moved to speak - all embroidered this glorious story.I returned to this book over and over across the years. I discovered Peter Beagle's own telling of it on tape - one of the best audiobook performances, in my opinion. I continue to marvel at how good this story is. It is one of the great works of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining, but a bit of a let down","review":"I'm a fantasy fan, and picked this book up because of it's popularity. People had kept asking me if I'd seen the movie. And if I ever did, I don't remember it.The unicorn was an interesting character, but became a huge let down and bore when she was 'turned'. I won't spoil it. I found myself expecting more depth to the story, and wanting more background and tales on it's creatures. But there was very little.It felt like a partially finished manuscript that had a thread of a good idea.I had to ~make~ myself finish it in the hopes that it would redeem itself. Which it did not. I will not be recommending this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shipping and even better price.","review":"Great shipping and even better price. Easy transaction and promt response. Will recomend to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Identity Crisis","review":"Beagle is a gifted writer and the story line is original with great potential. Unfortunately, the telling of the story can't decide if it is fantasy or parody. Or perhaps it is parody and I wanted it to be fantasy. Beagle builds beautiful images with his prose only to topple them with flippant dialog and pointless actions. The ending is completely unsatisfying. Throughout the story, tension builds over the Red Bull, the nemesis of the unicorn, but when a confrontation takes place, the scene dissipates benignly and the story coasts to a bittersweet end.There are many elements here to enjoy, so it is worth the read; just don't expect too much. If you're looking for good fantasy, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...to have loved a unicorn.\\"","review":"This is a beautiful, haunting book about a unicorn in search of her own kind, who have vanished with barely a trace.

The characters were not very likeable and they didn't even seem to like each other. I came very close to not finishing the book after the scene with the butterfly. This book appears to be written in medieval times, yet the butterfly is talking about a \\"sale\\" and \\"all things must go\\" and singing \\"won't you come home Bill Bailey...\\" I sort of got the feeling that the butterfly was on drugs - or maybe it was the author... I thought at the beginning that the Unicorn would be a character I could enjoy, but she turned out to be not very nice either. I don't think there were any happy people or animals in this book at all, come to think of it...but, to each his own. You should give the book a try if you are interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great.","review":"I don't know what all the hype is about over this book. It reads like a drawn out bedtime story which takes place in a world with no substance or history. It seems like the author just threw everything together, then made things up as he went along.

However, I was very dissapointed. The Last Unicorn can't even be compared with the aforementioned masterpieces. I don't know why so many people love this book. It is gloomy, depressing and very slow reading, almost to the point of boredom. That is all I have to say on the subject. Pick another book because this one is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Believe I Bought It","review":"Seeing how this book received such stellar reviews, I decided to buy the book without even reading it beforehand (I usually only buy hard copies of books I adamantly love), and boy, did I learn my lesson: People, popular doesn't mean GOOD!!! I couldn't bring myself to read beyond the sixth or seventh chapter, and now I'm mad at myself for wasting money. I'm sure this book was mean for children who tend to have a limitless imagination and overlook things that lack logic or reason, because I read this at twenty-one, and couldn't find anything fascinating about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest fantasy stories ever written","review":"There is no better artist of the written word than Peter Beagle.

I hadn't read it in years, and found it just as enthralling as it was over thirty years ago.But I was surprised at how difficult it was to ignore the presence of the Red Bull...I mean, the energy drink, which kept diluting the serious and mysterious fear due to Haggard's bull. I've come to terms with my last name, and the connotations recent acquaintances attach to me because of it, but I was sad that such a great piece of literature had been sullied by a cultural phenomenon."},{"rating":"2","title":"deserves more recognition(at least this 15 yr old thinks so)","review":"I have never before found a book that so delicately wound its way into my heart and left me wanting more, even when the ending wasn't exactly happy. No other ending would have made so perfect a fairy-tale.Beagle himself admits to its fairy-tale status with his allusions to stereotypical characters such as \\"hero\\" or \\"witch\\", etc, and, I think, gets away with it by taking it far deeper than any other story I have ever seen. He guides each character gently across the chessboard of the story by showing a subtle futility in crossing fate mixed with an intriguing web of emotional interplay that is entirely unique. Schmendrick, Molly, Amalthea, Lir, and even Haggard have complex, colorful personalities that contrast wonderfully with the darkness of their circumstances and surroundings. Each one has a predetermined part, but it is theirs to play.Read it, I think you'll LOVE it.

An easy 200+ page read, and simply amazing for fantasy and non-fantasy enthusiasts alike. Some stories are beyond great, they're masterpieces; and this is truly one of the most uniques books amongst fantasy novels.

The Freddy Jones Band is one of the Best Bands ever. Their music is soothing and intoxicating. Based in Chicago, the band beautifully blends rock with a hint of country. Smash hits like In a Day Dream, The Puppet, One World, Dixie Dynamite has provided an amazing base for this group. I suggest investigating other Freddy Jones CDs such as The Freddy Jones Band, Lucid, and North Avenue Wake Up Call. If you get a chance to see this band live DO IT!!

I would like to say however, Kian and Nicky where have you been hiding those voices? your lead vocals were equally as good if not better than the other 3. 'What aim i doing without you' has good lyrics but boys your voices need to be showed off in those ballads we all love so VERY VERY much, especially Kian and Nicky.A refreshing change, next time stick to your own material and make the album truly your own.

The standout tracks are QUEEN OF MY HEART, BOP BOP BABY, I CRY, WORLD OF OUR OWN, WHEN YOU COME AROUND, WALK AWAY, and Sarah McLachlan's ANGEL but all of them are good!!

You have to wonder how someone can get a book like this published. The author is a journalist, but even that is usually not a disqualifying factor with a book on military history, or any sort of history for that matter. Journalists, after all, deal in fact also.In this case, however, the book is filled with factual errors, and you get the idea that the author sometimes missed the point of a battle or campaign that he was recounting to you. Given that he's so often mistaken about what happened, it's not much of a surprise that his interpretations are going to be poor also.All of this leads to my final conclusion. I would avoid this book at all costs. I don't get rid of any book that's non-fiction, usually, but this one's going to the used bookstore. I expect them to reject it, and I'll probably wind up giving it to the library, who will overprice it in their book sale at $1.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"More author's blunders than the military's","review":"If you believe that the Comintern (\\"Communist International\\") was a pact between Nazi-Germany and Italy (and Japan) AGAINST the Soviet Union, this book will be nice reading for you.

There is some of that happening in the remastered version but the loss is not significant.The 69' release is noisy and musical.

Fresh out of the box, it could BARELY shred 5 or 6 pages... and even then it sounded like it was dying. Heaven forbid I try to shred one of those credit card offers with the flimsy, fake credit card enclosed -- instant jam.Long story short: this shredder died on me after about 15 minutes of shredding. I never put more than simple junk mail into the slot. No staples... and definitely never \\"11 pages\\" at once. I'm taking it back to the store.Why on earth would a company advertise 11 page shredding for a product when it can barely accomplish half of that?

Not in the salacious sense, but Ethan Travis has no way of knowing her close-held secrets. He saw, instead of an avenging angel, a lost and vulnerable soul who needed his unique talents to rescue her - almost as much as he needed her unconditional love to rescue him!Cloaked in dark and dangerous appeal, Ethan Travis wore his whispered title of \\"the Demon of Alsatia\\" well. And Sarah Hunter was drawn to him with a mad intensity. But it was futile, she knew, for even a man with a past could never truly desire a woman without a future!\\"I could not put this book down.

Excellent story--good plot lines--sensual sex scenes--tortured heroine & hero. Everything WE read romance for. The story stands on its plot & its two main characters--Sarah & Ethan. When \\"the misunderstanding\\" occurs (at the end) neither the story nor the characters falter.

It's hard cover and the pages inside are detailed with little personal pictures and descriptions of Anakin's thoughts as he grows up in the Jedi Order.What's wonderful about the journal is that each of Anakin's memories are detailed enough to see and read, but not overpowering that it takes up so much space that there is little room for a personal journal. I, personally, have used it to write short Star Wars fan-fiction stories for my younger sister and have had plenty of room (and pages) to write them. It's almost been 10 years later and she still cherishes it like no other memorabilia!It's an absolute must have for any Star Wars fan! It is so worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Writing","review":"This was a wonderfully edited version of some of the best writing Douglass ever wrote.

One of the best Frederick Douglass books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"For die-hard collectors only--a mercenary cash-in on Sellers' talent","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer that Peter Sellers deserves so much more than this.It is indeed a cut-and-paste, fast-paced collage of fleeting moments from a slew of movies which are not even identified as they are being shown. At the end, the characters are identified, but not the movies with which they are associated. Of course, most people will recognize the Clouseau character or Dr. Strangelove, but there are many hilarious moments here that will not further the knowledge of anyone who isn't already well-acquainted with Peter's VAST repertoire of films.What it does have, are a significant number of clips from The Case of the Muckinese Battlehorn, an early rarity that also stars Goon Show fellows Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe. For that alone, the die-hard collector may find it worth owning. Otherwise, I would recommend The Unknown Peter Sellers over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL, TRULY AWFUL","review":"Like many other reviewers for Scanpan pieces/sets, my experience with this cookware has been awful. I've tossed a complete set out after just four years of use. I'm aware there is a warranty, but why replace bad with bad? Besides, the process for warranty replacement has less appeal than a root canal. It's a joke.YOU REALLY OWE IT TO YOURSELF to check around on the Internet for consumer feedback/reviews on this overpriced and overrated cookware. Again and again you'll read about how the nonstick surface eventually discolors, then forms little bubbles, the surface degrades, then finally loses all its nonstick qualities. Take the time to read customers' 1-star ratings here on Amazon for both sets and single pieces, and you'll read the same thing over and over again.

Org. purchased one 11\\" Sauté pan 6 yrs. ago 1 1/2 yrs. the store where I purchased stated that they had these issues due to their reuse of scrap material in the production process. They replaced the pan for me without having to go through Scanpan. 2 yrs. later it happened again; this time the store would not replace stating that they no longer carry the brand... I did get the product replaced through Scanpan after getting a RA and mailing back to them. 2 yrs. later I have the same problem AGAIN; I just got off the phone to get a RA emailed to me.A drawback of this pan is having to get it replaced every 2 years. Positives are it's a quality pan and the return process isn't the worst I've had to deal with.

They would not take it back either because it came from a third party so amazon wasn't involved but did the brokering of the deal. Anybody what a my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trip through primal lands.","review":"Mari Boine brings the ancient to life in this CD of primal ballads, chants, and sometimes soft, sometimes strikingly harsh vocals. It starts off with the deep chanting of \\"Gula Gula\\", a great introduction to this path through the wilderness of the north. After this, several softer tracks blare through the fog, with Mari's voice going from the most intimate notes to a shrill cry from deep within her throat. The seventh track \\"Oppskrift for Herrefolk\\" is a suprisingly upbeat tune, and one of my favorites. While the songs are in Mari's native Saami, the lyrics are printed in English, along with a short description of Mari's career. This is a beautiful work, filled to the brim with ancient tradition in a modern setting, of untouched beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increible - We all like the video. Diego and the spanish track a PLUS","review":"This is my 3 yr old favorite, specially because Diego is included and provides more action with all the animal rescue. This video is great for kids that are interested in animals. Animal adventures has the Spanish Stereo (under set up options). It is \\"fantastico\\".

She watches each of them all the time. They have yet to fail us. She LEARNS so much from them. I don't feel as though they are babysitting her. Instead, they are teaching and entertaining her.

Public documents are quoted at length, but the writer's use of private communications as well as her own \\"take\\" on those Sisters who have changed their lifestyles are often unsupported.While Carey is certainly entitled to her views, the book would have more substance if the style were academic and her language a little less restrained in discussing groups whose actions reflect a worldview quite different from her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanted view point","review":"The book is very negative and slanted. It fails to take into account the numerous women who lived through the chnages in religious life and are living healthy, vibrant and God centered lives of prayer and ministry."},{"rating":"2","title":"sobering statistics","review":"Ann Carey deserves much credit for this carefully researched work on the crisis in female religious life in the USA. The statistics presented are sobering. The dramatic decline of teaching sisters from 104,000 in 1965 to fewer than 13,000 in 1995 is a major turn of events in US Catholic history. With the skill of a seasoned journalist, Ann Carey explores the reasons behind this 88% drop in just 30 years. While Vatican II called for an appropriate renewal of religious life, many religious congregations embraced forms of experimentation that were sincere but ill-conceived. Some went even farther and began to manifest open resistance to ecclesiatic authority. For those who are trying to understand the sources of conflict in the post-Vatican II Church, this book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year old loves it","review":"My son is only 2 years old but he loves this book.

I have no problem with dark humor but a little irony would be helpful. The acting, direction, and writing here are strictly amateur hour. When the high point of a film is Susan Tyrrell's account of a depressive welfare mom then you are in trouble. As for the aforementioned problems with the images breaking down at the film's midway point and then stopping altogether it's all true. Don't waste your time or money on this DVD because it's not worth the aggravation. Cheezy Video, indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for swing","review":"Brian Setzers guitar and vocals coupled with poor production dround out the rest of the musicians. I wonder if there is actually an orchestra backing him up? Save your money. Buy Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Bill Elliot Swing Orchestra, Cherry Poppin Daddies, Royal Crown Review, Colin James, any album by any of these artists is better than this and you can actually hear the other musicians. I liked the Stray Cats. Somehow his style does not suit this music. Setzer is basically a solo act. I get the feeling that he is not comfortable sharing the stage with other musicians. For me a one man swing band just does not work. I traded this CD for a David Wilcox. Nice CD, powerful raunchy guitar and vocals and he doesn't call it the David Wilcox Orchestra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frantic lounge music, with touches of rap & techno","review":"This is wild lounge music, with Techno, hip hop and rap.

Please? I really love swing, and had heard some of B.S.O.'s stuff, and so thought I might go ahead and try out the CD. What a dissapointment. They do covers of classic Swing songs (i.e. \\"In the Mood\\") that were pretty good to start with, and ultimately end up murdering any musical integrity that has managed to survive through the ages. What's more, this album kind of rotted out any remaining, vague desire to go Swing dancing that was left over from when it was popular.

The problem here actually isn't in Setzer's steller performances, it's in the lame song selection and the production, which is just overproduced majorly. Take the rap solos out, and teh corny, beat music out, and dumb filler songs liek Americano(which wasn't even cute when Sophia Lauren sang it).

I may only be 21 years old but I know the difference between swing and Elvis Presley influenced rock-a-billy. And Brian Setzer isn't a swing or jazz artist he's a oppritunist who's using the swing fad to make a few bucks, the only problem is he's not playing swing. Another thing Gramps tought me the dofference between good music and bad music, just listen to Jelly Roll Morton & His Red Hot Peppers or Fats Waller & His Rhythm Makers, or Louis Armstrongs Hot Fives and Sevens, then listen to Brian Setzer, you'll realize how talentless he really is.Please try these 4 CD's 1st:Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives & Sevens Volume One (Columbia) Jelly Roll Morton & His Red Hot Peppers: Chicago 1926-28(RCA) Fats Waller-The Joint Is Jumpin' (RCA/Bluebird) McKinney's Cotton Pickers 1928-29 (Classics)See for yourself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Brian setzer's Orch., but...","review":"Setzer and his band are sizzlin' hot, and he is my favorite swing band leader, however no matter how many times I try to listen to this cd, I just can't bring myself to like it. It is just too darn hokey, cheezy, commercial, and corny. In the Mood is full of energy, and could have been great without the \\"DJ MIX\\" club beat intro, and I find the rapping offensive racially. It sounds as though they are making fun of the rap genere, and mocking the race. Setzer's vocals never sounded better and hsi guitar playing is great, and band is smokin.

If, in doing so, he has incorporated a number of styles from a number or eras, where's the harm? Take a laxative and get over it! The bottom line is that this disk is fun, it's upbeat, and because of the number of styles he's melded together, it's totally unique. This is not just a retread, faithful reproduction or a 50 year old musical form. This is a completely new and joyous celebration of many of his influences.

I think musically it is a little below Dirty Boogie (Pennsylavnia 6-5000, and In the Mood are a little too commercial sounding)however there are some gems that can't be duplicated! The layout of song selections is excellent; slow tempo songs after a set of fast. I noticed that in Vavoom as well as Dirty Boogie, Setzer performs an instrumental and a ballad. These happen to be my two favorite selections on BOTH CD's. Setzer's vocals on Gloria are smoooooth.As for songwriting; Setzer has really improved since Guitar Slinger. Not that he needs improvement; songs flow better lyrically in Dirty Boogie and even more in VavoomAll in all Brian Setzer is my favorite artist...I can't get enough of that big band sound.

Brian Seter's Dirty Boogie Cd is a 4 1/2 star disc, maybe even a 5, however this cd, is just insluting comne on a rap on a Glenn Miller song??? Setzer was trying oo hard for commercial success, skip this, if you already have Dirty Boogie get his Christmas cd instead. Setzer can get away with dong \\"Elvis\\" sounding material, but he isn't Miller worthy. As always Setzer's guitar and vocals are wonderful thoughout, and the band is just a prop behind him, ehich is tight, but not allowed to stretch out at all(no solos, other than Setzer's guitar). Too bad he couldn't have skipped the Glann Miller rap tunes and stuck to his originals, rockabilly Elvis swing, or even Louis Jordan, Louis Prima or Louis Armstrong.

If you're idea of a good jazz sax player is Kenny G, you're going to think this Brian Setzer CD is swing. This is NOT swing music, it's insulting to anyone who ever liked jazz, dixieland or swing. Don't buy it unless you know what it is you're buying. Now you've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Same TUNE!","review":"no matter what cover Brian Setzer does or new song he comes up with it all sounds the same.this disc is no different.while the Stray Cats was cool back in the early 80's his take on Swing is way better than the other Groups but it like the others falls way short on Groove&Swinging.this Disc doesn't Speak Cab Calloway to me.it sounds more like Johnny Rivers or Ricky Nelson doing a Take on Bill HAley than any real Swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives Up to Its Predecessors","review":"Having seen Brian on tour weeks prior to this release, it sounds just as fresh on CD. Pennsylvania 6-5000 is a jumping track, similar to previous songs like Dirty Boogie and Jump Jive An Wail. Mack the Knife is an ambitious cover. Americano is fun at its best, and Gloria also stands out. Obviously, this cat still has a few lives left!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin'!","review":"I love the swing and big band sound, but I didn't settle down and really pay attention until a friend played the Brian Setzer Orchestra for me. Arrroooo! I love the new CD; having heard the originals of the songs he borrows and makes unto his image, gotta say I love 'em as much (the rap at the end of \\"In the Mood\\" is a scream). While \\"pure\\" swing is cool and funky, Brian Setzer is audacious and spicy -- a sweet balance and a singular pleasure to listen to. He and his band are having a blast, and they take me right along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too shabby!","review":"I don't liek this as well as dirty Boogie, becasue of the rapping and techno, bit it's not too shabby if you can overlook it's many flaws, like a stupid song called \\"Ride Like Thunder\\" and a lame rendition of \\"Americano\\" from the cary Grant Sophia Loren movie \\"Houseboat\\", this isn't a 3 star cd because of the hip hop and techno, it doesn't mix well with swing. It's liek adding tobasco cauce to your martini. Buy Dirty Boogie and if ya can't get enough and are a diehard fan, go ahaed and blow $18.00, it's not really worth it, but if ya liek Setzer you can forgive him for his dumb mistakes that ruin this cd fro mbeing a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Me Wrong...","review":"But this book sucked. I gave it 2 stars out of respect for the author. I started with 2nd Assassin, loved it, then it was Gathering of Saints, love it, then Wisdom of the Bones, and I loved it, but this early work by Hyde just didn't cut the mustard with me. I found it slow, and awkward, and it felt as though it was written by a novice. I didn't finish, barely got half way, which is pretty rare for me. I've got to really dislike a book to not finish. If I had read this book 1st I wouldn't have read any of his work since this one. Glad I didn't start here."},{"rating":"2","title":"KNEE DEEP IN GIANTS","review":"I LOVE THIS CD..Romantic, clever a feel good collection of smooth tailored songs. My personal favorite \\"Coffee in Bed\\" it just stays with you. I feel I should be on a beach somewhere with a special someone sipping umbrella drinks. I highly recommend it. Also would make a great first date gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bar set!!!","review":"Very cool looking design and high quality!! Each tool is heavy and made to last, and has a good feel when using them. The jigger is very convenient to use since it is attached to a rod. I haven't seen it designed this way before, but it sure works well (just pour and twist!) The spring on the strainer seems extra fine, and thus allows less small chips of ice through than the average. The ice bucket is on the small side, and will need to be refilled frequently if you're making a lot of drinks, but it sure looks good! All-in-all great quality, functional, and artisticly designed to be a great conversation piece. Everything you need to set up a home bar except a shaker set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riot - releases another world class production","review":"After another excellent release I continue to wonder the reason Riot does not receive more attention from the world of hard rock. Mark Reale's musicianship has been, and continues to be, on par with the most respected guitarists of the genre. Mark's compositions on \\"Through the Storm\\" are no exception; each song is an amalgam of expert timing, arrangement, and harmony, and if you are a fan of rock songs with soloing guitar this album will certainly delight. My picks are tracks 1,2,4,7, and the tribute instramental to George Harrison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very beautiful images","review":"This book contains very beautiful women posed very nicely. The images of the women in the empty room are great. I think the photographer replicates himself a little bit in the book, displaying images that are so close to eachother that they are not diiferentiated from eachother well enough. if they were suppoed to show a series, then it doesnt come off well enough.There are some amazing images where I found myself staring at the beauty of the image."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Judge This book By It's Cover!","review":"As my title to this review suggests the photos inside are not on par with the cover! this is a nice book of B&W photos of parts of the female form, some are even in focus. The majority of the models inside are thin to the point of their ribs show even when not streching. most have small breast and do not have the almost hourglass figure of the cover model. Sure there is a small precent of the models inside that are as well proportioned and pretty as the cover model, but it is a small precentage. Also in the cover shot the surroundings/landscape inhances the female form and does not that your attention elsewhere, whereas inside many of the photos the surrondings detract or even obscure the model. I am a photographer and I can appreciate most any part of the female form as the subject in a photo (although I prefer the whole more), but many of the photos here look as if taken by a high school student the frist time they ever photographed a nude model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the cover","review":"I purchased this book hoping for some inspiration for my art. Most of the photos are so far away, the model isn't much more than a speck. Other ones are so dark and/or blurry that you can't tell if it's a woman or a man. The cover is probably the best photo. I plan on reselling my copy. I was very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a strong work of photography","review":"I have never had any issues with skylight pubication. this is no execption. Many photo feel 'real' and not staged. A very fine collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was so interesting to hear the stories behind all the Christmas songs. The only reason I rated it a four is that not all the song lyrics are included. Even when it is a song I know by heart, I liked reading through the words, especially songs that have several verses that we don't always sing. Very sweet, easy to read, and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add it to your research - but don't use it as a sole source.","review":"Another reviewer points out the this author seems to weave fairy tales into his narrative. That's exactly the problem. There is often a core of fact in what he's describing - but he weaves about half a page of fact into a fanciful two and half pages which he crams with spiritual extrapolation. He adds a subtext to almost every story that is his own agenda...putting thoughts into the composers head and words into their mouth which are obviously fabricated. It's frustrating - because if he had gone with \\"Just the facts, Maam\\" it would have been one of the most useful books out there on the subject. Instead, when i'm researching a carol, I have to cross check it with several other sources to make sure he hasn't completely invented part of a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories Behind the Best Loved Songs of Christmas","review":"Enjoyed the book. Didn't order a miniature but it worked out. Arrived in great shape. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Urban Myth and history","review":"\\"Stories\\" is the right beginning for this book. I bought the book to save myself some time doing internet research and found I have to do it all anyway because the author simply repeats the urban legend stories that are cute but unfortunately often very inaccurate.Read it for fun, not history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some new stories","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this little book, reading a few chapters at a time through the season. Some of the background stories are well-known; some more obscure; all well-written and enjoyable. Lyrics to each song are included in the chapter. Will be rereading this each Christmas season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"I still have the last two chapters to read, but overall, it was very helpful. I feel like a burden has been lifted regarding Halloween and my family. There are several great suggestions to be able to minister on Halloween instead of turning off the lights and hiding ;) The chapter on some of the history of Christian martyrs and the moving of All Saint's Day to Nov. 1st was interesting, I didn't ever really understand where All Saint's Day came from before reading some of it in this book. Overall, it is definately a topic that needs to be covered in prayer and decided by your own family what the Lord wants you to do...and when our hearts want to do what is best in glorifying Him, I don't think it necessarily has to end up looking exactly the same as someone else. That is what I took away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed this book leads people astray from the truth","review":"The verse the book is 'based' on is so far out of context--go to your Bible and read what the rest of the passage says. It does not say what this book purports. Study the Scripture for yourself. Halloween is NOT a Christian holiday and it never was! This book not only distorts history but seeks to rewrite it to justify comprosmise within the church. Do not be deceived! Extreemly dissapointed with those who promoted this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do Christians insist on Twisting History???","review":"This book is full of utter nonsense. Halloween is an ancient Celtic PAGAN holiday, that celebrated the end of summer. It was there LONG, LONG before Christianity was even invented. At least have the guts to admit that your just stealing a PAGAN holiday and appropriating it for your uses if your going to write a Christian book about it. Sheesh! When will people ever learn that just because something isn't christian, that doesn't make it evil. If you celebrate Halloween and are Charistian at least admit to yourself that you are celebratin a Pagan holiday. If yoyu like Halloween then celebrate, that doesn't make you evil, and it doesn't mean you've turned to Satan, Pagans don't even believe in Satan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy of a Murder not widescreen .","review":"The only reason I got this set was to upgrade to the widescreen version of Anatomy of a Murder. So much for that idea. I already owned all three films. I sold my originals and ended up dead even as far as the cost is concerned. Still don't have a widesceen version of Anatomy of a Murder. The films are still excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The house on the beach...","review":"I enjoyed the suspense of this novel, \\"The Beach House\\", and it is a good, descriptive, thrilling book. It may be I should have rated it a five, though the book did not quite hit the nail on the head, and thus a four. There was something missing, some of the suspense may have been tuned down a bit - perhaps the narrator gave us too many clues.The end was an astounding one, though, and as a four-star book it has plenty of the necessary suspense contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing!","review":"This book is confusing to me. It kept going to the past then the future, and on, and on, and on. It started out okay. But I really didn't get the ending. This is short because I really don't have nothing to actually say about it. I don't really recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"This book is my favorite R.L. Stine story because it kept me wondering what was going to happen next. The book is about some friends who love to go to the beach. But the problem is, someone is killing them one by one. What I love most about this book is that it consists of two different time periods and they join together in the end. I would reccomend this to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of drama","review":"Beach House was one of the most suspenseful books I've read in a long time. Almost all of the book was interesting. If you like R.L. Stine then this book is for you. This is a difficult book to understand until the end. It has a lot of drama in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE LITTLE THRILLER 4 THOSE SUMMER ROAD TRIPS....","review":"This book proved to be a great read for my 3 hour trip to VA Beach. Interesting & thrilling storyline for those who like R. L Stine teen thrillers... even if you're not a teen. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books ever written by R.L. Stine","review":"I read this book some years ago and I can still remember this 'horror' story. This story was so scary and so well written that to this day I still find it one of the best books I have read. The ending was SOOO good but also very sad and very frightening. I know I am being vague but I don't want to reveal the story to you. You've got to read it for yourselves and experience a true horror story. This book rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing.. UNTIL the horrible ending.","review":"The book had me zooming through the chapters non stop. I stayed up late wanting to know what would happen next, who was going to die, and who the killer was. Sadly, the ending ruined the whole book for me. It went from murder mystery to sci fy. The book took a 180 and went down hill. I was very disappointed with the outcome. The ending just ruined the whole book. I was upset that I wasted my time to get that stupid \\"Back to the Future\\" ending. Major disappointment. Just plain stupid.."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I bought this book as a Christmas presant for my dad, and he absolutley loved it. The book arrived earlier than I expected and was great qualilty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Choice Unless Aiming For >90%","review":"This was the most useful test prep aid I had. Most importantly, I would say that if you are considering taking a Kaplan GRE course, don't do it. You're better off just buying this book (and/or the individual verbal/math books). It covers the same strategies that the class does at a fraction of the cost. The only negative remark I have about this book is that if you are shooting for scores in the 9oth or 95th percentile (e.g. a combined verbal/math score of 1400 or above) then this is not the book for you. Frankly though, I haven't seen any books that accomodate for this sort of goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"This book was incredibly helpful, and by studying out of this book for about two months, I was able to get a perfect score on the GRE's without taking any classes or buying any other books or study materials.I memorized all of the word lists that they gave, and they also have a handy appendix in the back of the book with little math tricks for math that you might have forgotten or don't know the shortcuts for.I also found the CD-ROM extremely helpful because of all of the practice tests and extra problems, in addition to the lessons. Although the interactive format was very cheesy at times, it still kept me more focused than if I were just reading through black and white pages of text in the book.Definitely a great buy if you don't want to spend the money to take any of the expensive (thousands of dollars!) courses, but still want to get an amazing score!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Testing software terrible","review":"The software that comes with this book is aweful, especially for the math section. For example, all of the practice math sections are 30 minutes long with 30 questions. On the real GRE, you will have 45 minutes for the math section with 28 questions. As a major test company, they should at least know the basics about the exam.Additionally, there were many math problems that were either impossible to solve (because they mistakenly did not give you enough information) or actually had the wrong answer at the end. I bought this book and the Princeton Review book and liked the Princeton review book and software much better. It helped me score an 800 on the math section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is OK, software is pretty bad","review":"I found the book to be OK, but the software is awful. Kaplan seems more interesting in making something flashy (sound effects, graphics) than something that works. Also, there are problems with several of the math questions -- the information you need to solve the problem has been left out. Pretty inexcusable, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: CD-ROM does NOT work for Macs","review":"Kaplan's test strategies are decent, and since the GRE is computer-based test, I bought this book primarily because it comes with a CD-ROM of practice tests. As an educator, I know that it's crucial to practice under test conditions. I thought this book was the answer, except that the disc is for Windows only! This is the 2007 edition, and I'm very dissatisfied with the useless coaster this book comes with--it would have been halfway decent of Kaplan to include a disclaimer somewhere on the cover or in the Amazon description informing the buyer that they chose to ignore a significant (and ever-increaasing) segment of the population, known as Mac users.I also bought the 2006 edition of Barron's GRE test prep book, and while they do have a disc that works for both PC and Mac, it only works for Mac OS 8 (!). Apparently, the people making these study guides think that Mac users are not applying to grad school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Choice","review":"Do not buy this book. Go for the Barron's book. It has a huge 3500 word list and detailed mathematics review section. Plus 5 full length tests. The kaplan book has only ONE test. Use the ETS software (2 tests) and Sheppard GRE/SAT word games (do a google search). Stay away from this book. Just not worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ezra Stoller does it again!","review":"Ezra Stoller is an expert in the art of photography.

When I saw this pan, I thought the size was perfect for cooking smaller ammounts. I was correct. It is also dishwasher safe, a real plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little pan ever!","review":"The first time I used this pan, I wondered how I managed all these years without it. It heats evenly, it handles nicely, nothing sticks to it, and it cleans easier than any pan I've ever used. The size is perfect for so many things and especially nice for single-portion cooking. This pan is a good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched on First Use","review":"The first thing I cooked in this pan was a grilled cheese. I used a silicone spatula to turn it, and a sponge to wash it afterwards. As I was hanging it on the hook where I would store it, the light caught the bottom of the skillet and I noticed two scratch marks in the surface. I used it again a couple of days ago to scramble eggs. When I was done, I saw more scratches on the bottom. I would not purchase this pan again, nor any pan in this line. I have used only silicone spatulas. The reason I'm not giving it one star is because the food didn't stick. I have no expectation of this skillet lasting long, because it makes me wonder--if there are marks indicating the surface has been scratched, where did that material go? Into my food? Very disappointed in this product and will not purchase another."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 yrs and still cookin'","review":"I've had my ScanPan set for 10 yrs. It's all I ever use to cook on top of my stove. It still heats evenly, food still doesn't stick, never warps, cleans up quickly and easily. The only problem I had was with one small frying pan and I really think one of my kids cooked on high with it several times, although they wouldn't admit it. It still cooks fine, but is a darker color. I will never have to buy another set of pots and pans. I love the fact that I can use metal utensils and not worry about scratching it or ruining the finish. I highly recommend this cookware for anyone, but especially families whose children cook also."},{"rating":"1","title":"scan pan","review":"This is not what we wanted and I am going to return it.I will try to find another item to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"This is the worst wax I ever bought. Couldn't find Rain Dance, so I splurged on this wax, thinking of how proud I'd be after giving it a real shine. Wow was I disappointed! It looked totally flat afterward. Didn't have time to fix the problem, so all winter, I looked at the flat paint, with zero water beading, and dirt just sticking to my car. I purchased Rain Dance via Amazon last week, and boy what a difference. Water's beading, and I hardly recognize my glossy car. Do not waste your money on Meguiar's Tech Wax Paste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wax","review":"I bought like 6 of these tubs cause i got a great deal at a local store and this stuff is awesome.

People looked at the car and thought it was new. The only real drawback that I can see with this wax is that you can't get it on the black plastic trim and it does leave white residue (wax) in the crevices. This is to be expected with a paste wax . It applies easy and removed much easier than most waxes. The shine is slick , deep and appears to be hard. Time will tell how long it holds up to the elements. It is December here in VT and I hope it will hold until at least April when I can wax it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go for the looks!","review":"It worked for about 30 minutes (turning on and off). Then I decided to use it in a different location, plugged it in and it lasted for 2 minutes and that was the last time I was able to get any heat out of it. The manual says that it may have turned off because of its overheating protection. But it clearly didn't get hot at all! The instructions say to turn it off from the outlet for 10 minutes and then plug it back in. Well, it turns off after 20 seconds again! I would never rely on it. Returning it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a reliable product","review":"I have owned this heater for about two months. I purchased it for the thermostat function, but the temperature sensor is so inaccurate that it causes more headaches that it saves. The manual says it will turn on at one degree below the set point and off at 2 degrees above set point. But if I set the temp to 70 degrees, the best the thermostat function can do is heat the room to about 77 (uncomfortably warm) then it shuts off until the temperature drops to 65. When I called customer support, I described the problem and was told it sounds like it is functioning properly and if I don't like it, I should return it. --So that is what I am going to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning examination of anger and bitterness","review":"I found this to be much more satisfying than Aeschylus's Libation Bearers. Focusing on Electrca offers a much more nuanced examination of bitterness and what it means to be exiled from those one loves. It also ties up some of the loose ends about the murder that Libation Bearers sort of glosses over. Euripides gives a real sense of the grave magnitude of these crimes. The speech where Electra condemns her mother is one of the most powerful statements of personal anger I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your While...","review":"The first thing that strikes you about the CD's sound is the clean, crisp production. There's no muddiness here. The sonics are balanced, with no exaggerated highs, mids, or lows. Both the producer and the mastering engineer definitely knew what they were doing!The 12 songs are varied in style. The band is extremely tight and polished. The singer has a great rock voice. It would be unfair to draw comparisons to a known band. The sound is fresh and current, yet vaguely familiar. The band is not afraid of harmony and melody, and can definitely carry a tune.Each of the songs creates its own atmosphere. All are unique in their own way. My personal favorites of the 11 tracks on the CD are \\"Cold Tears\\" and \\"Lethal\\". I kept going back to relisten to these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for...","review":"I also thought this was an exercise CD.

In my experience there is certainly a gender binary, but it doesn't manifest the ways he suggests. He says that people either want to be dominant or submissive in relationships, but that is only true for a very small portion of the people I've met. Reading it only a small part of it rang true for me. One concept he stresses in every of the 50 chapters is \\"male essence\\" and \\"female essence\\" and by the end of the book I am still not sure I fall into either one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Insight, from one of the worlds great spiritual thinkers.","review":"I found this to be perhaps the most important book I've ever read in understanding My woman !Further - it has provided amazing context for me to improve my relationship & take many aspects to a new level including our sexual intimacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Must Read* For EVERY Man, Everywhere","review":"Stop reading this review, and BUY THIS BOOK.I've read hundreds of books in my life, well over 50 on psychology and relationships...

If this was required reading half of the failed relationships out there would either work themselves out or be cut off too early to be a problem. If men took the responsibility to understand themselves and how women view their actions we would all be much happier.

I looked forward to reading it based on these recommendations. However, what I discoveraged was an extreme look at relationships through the eyes of a post-modern spiritualist point of view. As a Christian, I found a lot of the book irrelivant \\"spiritual\\" fluff. There were a couple items for thought but overall, I thought it was a pretty sad attempt at understanding God's creation and replication of Himself through man and woman and the amazing intimate relationship that was intended between the two before the fall. I guess it's always good to know what humanity at large is subjected to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Author and Thinker","review":"Dang! This book offers page after page of straightforward insights that most wait decades to acquire. I'd say he's got things nailed down pretty well except that some of his suggested sexual technique is a little too psycho-modern for me. Yet there's definitely something for every man and it offers a slough of legitimate and original philosphy that can be readily interjected into daily life. The way he numbered and titled his maxims and then accompanied each with a brief but thought-provoking explanation was well crafted and is reminiscent of some great philosophical work. Guys, I don't know if we'll ever figure chicks out, but Mr. Deida sure gets us moving down that trail."},{"rating":"2","title":"This woman prefers superior men","review":"This book teaches men lessons not readily given in our society - how to be a MATURE man, and how to provide the contrast needed for a passionate relationship. I recommend this book to everyone, but especially the men who act like children in their marriage, the ones who don't step up and have lost respect from their wives. I realize mutual respect is a two-way street, but it might as well be the superior man who takes the reins and sets a new precedent. In most relationships, the female energy partner is like a burbling creek - they want their male energy partner to be a solid boulder.

I got it for my boyfriend, and he is enjoying it so far. The book is very sexual in nature but not overly so. The author is trying to enlighten men to the art of controlling their sexual desires and creating something meaningful and productive out of them instead of letting them take control. I would recommend this book to any young to older male who wants to learn more about his inner desires and feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Pushes a Few of our Boundaries","review":"For a conservative, I would say that this book did get a little outside of my comfort zone, but I found that what he had to say was rather powerful.

While some parts ring true, i.e. if my love life stinks , nothing feels right, other parts of the book will get men on the wrong track for a woman like me. I find his chapter on the reliability of what women say ridiculous. Though I can get quite emotional, I generally mean what I say and do not do a 180 degree turn five minutes later because my mood changes.I have read two other books of Deida's. I believe he may have some insight into the male psyche, which makes sense since he has one, but for understanding women or more complex men he falls short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Well explained, easy to read, short chapters, thoroughly enjoyed this and read it quickly! Good stuff! Would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfortunately, Deida's understanding of most women is correct","review":"I was in a relationship for eight years which ultimately failed, and this book is to some degree showing me where I went wrong. Although I would like to think that there are some women out there to whom his his teachings don't apply to, I think most women are as irrational as this book suggests. Its a great book to help you understand most women and how to ignite their sexual attraction for you. What I find unfortunate is Deida is reminding me that that the burden of generating romantic interest falls on men, but if you want a girl in your life his is a good book to teach you how to keep the attraction alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it...","review":"I listened to the audiobook version based on the recommendation of a friend of mine. I had high hopes for it but was very disappointed. I'm not saying the book has no value, but what I am saying is that the value in this book could be condensed into a very concise 8-10 sentance paragraph. It is so diluted by pseudo-scientific psychobabble that the author ends up repeating himself over and over and ultimately ends up actually saying very little. For a book about being a better man this guy sure does talk about emmotions in the most feminine way I can imagine. My wife wouldn't even talk like that. It's also worth noting that in the audiobook version the author sounds like a very feminine Ben Stein. Only worth noting because it's hard to take advice on being more masculine from a guy that sounds like that. I found myself working very hard not to discount everything he was saying. There are much better books out there about being a better man."},{"rating":"2","title":"service and quality","review":"My order arrived quickly and for a used book it was in excellent shape, looking like new.

It's not all woo-woo: there is probably some truth to some of the author's assertions -- but really, I think this book is squarely aimed at men like the author, who are after the sort of relationship that just may not be possible. Probably great for people who have liked his other books, likeThe Enlightened Sex Manual: Sexual Skills for the Superior Lover, but really not so much so for those who think that, though men and women are different, they are still the same species.

While not offensive, the work is intellectually vacant and smacks of unsubstantiated pop psychology wrapped in short, superficial chapters. The single and valuable message within the book can be summarized here: True intimacy requires a strong sense of self combined with the ability to open oneself to the risks and passions of another human. If you can believe that, save yourself the cost of this book and research elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-Opener","review":"Deida is something else.

Just try and be that way a few years into a marriage with a woman who is always raging. Sadly, some women are simply too irrational for the average male to be able to understand and deal with.

As a man, find your true direction in life and live life to the fullest, giving the world and \\"your woman\\" all your love and gifts. Live in accordance with your calling and sexual and relationship success will follow.Add in a bunch of new age baloney about spiritual energy flows and living life as a giant erection having sex with the world and life in general and there you go.

The book describes the relative positions of the masculine and the feminine and offers practical advice on many issues faced by men in modern American society.These insights appear to be based on a metaphysical premise and yet are more insightful and accurate than books based on psychology. What is lacking is an explanation of just what metaphysics shaped his beliefs. In other words; we are told \\"what's what\\", but not \\"why\\". While I doubt seriously that anyone who would read a book on this subject would find the concepts expressed here offensive, it would be interesting to know just where they come from.If you can read this book with an open mind, you should find it fascinating and informative.

The chapters on allopathic, traditional, and alternative treatments are informative, also a chapter on the 'old wives' and 'witches' of history, but overall the forecast is grim. Chapters with flippant titles such as \\"Sex and the Single Crone,\\" \\"Misery,\\" and \\"All Your Own Fault\\" seemed more polemical than informative.

I like the idea of having three timers in one, and frequently need this feature. But this product falls short: the ringer is so low that it can be hard to hear it if there is any other sound in the room. The buttons are hard to push. The operation is certainly not intuitive - poor design to need a 'mode' button to get from timer 1 to timer 2 to timer 3. Even though my last OXO timer died far too quickly, I will purchase another one, because its design is superior.

Will NEVER buy a Polder item again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute junk","review":"In the store, wrapped in its packaging, this timer looked so impressive. Sadly, it turned out to be absolute junk. The latch on the battery cover is so cheaply constructed that every time I grabbed the timer off my refrigerator (it has a magnet back), the cover would break off and stay stuck to my refrigerator. The alarm sound can be described as unpleasantly piercing and, as others have mentioned, weak. Sometimes I barely heard it. Battery life was also a problem as the timer has no \\"off\\" or \\"sleep\\" mode. It just stays on until the battery goes. After all this, my timer lasted about a year before it stopped functioning completely. Please learn from my mistake, don't buy this timer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"I, too, have had nothing but trouble from this timer. It worked fine for the first month or six weeks, although as others have noted the buttons are excessively debounced and have to be pressed and held to function.

Even the kids now know how to remove the battery cover, take the battery out for a few seconds, and replace it to reset the timer.

I owned a West Bend triple timer for 20 years and you could hear the alarm from another room. With the Polder, you can barely hear it standing next to it. If you had the radio on, you probably would not hear it. West Bend's new unit does not work like the previous one, otherwise, I would have purchased theirs. Also, the Polder unit display cannot be turned off and it wastes battery life. The West Bend display could be turned off.

I fell in love with this product in 2002 and it's all I've used ever since. I used to get horrible breakouts, and with this this product line (Pure Zone) that all came to an end. It's really really sad that companies stop making things once they're perfect. Wow, was I happy to see that someone still had it available, here on Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great.... if all you need is the lid","review":"I ordered this item. It was listed as being sold by Amazon. I picked up my package tonight only to find out that all that was shipped to me was the lid ! I can't be sure it is the right lid for this fryer since the fryer wasn't with it, not that I can use the lid without the fryer anyway. Now it says it is out of stock. I'm thinking it was out of stock when I ordered it even though it said there were 4 available. Guess you can't rely on what you see here. I am VERY disappointed. I called and am told I will be refunded. That's all well and fine, but right here before the holidays is not a good time for games. It makes no sense for them to have only shipped me a lid. It would have been a much more appropriate to have contacted me and let me know there wasn't really anything available. Instead, I get to deal with this hassle. Yay me !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pan, great customer service!","review":"This was a gift from my Dad shortly after I was married. It's 8 years old now and still my favorite and most used pan. I was cooking with it today when the lid accidentally slid off of the counter. The pyrex didn't break, but the knob did. I called Scanpan and they offered to ship me another free of charge. Wonderful service. LOVE my Scanpan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Quick Detailer on The Planet","review":"I've used all of Meguiar's detailers in the past and was hooked on \\"Final Inspection\\" for a long time. I saw this one, then the price, and passed on it more times than I can count. I took another look at it recently and said to myself, \\"okay, but this stuff had better blow my mind\\".Results: Mind blown.This product is, in my opinion, the very bench mark against which all other detailers ought to be measured. The lustre it adds is not even second to spray waxing the vehicle, it lasts at least twice as long as the next best detailer in line, it hides imperfections, it makes washing the car go faster and minimizes water spots when doing so, dust comes off with a car duster with far more ease and with no need to use additional product for the next couple of days, etc etc etc.Another home run for Meguiar's. Good stuff and worth every dime. I'm tempted to admit that I'd pay more for it but I don't want Meguiar's to get any ideas......oops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfactory","review":"There was some confusion between the title I thought I was ordering and what I actually received.

We purchased and used one-item-each of all the other brands when we were ready to replace our original Club cookware. All the others were returned because they didn't perform as advertised especially regarding non-stick without Teflon.Scanpan works the best for sturdy, even heat, non-stick without Teflon, stovetop cookware.This is just the latest addition to our collection.For in-the-oven cookware, Pampered Chef takes the prize. Its on the expensive side but this is a classic case of getting what you pay for - great product with a lifetime guarantee."},{"rating":"1","title":"all our scanpans are sticking like crazy","review":"All the scanpans we have are sticking like crazy and are very difficult to clean. I emailed the manufacturer many days ago and received no reply. I wonder what \\"Life time warrantee\\" means.I found that a good stainless steel pan or a good cast iron pan will work much better in not sticking."},{"rating":"1","title":"ScamPan","review":"I received my Scanpan in good condition, and thankfully read about the PTFE in this pan on the Scanpan web site before using it. The box the pan came in brags of how \\"green\\" the pan is yet never mentions the PTFE in the non-stick surface. According to Scanpan web site, heating this pan to high temperatures (those commonly used for stir-fry) could harm my birds, who fly to the kitchen to join me while I work. I doubt this pan healthy for humans, either, as I have read PTFE can interfere with female fertility. If I could I would give this pan zero stars. I returned it and received a full refund.I next purchased Cuisinart GreenGourmet Hard Anodized Eco-Friendly Nonstick 12-Inch Stir-Fry Wok with Glass Cover from Amazon--what a difference! Love this pan. Cook everything in it from bacon and eggs to you name it, every day. Will write a review for this pan sometime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel","review":"I learned from TV news that the traditional non-stick Teflon coating cookware can break down under heat or scratch off and cause cancer. Therefore, I have not been using them at all. I had changed to all stainless steel cookware last year. However, the food stick and can got darken easily (also cancer causing) and I have to use a lot of oil for cooking. I then saw there are ceramic coating pans on the market. I bought a few of the Scanpan ceramic titanium coating pans and also a few of the Healthy Legend ceramic coating pans and pots with the German ceramic coating call Greblon. They are both very good even they are expensive. Overall, I think the Healthy Legend cookware is slightly better and the non-stick property works better after some use. There are other on the market but their prices are even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Danish Wok","review":"We have an entire set of ScanPan and consider it the best cookware we have ever owned in terms of function. When the stir fry pan was introduced we had to have one. This is now the pan of choice for stir-fry and for cooking things like chowders, stews and chili. It conducts heat evenly with no hot spots, it cleans up easily with a paper towel. There is really no reason to put it through the dishwasher since it wipes clean with a sponge or paper towel. It is absolutely the best non-stick surface with which we have ever cooked.We highly recommend the ScanPan brand of cookware and especially this multi-function pot."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my ENDURING favorites","review":"Mine is over 15 years and still looks and works like new! This is a uniquely valuable pan. You can crank up the heat to high, cook quickly with assurance of smooth even heat, then rinse it under the fawcet to swish absolutely clean while it's still hot. AMAZING. No risk of warping or damage. No problem with sticking. And because of its density and superior conductivity, NO problem with burnt foods. While I love my LeCreuset, it can't handle high heat. Scanpan is a natural for things that like high heat. If you haven't tried this brand yet, this pan would be the one to try first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains PTFE--same as Teflon","review":"I bought this pan thinking that I am buying a non-stick pan without Teflon. While the health issue became questionable concerning Teflon, I am willing to pay extra to be safe, and at the same time still enjoying the non-stick feature. The product description somehow suggested that the pan is non-stick because it's ceramic titanium.Well, I was wrong, and I didn't know I was wrong until I accidentally browse the company's website and read its FAQ. In their FAQ, it says: \\"The ceramic-titanium particles become one with the pan at that point. A subsequent application of a specially formulated PTFE provides the nonstick effect.\\" PTFE is the problematic element of Teflon. Well, I wish the company discloses this information somewhere on the product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Stories","review":"Beautiful and elegant short stories which transported me to another time and place.

They responded to my request to buy a copy with a thank you for interest, but licensing restrictions prevent them from being able to do so. Who knows who hold the licensing rights? Anyone reading this know? Maybe the Rhubarb crowd can convince them that it would be worthwhile to print it and sell it. Can Amazon use its muscle to help its customers with this?

With the \\"Gilligan's Island\\" spoof they overreached themselved, as they just didn't have the computer power available to them to satisfactorily render some of the effects they were going for. Roman Catholic and Orthodox parents will probably object to the gratuitous shot at the sacrament of Confession that occupies the space between the two segments. It's almost worth seeing for the introduction of Pa Grape, but since his personality undergoes a complete transformation in later videos you don't lose much by not seeing him here.

Also, there's no built in strainer; if you're going to buy a shaker you might as well get one that has the strainer built in.

The problem with this scale is two things: Once the \\"empty\\" container is placed on top of the scale, the scale jumps off zero, therefore you will have no idea how much food to put in it to weigh the amount you want. Secondly, there is no way to know how much is 2 ounces, 3 ounces, 5 ounces, etc. because of the many lines which makes it very difficult to figure out anything. So don't frustrate yourself.

Now that I have had this scale, I realize children's fascination with such a kitchen tool.

Another complaint is that once the timer has rung, if I don't clear it by pressing the minute and second button at the same time while holding the timer stable, it starts all over. I have to press for each minute of cooking time I want, and I would prefer to have an hour button than a second button.

I bought a few pieces of the other non-stick three years ago at the same time I sent several Scanpan pieces in for warranty replacement (again). The other/new set of cookware is going strong and is not in need of replacement. My scanpan is now a very expensive, though nice, set of camping cookware.For the record, I hand wash my cookware, I don't use non-stick sprays, I only use nylon/plastic or bamboo utensils, and I never use high heat.

I loved Left of the Middle, and its been 4 years since that cd was released. None the less I was excited to hear the new stuff. And the waiting was so worth it.The first single That Day, is probably one of my favorite songs of all time. Its different from what the radio seems to play every day. And its a shame the radio stations in the States never played it, because its truly amazing song. Her next single, Wrong Impression, is doing far better, and the song itself is a great song.White Lilies Island is a great cd. I think that Do You Love is one of the more stronger tracks on the cd. Its probably my favortie, besides That Day. Other good track are Beauty on the Fire, and Satalite...and the rest of the cd. Its just a really good cd. The cd just flows along with mellow music, and its worth getting the import, because it will probably be another 2 months before its released here in the States."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Year's best, period.","review":"Splendid sophomore effort by Ms. Imbruglia.

Perhaps I wasn't ready for this album, when I listened to it when it first came out. So I guess if you don't like it at first, then give it some time and it will more than likely connect with you later. The lyrics work into you, the production actually sticks pretty well, and her voice is obviously good as I mentioned before.

It hasn't left my cd player these past few days, and every time I listen to it, it gets better and better.Natalie Imbruglia's voice has definitely matured since her previous album, and it makes her songs that much better. It isn't quite so breathy, and it has a rich, pretty, melodic quality to it.My favorite tracks are That Day, which has a lot of almost-spoken word, Beauty on the Fire, which is a little more techno than usual, and Do You Love? which is almost catchy, for Natalie.This album is definitely worth the money, and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sophmore Jinx Here!","review":"As the other reviewers have said; the wait was definitely worth it! This is my favourite release of the year so far. One thing that I will say about her CDs though is this: they grow on you!

The ones that become my favourites are the ones that I didn't initially like that much.Everytime I listen to this CD I find something else to like about it. Her singing is stronger, the songs are better, and a lot of thought went into this one. The time off for her was very well spent. She could have capitalised on her last CD and just rushed out any old thing, but she took her time and did it right. I hope that you give this a chance.

Anyway, Nat's sophomore offering is not at par with her debut album \\"Left Of The Middle\\", no powerful alternatives like \\"Torn\\" or \\"Smoke\\" just plain, and boring handicrafts from Natalie's group of dragging songwriters and composers. She co-wrote some of the songs and there are only 2 standouts, \\"Wrong Impression\\" and \\"Beauty On The Fire\\". Good thing, these two had been released as a single but never gave justice to the slow and minimal success of \\"White Lilies Island\\".

With this, of course, the welcome return of Ms. Imbruglia, \\"White Lilies Island\\". Slow, moody, and yet still breezy and catchy, this is definitely a solid follow-up. It doesn't out shine the previous album, yet it has it's own moments of greatness, including the internationally released singles \\"That Day\\", \\"Wrong Impression\\", and \\"Beauty On The Fire\\". The latter two of these are excellent tunes, strong and catchy. Much like the last album, many album tunes can stand up with their single companions, some of the best of these including \\"Sunlight\\", \\"Do You Love\\", and \\"Talk In Tongues\\".

First, this balm is waxy and heavy. Not quite as bad as old-school chapstick, but pretty close. It made my lips feel gummy and almost (but not quite) sticky. I also find the ingredients list questionable, because the vanilla scent (\\"vanilla extract\\" on the label) is very strong and extremely artificial; additionally, I felt a mild stinging with repeat applications. I do have sensitive skin that is prone to eczema and seborrheic dermatitis, but I've never reacted to vanilla fragrances or true vanilla (by which I mean diluted vanilla essential oil).

When she learns she only has three weeks to live, she decides to follow her dreams and live her life.It is true that many people do not try something new or to try and obtain their dream for fear of failure.

Even though it was sad in parts, the happy moments that Squirrel experienced made up for it. The narration was so real that I felt like I was there, and Squirrel's voice was perfect. It allowed me to feel her emotions, hear her thoughts, and hope that everything would work out for her!I hoped that she would find Bone the whole way through the book. I recommend this book to all second graders and above. If you don't love dogs, you will after this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dog's Life","review":"The book to me is a very touching story. Squirrel goes through hardships and suffers from the lost of her brother, mother, and friend. Squirrel seems like a brave and confident dog. She learns to live on her own and live without humans.

He had the best time with this and we were able to pass it on to his cousins who enjoyed it for a couple years. It wasn't perfect, it would hang up occasionally and you had to have the right size keyboard to attach it to, but overall I thought it was one of the best computer games out there for children. They always see us at our computers and want to get there hands on them so this was a great idea. They were in front of a screen getting hands on without wrecking havoc by pressing things they shouldn't. I started with my grandson in my lap showing him how to work it and it didn't take long until he was able to work it all on his own. I now have three more grandsons that would love this but it isn't available to work with Windows Vista and/or 7. There also was a Tonka version with it's own playset for the keyboard which was great also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My 4 year old son loves Thomas.

The playset that straps onto the keyboard is not always cooperative, and once that issue is addressed, the software itself is difficult to follow for my son or for me! He became extremely frustrated after a few tries and it wound up being a very costly mistake. Avoid this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration","review":"OK, so it's the day after Christmas and I sit down to play this game with my 5 year old son. He plays for awhile, but keeps getting stuck - so I try. I had a horrible time with it too. We couldn't get the track to move where we wanted it to go, couldn't get to the other games, etc. Although my son is 5, he's been playing on a computer for 2 1/2 years already and I'm no computer slouch myself.I found the game poorly programmed with marginal graphics compared to other products. If I had to do it over again, I'd pass on the fancy set-up for the keyboard and software to purchase another Jump Start or Rescue Hero game.Just one moms thoughts...."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite","review":"I rate this 5 stars based on how much my daughter likes it relative to other software. The keyboard-top module makes the difference.My daughter (4-1/2) received this for Christmas, and has enjoyed it immensely. She's been a huge Thomas fan since she was two, and already had the Railway Festival and Trouble on the Tracks games. Those were diverting for a while, but this one has captivated her. She'll spend as long as we let her driving along, carrying out tasks. It's very mechanical-- not a great deal of creativity or strenuous problem-solving involved-- but she enjoys it a great deal.I view it as a good complement to her other favorites: Freddi Fish, PuttPutt, and Dinosaur Hunter, which involve some problem solving. Sometimes you want to stretch your mind, sometimes you just want a nice day in the country, loading barrels at the harbor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Game - Didn't work!","review":"The CD loaded fine. I strapped the plastic device to the keyboard as indicated and although the \\"pegs\\" that come down from the device to activate the keys did come down,for some reason did either not match up or did not protrude far enough to activate.

I had also purchased the Tonka Dig N Rigs Playset which offers the same concept and it works fine..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"BEWARE! I am very disappointed. My son loves trains and Thomas, and when I ordered this I thought he would love it. Everything is properly installed, but the playset will not work. I see on the Infogrames website that the FAQs say to use the keyboard if the playset won't work, but what fun is that for a 4 year old - he wants to drive the train! I know it is not the configuration of my keyboards - I have tried it on 2 keyboards. Both times, the playset will press the keys enough to type the characters when I have it in Microsoft Word, but it will not respond when it is in the Thomas program.Do NOT show this to your child until you are sure it will work! I'm sure glad we tried it before Christmas! I sent an email to Infogrames (mfgr) on 12/22/01 - as of 1/19/02 still no response.And once you've opened the software, no refund!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for my 3 year old!","review":"This was a Christmas present for our Thomas-crazy \\"just turned 3\\" son and he has loved it! I place the set on our keyboard and he completely takes it from there. He quickly mastered all of the games, but he still enjoys going back and trying them again and again. We have quite a collection of children's software, and this ranks among the best so far for his age group. I suppose from reading the other reviews, you simply need to make sure that your computer and keyboard are compatible with the game and that your child enjoys challenges that require a little more attention to details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague instructions, difficult to exit","review":"My 3 year old son enjoyed \\"Thomas & Friends: The Great Festival Adventure\\" and \\"Tonka Dig & Rigs,\\" but this game is too complicated for him to play.

This being my first album, I am extremely pleased with their culmination of ten years of brilliance in sixteen songs. I hear from others about an American Gramaphone-type release that wasn't included. I've never heard of it before, but I can imagine it is truly spectacular, given Reflections on a Decade. I find it sad that, being a high school student, most of my fellow teenagers don't listen to or appreciate this kind of unrepressible beauty. Even if you claim not to enjoy \\"new age-type\\" music, this is truly a masterpiece! Personally, my favorite songs are \\"Distant Thunder\\", \\"Going Home\\", \\"The Good Brown Earth\\", and \\"GreySky\\", though there is not a bad song to be found on this album.

I do like the first 5 chapters though. For a more modern approach to the Goetic operation, one might look at the \\"Book of Solomon's Magick\\" by Carroll \\"Poke\\" Runyon. But one might question why resort to Goetic magic at all when there are better and far healthier systems available. Mr. Savedow writes at the end of his book that he intends to write a book on Enochian magic. That would be interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete","review":"The Demons are free.

It features two smart spunky kids, Scooter and Mary, who stumble on some counterfeit money, but nobody believes them. Using their brains, the kids solve the crime without the help of adults. Along the we we meet two funny, not-too-bright thieves--Jake and Lefty--who can't seem to do anything right. There are several other colorful characters in the story, a wonderful look at middle America (Iowa), and lots of fun scene throughout the story. Older kids can read it themselves, while parents can read it to younger ones. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counterfeit Detectives","review":"\\"Counterfeit Detectives\\" by David Krumboltz & Mary Dixon is a pleasure to read. Set in an Iowa small town, \\"Couterfeit Detectives\\" took me back to the days of innocent childhood when, as adventerous children, were able to express our free spirit. It was easy to identify with ten-year old Scooter, the town's leading, and only, boy detective. When Scooter stumbles across a bag of counterfeit money he sets out, with the assistance of his sister Mary, to solve the mystery and bring the criminals to justice. I especially enjoyed the humor, the compatible relationship between Scooter and Mary, and with their friends. This is a book that entertains the young reader and makes adults wish they could be a child again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Insightful","review":"I really liked the first chapters of this book, but It kept saying in the later chapters that niether is our religion not a religion but \\"not a viable way of life.\\" Otherwise, its an insightfull look at what most xians see in us. why they might be angry at us.

Not only does Jimenez add character depth to Caesar's accounts, but he brings to light likely points of exhageration and ommission on Caesar's part.This book also provides a background for The Civil War. I thought I understood the conflict between Pompey and Caesar, but after reading this book, I see their dynamic in a whole new light. Read this book BEFORE you read The Civil War and AFTER you have read The Conquest of Gaul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victories in Gaul: Caesar's achievement","review":"The author had carefully traced Julius Caesar's war against the Celts in a yearly basis.This book is a useful supplement to the book written by the protaganist himself - 'The Gallic Wars'. As we read through the book, we can see how Caesar managed to subdue the fierce Celts, and unknowingly, managed to postpone the Germanic tribes invasion of Gaul for the next 300 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"In depth review of the Gallic Wars and Julius Caesar","review":"This book examines Julius Caesar and his conquest over the Celts during the Gallic Wars. The author has done much research from ancient and modern sources to try to distinguish fact from fiction in regard to Caesar's \\"Commentaries on the Gallic Wars\\". The book also examines the backdrop for the action, the political intrigues back in Rome.I thought the book was a good insight into Caesar's conquests. The author sites his references so that readers can go back study deeper into the Gallic Wars and the politics of Rome. I think this is a good supplement to anyone interested in Julius Caesar and Rome during his lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie","review":"This movie is good.

Asking people, \\"hey, want to play Pass the Pigs?\\" is always evokes an interesting response for those who haven't heard of the game. The way the pigs land determines the amount of points, if any, you get for that roll. You can keep rolling, but part of the strategy of this game is knowing when to say when because if you continue to roll you could \\"pig out\\" and lose all the points you accumulated for that round. I love the ultra portability of this game. The only downside of this game, if you can call it a downside, is that I can't take it on camping trips because I can't rely on the picnic table being level.

However, I think the product is too small. When you \\"roll\\" the pig die, they land in various positions that really all looked the same to us and were difficult to compare to the various pictures in the instruction which you are to compare to and determine what type of \\"roll\\" you made.

I do not recommend. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's PIGTASTIC!!!","review":"I got this game a few days ago, and I LOVE it!!! The only problem is that the pigs' eyes rub off easily.But this is barely noticable, and that defect aside, it's a great little bang for your buck (...) I played it with my brother, a 3rd. grader and it REALY helped him with addition and subtraction. I played it with my father and we loved testing our luck.

I will stick with a deck of face cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful for all ages","review":"Pass the Pigs is a variation on Yahtzee, with the fun little pig dice being thrown into different combinations with various point values.It's a great game to take on trips, or to pull out when entertaining children of various ages; everyone can enjoy it. I've played with children as young as 4 and had a fine time.Although the rules of the game rely on the player taking a turn until he or she determines that luck is about to run out (at the risk of losing all accumulated points), this can easily be modified (esp. for younger children) so that each player throws the dice in turn and records points.The educational value is in using mathematical skills, and pattern recognition skills, for younger players.This game is very durable, but it would be a sad day indeed if the little pigs were ever lost. Luckily, all the parts (pigs, score pad, pencil) fit into a neat little case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small package, great value","review":"I really like this game for a number of reasons. First, because it's fun for kids AND adults to play, second, because it is very small and portable, and third, because it does require some math, giving it some educational value. It is also a quiet game requiring only a flat surface on which to roll the pigs and enough light to see them. It's nice that there are also so very few parts to lose (2 pigs,pencil,& paper-all in a case).We keep a set in our car, and when we are waiting to be seated or served at a restaurant, it's a great way to pass the time. It also makes a nice little gift for friends going on a trip. I only wish that I had thought up such a simple, but clever game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Contagious","review":"From the first time I played I was hooked.

That is, if the whoops of glee don't disturb those dining nearby. You \\"roll\\" two little rubber pigs like dice and get points according to how they land. A Snouter (pig lands on his snout) is worth more than a Sider (pig lands on his side), for instance. The educational part is when you have to count up the points. The scorekeeper is supposed to add current points to accumulated points, which can be tricky but good practice for the younger ones. Children as young as three or four can enjoy this if playing with adults. For them, you might want to change the rules -- one bad throw can wipe out a player's entire score. Just ignore that rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the kids","review":"but the adults took it over and had so much fun that it has become a tradition to play during the holidays when we are all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"It is interesting, fun and funny!

Throughout the year Jesse Bear announces \\"how he says *it*\\" each month. We don't know what *it* is till the last page, and by then, even I wasn't curious any more. The ryhming text is not always closely related to a season (September: \\"With clothes that don't fit and no place to sit, I say it with buttons today.\\") and won't make sense to young listeners.The illustrations are colorful and busy, and young kids will enjoy the activity.

Also, how can a woman write about how to please a man? That's like a man writing about the pains of giving birth. Good primer, but really needed to offer better and more in-depth examples. A smart woman would be frustrated over the sex part being glossed over. Cooking, cleaning, etc. are not what makes a man feel manly. Next to survival, man's 2nd instinct is sex and the book does not do a very good job imparting this belief to its readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right","review":"I read this book cover to cover in one night. It is written well and simply to get to the point. Many reviewers claim that this \\"takes you back to the 50's\\"... wrong!

Its an excellent book with loads of ideas if you feel your in a rut or just want to try something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty basic stuff","review":"For someone new to relationships and men and very little experience, this is a fair review of various aspects of relationships from communication to sex. But it is for all practical purposes mostly common sense or just scraping the surface. Don't expect to walk away from this book with any revelations on how to please a man. The first 1/4 of the book for me was pretty retarded to be honest :) The rest of it, well you could definitely learn more from gossip with your girl friends!

My partner and I are having problems with intimacy, and we are pursuing ways to 'fix' the problem. If one is new to dating and intimacy this book would probably contain helpful advice. A more seasoned individual will not find this book helpful, nor will it deal with the more complicated sexual situations in real life. The second point revolves around the fact that, in situations outside of the bedroom, the author appears to have mistaken the century, and advises women to be pleasing, personality-lacking, self-effacing 'yes people'. Although I agree with her point that we should always try to put our best foot forward, she is one step away from advocating a subscription to the June Cleaver fan club. I can't dissuade the reader from buying this book enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book drew me in as if I were part of the story, and then I could not put it down.

I'm a huge fan of historical fiction, and the author did a fabulous job of putting me in the story and truly making me feel as if I was in 19th century Australia. I feel as though I learned a lot about the Aborigines, and the characters became my friends.For the most part the story moved very nicely, although there was a spot or two I found a little slow. The reason I didn't give this five stars had mostly to do with the ending. I loved the message of the ending, but we never found out what happened with any of the other characters. I felt as if it never got wrapped up, except for with Joanna and Beth.The Dreaming is definitely worth reading, however, especially if you are interested in the history of Australia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something is missing","review":"Of course Barbara Wood is an excellent writer, at least for me, but in this book something was missing at the end of it, all the book was perfect, it keeps you reading, but when you finish, is just like that, you finished the book and you don't know what happened with the other people of the book, what happened with Judd? or Sarah? or Adam? or the last expedition to find her?As in all of her books, with this one you will learn about Australia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous pictures, and lovely ideas, but....","review":"\\"I was really surprised that the author stresses the use of stearic (animal based additive) and completely omits the additive vybar, which is a viable and most preferable additive to many people. Her creative ideas are sound but some procedures do seem to be altogether forgotten. If it weren't for the pictures and some of the projects I would have rated this book a lot lower. Beginners should not start here as they may be confused later by some of the things that were completely missing, or they may not get the results they want due to a simple lack of knowledge that should have been included.

This book covers so many topics, it can't go into any depth on any of them. For example, the author says seminars are a great way to get business but he offers only half a page on how to do them. He tells you how to get a trademark without discussing why they may or not be necessary. Also, there are way too many irrelevant stories about millionaires like Michael Dell (who cares how many square feet his mansion is?) and Jeff Bezos. If you already have a business in mind, you have to wade through a lot of chapters about finding the perfect business for you. However, if you haven't a clue about which business to start, the book offers only a surface idea of several home businesses.

That is just the beginning of the bunk this guy tries to force feed young America. This is propagand on the largest scale.
