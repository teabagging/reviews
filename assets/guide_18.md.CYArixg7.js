But this is not the one to buy. I purchased two pairs, one tore the very first time I wore them. Getting a response from the vendor and replacement pair took weeks of constant follow-up. I'm pretty sure if I had been less persistent they simply would have screwed me out of the cost of that pair. The second pair began falling apart a couple weeks later, but at that point I was not about to deal with the vendor again. If you want gel wraps I recommend looking into other brands - these Everlast one are cheaply made and not worth your money.

Don't recommend,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone needs to be fired for these","review":"I received a pair as a Christmas gift and the stitching between the fore & middle finger was already coming undone on the right hand glove.

Its a great idea but someone at Everlast dropped the ball with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart in no time","review":"I bought these to replace hand wraps. They fit relatively well and are somewhat adjustable using the elastic straps that make an \\"X\\" on the back of the hand. However, they are made of a combination of mesh fabric, foam rubber, and leather. The foam rubber started to tear away from the mesh material in less than 4 weeks. If the gloves were made of a more durable material, they would be great. I can't recommend them given the lack of durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"HANDWRAPS, NOT GLOVES","review":"as someone wrote before me a lot of people are making the mistake of using these as just boxing gloves when they are actually suppose to be a replacement to handwraps that go under the boxing gloves. as far as time saving goes they are great, i do mma so i switch between grapping and kickboxing a lot and the hand wraps always slowed me down and these took care of that. i would say they also provide almost, if not the same, amount of protection that handwraps do. although they are a little thicker then regular hand wraps i havent had any problems getting them into my gloves and using them, just a little different feeling to get use to. the only reason i dont give these a 5 is because i havent had them long enough yet to see how durable they are. but if you are looking for an easy fix to hand wraps like i was these are truly great"},{"rating":"1","title":"mismarked item and terrible place to purchase from!","review":"i bought this item in small because i am a woman, 5ft 100 lbs. the gloves are EXTRA small and uncomfortable. i contacted the seller MMA ONE STOP SHOP to exchange for a medium pair and they would not take them back for an exchange.this is the problem with online shopping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped after 30min","review":"I bought this with a Century BOB punching bag.BOB held up but the gloves did not.

Despite two stars in the lead that I simply adore, it falls miserably on its head. There are about 2-3 actual gags that evoke so much as a grin, and out of a full length movie that just isn't enough.While I highly recommend the original, you'd probably be better off skipping this wannabe farce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This movie is so hilarious. It tells the story of a man who got fired but is too proud to admit that to his wife.

Is it just me or when you watch this movie do you not SEE THAT Goldie Hawn has yet hit 35? And she's like 52 in this movie, she looks so good. Steve Martin...well, he's always looked around 54 or 55, even when he was in his mid 40's, he always looks older.

Martin's acting, as usual, is good, but even his good acting could not trump the poor writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"Embarrassing for the cast to be involved in this stink-bomb. It is the worst film involving Steve Martin that I have seen heretofore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity in all it's glory!","review":"All I can say about this movie is that it's...mediocre. It's not really funny, with a couple chuckles and smiles here and there, and the actors play characters that you can't help but hate. Steve Martin is, okay, but I've seen him in funnier roles. Goldie Hawn's character was showered with so much stupidity and idiocy that she became annoying and at times, unbearable. John Cleese dancing in drag did nothing for me, and it wasn't funny. \\"The Out of Towners\\" is not a terrible movie, I just didn't really care enough about it to make a real judgement. My friend liked it and bought it, so I laughed sometimes for his benefit. I thought about how much money he spent on it too, $30 to be exact, and thought that this movie didn't deserve to have that much money shelled out on it. I can't come up with a real opinion of this movie, only that it should win an award for most mediocre film of the year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Send in the Energizer Bunny","review":"This movie is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO STUPID!!!!!

I was ashamed for Steve Martin at this poor attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the Original","review":"If you've seen the original \\"Out-of-Towners\\" with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, there's really no reason to see the remake. Jack was so funny and put everything into his performance, but this time the humor just isn't there. The story is very rushed and it hurts the movie. For example, the couple leave Ohio, get on a plane, it can't land in New York, they can't find their luggage and are rerouted to Boston all in the first 20 minutes of the movie! And they altered the story a little, which cuts even more of the humor out of it. Like, instead of the hotel giving their room away, their credit card was decined. There's just nothing funny about that. Nor do I remember their going to a group in the hotel to talk about sex in the original movie! Making a remake of this incredible movie was a mistake. Or if they did want to do it, they could've taken the time to do it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny. No imagination shown here.","review":"The original screen version is far superior to this stinker. Isn't there anyone in Hollywood who can write comedy? Hollywood screen writers seem to be stuck on a constant diet of tired sex jokes and innuendos. This movie is a heavy bomber. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEIL SIMON PROBABLY LEFT TOWN","review":"Wouldn't you with your name attached to this pathetic movie? Of course Neil Simon had very little do with this fortunately. The original movie pretty much was carried by Jack Lemmon -but it had a certain charm. While no Odd Couple - Simon with the original one - did not need to be ashamed.Very few of the jokes work in this movie. For example, the bit where they mistakenly enter a sex therapy group, starts out funny, but ends up very unfunny. This movie really proves how very difficult it is to write a good comedy. My guess is they paid big $$$ for this screen adaption - yet the results look like a quick TV Movie script.Interesting thing is to look at each scene in this movie - and try to figure out how to make it funny.Once the film company had this thing locked and ready to exhibit when it first came out, one can only think of the famous words that Bernie Shaw of CNN uttered live on an actual CNN news segment last spring: \\"This is going to be a f....n disaster\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny for being so horrible","review":"Bleh! Ha Ha Ha! How pathetic! I watched this film only because I wanted to see how bad it really was, and I was not let down in the least. Goldie and Steve Martin go to New York together to rekindle thier marriage while Martin visits for a job interview . Both of them try real hard to act silly as they get into dumb predicaments, but Goldie really sinks it up with this film .She trys to be too much like Steve Martin , and the result is a complete lack of chemistry between the 2 actors.

The historians and locals interviewed are really well-informed and have a real sense of the city's history in the context of the much larger US history narrative. Some of the information in later episodes is repetitive, but the series does a good job of explaining the role of the mob in developing the city; the historical importance of Las Vegas dating from the 19th century (did you know the Mormons were important in the settlement of this oasis town?); and the changing times and attitudes in the US with regard to gambling, prostitution, drinking/prohibition; and most importantly, perhaps, corporate economic power.Though I've driven through the city several times, I've never been intrigued by it. Now I am, thanks to this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This DVD is very Informative. It tells from the start of LV to now. I liked watched most and am still viewing the rest.

I was delighted to discover this thriller still able to elicit fear and apprehension! When Telos, strong valiant giant Titan gets wind of a thief, his head turns so slowly to initiate the thrill of man vs beast battle. Greek mythology elements appreciated and audience has limited moments of peace in this action packed script. The rescued Caulkis woman was truly beautiful, exotic and created a different image of beauty for that time typical of blond, fair, and delicate. The comedic actions of the Harpies, Skeleton Army, and even Hercules were a special treat.

Sure, Ray Harryhausen was a genius and a pioneer in the special effects department but in today's world this movie just falls flat.

Fortunately, the image quality of the movie is way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the VHS!!!","review":"This film is presented in a cropped widescreen format, though it was an Academy Ratio release. The full-screen version on the flip-side is cropped down from the widescreen version, and shows less on all four sides! The VHS (or the Harryhausen-approved full-frame laserdisc) is currently the most accurately framed version of the film currently on the market. This is symptomatic of the notion that letterboxed is always better (see the DVD of Gus Van Sant's _Elephant_, which at least acknowledges that the full screen version is, in that case, the correct theatrical presentation), but this is letterboxed when it's not supposed to be! My source for this complaint is Video Watchdog, which would never advocate pan and scan, and points out that that's what this DVD *really* is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie from my childhood","review":"This wonderful film from my childhood was better than I remembered!

What starts out as a extremely ( putting it lightly ) snuff film and into a revenge plot. The Innocentz alone were enough to disturb most people, but the Smilies put it over the top. I can see with the stealth kills and how the killing of corrupt cops, is momentously provocative. Piggsy, Piggsy, Piggsy, you were the most horrific part, seeing half - eaten corpses, a man wearing pig skin and weilding a chainsaw ( an obvious homage to Leatherface ) and the atmosphere itself is... terrifying for most.

I've never been so absorbed by a game in my life, and if that makes me psycho, oh well. People who say this game isn't very violent are in denial, because they know their idea of what a great game is has been swept away by Manhunt's greatness.

What game is there where the game play throughout the game is always different? People say that all you do is hide. Yeah, in real life if you're in a situation where there's 1 of you and 100 of them who want to kill you, you're gonna hide also. That's if you even still wanna live after that.They give you different weapons to sneak up and kill guys. Bats, crowbars, nail guns, glass shards, hooks, wire, and eventually shotguns. There's parts where you lure guys into the shadows and you're aiming a gun to their head. Towards the end it turns more into typical shoot outs but the game is still good enough and you have to kill that man pig.

Stealth with REAL stealth assualts ( How annoying was it in MGS2 to never be able to do what you want to those annoying people! In this you can torture them!. Anything is a weapon, glass shards etc etc. Interesting story!. Good ending. Nice length. Pure fun. Its like plaing a murderer in a film!. Most violent game made!Bad. Not sure about replayablilty.

Crawling around executing people just loses it's pizazz after a while. However there are some good levels where the main objective isn't to kill. Like there is one level where you have a \\"friend\\" following you around. You have to keep the transient alive throughout the whole game. While you can send him into a \\"sleep mode\\", and goes into a shadow away from the Innocentz. There are many doors and you can not get buzzed in unless you have this guy with you.

You don't even have any real combos when you do have to fight an opponent. It gets old really fast.I'm quite surprised that with the reputation that Rockstar has, they would release a game of this low quality.

About 3 levels into the game, you can get a nail gun and stuff. After that you can get a Pistol, then shotguns(sawn-off's and regular),revolvers, and small handguns.

He uses Cash to kill gang members and anyone else Starkweather doesn't like. Cash has to sneak up behind the gang members and execute them. When this is done, the camera does a close up of the execution, and they are quite brutal. Cash is able to do 3 levels of executions white, yellow, and red. The darker the color, the more vicious the killing. Lots of weapons which include: plastic bags, knifes, wire, staple guns, sniper rifles, pistols, revolvers, machine guns, shotguns, and a chainsaw.

The killings are brutal and violent, people need to pay attention to the fact that it has an M rating. But as an adult, I can handle it. As long as you know the difference between reality and fantasy, you should be fine. If every time you play a game you go out in the real world and act out what you have seen in the game, then this is not for you. But I have waited a long time for violence to be so much fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit or Miss","review":"The main reason I had for playing this game was because I was a huge fan of the Grand Theft Auto games and was curios to see what Rockstar had come up with. I am not going to tell you what the game is about but rather what things are good and what things are bad about this game.First, this game needs a lot of dedication on your part if you want to play it. You cannot just sit down and play for a few min. like in GTA. I found that my average time for each level was about 40 min.Seconed, this game can get old very very fast. If you are not good at games where you have to be quiet and keep from being seen, than this game is not for you. It is one of the only games i have found where your enemies are as strong and ruthless as you are, so being hidden is important as hell.Overall this game is hit or miss. You love it or you hate it. But plese rent it before you buy it. If you dont have the time or patience to play it, than dont waste your time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Fun For 10 Minutes","review":"The problem with this game is it is alot of fun for the first ten minutes and than after that all u do is repeat the same murder scenarios over and over.

If u dont mind repetitive killing than u will love this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manhunt - Don't Be Caught Without It","review":"Stealth games usually turn me off. They're too slow and you end up having to replay a whole mission over and over again. Thankfully, Rockstar knows how to produce the best video games and rids gamers of this frustration.This game has a save anywhere feature which should be a requirement of all games. More importantly, there's enough gore to make even the sickest of sick people smile with joy. I thought I would get tired of sneaking behind bad guys and choosing how to kill them, but not so, especially after they've killed me several times. You just gotta love their screams of agony as you're separating their head from the rest of their body.Anyway, I give this game 5 stars and has made my top 10 Must Have Video Game List.As always, stay away from No One Lives Forever unless you really want a craptacular game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful ordering this product","review":"\\"I am pleased with the seller who credited me promptly for this product.

Employee of the Month, a film that borders along the outskirt territories of film noir and the lowlands of dark comedy, resting somewhere between and finding a new niche as a classic example of why independent films are often the sweetest things since Raquel Welch's thighs.Our plot seems pretty simple: we have a fast-rising banker named David Walsh (Matt Dillon) losing his job at the hands of an arrogant, bottom-line bank manager who cares little-to-nothing for those who work under him. Walsh then begins a hybrid plan of enacting revenge, but soon it becomes clear to the viewer that nothing is as it seems, wherein all parties are capable of betrayal and murderous ambition.A very clever film that is funny enough to keep you watching, and intriguing enough to keep you guessing.4.5 out of 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"Not only was it not what I expected, but it was rather B grade and a bit cheesy. However, if you don't have anything better to do on a Saturday rainy afternoon, or for an all night movie marathon at home, it's not a bad flick all said and done.The ending twisted a bit, and I know a lot of have said they liked it, but truth is, for me, it was quite predictable, and perhaps a bit too convenient too. I think that revealing the ulterior motive and the relationship between the two remaining at the end was more for shock value and sales than it was to further the plot, but hey, that's just an opinion.All in all, it was okay to watch at home when I had nothing better to do, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at a theatre. The casting was not bad, but the acting was horrible. The filming was cheap, and I was mostly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a total failure","review":"I cannot believe this was actually released.

What kills me is that there were actually some decent actors and actresses in this lemon, Steve Zahn in particular.

Sure it had a couple good ones, but mostly I didn't like it.The movie is about a man with the perfect life, a beautiful fiancee and a dream job. And then, he gets fired and everything goes down the drain. A bankrobbery and peeing on a painting as wel as a lot more occur next but the movie just never is really funny. Most of the time, the jokes were really mean and just too dark for me. They were so dark that they were rude and innapropriate. Of course like every comedy, it has some laughs but not enough as most of them just weren't funny and were too dark. I recommend not even renting it because it's hypocritical of everything and not funny.

I gave it 2 stars because I expected more features on the DVD such as other movie Fraser has starred for the studio(The Mummy),director/ actor commentary and what about a behind the scenes feature on the DVD?

Eric Idle as the Teacher is goofy as usual. The Kumquat (sp?) Indians are also a riot. (Riverdance?) The only problem I really have is Sarah Jessica Parker.

I loved Haggard, the first \\"feature\\" film the crew did...and Minghags missed that mark. Brandon played some good/funny parts, Bam was just Bam...hes not even good at playing himself. The worst part was the distinct lack of Raab.

I thought Haggard was bad and then I saw this piece of garbage. I love Bam, Bran, Ryan and Raab but they really need to stick to what they're good at which is making CKY movies. These pathetic attempts at screenplays are just embarrassing. Bran's character is annoying as hell in this movie and didn't make me laugh once. The Ralph character was equally as annoying and equally as unfunny. The acting was terrible the plot was terrible the movie was just all around terrible.

Just simply reading this book will not help you if you are playing golf once in a while. The book is very easy to read and understand.

I am very surprised that they remade it in later years. The only reason this video did not get 1 star was because of Dolly Parton and Sally Field. Julia Roberts was way too old to play the roll of a daughter about to get married, and the story did not flow in a smooth pattern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who the Hell Are You?","review":"This movie is worth it for one character-Weezer played by Shirley Maclaine. The title for my review is one of her lines in the movie. Shirley's character was a hoot. She had the best lines. For example: she tells Sally Field's on-screen husband (Skerritt) that he is a boil on the [backside] of humanity. Of course the movie is good for other reasons. Dolly Parton, Julia Roberts, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis and Sally Field are all great, but Shirley steals the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful movie","review":"You'll laugh, you'll cry with the story of Shelby, based on the true-life story of Susan Harling, a woman trying to live her life regardless of her diabetes. Her brother, Robert, wrote a play based on her life, which became the basis for this wonderful movie. I truly recommend this movie. It is funny and thoughtful and about life and how we live it to its fullest everyday. DVD features include a really good featurette and not so good commentary by the director Herbert Ross. He gives a bit of unique information as you are watching the movie, but there are long periods where he doesn't say anything at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can it not be good??","review":"I loved this movie, and frequently watch it again and again when I need a good emotional movie - or a good cry.

The Louisiana setting is fun, along with all the southern-belle accents. The story is just a moment in the lives of this family, and the choices a woman makes to have the family she so desires.

The acting in this movie is so phenomenal, that it requires multiple viewings, focusing on specific characters during each viewing, in order to fully appreciate the film.

It's set in Lousiana. Julia Roberts, Sally Field, Olivia Dukakis, Shirley Maclaine, Dolly Parton, and Darryl Hannah are the main stars of the movie. It starts out as a group of women in a beauty salon getting ready for Julia Roberts' character's wedding. We meet Darryl Hannah's character in the beginning as she comes by looking for work and a place to stay. The story goes over a period of time from Shelby's wedding to the birth of her son and her kidney transplant and her death. At the end of the movie, it shows Darryl Hannah's character heading off to the hospital to have her baby. During the movie, Darry's character went to beauty school, fell in love, got married, and became pregnant.

Since my mother died from cancer at 45 in November 2000, which was accompanied by kidney failure, the movie took an all too real turn. I would have ever thought I could relate to this movie in such a real way before. It did look like she had been \\"driving nails up her arms.\\" and what was once funny on television became too real to understand. I have been unable to watch the movie since she died, but it has and will forever be my life on screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie about life","review":"Steel Magnolias fits perfectly into that particular genre of movie that deals, quite simply, with the concept of \`everyday life'. It's just that everyday life, as the movie convincingly reveals, is never quite that simple.The film details the lives of several women living in America's Deep South and how, despite their obvious differences, each is a supportive friend to each of the others. Within this complex web of relationships, set across the backdrop of a small community, all emotional aspects of life are explored from birth to marriage to death - even religion gets something of a look in. Through this exploration we get to understand and know more about the characters, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses.Steel Magnolias is, in short, an emotional film: it's both happy and sad, it will make you laugh and it will probably make you cry. And that's just the way it should be, after all that's the way of real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie","review":"At least, that's what the recipient of this movie gift thinks!

Anyways I liked the movie and being a girl I loved this movie. It had great one liners and had many wonderful stars in it such as Julia Roberts and Sally Field. This movie released in 1989 shows it's age somewhat but will always remain a classic. This is a must have for girls only."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say? You just have to see the movie!","review":"It is such a wonderful story of the bond between women, mothers and daughters, friends....

It is a must-see for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie Ever","review":"This is my very favorite movie in the whole world. I'm from the South and so of course I enjoy it, but anyone will... really. I think that all of these actresses perform wonderfully, especially Sally Field in her graveyard scene. I also loved the chemistry between Olympia Dukakis and Shirley MacLaine. I especially love the DVD because of the deleted scenes. I have three copies of the movie on VHS, but the DVD is worth buying just for the extra stuff.

It expanded many of my understandings and put me in much deeper awareness of the topic, and I really enjoyed that.One of the ways I could relate to this book is that some of the exercises resembled Aikido warm up exercises, which made me understand why I feel the way I feel when I practice Aikido and the sense being charged with positive energy.I gave this book a rating of 4 stars, even though it deserves 5, simply because there were parts that I couldn't tune into or relate to, but it presented a really interesting argument.I am full of admiration of the writing style and the stories, and I loved the introduction, because I could relate to most of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I loved this book because it's simple and yet very effective.

However, this movie was the worse German movie I have ever purchased. The movie is predictable and most of the times boring and I yawned from beginning to end.

Don't waste your money not even for a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful model","review":"A very beautiful model of a Greek temple.

But if you have the patience to do it, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Requires focus but well worth it!","review":"This is a time-consuming project....but the end result is well worth it! The model is made of a heavy-gauge, glossy paper that folds well and has a substantial feel without being too heavy, and has good color and detail on it. It is important to read through the instructions first before starting assembly. There is a LOT of cutting, folding and glueing involved, especially with the many columns. I am an adult, and it took me approximately ten hours to construct. The roof remains attached but can be opened (like the lid of a box) to reveal the interior of the temple, which has several chambers and nice detail such as the statute of Athena. Very nice model with good detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everlast Soft Flex Water Bag","review":"Don't waste your time with this bag if you are serious about a workout and want something that will last. I have busted two of them inside of six months. The first lasted about four months. Everlast sent a replacement after I complained and it lasted two months before it sprang a leak in the side. Also, the bag will bulge in the side and at the bottom. Finally the top of the bag seems to collapse after some use and forms and uneven surface that is difficult to hit without injuring your hand or foot. All around a bad design and dose nothing for the fine name of Everlast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lopsided and inconsistent surface!!","review":"I chose this bag as replacement to a leaking Century water/air bag that I loved (4+ years old).

The result is an inconsistent and awkward punching surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"In theory this should be a reasonable piece of equipment. Unfortunately, the weight of the water will cause a teardrop effect on the bag, creating a problem finding the \\"sweet spot\\" of the bag. Furthermore, the teardrop deforms the inner lining and outside of the bag. Lastly, I don't consider myself a heavyweight by any means, but after 2 months, my bag's bladder started to leak...and that was it. Now tell me, what good is a heavy bag that lasts just a short time and is the product of faulty design?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BOTHER","review":"Not worth it!!! The top of the bag will cave in after the first few uses. Even though tis happened I still thought it was an ok bag for awhile. The water minimizes the movement of the bag (moves like a heavier bag). The problen was I had only used the bag 3 times a week for 4 months before it sprang a leak all over my floor. Im not even a heavy guy I walk around at 150 lbs. It would be a good bag if it would of lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on the hands","review":"The Everlast Soft Flex Bag has been a great addition in workout equipment. I am 35 years old now and I train only to relieve stress and stay in shape, all while not trying to injure myself in the process. This bag has been perfect for my hands, knuckles, wrist, elbows, and shoulders. I can hit this bag with out having to worry about the aches and pains that normally come with a solid heavy bag.

There is only 1 old 50s song on this soundtrack. and in the movie there were like 5 or 6. Why were these songs forgotten? Are soundtracks being made today only putting songs on CDs from this time period even though they have old songs in the movie? If your buying this soundtrack for the old 50s and 60s songs you heard in the movie you won't find them on this CD that's for sure.

Since she's in Seattle and I'm in Philadelphia, I can't give you a first-hand observer's report on the worth of this toy, but I can say this:When my brother called me to thank me on Estella Rose's behalf for the present, he also reported to me that she carried it everywhere and hadn't let it go for two days.Of course, Estella Rose won't remember actually getting this Curious George doll years down the road, but I predict it will be a treasured part of her childhood. Curious George is both cute and fun, and this doll provides stimulation for little tykes (it's rated 3 years and up, but it looks to me like it's safe for any child beyond the first months of infancy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing; Tickle but no wiggle","review":"I bought this toy for my five year old daughter's birthday because she's on a bog C.G. kick. The toy itself is cute and and soft, and mildly cuddly. However, the package states the C.G. \\"giggles and wiggles...\\". After replacing the defunct batteries that \\"were included\\", I did eventually make George giggle, but could not make him wiggle short of shaking him myself. I was tempted to keep him anyway because he did giggle and laugh, but not by tickling his underarms and feet, etc; to produce C.G.'s laughter, you have to locate and compress the trigger points in each \\"tickle spot\\"... a bit like a massage therapist would do, but only you have to do it with so much force you'd think you were trying to HURT C.G rather than give him a little tickle. It should be re-marketed as pressure point George. It's no wonder he was on clearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"My four year old requested this item for Christmas, which I had never heard of until then. The doll itself is cute enough, but the vocals are, well, strange. Much deeper than you'd expect from George and therefore very unpleasant. Kind of creepy, actually.

The night scenes - of which there are quite a few in this film - display very uneven levels of \\"blackness\\", resulting in a splotchy effect that is very distracting and detracts from the viewing experience. Playing the same discs on a different DVD player and television produced the same results. I can only assume that mine is not the only CLOSE ENCOUNTERS DVD with this flaw, and I am surprised that the quality control folks at Columbia Pictures did not catch this problem and correct it before shipping the product. I contacted Columbia weeks ago, but have not received a reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film. Awful transfer!","review":"There is no excuse for the poor image quality and distorted sound track.

It does not deserve the praise it gets.

Only marginal improvement during the outdoor scenes. 5 stars for all 3 versions being available on one Disc. 3 stars for the pic quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Directors Cut Rocks","review":"I am glad Spielberg re-edited the film and included the scene where the ocean liner is found in the Gobi desert(this scene was originally dropped in the initial 1977 release). There are also scenes that were dropped for the 1981 Special Edition release that are included here such as the Air Force press conference, and the footage of Dreyfuss tearing up his neighbors duck pond and yard to create his Devil's tower. One thing is missing however, and I think Speilberg made a mistake not to include the footage of Dreyfuss going inside the mothership on this version. Sound is incredible on DVD version. Special features include trailers, teasers, outtakes, and a cool documentary with interviews by cast and crew."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly boring","review":"this is a completely boring film and one of Spielberg's worst films. Usually his movies are fantastic, like Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, or even E.T., but this so damn slow and plodding!

I'm sick of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped eye candy with no plot","review":"Okay, we all agree the visual effects were beyond the leading edge for the era. We all know today's computers can blow it away visually. But really, the plot is WEAK. The characters are so shallow. I mean, the farm mother loses her kid, and doesn't even seem that upset! Hello? And what is a single mother doing raising a young kid on a farm in the 70's? Where is the father? Where is the character development? Why didn't Dreyfus' wife put him in the psyche ward when he tore up the neighborhood? Why didn't the police drag him in for protective custody? The plot is so goofy and contrived it totally distracts from the big picture themes. The 1 star is only for visuals, otherwise, it ranks about a zero. One of the most over rated films of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's this movie about?","review":"Having heard a lot about this movie, after seeing it, I utterly fail to understand what people like about it. The story: guy has a hell of a row with his wife, leaves her and his nice kids, travels the country with another wife, and finally leaves the mess around him in a spaceship. If this is what happens when aliens come down, well, let them please stay where they belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"As ever,Spielberg stinks","review":"What more need be said about this other than that it is a film by Spielberg, the insipid director who brought us such films as \\"Always\\" or \\"Hook\\", other than that he is the worst filmmaker since Bill Rebane? This early effort is even more idiotic than most of his more recent, half-hearted efforts. This film is an incredibly boring, almost plotless, overlong borefest that may well cure you of insomnia by boring you to death. Also, a special note to the manufacturers of this disk: This is the 21st century! We want more than just some sorry movie on the disk. If all we the public wanted was the movie we would gladly buy the VHS. For your next release, try putting some worthwhile extra features on the disk. At least then you might be able to trick the public into thinking they are getting something worth the money they paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still charming after all these years","review":"Although the special effects cannot compare with what moviemakers can conjure today, this remains one of my favourite movies. The story line is charming and Richard Dreyfuss is excellent. The blue ray version is satisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Movie!","review":"I remember this movie and think about it as the time when Steven Speliberg was really, really good. It seems that after Empire of the Sun, he became obsessed with approval and approbation than being a great filmaker.

It is very rusty and looking at the subtitles help immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Work On A Classic","review":"I was not disappointed in the quality of this DVD!

It will never get old. Definitely a most own movie for movie lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!","review":"Truly one of the all-time great movies ever made, it still floors me to think that Spielberg was only about 28 years old when he directed this film. He also wrote it, and it's a damned mature work for his age at the time -- strangely, other films of his that would follow (ie. Indy Jones, E.T., Hook) were entertaining, but not nearly so adult.This film succeeds by making our own fear of the unknown the villian, and not some cliched men-in-black operative, or bug-eyed alien. Few, if any, films have ever duplicated that feat.A masterpiece I would say, both visually and thematically. No film since has captured the scope or awe of what \\"first contact\\" with an alien species would be like quite like this Spielberg gem.Unfortunately, even this widescreen, letterboxed transfer of the film on video doesn't quite convey the full impact -- only the big-screen can do that.

Sure, there's big special effects and stuff...but the story is pretty lame. A man makes stuff out of mashed potatoes and is pretty much obsessed with Devil's Tower. That's all this films about...a man's obsession with mashed potatoes and a mountain...groovy, but boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as promised!","review":"Wonderful films!

Unlike the sci-fi films of the 1950's that revolve around UFO's and alien contact on Earth that usually had the aliens being evil and coming to dominate and destroy the Earth, Mr. Spielberg depicts them as benign and friendly. The visual effects were first rate in 1977 and are a far cry from today's studio wizardry, they are not hokey and actually hold up well. The cast all give fine performances including Mr. Dreyfuss, Teri Garr as his beleaguered wife and Melinda Dillon scored a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her role as a fellow contactee. Although the film was not nominated for Best Picture, Mr. Spielberg received his first Best Director nomination and the film won one award for Best Cinematography and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dolby TrueHD issues..","review":"This is a great transfer of this film. I may have gotten quirky copy, but I thought I would let folks know. When I watched it with the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack, it became out of sync with the picture starting with the first Richard Dreyfus scene with his family. This was during the \\"Theatrical Edition\\" version on the disc. Fortunately, this awesome version also includes the DTS HD soundtrack as well. So I just switched over to that audio and had no more problems. Again, I assume this is a fluke, since I have read no other posts about this. I just thought I would let people know about the \\"defect\\" and the quick fix. Other than that, I highly recommend this Blu Ray. It is an excellent transfer. Some of it can be a little grainy, but it IS 30 years old. The sound is phenomenal! The spaceship scenes really put your subwoofer through its paces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks & sounds great, but Spielberg pulls punches w/extras","review":"Laserdisc collectors already have the definitive version of this movie courtesy of the Criterion Disc.

I still have the Criterion Laserdisc version, and that will be the one I go to when the time rolls around to watch this movie again. Spielberg did the same thing when he released \\"Jaws\\" on DVD in July of 2000. What should have been a definitive release was instead an abbreviated version (I'm referring to bonus stuff, here) of the edition released as a Collector's set on Laserdisc years before.

Stick with the dvd instead.Close Encounters of the Third Kind [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly Encounter","review":"A Steven Spielberg movie, as all the world knows, is generally a masterful assemblage of special effects concealing an entirely brainless script. \\"Close Encounters\\" was made on the credit Spielberg ran up for steering \\"Jaws\\" to box-office success, and it is just as dim-witted as the fish story. At least when Hollywood made flying saucer movies in the 1950's nobody expected the audience to take them seriously. It was pretty shocking to discover that a man in Spielberg's position actually believed the UFO claptrap in circulation by the mid 70's. Still, it all might have worked if his aliens had amounted to something; they're like a race of speechless squeeze toys. A very poor effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"I had been hearing how great this movie was but I had never seen it. So I bought the dvd. I was a little disappointed. This version has the added scenes that were not shown in the original theatrical release, and maybe that is what I don't like. It is slow and too long.

Maybe not Spielberg's finest (\\"Schindler's List\\" takes the cake), it's definitely one of his best.The setting is rural Indiana. Our main character is one Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), a struggling electrician who is contacted by aliens and travels to Devil's Tower to meet them. Accompanying Roy is a distraught mother (Melinda Dillon), whose little son was \\"kidnapped\\" by the aliens. But also heading to Devil's Tower is a band of government researchers led by a French scientist named Lacombe (Francious Traffaut).In all, this is an amazing movie.

This is NOT correct! The disc I received did not have the 30th anniversary text on the outer or inner cases, and does not contain any of the special features included with the Ultimate Edition. Very deceptive, and I will be returning mine.This edition does appear to have all three versions of the movie (theatrical, special edition, director's cut), so if all you want is the movie itself and if you can get it at a significant discount to the Ultimate Edition, then it might be an option.

A must buy regardless of price by anyone who loves movies in High Def."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Film to Finally Enjoy on Blu-ray","review":"I originally owned this on regular DVD and thought it'd be even better to own on Blu-ray with all the extra special features that most Blu-ray movies have to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Spielberg","review":"One of Spielberg's best films, his next blockbuster as the follow-up to Jaws. Close Encounters, about a man (Dreyfuss) and a few others all have a calling to meet at Devil's Mountain where they will meet extra-terrestrials. Some of the best scenes full of intesity made whole with John Williams awesome score. The final scenes are some of the most memorable, and the best special effects you will see in modern cinema (comparatively so with CGI). Spielberg also wrote the script, along with a cameo of famed French director Francois Truffaut."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far Spielberg's best","review":"A magical, eye-filling wonder. Get out the popcorn, crank up the stereo, and enjoy. The best and most fully realized of Spielberg's works, only occasionaly descending into sentimentality."},{"rating":"2","title":"close encounters of a third kind","review":"Great movie with good special affects, acting and story. This is a great early lSpielberg masterpiece.

It is a movie that continues to be thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHICH ENDING IS ON IT?","review":"I wondered if the disk had the original ending or the \\"extended\\" ending that came out a few years after the theatrical version.Well, it has the theatrical version ending; the extended \\"inside the ship\\" ending is included in the extra scenes chapter.Better this way, IMO, since the original leaves the sense of unknown in the viewer. And the inside of the ship was kind of simplistic anyway - it looks like rock concert lights!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD RIDDANCE TO A TOAD OF A HUSBAND","review":"If I had a husband that lost his job, didnt look for new work to support his family, trashes my kitchen, argues with me in front of our three kids, runs off to passionately kiss a single mom, then hops aboard a UFO, GOOD RIDDANCE!The ending of the film should have been the aliens harvasting his organs. They wanted to know what a lousy earth husband was made of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close Encounters of the TURD Kind","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is long and boring. The main character is so easy to hate which makes the movie even harder to watch, when you wish he was dead.

I felt invested in each of the main characters and wanted to keep watching. The music was haunting and well planned, adding wonderfully to the atmosphere of the story. Might be too frightening for young children but not boring to non-science fiction fans since the focus is on what drives and pushes the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lone Hold Out","review":"I may be the lone hold out, but.... on my Samsung DLP , the transfer is terrible. I am of the opinion that the HD transfer is also enhancing the grain of a thirty year old movie. The DNIe engine in my Samsung is making that grain more enhanced. Any family scenes in the house look like they're in a snow storm. Other than that the outdoor scenes are great, and the colors and sound are awesome. If you have a Samsung DLP, though, you will have to watch it with the DNIe off. The picture is not as sharp, but the snow is not as bad. By the way, I looked at the regular DVD version in the same Blu- Ray player and there was a little grain, but no snow... with the DNIe engaged. 32 dollars wasted? Hard to say at this point. Anybody else having this problem?"},{"rating":"2","title":"MASHED POTATOES AND MORE","review":"CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is another one of Steven Spielberg's innocent looks at children and aliens, as in ET. This classic is a superior example of good filmmaking, with its rather thin plot overshadowed by its wonderful direction and Richard Dreyfuss' marvelous performance. Also note the fine support from Teri Garr and Melinda Dillon; their presence gives the movie a foundation of family ideals. The scene where Dreyfuss makes his mashed potatoes into a replica of Devil's Peak is still one of the most memorable in science fiction films. John Williams' score is as always impeccable and the effects state of the art. A lot doesn't really \\"happen\\" in the movie, but its view of friendly aliens and contact with we earthlings still gives it classic status."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Neary Family is as impressive as the light show","review":"For me the portrayal of the Neary family is equally as stunning as the portrayal of the spacecraft throughout the movie. The acting in any scene involving the Nearys is astounding. Even though that family doesn't end up the way we might hope, they behave exactly like a real family might when faced with their situation. Pay special attention to the children. Their reactions are dead on.The special effects are breathtaking and continue to prove, as have so many other great films, that the old way of doing effects is far more spectacular and convincing than today's cartoonish CGI effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick","review":"I hired this after we went and saw the Devils Tower mountain we thought we would love to see the movie again.So when we got home from our trip it was waiting for us.

I figured it'd be a documentary. Then I started watching it. It seemed good. Then go all \\"magical\\". Screw that. Although the tape is in good condition, and it works well, the movie really sucked.Thanks though for the price; I'd recommend the seller I bought this from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Package","review":"A very nice package for a classic film, It's nice to see that Spielberg took the time to do a nice remaster and include all the versions of the film. It's great to see how it developed over the years into what Spielberg really wanted. The picture is very crisp with some of the gloss being removed from the original. I for one really enjoy these packages where the put a number of versions of an important film together and give reasons for all the different changes. Over the course of watching these I end up changing my own choice of favorite version. Anyway a great job done on a great film, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD!","review":"This is yet another amazing Blu Ray disc! Perhaps better than the release prints. The sound in DTS surround (and Dolby Digital) is amazing as well. 1977? That's hard to believe. All three versions of the film are here as well.

The 2-disc collector's edition was well worth it because it has all the behind-the-scenes extras such as the making of, deleted scenes, interviews, etc. The video and sound quality were very good. I expected the 30 year-old special effects to look \\"dated\\" but they still seemed surprisingly good. I would definitely recommend this movie if you are a sci-fi fan. As always, Amazon's delivery was speedy and the item arrived it excellent condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing as an adult","review":"I saw this movie when I was 10. I loved it! Must have seen it 5 times in the theater. Bright lights, spaceships, friendly aliens, action - couldn't get enough of the eye candy. As an adult, and a avid sci-fi movie-goer, I could not stomach watching it. With the FX now passe, it was a painful journey through a shallow, self-serving story with so many loose ends that left me frowning. The editing in this \\"restored\\" version is atrocious and abrupt, and the sound quality is dissapointing despite the THX/DTS rating. The premise of the story remains incredible and hopeful. The execution, however, is terrible. As a DVD this is okay for the bonus material - the ONLY reason it got two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instant Video version is \\"TV\\" screen","review":"Be warned that if you buy the streaming video version of this movie (rent is not an option) you are not getting a film version of this movie, but the hacked up narrow screen version that is formatted for TV. It's also low resolution and essentially looks like someone recorded it off of their television on a DVD recorder 10 years ago.It's a huge ripoff and there's no excuse for amazon to be selling this version. I am very disappointed. If this is what they're selling, they should lower the price and INFORM the customer that it's not actually the \\"movie\\" version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transformnig our perception of Wealth!","review":"This is definitely one of the best money books I've read.

After the first few chapters you see she is not trying to raise money for her organization by this book, rather she presents a perspective about how using money relates to your soul -- the bottom line is to use money in ways that are consistent with your personal values adds to your happiness and betterment of others. A very good read and definitely relevant with the economic issues facing all of us now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This was a total waste of money.

Written by activist, Lynne Twist, it carries you through her journey in searching for the true meaning of money in our lives. She writes well and her book is easy to read and quite enjoyable. Through her example, we learn that money represents our life energy and that it can be used to express our \\"soul\\" or our values. It is a representation of who we are. If you are looking for a practical, how-to, book about money and finances, this is not it. It is much more the philosophy of the meaning of money. I use it in my money workshops and my Life Unfolds coaching because it helps folks to figure out where their money issues are. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for money advice, this isn't it.","review":"If Twist had billed the book as an autobiography, it could have worked.

But after that it became, as one reviewer put it, \\"redundant\\", almost unreadable. \\"We\\" (our culture) are constantly being characterized as in the race for \\"more\\"--which, while it describes the corporate and political cultures, does not reflect my experience of individuals in my circle at all. I do, however, believe fervently in (and contribute regularly to) The Hunger Project, for whom Twist works, and their smart self-empowering methods to end hunger. My suggestion is to get this book out of the library, read the interesting parts, and donate the cost of the book to The Hunger Project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul of Moneyh","review":"The book, Soul of Money, arrived quickly and in very excellent condition.

It was fun to read! Although my concerns and despair around the culture of money were validated, even more so were the values of my heart and soul.

Is there anything new and innovative on it ? No not really. I don't care though. I think the singer has a decent voice. I like the melodies. This album makes me feel great it really pumps me up. I reccomend it if u want an album that will make u feel good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific thriller","review":"I remember watching this on television in the 1970's and it was one the scariest films of any genre I'd ever seen. Audrey Hepburn is superb in an Oscar nominated performance as a blind women terrorised by 3 men who are looking for a doll which contains drugs. Its tautly directed by Terence Young (who also directed the first two James Bond films 'Dr No' and 'From Russia with love'). The excellent music soundtrack is by Henry Mancini.As well as the usual trailers, the DVD has an interesting short extra called 'A Look in the Dark' in which Alan Arkin and the Producer Mel Ferrer (who was married to Audrey Hepburn) look back at the film. This is only about 10 minutes but its quite informative.However the main reason to buy the DVD is the film, and once it starts you will be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great movie","review":"We purchased this DVD used and were very happy with the quality of the DVD.

If you haven't seen it, I highly suggest you do. It is deliciously suspenseful. Audry Hepburn is an amazing actress and played a blind lady almost perfectly. I just love the movie. Ten out of ten in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Standard","review":"This is first rate Suspence, first rate acting. This is what all suspense/horror movies should aspire to. Forget present-day blood-splattered gorefests. This is eff-ing SCARY! I first saw this movie in the theater as a 12 year old boy (okay, that dates me) and it has never left me. I remember a poor young woman sitting a couple of rows in front of me standing up in one scene and screaming!!! Her friends pulled her back down.We are so de-sensitized today that I doubt anyone below the age of 35 (maybe 40?) can appreciate Audrey Hepburns' delimma (and excellent acting... or Alan Arkins' skin-crawling antics).No other movie reaches the bar or has impressed me as much (unless it is \\"Requiem for a Dream\\"; I had to force myself to take a nap afterwards to Get Outa My Head!/MAKE IT STOP!!). \\"Wait Until Dark\\" has set the goldbar standard for me for Classy Suspense/ O God I Think I Just Pee-ed Myself a Little/Didn't See That Coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thriller","review":"I discovered that the person who wrote Hitchcock's Dial D for Murder also wrote this story. You can tell because this story takes place in an apartment. I enjoyed this film very much. It is a blind woman who has to deal with three dangerous criminals who are after a doll filled with drugs. Every scene keeps you to the edge of the seat, and its last fifteen minutes or so, are even more enthralling."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. Audrey Hepburn did a super job! If you're considering buying this, DO NOT hesitate! Go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy","review":"Instead of the gore in today's scary movies, this one is just plain creepy.

Very good and clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait Until Dark","review":"Lock the front door, turn down the lights and don't forget that tub of popcorn! Here is a thriller sure to make the hair on the back of your neck stand upright. Susie Hendrix, played by the wonderful Audrey Hepburn, is a blind woman being spied and terrorized upon in her own apartment. When Susie's husband Sam is asked to hold an antique doll for a woman who mysteriously disappears, little does he know the horror that will unfold. Unknown to Susie, the drug-filled doll is in their home and a psychopath, played by Alan Arkin, must retrieve it by any means necessary. Hepburn adds much suspense to this movie; she may be blind, but she's not stupid and she quickly unravels the mind games of Arkin. For those of you who thought blind people were defenseless, think again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Scary Film","review":"1967 Wait until dark is a Film that shows that there was once a time when Hollywood madetruly scary films. it is a classic of the genre with wonderful acting and dialogue.I'm glad that movies like this are still available and that we who enjoy oldschool scary movies can still watch them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie","review":"This is the worst movie of Audrey Hepburn, It's different from her early films.I prefer the early films, like \\"Breakfast at Tiffany\\", \\"Roman Holiday\\", \\"Sabrina\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hepburn and Arkin, super thriller","review":"Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin star in a dark thriller that is a true shocker. Hepburn stars as a blind women in her apartment (Susy), that is routinely terrorized by a group of con-artist/henchmen led by Alan Arkin. They seek a toy doll that was hidden in the blind woman's apartment that contains several packages of valuable cocaine. Through the movie, (Which entire action takes place in a single room! A Broadway replica film) the con men each take turns in trying to convince Susy to give them the location of the doll in the apartment. A maddening, nail-biting thriller that SHOULD be watched in the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Thriller Sleeper","review":"This is a great thriller movie. I saw it the first time when it was first released and most of the women where screaming at the end of the movie and the men at the very least flinched several times. This movie is often unheard of by those born in the last twenty years. Even for them if they have any appreciation for older films like \\"Psycho\\" or \\"Rear Window\\" they should see this. Another to check out is \\"Magic\\" starring Anthony Hopkins long before his \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" fame.

Sure, the performances were good, but not much else. Both my parents said that since I love scary movies, I would love this terrifying film. Boy, were they wrong! Watching this movie was about as much fun as trying to teach a man with no fingers how to light a match. If you want to see a film about a blind girl being terrorized by a psycho that is actually scary, watch Jennifer 8, but not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This movie is not scarey.

Wonderfully haunting score, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking back","review":"Like so many others, I too love this movie and am pleased with the DVD release. Rather than repeat what others have said, I wanted to add my own little side note: in addition to leaving front doors unlocked, who in the current time would send an eleven year old girl out at night by herself in Manhattan to the Port Authority Bus Station to wait for buses?!? While I was scared for Hepburn's character in that little apartment, I was also scared for the little girl skipping off into the darkness! Also, it would have made more sense to send her to the nearest police station rather than to wait at a bus station in hopes of running into Hepburn's husband - ah well, movies!But don't let that stop you from seeing this movie. It's worth every second of great suspense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intense thriller","review":"I am taking a course in Graphic Design (computer graphics) at a community college whose drama group is putting on the play \\"Wait Until Dark.\\" We were given a project to design a poster for the play - the best would be used for publicity. I did not see the movie when I was younger (I am retired and back in school for enjoyment) so I purchased the DVD to become familiar with the story. I liked it. It is a film in the Hitchcock tradition. It's not like the modern \\"slasher\\" or action movies. Instead, it grips you because the story relates to things that are much more plausible - by accident, anyone could be the target of nefarious people. The acting is quite good, especially Audrey Hepburn. I made the mistake of watching it on my computer while at school. I would recommend watching it on a larger screen in a darkened room. And just concentrate on the film; you need to let yourself get absorbed to get the full impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Indie Action Title!","review":"The movie is great, especially considering the budget. The acting was nearly flawless, action choreography was intense and frantic, sound was immersive, and the music was AMAZING.

In this case, perfection of the medium flex has been achieved (fireworks please) because the leading edge is fairly flexible but it soon transitions to a stiffer mid section.Apply low pressure and you have a soft tool in our hand; apply heavier pressure and your have the capabilities of a stiff spatula.

If you possess some basic knowledge of what was happening during the era of civil rights, you would enjoy seeing the actual based-on-the-true-events scenes and comparing it to the present time.

It will make you angry and for too long we bottle our anger because we feel we have made progress. We think because black men are in front of and behind the camera that we've climbed up that mountain. But when a black boy can be beaten and a black man dragged behind a car in THIS DECADE, then you know we haven't come far enough. This movie doesn't just illuminate white southern racism.

I watched this movie hoping to see an intelligent, controversial film but instead it was the same old politically-correct propaganda.I'm certain that a lot of racism existed in the South in the old days, and that some of the events in the movie were realistic. But what I didn't like was that this movie portrays most southern white people as despicable, illiterate, racist murderers. Yet all of the black people in the movie are depicted as peaceful, church-going, articulate people. I actually had to rewind the tape at several parts of the movie because I couldn't make out what some of the white people in that movie were saying; they sounded so unintelligible.This film basically makes racial issues of the old South seem very clear cut.

However, he found himself again and did a complete 180 degree turnaround. This movie was funny and endearing and to my surprise, somewhat realistic (as far as fantatical fans). Jimmy plays Ben who is obsessed with the Red Sox and the story follows him and Lindsey as they start a relationship and she begins to see the extent of his passion for sports and especially baseball. I think this movie really worked well because these two had amazing chemistry.Even if you aren't a big fan of baseball (how could you not be) or any sport, you'll still enjoy this heartwarming comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun flick..lighten up already.","review":"OK all...I am attempting to keep the \\"Obsessed we-won-26 World Series\\" and \\"Yankees Suck\\" comments out.

Not rocket science...not preachy...just a cute \\"Romantic Comedy.\\" Not a 2004 Post Season documentary!What I do find amazing is that how they picked, of all years, 2004, to make this movie.

My husband and I really enjoyed it. It was an unusual romantic comedy: one you could actually enjoy with your mate! It was not too sappy or lovey. This movie is not laugh out loud funny, but there are a few funny moments. The movie had a lot of insight from a guy's point of view and it had a lot of sports!! For a Farrelly brother's movie, this one was uncharactristically normal. Usually their movies are zany, wacky, kind of over the top (Something about Mary is a good example) Although some of the Red Sox obsession was a little hard to believe, overall this was a pretty believable love story. It was neat how they followed the Red Sox and then changed the ending to the movie when they actually won the World Series!! Great date movie, friend movie, just a great movie.

The script isn't all that great and Jimmy Fallon isn't very believable as a Red Sox fan. How can he when it is a well known fact that he is a Yankees fan (talk about miscasting)? And the final scene in Busch stadium may have looked good on paper. But did anyone research this with Boston fans? Did the Farrelly bros ever put out any teasers to test the Red Sox fan base to measure how lame this film and ending really was? I saw this movie once at the theater and saw it again as a rental to see if my opinions changed over time. Contrary to popular belief, Red Sox fans do NOT like this film. OK, putting that aside for the rest of the general public, why would anyone else be interested in seeing this film if it didn't involve their team?

Overall the movie was stupid and foretable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!, a must for any Red Sox Fan!!!","review":"I must admit, I'm a little biased since I spent my last two years in Boston, and there was a lot of Red Sox magic going on, but the movie in itself is funny, imaginative and well created, and even if you're not a fan of the Red Sox, you'll definitely love seeing Drew Barrymore getting whacked in the head with a Baseball!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Pop-Up","review":"You would think that with source material by Nick Hornby and the filmmakers benefitting from the Boston Red Sox being in the pennant race that this would be a more engrossing picture. The film suffers from flat direction by the Farrelly brothers and uninspired performances by Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore. As a baseball fan I was bored with the Red Sox arcana that the film is rife with. Do yourself a favor and seek out the superior British filmization of Hornby's novel concerning a fan of the Arsenal football club. The always good Colin Firth delivers an excellent performance in that version. I'm not even remotely a soccer fan but I was infinitely more engaged by the British version than the American one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE TOP 5 WORST FILMS OF ALL TIME","review":"Plain and Simple: The film was not funny.

There were more dropped calls than completed. We got the phones through Cingular, there is a Cingular tower 500 ft from my house, we always have 5 bars, yet these phones still could not get reception.

Unfortunately, they have the option of sending you a refurbished model, which means that they tried to fix someone else's problem phone and pawn it off on you.

I am now on my FOURTH V180 in 10 months. I returned the first due to nonexistant reception. I returned the second due to the fact that it would not always hang up when flipped shut. I returned the third because it randomly froze several times in the middle of the night (always at 3:39am, which was odd); since I use my phone's alarm clock, this was problematic. The fourth time is apparently the charm--this one has been fine. Had Cingular's return policy not been so convenient, this would have been way more annoying. It's still been an inconvenience, however. So learn from my experience, and choose a different phone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the hinterlands","review":"I must live on the edge of Cingular's (and everyone else's) coverage area. This phone can't hold a call at my house, and I have problems with it dropping calls even when it shows several bars strength. Part of the problem is the coverage area, but part is the phone, too.

I was afraid that a Samurai movie starring a white guy might end up kind of goofy. But Tom Cruise puts in a strong performance here and won me over by the end of the film. If you love swords this is the movie for you. Tons of training with swords, fighting with swords, and philosiphising about them. The action is spectacular, and the score is stirring. The cinemtography is beautiful. The mountain village reminded me of the shire and made me want to live there. For a movie with some brutally violent action sequences, it also features some amazingly peaceful and relaxing moments in the middle of the film. Anyone who believes in honor and chivalry will find this movie inspiring.Est Sularus Oth Mithas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Cruise plays somone other than himself","review":"This is an interesting role for tom Cruise. Many times, you'll see him playing himself in films - by that I mean, you never quite lose the line between him and his character.And that works for him.In this film, you get a glimpse of how he is learning to transcend his own character and lose himself more fully in his roles. As he matures as an actor, and not just a blockbuster draw, I really think those kinds of transformations are going to be his best asset.The story in the film is touching and ironic, and is respectful of all the cultures represented within it. Are they accurate portrayals? That depends on which side of the lens you're on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and pretentious","review":"No wonder the Japanese people hate this movie. It's not only the stereotypes (most of the Japanese characters were faceless or ugly, and in general violent and, hmm, stereotyped). It's also the pretentious way of fitting an Oriental philosophy in a Westerner's world. I'm not against meshing the best of different worlds. I'm just saying the novel and the movie are purely made to make money, and there's nothing philosophical or endearing about the story or the main character. Of course, it has to end with the white man taking the Asian woman as his bride. No wonder the Japanese hate this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Evil West\\" Strikes Again!","review":"The Last Samurai is very reminiscent of Braveheart , minus the kilts and good acting. It takes place in the 1860's in Japan at the end of the Tokugawa family era, the last of the Shoguns. The Samurai are in revolt against the Emperor, because they are asked to turn over their swords and culture and accept a modernization (westernization) of Japan.The film portrays the modern Imperial army as evil, while the Samurai are the oppressed good guys. Interestingly enough, the Samurai in history were the elite army and agents of oppression of the Japanese people, while the young Japanese Emperor in 1868, struggled to bring his country up to date with the rest of the modernized world.This may be entertaining for those who like pure visual stimulus without thought. For the rest of us....don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most ironic film of the year","review":"Apart from being slow, condescending, cliched and overblown, this film is hilarously, and unintentionally ironic. An American from an American-backed 'peace keeping force' joins with a bunch of reactionary rebels. Amazingly, the rebels are right to despise 'western ways' in their desire to cling to 'traditional' beliefs. Guns, progress and capitalism aren't, apparently, the basis for inner peace. In the face of impossible odds, it's still better to die an honourable death in the face of automatic weapons. So, presumably, the follow up will be something like 'Last Jihad Warrior' where Tom Cruise joins the Iraqi Shi'ite militia in a vainglorious rebellion against Apache attack helicopters."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 days for delvery","review":"have not received it as of yet ...I am led to beleve it will take at least one month for it to arrive iI MAY JUST CANCELL MY ORDER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try this one on for size...","review":"Imagine you are a woman living in the United States, and a foreign fighter (Pick any of the convenient enemies - The Soviets, Al Qaida, The French, etc) invades your town, killing your husband and trying to destroy your very way of life.Imagine again, that within 6 months, he has learned everything there is to know about being an American, and has embraced the American culture and now becomes a leader in the fight against his own countrymen.

So he goes around karating and samurai-ing. And everyone's like, Oh hell! It's the Cruise man. And I was like, oh HELL, LET'S WATCH SOMETHING ELSE!

It has better action and battle sequences. It really gives you a feeling that you are there experiencing the war. I don't care what people say, Tom Cruise does just fine as a samurai. I don't get it when people say Tom Cruise isn't a convincing Samurai.

I'm pretty tired in the evenings and this took about 3 days to watch!The acting is good & the battles and sword fights are great. However, this movie really has nothing to offer as far as originality, tone, or filming. I'm really surprised it was even made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful","review":"This is a great movie. Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, and the rest of the cast play their parts perfectly. This movie is more than just some excellent battle scenes.

Oh, and there ARE some great battle scenes.I was a little sceptical when I was about to watch this the first time, but it blew my expectations away, and I loved it. Very few movies can bring this man to tears, but the end of this movie accomplished just that.

The film's tone, mood, action, acting, directing, sets, and scenes (especially the exteriors) were magnificent!!! This is a movie with a heart, and Tom's gradual transformation--from savage soldier to honorable fighter--was refreshing and uplifting. Buy it and keep it. You'll want to see it many times, as each viewing shows you how very much more there is than when you saw it earlier. I can't praise this movie enough, and believe me, I'm a harsh critic, especially when I note something unbelievable and phony.

The only sharp blade in this movie is Ken Watanabe, who in my opinion is the only reson to watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Even though he earns a major paycheck, is a huge box office draw, and is a helluva nice guy, Tom Cruise really doesn't get his due respect as an actor. I will admit that at first I thought this was gonna be stupid, but I was way wrong. Some might describe The Last Samurai as Dances With Wolves meets Braveheart, but it really does stand on its own. I'm not saying the storyline is anything new, because it's not, but these are three-dimensional characters you really come to care about by film's end. That's what modern films need is 3d characters! My only complaint about the movie is that there is one perfect -- and very powerful -- ending but we are spoon-fed two more endings after that. Aside from that assumption to the audience's lack of imagination, The Last Samurai is a nearly perfect example of it's genre and is certainly one of the best offerings of 2003. OH AND I ALMOST FORGOT!!! The fighting is so awesome! I mean wow! It's so great!! 2nd best movie of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic!","review":"Outstanding in every way.

The scenery is gorgeous and the costumes are extremely well done. The Samurai battle scenes and sword wielding is very emotional to watch. I really, really love this film and I do not know what is wrong with some of the other reviewers concerning their comments about this film. Master and Commander was good and I did see it before I saw Samurai but it in no way holds a candle to Toms film. Yes the story line is similar to Dances with Wolves, also a good movie, but not acted, nor filmed as brilliantly and not as emotionally touching. The Last Samurai deserved the Oscars moreso than even the Lord of the RIngs Return of the King which I saw and was somewhat dissapointed in. The Last Samurai is my pick for best film of the year in all catagories."},{"rating":"2","title":"it does not disappoint","review":"I was able to see an advanced showing last night and i was very impressed. I had very high expectations going into it, and I was not let down. Tom Cruise is very good (as usual) and does not just rely on his good looks. The movie moves along at a pretty good pace and doesn't seem like 2 and a half hours long. The film is also very beautiful to look at. One word of caution for some viewers: The Last Samurai is one of the most graphically violent movies i've seen. If that does not bother you, I strongly encourage you to watch it. I thought it was an excellent film and the theatre roared with applause after the film was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is a great story, great acting, great cinematography, great directing, and so on. And I've read some of the most bizarre reviews of this movie. A movie is a movie. It's entertainment. This movie is a work of art. And not many movies are, that. Amelie, for example, is a great work of art. Maybe some don't like Cruise. O.K. But this film is good -- even great in some ways. Perhaps some don't like the genre. Maybe some expected a documentary or a history film. Well, I've seen history films that were pure bunk when telling history with accuracy. Frankly, I couldn't care if this film is historically accurate. It is a beautifully made work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Been-done-before","review":"Yes, it's been done before: Add Dances With Wolves to the King and I and what do you get? Well, you would get a LOT MORE than this movie, but generally you get the idea...The acting is generally average, with the exception of the usual Tom Cruise faux intensity, replete with the usual faux intellectual/academic post movie interviews...As for action scenes, the audience get's to watch a slo-mo repeat of one sword-swingning scene presumably to show us how great the fist version would have been had it been properly filmed...and the epic scenes are, well, simply put, NOT EPIC.The lack of love interest is apparent in the apparent lack of interest in the female character by Cruise - no surprise - which leaves the male viewer with little more than some OK aikido, iaido and sushi.The only thing missing was a rice-rocket motorcycle scene. No Top Shogun here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but very Disappointing DVD","review":"Wonderful movie, one of the best you'll ever experience and since most reviewers wrote a lot about this movie I won't. The DVD was very disappointing to me because this movie was based on Japan and it's history, however, it doesn't offer you to watch the movie in Japanese or it doesn't even offer the Japanese subtitle!!! They offer the typical, Spanish and French! It would have improved this DVD greatly if they had an option to either watch it in Japanese or to watch it with Japanese subtitle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake and pretentious.","review":"Samurai were not that stupid. I don't particularly like some aspects of classic Japanese culture (excessive obsession over honor and conformity), but the one thing they do better than most other Asian cultures is adapt military technologies when given the opportunity.To imply that there was a group of Japanese Samurai who refused to use fire-arms is retarded. The Japanese have used guns since they first encountered them from the Europeans in the early 1400's, from these they reverse engineered. Japanese Warlords have won the entire country with rifle-men.Historically, there really were a group of samurai who rebelled against a modernizing Japan. And they really did fight to death. And they really did only used swords.But not due to a retarded dogmatic aversion to guns, but because they ran out of gun-powder in their last battle.Also the idea that the last and only surviving samurai would be a white man is insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not rating the movie, but the HD-DVD","review":"I like the movie a lot, but this HD-DVD is not so HD. I've played it together with the regular DVD, both from an HD-DVD player, so the regular DVD upsized to 1080i, and there's not any difference. Sorry, but this looks more like they upsized the original DVD than real HDTV. Fox Football looks way better than this DVD. King-Kong, although an awfull movie, shows what HD-DVD is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again!","review":"We have seen this plot a hundred times. It is so overused that it had lost value. They did this again in Avatar. Another recurrence of 60's Hollywood movies where Japanese speak perfect English. Don't we have enough glorification of Samurais. This is a murderous military culture which killed millions of Chinese, Filipinos et al during their occupation. If you want action superhuman Rambo, Bruce Willis style where the hero never dies this is for you. Tom Cruise was hit so many times and he is still alive, unbelievably in arms and legs only! Historically inept, corny mundane Western guy meets new culture and most of all the worn out story of renegade soldier who sympathizes and joins the enemy and becomes traitor then hero. Tom Cruise as always overrated and an eye sore when it comes to acting. This is a movie for substitute teaching classes and for parties just to create distraction and control drunks and power drinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter waste of time and money.","review":"This movie (...) It's no wonder Tom Cruise didn't get Oscar nominated for his role as the obnoxious American captain in this movie. And I'm not surprised at all that the movie didn't get any major nominations during the recent Oscars because this movie is so godawful! I'm really disappointed by this movie which initially had appeared promising. 'The Last Samurai' is simply just another Tom Cruise vehicle whose sole purpose is to get an Academy Award for Best Actor. One piece of advice to Tom Cruise: Go get some acting lessons from Nicole Kidman. In my opinion, Tom Cruise's ambition of winning an Oscar is just a mere wishful thinking because he can't act at all! So, don't spend your money on this horrible movie. Instead, watch a nicer movie, for example Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little to familiar","review":"Yes I thought this movie was alright when I first saw it and I kept thinking that the story was vaguely familiar and then it hit me replace the samurai with Indians and Tom Cruise with Mel Gibson and you've basically got dances with wolves. this movie is a rip off and completely unoriginal."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent movie","review":"I really enjoyed it.

Not only does it depict strong issues about honor, trust, integrity, values, sound morals, lodyalt, duty, and respect, but it also shows a deeper sense of love and loving than I've seen ages. Here is a movie full of passionate love, but no blatant sex acts. Yeah!!! That was a wonderful departure from the norm. Ken Watunabe's role was AWESOME!!! This is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Tom Cruise has alway been a good actor, but I consider this to be his best work to date. I've have many movies in my library and I'm very selective about which movies I will purchase, this is one such movie. If you like action/adventure then this is the movie to watch. It is the story of a man who has done things not of his choosing and has suffered for it. It is the sory of a man who found the meaning of who and what he was, in anouther land, and found the piece mind that he had thought lost forever.I am happy to add this movie to my library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Formulaic But Still Highly Enjoyable","review":"I liked this film much more than I expected to. The story moves along quickly and the formula of the American among a foreign and alien culture brings to mind Dances With Wolves set in 19th century Japan. Nevertheless it is beautifully filmed and well acted. Tom Cruise is ultimately convincing in this role even though I am not a big fan of his. Ken Watanabe is fantastic.The battle scenes are incredible and well done in that there is still tension and interest up to the last even though the ending is quite predictable. The cinematography and the setting of Japan make this a gorgeous film to watch. There is much about this to like even if it is a stock Hollywood production. I took a long time getting around to watching this but I'm glad I finally did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acting, Excellent premise, lower budget","review":"Great cast and acting and truly excellent premiss. The one thing missing from this movie is the eye candy and aesthetics that would really sell it. Still worth a view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film.","review":"I would like to start by saying, that in my opinion, it was slightly presumptuous of the writer, whomever he/she might be, to throw a white man in the midst of the demise of the great and mighty samurai and to have him effect that demise in the way he does. Moreover, I'm not positive but I think there where a few historical inaccuracies in the picture. For instance, as far as I know, a type of sword belonging solely to ninjas did not exist. However, despite these trifling details, this is a truly wonderful film, absolutely dazzling, and I give it five out of five stars. I would recommend it not only to those interested in Japan, samurai, and all you war movie fans, but to any one looking to see a really good film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely under-rated... somewhat violent","review":"A very well crafted movie, with so many parallels to the spiritual life, especially the priesthood. I was particularly struck by its romantic view of an idealized lost culture, juxtaposed against modern industry and greedy politicians, which served as a warning against the dangers of Utilitarianism (which pope John Paul II spent so much time speaking out against in his writings)."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT","review":"got in on time, great condition. great pricing as well and it is exactly what i thought i would get!!

The characters in this film are unrealistic and silly. The story is cheap and trite. If you like an action comic, this is a good movie to watch, but if you like a realistic samurai drama, you are in for disappointment. The movie makes samurai look like war-happy idiots.

Much has been written about \\"Braveheart Visits Japan\\" and as much as I hate to admit it, the suggestion fits. I have always enjoyed the spirit of Tom Cruise, but he lets me down in this movie, despite his clear effort to lift it above the action flick genre. It does not inspire. It does not engage. It does not even entertain too well, although the choreography of the fight sequences is very good.

Gee, maybe that is why he has never won an academy award.....has he ever been nominated? I don't think so.......The only redeeming part of this film was the story, the wonderful scenery, and the supporting cast.

The story line is very much like \\"Dances With Wolves\\" in the way that Tom Cruise makes a transformation from a \\"Bad Guy\\" in the beginning and becomes a \\"Good Guy\\" later on in the film as he joins up with the loyal Japanese samurai soldiers.The direction is poetic and confident. Cruise is serviceable, but not memorable. The real steal in the film is the acting by Ken Watanabe. His character really moves and enlightens you. There's an effortless grace that he posesses.I would recommend this film to anyone who likes sweeping epic dramas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top Gun with Samuri Swords","review":"This film started out interesting and good,and then just became \\"Top Gun\\".While interesting historically,this film lacked everything else,and just followed the basic \\"Hollywood\\" formula.It was also unrealistic to believe Tom Cruise's character(a troubled,raging alcoholic) could learn the art&skill of a Samuri Worrior in just a few short months of time.The film followed all the basic plot outlines of Top Gun,just like \\"Days of Thunder\\",and I was rolling my eyes towards the end.It sounds great on a home theater system,but this is'nt one I'd want to buy&keep forever.Buy&own at your own risk,but there are better Jappanese Samuri films out there like \\"The Seven Samuri\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT EPIC MOVIE","review":"I rank this movie right up there with Braveheart and Gladiator as far as epics go. At first I thought this was going to be one of those \\"face time\\" movies just to get a paycheck for Tom Cruise, but to my suprise it was a great movie. While watching this movie I actually learned something, which I wasn't expecting, and that was that the samurai were alot like the native americans in the ways that they were removed from their own land.This is one of the best movies to come out in the last couple of years and a breath of fresh air compared to those movies like Master and Commander that claimed to be action movies but were really just \\"face time\\" for their leading man."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Samurai is Ken Watanabe","review":"(...)Ken Watanabe is the true last samurai in this film (and was nominated for best actor in a supporting role) All the Japanese warriors in the final battle scene all commit seppuku instead of being captured. Cruise pops up like a drunken soldier.Cruise is as always easy on the eyes but does not convince as a Samurai Warrior. He's a lover not a warrior...There are also bits of humor in this film added by Cruise that seems totally out of place. I love him in every movie but this one is not his best.Also Academy Nominated for Costume Design, Art Direction, andSound Mixing. This is no Kurosawa Samurai epic if that's what you're looking for but I sill like the attempt!I totally agree with the Dances with Wolves analogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE YEAR!","review":"I have never been a Tom Cruise fan.....until now! The Last Samurai is one of the best movies I have ever seen and it is by far Tom Cruise's best role. Also adding to the film's greatness is the performance by KEN WATANABE as Katsumoto.

It is one that you will want to watch over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Trying to make a film about honor? Please","review":"This film is an absolute load of steamer. I died laughing watching it at the theater, and then again when i saw it on dvd. Tom Cruise, arguably the most over-rated actor in the past 50 years, would have been waxed in the scene where he is taken hostage to start with. the very ethic the movie takes such pains to over-illustrate would have had it no other way. the japanese guys did a decent job, but i couldn't help but think they were just there to cash hollywood checks. It is rather like when American actors come to Japan to do a friggin car commercial. There is no critical fallout, so why bother?

Once again, a formerly evil American U.S. Army officer comes to the aid of an indigenous people who are threatened by evil predatory U.S. imperialism. At least that is what the filmmakers would like you to believe.Actually, the Japanese samurai were an oppressor class in their own right. The samurai preyed on the peasants. Eventually, as reformers took hold in 19th Century Japan, a new national army based on the peasantry was formed. When the samurai rose in revolt against the reform government and attempted to restore their traditional privileges. the national army defeated them.The Last Samurai fails as both movie and history.

The last battle field is totally ridiculous; yes, R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S. All the samurai are killed (in such a way) except Tom Cruise (still alive)?!?!?! How many people can survive such an attack (heavy open fire) if this was real? I was amazed to see Tom Cruise walking into the Emperor Meiji's chamber and proudly presented himself as the last samurai the end of the film.

This movie is Japan from eyes of American, not bushido, NOT TRUE SAMURAI, not the heart of Japan. Japanese emperor and bushido are not heterogenous, this movie mislead of Japan conception. Why ninja attacking village? Was this still playing active part in Japan which became Meiji? -No. The scene when children eat meal without having a rice bowl in left hand, this is very ill mannered in Japanese meal, and this also Samurai's child? -No. To say \\"This Hollywood film drew the heart of Japan or samurai correctly\\" is profanity to the samurai who fought for the resturation of Japan. --- A rental is enough, I think we see only one time even if we buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good Movie, but...","review":"i may pick this film, but I think that certain things take away from the overall story. first, i think it would have been better completely without Tom Cruise's character. Just Ken Watanabe's character. Secondly, there was this one part where you watch Tom Cruise fight some guys, then directly after, you have to watch it over again. it was supposed to add dramatic effect, but i hated it. i already saw it once, why do i have to see it again? finally, the ending sucked. it was just Tom Cruise acting like he was an angry drunk and it didn't make any sense why he didn't die. Ken Watanabe's character was actually cool, why did he die and Tom Cruise live? other than that, it was a pretty good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story; Bad Execution","review":"Tom Cruise is miscast here. The long battle scenes were gruesome and gratuitous. The story was nearly lost as a result.What we get with modern action/adventure/war films is a sensory assult. They're loud and excessive and overdone in every way. Look at old movies when directors had respect for the audience and the point of the movie was the story. I'm tired of being masturbated upon by these modernists. I'm not seeing any more new movies until I see more of the great old ones. I recently saw Paths of Glory with Kirk Douglas/directed by Stanley Kubrick. Although Kubrick was certainly a bit twisted himself and some of his later films showed it, this early film is a success. I'd recommend it, not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu","review":"There is nothing bad about this movie, except it is extremely predictable, especially if you have seen 'Dances With Wolves'.

The development of the movie at the beginning was good, the first battle scene being very good, actually. That really set the stage for Cruise's character to evolve, arch, etc., but it fell short and didn't come full circle for me. We see Tom Cruise as a victim at first and then a willing participant with a foreign culture, very similar to Dances With Wolves. I would have liked to have seen a lot more detail about his assimilation and the family that took him in. The \\"heart\\" of the movie was moving, and it has an ending that stuns the viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth a try","review":"Even with all the negative attention Cruise has been garnering lately it's hard to see why people wouldn't see this film.

Tom Cruise excelled as the leading role. He brought humor, emotion, and charisma to his part that I really didn't think he could pull off. All of the Japanese Samurai characters were great and you will come to love them as the movie goes along. You can see why Cruise's character would rather live with them than his own people. The action scenes were awesome, but much more gory than even I expected. Those samurai swords can do some gruesome things. The movie is never boring, and it managed to keep my attention for the full 2 hours and 30 minutes.

After warranty period you have to shell out about $90 -$100 to get a new print head if it should need replacing. Add that along with the cost of ink and you could be talking about a printer thats expensive to maintain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better prints than darkroom.","review":"By now you've read the other complimentary reviews of other users. I am a darkroom photoprinter from the \\"old days\\" and I never had better results (or as easy) with regular photopaper. The output from two different digital cameras is stunning (3.1 megapixel) The question of various print media problems threw me in deciding to buy, but I have now used both Canon's and Kodak's paper with startling results - although print settings for these two papers differs -- you must use Kodak's or Canon's recommended settings for Kodak papers. Printer cost of $$$with $$$ rebate at [local store] makes it excellent buy. Kodak Premium paper right now at [local store] is $$$ for 100 sheets. Whoops this won't help Amazon in [local store] sales areas. Might be better printers but that would be hard to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Output","review":"I don't own this printer - but a friend does. This printer is way way better than similarly priced epsons and HP's. Using the right media and settings, the photos printed on gizmo will blow you way.However, I decided not to purchase this printer when I found that costco will print 4X6's and 8X12's (off digital media) for rather low prices in their one hr photo lab. I can always do the cropping/balancing at home, take the CD-R to them - and get a huge numbers of prints - just for the cost of owning this printer. And I am not even factoring the cost of media and ink in the equation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF CANON S800 Series PRINTERS - NO INK AVAILABLE","review":"Do not buy Canon S800 series printers until they are forced to allow others to produce their proprietary ink cartridges. We have had our S800 printer for a year now and we have had nearly three m0nths of down time because Canon has been out of stock on the black ink four time. Their claim of a 25 year life for photos is great but beware of that too. We find that our S800 only prints on Canon paper - which is extremely expensive. I do not know if they have changed this with the S820 but it is a big problem with the S800. Very poor customer service and support from Canon makes a canon photo printer purchase a very bad idea. The color is not true to life and the text is blurry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon S820 bit the dust just after warranty expired","review":"I purchase the Canon S820 (for close to ...[undisclosed dollar amount])when it was first introduced in late March of 2002. Two weeks after the warranty expired...it bit the dust. I had a Canon bubble jet printer prior to purchasing the S820 and had a similar experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using Kodak Paper on Canon Printer","review":"I purchased this printer to replace an HP895 that I used for printing photos, after reading the reviews and trying it myself, I agree that the best results are from Canon Paper, but since I had about 50 sheets of Kodak paper laying around I thought I would see how good it could print with Kodak paper. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Investment!","review":"I would strongly recommend that you do not purchase this printer. While the quality of print is good, it goes through black ink cartridges ($12 a pop) at about 1 every 2 weeks. Besides the cost--this is really a pain in the behind since it doesn't give you any warning; it just stops printing and tells you in replace the cartridge before it will print again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big bang for the buck","review":"I bought this printer about a month ago and have been very happy with it. The S820 is very easy to set up. The photo-print quality is excellent, especially when you consider the price of this model. Sure, you can spend a lot more for a photo printer. But the law of diminishing returns applies, meaning you're going to be paying hundreds more for just a little bit better print quality. I should mention the S820 does not come with a printer cable, so you'll have to factor that into the total cost.If you want to save a little more money, I would recommend using Canon Photo Paper Plus. It generally costs less than Photo Paper Pro and the print quality is almost as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this printer unless you have money to throw away.","review":"I purchased my Canon S820 printer one year ago for about twice the price they are selling for now. The print quality is excellent as long as you use Canon ink and paper which is expensive and hard to find in a lot of places. Two days after the warranty ran out, I started having problems, and was informed by Canon Tech Support that I needed to purchase a new print head. The cost of a new print head is $80.00! For what I paid for this printer, I would have expected it to last more than 1 year. I feel like I've thrown away a lot of money for a piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"get it while it lasts","review":"Wonderful deal on a printer. The replacement for this printer (S820D, I think) gives direct print, but who needs it? Canon definitely has a leg up on other manufacturers with speed of printing without any loss of print quality. I use the printer with OS X on a Mac. Nothing negative I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent output, short life--beware","review":"I've had this printer for about 18 months and have been very satisfied with the quality of photos. However, the printhead has died, and replacing it will cost me more than the printer originally did. This seems to be a common problem with these printers (see fixyourownprinter.com), and Canon doesn't seem at all apologetic. Making printers that are intended to be thrown away after a year or two is not a responsible corporate practice, so I'm going to be shopping around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book; Good Translation; Decent notes","review":"This stunning novel about the Vicmonte de Valmont and theMarquise de Merteuil's adventure in attempting to lure a pure heartedgirl into bed; is incredibly well written and exhillirating to read.In a story of lies, deceit, and sex; it is impossible to be boredreading this epistocple work of literature.

I bought his last doll stroller used and it lasted him a year and a half of heavy use. (Lots of running back and forth to the park and up and down our sidewalk.) This stroller lasted approximately ONE HOUR before one of the back axles bent, causing one of the wheels to stop turning. And that was just a little light use on the sidewalk in front of the house. Junk, pure and simple. Don't waste your time or money. I only wish I could find a durable toy stroller. Anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best 23 mth old's gift!","review":"We are worried that we will never be able to match this gift again!

It came very quickly and works nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best For 1-2yos; Good value for money","review":"This light blue stroller complements the other pink items I have for my 15 month old daughter. It is easy to use, and is the right height for her to push around the house, or when visiting friends. I would recommend it not be used outside on hard surfaces (grass ok), because that will impact its durability. Like other reviewers, it takes one or two tries at first to fold down the stroller but after that it's a cinch. I also purchased a Fisher Price 'My First Bear' to go with the stroller, also in light blue and she loves it, taking it everywhere, and having lots of fun. Overall, I recommend this product.

Everything I found locally was pink.This stroller has been very popular at our house. It was one of the most played with things at my son's second birthday party (by other boys). Of course this typically means random items like blocks or sippy cups are raced around the house in the stroller, versus a small cuddly animal or doll.One star is deducted for durability. A rip developed in the fabric the first day my son used this toy. This was hastened by the tot putting his toddler butt in the seat and trying to push himself around, but it still seems a little flimsy given that it's inevitable that toddlers are going to try sitting in this type of item at some point. Ripping the first time it happens does not seem right to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome doll stroller","review":"My 15-month old nephew loves this stroller.

Unfortunately, his one true love (and hottest sex partner) is married and doesn't love him back. This isn't really a \\"gay\\" novel, but has some pretty explicit same-sex (and hetero sex) scenes.

Some are very good (chapter 15 on reusability) and others are horrible (chapter 5). I suggest skimming through this book at a store to find if it has some articles of interest to you. It is certainly not a tutorial (hence the title \\"Advanced\\"). Programming is not a very debatable topic, so anytime you find an author who challenges common established practices, be wary of him.

As soon as I opened the box I knew I had been ripped off. If you do some research you will find that there are several fake Epiphone Zakk Wylde Les Pauls being sold on the internet and it just so happened that I recieved one. The pickups sounded like crap, the volume knobs didn't work properly, there were flaws in the finish and there were several epiphone emblems that gave it away as a fake.I was able to return the guitar for a refund, luckily.

John Huston, after a faltering period in his long directing career, regained peak form late in his career with this, one of his most notable and memorable works.In contrast, the DVD barely gets a 1-star rating. It is unbelievable that Warners is still selling this long-toothed, single-layered, minimal-extras, side-flipping 11-year-old edition that should have been withdrawn 10 YEARS AGO!The movie, and we consumers, deserve far better than this. Come on, guys at Warners, set things right and bring out the DVD edition (yes, DVD -- along with Blue-ray) this movie sorely warrants!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie.... but its a flipper!","review":"I love this movie, and while remastering the audio would have helped (perhaps) the biggest disappointment for me was that the copy I received (and perhaps all copies?) was a flipper.

I don't normally collect DVDs, but I bought this one because The Man Who Would Be King is my favorite movie. What a disappointment that in 2010 anyone would simply re-issue an archaic \\"flipper\\" disc. Not only that, but it is highly edited and the video quality is mediocre at best (I realize allowances must be made for a 35 year old movie, but still, it should be better than this). If you wish to purchase this movie, I would HIGHLY recommend that you pre-order the blu-ray disc. If you need to watch it now, rent it. Don't waste your money on this poor quality DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they wreck a great movie?","review":"About an hour and 11 minutes into the film, it suddenly stops dead. Thought the DVD was defective and called Amazon. After looking into, here's the story: you have to go to your DVD player, hit eject, flip the DVD over and the movie continues. Give me a break! It's only a 90-minute movie. Guess they copied (literally) the old LaserDisc version, where you had to also flip over the LaserDisc at the 60-minute spot due to storage limitations. But on today's DVD? Wondered why it was priced so cheap for a new DVD on Amazon and this is the reason.The movie is a classic, no doubts, they just wrecked it with how you have to view it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Caine and Sean Connery","review":"Both are superb actors. Combining them into this story of two ex military in the colony of India, hoping to make their fortune in the wilds of India is the makings of an excellent movie. The actors and plot do not disappoint! And for an American, the accents only add to the exotic nature of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"caine, connery, and plummer give performances of a lifetime","review":"Director John Huston originally was going to make this with Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable in the leads. Thank God that project never gelled. Caine, Connery, and Plummer were born for their roles. This should be required viewing by any whose country is debating whether to enter another land as friend or foe. Based on a story by Kipling, whose time in the British Empire's India provided many an insight to man's folly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Rudyard Kipling protrayed by a classic cast","review":"Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer directed by John Huston. . . It doesn't get much better than this! The movie is an old fashioned adventure tale centering around two ex-British army pals trying to make (or steal) their fortune in India. Sean Connery's character is mistaken for a returning god by a tribe in the remote mountains of Kafiristan. Unfortunatley, the character starts to believe that he just might be destined to rule. Trivia buffs should pay close attention to the native girl who is the object of Sean Connery's affection. She is Shakira Caine, a former beauty queen and Michael Caine's real life wife at the time this movie was made."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible film!","review":"This is a terrible movie! I can't believe that a director as respectable as the great John Huston would make something this ridiculous. This film is the epitomy of the idea of \\"The White Man's Burden.\\" This film shows Eastern cultures to be cruel, uncivilized, and lack intelligence. I went into this film thinking it would be a great adventure. Instead, at the end I felt like vomiting! Being an Indian and an American; I felt very offended that they were basically glorifying Alexander the \\"Tyrant\\" as a \\"god.\\" I fail to understand why a man like Rudyard Kipling is considered a great writer. I wish I could give this NO STARS. John, I'll pretend you never made this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"here you have one of the greatest movies ever made, a wonderful tory, you set the dvd into the machine and, amazingly, without any packaging warning, you have to flip the dvd to watch it in its entirety. why time warner continues to distribute so many of these flaws dvd products is beyond me but i strongly recommend no one buy these screwed up products until they correct the problem by re-releasing the dvd on a one-sided version. just plain stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great great film, so so DVD - with one startling omission","review":"This is, of course, a great film, with every aspect of what makes a great film fully exploited. But I did discover something strange on the DVD - there is an entire scene missing. After Sean Connery falls from the bridge, instead of the process shot that shows him falling in slow-motion and the crown falling from his head (which is in every version of the film I've ever seen) the scene dissolves to Christopher Plummer listening to the final words of Michael Caine's narration. What happened to the scene?? Why would it have been removed?? My only other quibble about the DVD is that the sound is not very full. It is an early release DVD so in subsequent releases they might address that issue, but PUT BACK THE MISSING SCENE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A FIVE STAR CLASSIC on a 1 STAR DVD","review":"This was one of my favorites, and a \\"must have\\" in my DVD library. The story is still great,and the dialog between \\"Peachy\\" and \\"Daniel\\" is still among my favorites still.But the DVD was dissappointing. The movie is split on two sides, and has to be flipped to view the remainder of the film.The DVD only has Dolby 1.0 Sound (Digital but MONO)and apparently very weak in the mix. Overall a better picture than my old worn VHS, but very weak audio overall.The menu's and commentary are hard to read, and there were points in the movie where the transfer to DVD looked \\"jumpy\\".More than disappointing presentation overall.This deserves a \\"director's cut\\", or an audio remix to serve those of us who will cherish whatever copy we have, forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"The only negative thing that I have to say about this item was the extremely poor sound quality. The TV volume was at its max and we could just hear the movie. I wish that I had complained a lot earlier and had sent it back for a replacement. It really is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic film, but KEY scene deleted! (thus loses a star)","review":"An absolute classic for all the reasons cited by most reviewers on this page. But I was astonished to see that on this DVD (issued almost ten years ago) a key scene near the end of the film is deleted. A character is falling in slow motion while there is voice-over narration by Michael Caine.The scene is incredibly powerful and among the most memorable cinema moments I've had. But gone from this print. Evidently still on old VHS versions.Still a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cracking movie, bold, impressive and unusual...","review":"This wonderful movie, unlike any other (Zulu was good but this is in a different class althogether). Great visuals, stunning scenes, beautiful cinematography, a compelling script & story and the some of the very best actors (particularly Connery & Caine) at their best. This is not formula Hollywood dross. Nice finishing scene too. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous and tragic Kipling romp/moral tale","review":"Sean Connery and Michael Caine are beautifully cast in this old-timey adventure movie, set in remote Kafiristan. They play a pair of rogues in the grand tradition of epic movies in this satire of British Imperialism. It's very, very funny, and also very sad: a tale that proves the old adage Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. What begins as a romp ends as a tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THE ENDING?","review":"The first side of the DVD worked perfectly fine. I tried to watch the second part of the movie on the other side of the DVD, but to no avail. The picture \\"froze\\" after four minutes of viewing the movie. I tried viewing the DVD on the other two DVD players in my home, but once again, the picture froze during the same scene. I asked two different friends to try the DVD on their players, just to be certain I was not having technical problems in my home. Both friends were unable to view the movie in its entirety. What is the ending of the story? I enjoyed watching the first part of the movie and would very much appreciate being able to view the entire movie, as would my friends. I am curious about the ending to the movie, therefore extremely disappointed in my DVD purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"This movie is a classic and it also contains great actors. It is set in India and Eastern Europe. The time is post WWI and follows the characthers through their travels among the native peoples of the region. It explores the misconceptions and morals taught by the Freemasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"the man who would be king","review":"I was very disappointed with this movie. It only went to chapter 21 and then I got all kinds of garbage, Humphrey bogart and all kinds of nonsense flashing on. I am not a happy Camper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connery Classic","review":"You won't find a better or more entertaining movie than this one...that is, if you like Sean Connery (much as he was in the Great Train Robbery) and Rudyard Kipling's special prose and prowess as a teller of tales. The DVD is disappointing only in the scene that was omitted...the one, near the end. Alas for such an omission.Still...an excellent addition to the collection. Good viewing on a rainy Saturday afternoon or a snowy winter weekend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two giants in a BIG BIG movie","review":"John Huston always wanted to make this movie and waited years for the opportunity. I'm glad he finally did the business with it, because it's something of a minor classic. Not a Sean Connery film. Not a Michael Caine film. Who would have thought these two stars could successfully be cast together. Both actors always seem to be themselves on the screen, but in MWWBK they seem to live their roles. Neither dominates the other. Both are indispensible. The photography is superb. Did I say four stars, very nearly five. I'll have to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie ruined","review":"This is a Flipper Disc! I hate flipper discs! The movie is only 2 hours and 9 minutes long, yet they split it up on both sides of the dvd. And this seems to be the only version available. This great movie is way overdo for an overhaul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone stole this from me and I was not upset because it meant someone has a great movie","review":"This movie is a Sean Connery, Michael Caine, John Huston masterpiece.A great movie for a child that reads and wants to see the British Empire from the British point of view with soaring vistas and strange peoples when the dragons still occupied the unknown spots on the map.There is much there for adults in that it is a masterpiece movie, created with meticulous by a master with no lame special effects.What one of these movies should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time favorite!!!","review":"I must admit that this movie has it all. Drama, humor, suspense, cinematography, and fine acting. What amazes me most is that so few people recall ever seeing this movie when it came out but once they see it on video they are amazed at the magnitude of it's greatness. It truly should be considered one of the all-time great movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL MOVIE","review":"it's a must see. Shawn Connery is a wonderful actor. A very entertaining film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting Human Interaction","review":"This movie grabs your attention because it presents a wonderful interraction between the opposities of wealth, culture, and religion. The cinematography is excellent, and allows the movie to yank you out of your suburban existence and throw you into an exciting other world. It's in my top 10 list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously Awsome!","review":"This classic is awsome. The game play is fun and unique with all the funny catch phrases and interesting characters. The game comes with Serious Sam: The First Encounter and Serious Sam: The Second Encounter. Both games installed and ran without any problems under Windows Vista 64bit and Windows 7 64bit.

The version (not included) in questions is the heavy censor TV version. Instead of \\"weed\\" they are carrying \\"diamonds\\". That version has a better soundtrack as well. Also, cartoons, and more UFO scenes. Usually censorship makes for a bad movie, but in this case it makes for a totally stupid, great, awesome movie. It just proves how far censors would go in the 1980's. Universal should release a disc with both \\"classic\\" versions. Oh, and Edie McClurg is great in this one!

This is their funniest movie and was a big box office hit. It captures the spirit of 1980(the year it was released in) perfectly, which was a world before AIDS, widespread herpes, and massive corporate firings (downsizing). Pure cotton candy for the brain. Their later films had haphazard plots, this has enough of one to keep the action moving along at a steady clip. Paul Reubens featured before he hit it big as Pee Wee Herman. Plenty of laughs, good enough to watch every few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wacky Tobacy Version","review":"There are two version of this movie out there.

Basically this film is a series of loosely tied together lowbrow comic vignettes, some involving dope, some not, centered around some colorful L.A. locales. Cheech does double duty here by playing both himself and his Texas cousin,Red. Film is also notable for an early appearance by Paul Reubens as Pee Wee Herman, albeit foul-mouthed. Michael Winslow a.k.a the sound-effects guy from the \\"Police Academy\\" movies has a hilarious bit at the welfare office. Edie McLurg is also hilarious as an oblivious middle-aged WASP that Chong and Red meet along the way. The laugh quotient here is pretty high but it's unfortunate that Universal did not include any extras here(not even a trailer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly spiritual movie","review":"It amazes me how people, fail to seewhat movies are really about.I choose to remain anonymous.I\`m tired of being nuked by those whoare unreasonable.

It has great acting, visual effects, and action sequences, and does tend to surprise you in some scenes. For example, I had seen it several times on TV, that when I saw it on Video for the first time, Barbara Bach's breast-exposing bathtub scene caught me off guard (the first thing I said after seeing this scene on Video was \\"Lord Have Mercy!\\" But I do have to admit, she's a good-looking woman). Also, the Dam sequence was awesome! Recommended to all history buffs. Grade: A-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the name \\" Navarone\\"","review":"An extremely poor follow up of the original \\" Guns of Navarone\\", the simplistic plot and fiented realism of this film knock the points off.

This movie is so far off track of the story line of the book that it should have a different title. It was obviously low budget with most of their money going for Robert Shaw and Ford but they completely wrote out the most colorful character in the book..Andreas Stavros, Anthony Quinn's character in the Guns of Navarone. I have never seen a worse adaptation of a book into film. Don't waste your time on the movie, the book can be purchased cheaply on the net and is a mighty fine read for adventure junkies."},{"rating":"2","title":"FORCE 10 ...

Notable that the Partisans (Communist anti-nazis) are portrayed as purely heroic, while the Chetniks (anti-communist anti-nazis) are shown as purely evil. In fact the film portrays the Chetniks as in essence a German auxiliary force--very very few historians would agree with that idea. But then, if you're filming on location in a Yugoslavia under Marshall Tito's communist dictatorship I guess you have to toe the local ideological line.

But I've always felt it is a fun action-adventure film with a great cast and fantastic vistas of the Yugoslavian countryside. Critics have lambasted it as being a highly inferior sequel to one of the classic war movies of the 60's, and maybe some of that criticism has some merit. Yet \\"Force 10 from Navarone\\" as viewed on its own merits without the comparisons to \\"Guns\\" is not too shabby. A straight-foward action story of an Allied force consisting of two British commandoes (Robert Shaw and Edward Fox), an American Ranger (Harrison Ford), and an escaped American prisoner (Carl Weathers) trying help Yugoslavian partisans blow-up a bridge to foil a German offensive. It's not Oscar material, but it is fun and definetly not as bad as the critics claimed."},{"rating":"2","title":"World War II Commando Movie. Early Harrison Ford work.","review":"Ford gives a good performance as a World War II American Ranger Officer sent behind enemy lines to aid the resistance with some demolition. This early performance, done in the middle of the Star War movies, forshadows the Harrison that is not Han Solo, but more of a 'gun using' CIA intelligence officer or 'take no prisoner's' future President. In this story, Ford unexpectedly ends up with two crafty English soldiers (Robert Shaw) attached to his Ranger unit with their own 'secret' mission; to kill a possible double agent (Franko Nero, Camelot). Lots of plot twists, good World War II movie. No significant errors in technique or history that distract from the movie.

Shots that may seem awesome on an 8 story screen look pretty routine on a widescreen TV. The documentary is only 40 minutes long or less than you can see every week on PBS Nature, Animal Planet, Discovery, etc. every week and the material is no better.

It removes a basic contradiction: If belief in God causes the \\"evil\\" in Atlas shrugged, why does the Catholic faith argue against the same evil. Simple, Rand was wrong.The book attacks Objectivism, but does not argue against Rand's true genius -- her ability to get inside the head of New Age man and describe and explain this evil being.The book does answer the question on universals. The observations on memory are brilliant.Examples of the new philosophy of Factivism include: \\"Name a nonexistant fact\\" answer the Past.The only reason for the four stars is that the book is hard to read.

I can only laugh when I hear Kamal singing \\"Early Libra\\" - it is pseudo-spiritual dross, no doubt written in good faith, but so maudlin as to beggar belief. Hallmark Card sentiments dressed in orchestral excess.These albums have dated very, very badly.

But ... does it work ... oh ya ... every time. You know why ... because having with you at all times is effortless. I prefer this red Pocket Pal to the aluminum Secretary because the red version is thicker in the hand and pocket. I should say I am a long time, happy, repeat customer of Victorinox. I use the small blade for non-food cutting, and the large blade for cutting fruits and vegetables. These are the ever sharp Victorinox SS blades and as such will easily handle a myriad of activities. No fancy locking systems, no fancy assisted opening systems, not intended to intimidate in any way imaginable.

No Bradbury book -- novel or short story anthology-- has ever better encapsulated this remarkably individual talent, one of our greatest \\"artful naif\\" story-tellers, and the original cover art provided with this edition seems, even after all these many years, to fit the stories contained inside with a unique and preternatural appositeness.

It's less expensive as well. William Miller's book has gorgeous artwork and pictures, but it seems his preeminace as ship historian as made him rather blase. This book is much better for reasearch, although both are still a decade out of date. It does not solve the mystery of why the Germans sold the beautiful 1980 Europa and built the misproportioned 1997 version. The multitude of well shot photos, as well as the fact that many are appearing for the first time, make up for not being as pretty as Mr. Miller's work. Definately worth the time to acquiant yourself with one of the most important but underrated passenger marines of the past two centuries."},{"rating":"2","title":"all in all i was quite impressed with this film","review":"Although the movie had some akward moments when the lines just didn't feel quite right, it did have something that most vampire flicks just don't have. It didn't feel like one big sex and gore fest. Whether entirely successful or not it did feel as though the movie was trying to say something and not just fill a theater. One thing i judge movies by is if they leave me thinking, this movie has remained rolling around my mind for several days now. All in all i would definitly recommend this if you are in the mood for a different sort of vampire movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly different vampyre fare","review":"Firstly, I am a great fan of Julian Sands, so it was only a matter of time before I discovered this wonderful film. 'Tale of a Vampire' avoids the usual blood-'n'-guts stuff, instead we get a beautifully filmed Gothic romance, without fangs (yes, NO fangs!), or contact lenses. Naturally there is a fair amount of blood, but then what do you expect? Cranham's performance is equally brooding and dark, as the sinister Edgar, who's hunting Alex (Sands). However, the film gets a bit slow at times and it seems we are forever in the Library set of the film. Moody, gorgeous and with stygian quality, 'Tale of a Vampire' shouldn't be overlooked. The acting is well done and it's nice to see that the vampire isn't ALWAYS the monster of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"I saw a few high rating reviews but found this a slow and dull storyline and movie.

The premise is not incredibly new. An ancient vampire finds a lookalike of his long lost love and proceeds to pursue her. Through twists and turns that seem to plod on forever we eventually come to the inevitable conclusion of the movie . . . and how many \\"happily ever afters\\" have there been in vampire films? Not your usual fare and incredibly slow paced, the film is interesting but you probably could only sit through it once . . . with the benefit of the fast forward button if you're an impatient viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO!","review":"Great acting and directing make this tragic movie absorbing.This viewer definitely recommends this to any Julian Sands fan and purveyor of vampire fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Love Story!","review":"Julian Sands as Alex the vampire is so emotional.

The Epson 1650 clearly the best. Returned it primarilly to check out Canon - same brand as my printer, but the Epson also had software issues. Since the return, Epson has released the 1660 which added USB 2.0 and apparently resolved some of the software issues as few reviews note software problems.

I now have printed them and have beautiful photos of a special day. Can't wait to dig out my old negatives from 30 yrs ago and print the photos. Just hope the negatives have held up thru the years. The scanner was ez to setup and get running. I like the photo programs that came on the disk. When you scan negatives, make sure you follow the directions and place them face down. It does affect the results. I am not so concerned with scan time as some seem to be. I can always find something to do while the scanner does it's job.

Mario is a weakling, a man who is so afraid of losing Blanca, his wife, that he will not be himself. There are times when he seems to want to quit this masochistic relationship, and face losing his wife in order to be himself and live his real life, but he never does it. The one redeeming moment when he would tell his spoiled, purposeless, drug-alcohol-sex addicted wife to walk out the door, never comes to the dismay of this reader and those other readers who have to put up with two of the most pitiful characters in contemporary Spanish narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"This product was not what I thought it would be.

I'm tired of compilations by the Guess Who, they may give us the great singles, but there were even greater album cuts that are ignored on these \\"hits\\" compilations, and I want to hear them as they appeared on the album. My advice is: forget the album compilations, buy a record turntable, then go to a used record dealer and buy the original albums on vinyl, transfer them to tape, and burn them onto a recordable CD.

Within minutes, I had the lights on, my hands over my eyes and the volume muted. The atmosphere created in this film had me almost blubbering. I'm not exagerating. I know some people will be like \\"whatever\\", but if you have an attention span longer than that of your usual mindless MTV addict, then maybe you can feel the tingling thrill of terror creeping up and down your spine. The opening scene alone set the mood for the entire film. And simple sounds and visuals can jolt you into panic. See the film, show your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"mildly creepy, not scary","review":"As a fan of Japanese cinema, I really wanted to enjoy this movie, especially since I'd read that it is much better then the American remake (which I haven't seen). Unfortunately, Ringu starts off nicely, but runs out of steam by the end of the film. There are a couple of genuinely creepy moments, but nothing approaching \\"scary\\". If you want to see good Japanese horror, try \\"Ichi the Killer\\", or if gore isn't your thing, the stark eerieness of \\"Onibaba\\" is much more unsettling than anything offered by Ringu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the remake","review":"Hollywood seems to have lost the ability to make a decent horror flick in recent years. Japan, however, does an exceptional job of turning out high-quality, moody horror. Ringu is a perfect example of this. Subdued and moody, Ringu is one of the spookiest movies I've seen in years. Seeing the buzz generated by it and its sequels, Hollywood decided it could do a better job, bought the rights, and threw out a hack version of a truly enjoyable film. Ringu works because of its subtlety and atmosphere. While some may be turned off by the supernatural/psychic aspects, they work within the scope of the movie. Both Ringu and The Ring made my skin crawl, but for much different reasons--Ringu, because it worked so well, and The Ring because it didn't. The DVD is barebones, but the movie and chills are worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to japanese cinema","review":"I bought a bootleg copy of this film a long time ago before it was available here because people said it was the scariest movie ever made. I love Japanese movies so I thought it would be great. But it doesn't have the same flavor as other Japanese movies. Actually, it seems more like a [bad] american movie. No wonder why hollywood remade it. The US version is better in a way. The ending is better in Ringu, but the rest of the movie is better in the remake. But to tell you the truth they are both pretty [terrible]. I just don't find an evil video tape scary. Sorry. If you want to get good Japanese films, get Battle Royale, Ichi the Killer, Tetsuo: the Iron Man, Tokyo Fist, Visitor Q, Wild Zero, STacy, and Junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the re-make","review":"Everyone knows about The Ring, but few in america has had the privelege of viewing the japanese one.Well they weren't really missing anything. I couldn't stop laughing at all the cheeziness, and fakeness of this movie. I was cracking uo the entire time. Even the psychological horror in the film was laughable. This is just not at the same caliber as the re-make, and as rare as this is the re-make surpases the original. This one is boring, fake, and humorous. To call this the scariest movie ever, you'd have to be a 3 year old kid who hasn't seen any movie yet. Other than that the only thing this film accomplishes is putting it's viewer to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you've seen the american version......","review":"then you've seen this movie. except for the esp that the ex-husband exhibits, and the truly creepy girl, this is pretty much the american remake. i liked this one better, it was more atmospheric. it didn't rely on shocking makeup to get the point across. and the flashback history of the esp in the girl was nice (you see none of that in the remake). the esp connection that the ex-husband forged, first with the girl, then between his ex and the girl, was also really nice. this one wasn't dumbed down to explain every little detail to the audience, as the american version was (whorywood seems to think it's audience is stupid), and the actors were very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary Movie!!!!!","review":"I think this movie is the most scary movie I have ever seen.

The Ring is FAR SCARIER than the lame Ringu, and yes I have seen both versions, and this one sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please!","review":"I too purchased this movie after reading so many great reviews. Gosh! Were we watching the same film? In a word, it stinks. Perhaps, if one spoke Japanese, it may have been a decent film, but the subtitling is the worst I have ever witnessed. Half sentences? Please. Perhaps one out of twenty lines are eventranslated, and those curiously unimportant. Without subtitling, the plot is almost impossible to decipher, and once you do, it's not scary at all. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORROR-IBLE!","review":"I rented this movie because I had read all of the reviews and a lot of people said that this was scary, so I thought I would give it a try.Well, first of all, it is subtitled, so you don't know what they are saying, unless you've seen the American version. And being subtitled, all of your attention goes into reading them.Second of all, there are no special effects or make-up, so if you think that Japanese people are scary, then you should watch this.And third, this movie is very boring, i almost fell asleep four or five times watching it.The only good part of the movie was the very end, because it was a little scary, and that is were it got the 1 and only star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad movie","review":"I give this movie only 1 star for effort or else it would have gotten 1/2 star. This movie does not attempt to be scary, it's extremely boring, and LACKS special effects--a supernatural movie DOES need special effects, crime dramas don't. I've read the reviews on this site about this movie being better than the American version...no way. The cultural differences make it difficult to have empathy for the characters. Is it a rentable movie??? It's your call, but I would not suggest it."},{"rating":"1","title":"[aweful]","review":"Not scary at all. The American Version is SO MUCH SCARIER THAN THIS LAUGH FEST!

Sarah Michelle Gellar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The original is unmatched","review":"I disagree with the ones who didn't find the original at least as good as the American remake. This is Japan, my fellows, and you should understand that you are dealing with a different prospective of life. I think that the original \\"Ringu\\" is without the shadow of a doubt an excellent film, a film with no needs of strong effects or whatever to make you fell very uncomfortable during the view. I rate it very high : I have watched it five times so far and I have always enjoyed it as the first one. Very very scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"persistantly creepy","review":"What many of you do not know is that long draping hair over your face and white dress is quintessential \\"classic\\" female oriental ghost. These ghosts usually appear crying or they've been seen bunny hopping around rice fields at night. I sh!t you not. So when i first so ringu i kinda smirked a little bit and caught the tongue and cheek part of the movie. Needless to say it's alot funnier to notice how hollywood which probably has no clue about the \\"joke\\" of the long draping hair and white dress faithfully copy the original. But hey! who cares! it works and it's gonna make them money money money!As for the million dollar question, I'd say if you r born of western culture watch the hollywood version and skip the original. Vice versa for those born of eastern culture. These two films are so similar there is no point in watching both. If you must insist, watch the japanese original first. But that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong Point of View","review":"My personal opinion is that people who say that the American version is worse because they use eye candy and special effects to scare us with only some jumps but no actually creepy parts definitely did not see both movies with the mindset of seeing two different movies. You have to realize that what scares Americans is completely different from what scares people of any other culture in the world...every culture has a different opinion when it comes to fear. Unfortunately, not everyone can freely watch two movies in different languages that have a similar plot but different methods of scaring and like the both of them. Unfortunately, Ringu and The Ring cannot be compared because they were both influenced by their country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you crazy?","review":"Anyone who thinks that the ...American version was better than the original needs to answer yes to my question. That piece of dung that Hollywood made is nothing compared to the original. Ringu will be my purchase on March 4th, Hollywood can keep their paltry remake. The original is creepier and the acting is even better. The major disappointment in that car wreck of a remake was that they showed her eyes, which ruined the overall creepiness. Avoid the remake at all costs and see the original. As is in most cases, the original is far superior.Also, people who know nothing of film, like the ones praising the remake over the original, should not be writing reviews and take some lessons in film by whatever means neccessary. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It underestimates our inteligence.","review":"Ok, I've seen it after the american version and I was very disapointed. The problem is not the lack of special FX or the peculiarities of japanese culture, the thing is that in this version every single character seems to have paranormal powers, which is ridiculous. While in the american version the mystery is solved simply by examing carefully the images of the tape, in this one everybody has visions and dreams, which make the movie less rational (if we can say so of a horror movie). Also, the american version leaves more open doors to Samara's story (Sadako), this one tells everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"unengaging","review":"This film did not impress me. This is the original story on which the US remake, The Ring, is based. There is less cohesive plot here, and much is left to the imagination. I don't see anything particularly compelling about this version nor anything I would consider superior to the original. It meandered a bit too much and did not engage me in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was HORRIBLE!!!","review":"I saw The Ring when it was in theatres, and kept hearing how Ringu was ten times scarier, even better... Uhm NOT! It was SO cheesy, I mean had I seen it first it MAY have creeped me out a little but I mean we were actually LAUGHING through a lot of it! You want a good scare see The Ring! Want a good comedy, see Ringu! I personally recommend not wasting your money on this though! How shady to advertise something as better when it's SO not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for television","review":"I'm not one of those people who can't enjoy a movie without special effects. In fact, I tend to prefer movies without special effects. I live in Japan and am a big fan of Japanese underground films. Now that I got that out of the way, let me tell you that this movie is not scary, not well acted (yes, I watched it in Japanese), and overall, very poorly made. The supposedly scary scenes use cheesy horror tricks to try and scare you and it just doesn't work. \\"The tape\\" is really short, and lacks the artistic edge of the tape in \\"The Ring\\". I've seen animations that were more unsettling. The story (what there is of it) progresses too quickly and the elements within that were omitted from \\"The Ring\\" were omitted for very good reasons. The only reason I gave it two stars is that maybe, just maybe, if I had not seen \\"The Ring\\" first I might have been mildy interested in this conveluted soup of a film. MAYBE.Bottom line, not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ringu","review":"RINGU and RING are the exact same movie, with a few little differences in the plot, but all in all - it's the same movie.RINGU was disappointing in comparision to RING.

This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. I have seen a lot of horror films and the sheer disappointment I was left with after watching this film was profound. The script for the film was decent and the plot moved along fairly smoothly, but those are the only two complements this movie deserves. The subtitled translation to english is very rough and at times puzzling. This alone is enough to kill any suspense and horror and turn the movie into something laughable. There was no point in the movie in which I was truly sucked into the action. This was no doubt due to the awkward acting, the poor music selection or lack thereof during tense moments and the aformentioned comical translation. If you like the idea of Ringu I suggest you watch the American counterpart, The Ring. I also recommend Frailty as another option, but I mostly recommend passing this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ringu","review":"This is the original Japanese production that inspired 2001's THE RING, in the United States. I rented this when it was first released in Canada and was truly mesmerized. The filmwork in this movie is really creepy, adding to the atmosphere of the film. The music score is undoubtedly the creepiest I've ever heard for a while, and the acting is superb. Both the remake and the original are stunning, so it doesn't matter which one you see first. A spectacle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Horror Masterpiece","review":"The first two reviews do not give this movie justice. Don't be fooled by closed-minded 'americans' who need blood and gore and have to have everything explained or else they think the movie [is bad]. The American remake can't compare to its Japanese original. It doesn't need background music or slasher-movie-qualities to make it scary, it does it through the story. You have to watch and figure a lot of things out on your own (not have them told to you like in the remake). If you're up to the challange, watch the original...otherwise go back to watching overrated violence and gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see alternaive to the US production!","review":"This original Japanese version has spawned a cult following in the far east as well as several TV shows and sequel spinoffs. But you don't need to worry about that to enjoy this movie. While the basic plot and theme is similar to 'The Ring', this original is more primal, more compelling, and more fist-clenching than the U.S. remake. And if you do some research on the net, you'll find there that there is a whole subtle subplot that makes this movie even more exciting! This was 'The Matrix' of Japan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This version was not as scary, but better overall.","review":"Like the American version, the Japanese version of \\"The Ring\\" has realistic makeup and special effects. The basic plot is relatively the same, with some minor changes here and there. I found this version to be not nearly as frightening as the American version, but I liked it better because of the differences in plot. It's a good investment for someone who has already seen the American version and would like to make a comparison for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by far!!!! Stick with the remake!","review":"I have been racking my brains trying to figure out why there is so much debate over RING + RINGU. i am beggining to think it is a thing of which you have seen first. I saw RING first and thoroughly enjoyed it, so hearing RINGU was scarier i was very excited. I see absolutley NO comparision. The RING(USA version) was so much scarier creepier and better acted by far! The lead woman in RINGU was very good however and the little girl walking towards the TV in RINGU twitching while she walked was extremely creepy. I guess this is a fun thing and a matter of taste. I guess everyone should watch both, but the question is now which one first because it seems like u wont like the second. Well if you are in USA get the remake then i guess. OH WHO KNOWS!!!!!! lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the final fight","review":"The moral of this movie is that Daniel should have used his heart when doing karate intead of using hard punches that his opponent uses. Yes the movie isn't original but I guarantee you that it is much simpler than the first. Part 1 was for kids. Its a story about a teen who gets beat up because he steals a girl from another guy. Part 3 is serious. Its about money, and the mind. I think the final fight in the tournament was brilliant. When Daniel starts doing Kaka his opponent is stunned and doesn't know what to do. Part 3 still has that popular Myagi music when they are training together. I felt Part 3 was more mature and modern than the original. There weren't as many actors in Part 3. Yes Part 1 was better, but Part 3 is more fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh...MY...GAWD....","review":"This is probably one of the worst movies I have even had the misfortune to see.

The first movie had an innocence to it. Ater that movie, the innocence was lost. Ralph Macchio looks too old for this film. He's a talented actor but when you're 30 something , there's only so much that make-up can hide. The obsession that the old sensai from Karate Kid part 1 and the millionaire had with Daniel's title was disturbing. I also doubt that he went to Vietnam because he looked like he was in his late 20's. They should have switched roles...the milloinaire could pass for the karate kid and Ralph Macchio (with a little makeup) could have passed for a middle aged Vietnam vet.The plot is predictable as well...if you're paying attention, you'll have an idea of what's going to happen. I'd take a pass on buying this film. The Karate Kid part 1 is much more worthwhile. It's simple, poetic, and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"enough is enough","review":"They just can't leave well enough alone.Each sequel got progressively worse.The acting really sucked and will somebody please get rid of John Kreese once and for all!!The only real good martial artist in this movie was Thomas Ian Griffith,he at least brought some life to this otherwise boring movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"haaaa","review":"LOL, that last review was so clever.

I think they should have ended the series with this installment. \\"The Next karate Kid\\" ruined the series. This installment had a better plot than the 1st, 2nd, and 4th, installments. This one had more and the best action sequences than the other \\"KK\\" movies. The tournament was awesome. In the final sequence Daniel uses the kata and beats Mike Barnes. This was the best.

While the 2 buddies hire Mike Barnes (Sean Kanan) to take the title from Danial.The plot is just cartoonish and the film doesn't have the charm and beauty of the first film. While if you saw one Karate Kid movie you've seen them all, that even goes for the remake. However the movie is mildly entertaining if you turn off your brain and don't take the movie seriously.

But I'd personally watch a train wreck over and over than watch some of the recent heaps... like \\"Twister\\" and \\"Independence Day\\". This movie's so bad that it would make an amazing midnight feature. It has cult potential. One evening my brother was seeing a stranger at the other end of a bar doing what seemed to be a scene from KKIII with friends. Upon closer inspection, he was correct.

Some loser-looking multi-billionaire who was in vietnam spends ALL of his time with his seemingly love interest buddy Reese harass some kid (Daniel) just because he wants to sign up more karate students? And they're over-the-top insane with it to the point of hysterical laughing, etc. And kata wins the tournament? Sheesh.And I didn't understand the girl's part in the story. Not a love interest, not really involved with him at all.On the plus side, it managed to keep my interest for the whole movie.

Part 3 is ridiculously awful. The villains are so extremely evil, it's very unsettling to watch. You keep waiting for something good to happen, but it never does, until that last 3 seconds of the movie.. BUT, that doesn't even come close to fixing the extreme dilemma. The team of villains, lead by an infinitely rich psychopath, end up with even more reason (not that they ever really had any reason in the first place) to continue torturing Daniel. If you want to feel good after the movie, then stop after part 1 or 2. Part 3 will leave you wishing for a part 4 where ALL of the evil predators get mauled to death by lions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Know Miyagi, Know Peace...No Miyagi, No Peace","review":"This movie is fantastic on so many levels. It contains one of the most hare-brained, ridiculous story lines ever written and perhaps the greatest character ever to grace the silver screen! Terry Silver, the Vietnam vet President of \\"DynaTox\\" Industries spends the movie smoking cigars, sitting in a sauna, sitting in a jacuzzi, bribing juries, illegally dumping waste, and hanging out in his silk gi. He has to be seen to be believed and there are too many priceless scenes to name just one. The fact that the uber-rich and powerful Silver drops everything in his life to focus on terrorizing a teenage karate tournament is just awesome. My favorite moment is when Terry puts on his tux and enjoys a night out being driven around smoking cigars and reading teenage karate magazines, only to come across an ad for Karate's Bad Boy...perfect. \\"Do you fight as hard as you negotiate?\\" -- \\"Harder.\\" I get chills every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Karate Kid movie of all.

This is not as good as the first two movies and I will have to watch the Next Karate Kid to decide if it is better than that one. The biggest problem with this installment is that the direction is so heavy handed it's like a sledgehammer to the face! I never thought I would get to use the term \\"ham fisted\\" in a review, but this is the perfect opportunity! The new villain in this movie should get the \\"Ham of the Year \\" award!

The DVD transfer looks good."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad acting","review":"What kills me about this movie is the bad acting. Part 1 and 2 was good it fit it's time the mid 80's. By the time part 3 came out RM was too old to play that role and he acted like a dorky little pussey throughout the whole movie. How could daniel and miyagi been so stupid not to know they getting played just watch it you will see how naive they really were. This movie lacks alot imagination and there no sole to it. They could have used better acting or even have johnny come back and help Daniel get back at kreese. I don't know i first saw this in the movies, in 1988 i was disappointed then, and still am today. There just so much more of a twist to the story to keep you interested like i said Daniel La russo acted like a DORK BIG TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bonsai Kid","review":"The third series of Karate Kid is the least favorite among the series(including Karete Girl one). The plot itself is not bad.Miyagi sensei in ambiguous manner warns against recent show-like atmosphere of the tournament itself and power-stressed styles. But it could have been much better presented in this film. Opening is really terrible. It ruins the whole plot. It's like rotten episode of 007 or Mitsukuni Mito the deputy-Shogun samurai drama. The previous series indicated some nice strategy so that Daniel-san could defeat the opponent in the end. But this one has none. It is quite unconvincing that Daniel san could win the Kobura-kai kids with latest Karate technics. I do not believe Kata alone can defeat the opponent.Miyagi-san's love for Bonsai is very understandable but it took time for the movie too much.Recommended only for die-hards."},{"rating":"1","title":"it didn't help,","review":"The only effect I had is to use the bathroom more with some bad feeling in my stomach with no effect on my weight,"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This is a god product...delivery was quick..but since we do need carbs in our bodies you must tak e your vitamins at least an hour afterwards.

The other scene that cracks me up is when his wife comes up to him with a married couple, Thornton looks at the other guy's wife & says \\"Yeah if that dress had pockets you'd look like a pool table\\" LOL, so halirious.

It was mildly humorous at best, it doesn't hold up well over the years. A few funny Dangerfield one-liners is about the best this film has to offer. Dangerfield's character is one you like, but he just doesn't deliver the laughs he should. One interesting footnote is that the Rowen Atkinson's, sight gag of preparing the coffee in his mouth, which he did on his show and the movieBean: The Moviecan be seen here, done by Rodney Dangerfield.

The outsiders are the good guys, and, of course, the Ivy League women prefer them, blah, blah, blah.

Other than a handful of smile moments, it's neither funny or remarkable at all.

Jeffery Deaver, however, is a superb suspense author...the best in my opinion. His plots twist and turn and always intrigue...his characters are three dimensional and command a reader's attention.Bone Collector is the first of the Lincoln Rhyme novels and is a great beginning to a great series. I cannot wait for the next offering from Deaver featuring Rhyme...this author has yet to disappoint me with anything that I've read by him.Pick this book up and read it...even if you have seen the film, especially if you have seen the film...you will get much more out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Fluff No Fun","review":"Though the characters in Deaver's novel are compelling and quirky, the story itself leaves much to be desired. I was forcing myself to turn the last few chapters because I realized something early on. The Bone Collector - the central killer - is not scary and you really don't care about any of his victims. The killer and his prey are merely structures to keep the main heroes revolving and moving. Though the book is fast paced, the action and the ending are hardly worth the effort. Even though Deaver is in much better command of the written word, I recommend Patterson's brisk storytelling over this sour brain candy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous, sick plot- a waste of time","review":"I made the mistake of believing the cover blurbs, and bought this book second hand.

The killer plants a red herring of a clue that is straight out of the film SEVEN, and other scenes are remniscent of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.

The thriller is as fast-paced as the Collector described in it and offers somewhat of a challenge to the mind thanks to the elaborate descriptions of forensic methods and tools. The focus is on the crimes and on the psyche of the killer, but a bit of subdued romantic tension is blended in, adding a little 'pique' to the story. Very gripping up to the last twentysome pages, where the surprising finale somewhat disappoints in that it is a bit far-fetched. But nevermind, it's a worthwhile read anyway!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bone Chilling\\" Mystery","review":"Jeffrey Deaver has weaved an intricate mystery that will amaze you with scientific detail and unexpected turn of events. The main characters, Rhyme and Sachs, seemingly have little in common. But as the criminal case escalates, their personas are drawn together in unexpected ways that reveal troubled, incomplete personalities that have been dealt harsh blows while living amidst New York City's law enforcement community. The bizarre behavior of the \\"unsub\\" is horrifying, yet creates an interest in why a man would be driven to commit such heinous crimes. As the tale builds to a climax and the perpetrator moves to complete his reign of terror, an unexpected twist will leave you fearfully grasping to protect your own neck.

Deaver develops his characters well, so you get a good sense of how they think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Crazy Glue for the mind","review":"This is the only book by J.D. I have read, and I must say he is one hell of a writer. The courage it takes to write about a paralyzed main character, and to make it believable in the process takes some imagination.The plot of this book was very well laid out, there was no fat to add to the mix, just good solid fun. The murders by the killer were original. And the tight story line had me biting my nails to see who the next victim would be, and how they would ultimately display the next clue. I highly recommend this book.Just an aside, the movie was good even with its weaker ending but nothing like the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive Book in need of a SEQUEL","review":"I felt like a true addict reading this book!

AlthoughNot Much Depth","review":"For those of us who read for entertainment value first and literary value second, this is certainly a worthwhile read. I would liken it to a Schwartzenegger movie...fast-paced and very exciting, but not entirely memorable. This book is heavy on the technology angle, which is not necessarily bad (Tom Clancy fans can appreciate such detail), but more energy could have been devoted to character development. I didn't leave the story particulalry liking (or even hating) any of the characters.It's no \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", where you held true passion in your like and dislike of the characters, but it is a good read in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more of Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs.","review":"A great book. I haven't read any of Jeffery Deavers other books but you can be sure I will now. I couldn't stop reading the Bone Collector.

Deaver has put together a great story with interesting characters you want to know more about. I immediately went out and purchased the follow-up, The Coffin Dancer, upon finishing Bone Collector.

I really enjoyed it and look forward to future installments in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!","review":"This book was a JOKE. The so-called suspense in this story didn't even come close to killing me. You have a disabled know-it-all forensics detective, who just got on my last nerve, and his dumb sidekicks solving a huge puzzle that did nothing but get on my nerves. And the ending was the most worst part of this whole book. Definitely not even close to being worth the money I payed for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"This book is simply pathetic. The characters are nonsensical, the action is unrealistic (can one really bite through the carotid into the spine?!?) and the plot is lame. What more is there to say? It's a shame some big-wig has taken a shine to this author. If you want to throw cash at someone without talent, send it my way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't collect this book","review":"The forensic details were fascinating, but the storyline was hard to swallow. The characters were flat and the identity of the \\"unsub\\" was ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bone Collector is contrived and lacks depth","review":"My problem with this book is that the author clearly wanted to capitalize on the interest in paraplegia arising from Christopher Reeve's accident.Research was good, but the result is term-paper like, with shallow characters, violent scenes inserted for effect that rang false, and an ending that works as a sequel set-up, but not as a satisfying conclusion to this flawed book."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"From a forensic scientist's point of view, Deaver butchered reality. As the greatest criminalist ever, Lincoln Rhyme breaks all of the rules even the most dim-witted criminalist would observe. The interpretation of the evidence was impossible by today's standards or the future for that matter (individualizing soil samples, running dirt through a GC/MS in minutes???). Deaver needs to do his homework if he wants to include forensics, crime scene investigation, and criminal profiling in his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scares you silly","review":"This book is one of the best I have read. I was in need of a good book since I had finished my others. I picked this one up due to the new movie, I could not put this book down. I was turning pages non-stop. I was in suspense the whole time that I was reading this book. Jeffery Deaver is one of the best writers I have ever read. Since reading this book I am hooked on Jeffery Deaver. I am currently reading the Coffin Dancer. In the Bone Collector there are many interesting twists and turns that will leave you reading till the end. If I could give this ten stars I would gladly give it that, and would recomend this book to anyone who likes thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This was an amazing read. I couldn't put it down.If you like CSI, then you will love this books. The forensics are very interesting.You would never guess who the killer is!

It is fast pace and exciting. I am surprised his books are not made into movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Excellent Book","review":"This was a great book. Loved it so much more than the movie (though that was great too). It had all the creepiness, intrigue, mystery, etc. that you could want. Highly recommend reading this one and it's sequels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - great details","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Wonderful details and excellent descriptions made the crime scenes come to life! Great characters, and I really enjoyed the complicated nature of each of them. I have never seen the movie, but I am very happy with the book! Good read - I recommend it to anyone who has the stomach for some brutal crime scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful page turner","review":"Excellent novel, suspenseful, great plot that just gets better and better, graphic in parts since it's about a serial killer but nevertheless a great book...one of the best i've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chapter 28","review":"Amelia Sachs, \\"Stripping down to her T-shirt, she flings away her gas-soaked uniform blouse and bullet proof vest\\", she then runs down to the basement of the burning building, \\"With her knife she cut a patch off her uniform blouse and lifted the crackling extinguisher by it's neck\\". Is Amelia Sachs a member of the magic circle? Or did she have a spare uniform blouse in her pocket? If not for this oversight in chapter 28 I would have given this book a 5 star rating, it's one of the best books that I have read in some time and I've bought and read every Jeffery Deaver book in the Lincoln Rhyme series since (and they all get 5 stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read!","review":"This book is a must-read. In it, Deaver simultaneously creates a sub-genre (master criminalist as detective), introduces some terrific and unique characters and sets up a wickedly exciting chase, full of suspense.On the technical side, this book really shows up writers like Patricia Cornwell. It's obvious that Deaver has done a tremendous amount of homework and you come away feeling like you've just completed a NYPD forensics course. On the character side, Deaver has created as enjoyable and interesting pair of investigators as anyone. You feel like you could reach out and shake their hands.But it is on the plot side that Deaver shines most. His style can only be described as wrenching -- just as you think you know where the book is going to go, it turns and runs full-tilt in a completely unexpected direction. The book is full of surprises and suspense -- you can feel your palms dripping in a couple of the scenes.Grab this book and read the next two, they are just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful start of a new series","review":"I got to be honest, I first knew about this book from the movie. I liked the movie so I checked out the book. And I must say the book was WAY much better than the movie. The characters were powerfully portrayed. I found myself another great series to collect."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good","review":"I haven't read any of Jeffery Deavers other books. This one was a good thriller. Different, but an enjoyably quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!","review":"I had read Coffin Dancer before I read Bone Collector so I was not only thrilled by the story itself, I was also thrilled to discover how Lincoln and Amelia met. I recommended these books to all my friends!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book deserves six stars","review":"Engrossing...., captivating.... an excellent read from the beginning, crowned with a great ending, ....suspense galore. Besides entertaining with its many twists and turns, also provides forensic elements and even divulges principles of science. Rhyme character is great and originally crafted. I enjoyed it very much \\"down to the bone\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read, but unbelievable ending","review":"I loved Maiden's Grave and have read and enjoyed his short stories as well. In his other works that I have read, I frequently thought I had found plot holes, only to to have the holes cleverly filled in later. No such luck here. I found the ending implausable at best. I'm hoping the follow-up will get back into the realm of believability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't want it to end.","review":"Since reading this book I have gone out and bought all the Deaver books I could find! I read this straight through in two days. I couldn't wait to see what happened to the next victim! He finds the most creative, gruesome ways to torture people. One of the most nerve wracking books I have ever read... even if you don't like murder mysteries, this is worth trying. I hope there is a sequel... or two or three...."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible read!","review":"Do not open this book unless you are prepared not to put it down until you've finished! This is the first of Mr. Deaver's novels that I have read, but if his prior novels are anything like this, I'll be reading them next. I was completely fascinated by both the story and the characters. Rhyme is unforgetable, both for his scientific reasoning, as well as his personal sorrows and joys. I was taken completely by surprise at the unmasking of \\"The Bone Collector\\" and the author kept me guessing up to the last sentence of the last page about Ryhme's fate. I have passed this book on to a friend, and have recommended it to everyone. It is a top-notch mystery and one I will not soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, this man can write","review":"I found The Bone Collector to be a thrilling, exciting, and absorbing chiller. Definitly one of the best in this genre that I have read. (And I have read many). Jeffrey Deaver knows how to keep us on the edge of our seats for the entire book. I have now bought all of his others, except one which I will get soon. Don't miss this exciting writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gory but riveting","review":"Forensic criminalist Lincoln Rhyme, almost totally paralysed from being hit by a falling beam at a crime scene, is planning to suicide with the help of a \\"death doctor\\", when he is drawn into a horrifying murder scene by a call for help from an old colleague. Terrible clues, all connected with bones, are being openly shown as bait to draw in the police. With the help of a gorgeous redheaded policewoman, Amelia Sachs, who acts as his arms and legs, Lincoln begins to unravel the crimes which are a direct copy of crimes committed in the 19th century days of old New York. The detectives race against time as clue after clue is left, each one more complex than the last. It's a fast, thrilling read and one which I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 : read this book! even if you've seen the movie","review":"absolutely terrific. Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book there was still plenty more to the story. I wish I had read the book first, but it is still a must read for mystery/thriller lovers.Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the ending different in the movie? (I haven't seen the film in a while, but while reading the book I thought \\"the bone collector\\" was someone other than the person it turned out to be.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"How would you like to see the blood of the innocent shed? How would you like to hear the sound of human bones breaking? Or, maybe you'd like to feel the pain of your flesh being cut through to the bone?Who thinks of these distrubing images? Why, it's none other than the images of (Unsub 823.) Who seems to like history and old things, but takes only random victims.If you like mystery, suspense and thrills, you'll love this book just as much as I did. Everyone likes the movie, but I think the book is better. It has very detailed descriptions of everything you'd need to know about crime scenes and physcial evidence to last you a while.Just when you think the case is solved, you find another clue that leads to other victims and perps. To find out who Unsub 823 is and which officer finds him you'll have to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition","review":"The description of the condition of the book was accurate. I didn't realize that it was mailing from outside the United States. Was anxious to get the book and it took longer to arrive than the others I ordered at the same time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Relatively boring book","review":"I never felt like I was able to get into this book like I should have. I never really felt any sympathy for any of the characters, including Lincon Rhyme or the victims of the crimes. The plot kind of meandered through the lives of the various victims and law enforcement officials, without providing any gripping tension. I was quite suprised by teh person committing the crimes, but it wasn't shocking. There are some nice moments, but overall I wasn't impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing and realistic page-turner!","review":"This book was fabulous and I can't wait for more featuring Amelia and Lincoln Rhyme. The Bone Collector is by far my favorite Deaver book and the follow-up was also wonderful.The story has it's quirks and they all work. The story is realistic and well written. The characters are well formed and likable. Deaver gives you just enough background info to keep you wanting more but not too much so that it takes away from the plot.This book was recently made into a movie - since the book is one of my favorites I saw the film - while decent it just does not hold a candle to the book. The book leaves no loose ends and Jeffery Deaver really fleshes the characters out. This is NOT your average serial killer novel nor is Lincoln your average detective.I highly recommend this one - it will keep you up all night reading because you just can't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRUE THRILLER!","review":"IN A FEW WORDS, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FIND A BOOK THAT CAPTURES MY COMPLETE ATTENTION, AS \\"BONE COLLECTOR\\" DID.

THIS AUTHOR DID HIS HOMEWORK VERY,VERY WELL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book but won't see the movie","review":"Lincoln is the best crime solver to come around since Dr. Kay, Lucas Davenport, and Alex Cross. The book was fantastic and kept me glued to the couch all day. I just wish the casting directors would read the books before they cast the parts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this before going to bed!","review":"I fell asleep shortly after reading about the rats. As a result, I had a nightmare and did not sleep well. This book has some terrifying images. While I liked the idea of reading about a quad who is struggling with whether he wants to live or not..and I liked the crime scene/evidence details, I was disappointed with this book. It is poorly written. I found it hard to believe that they could solve clues so quickly. It just didn't seem realistic. The characters didn't come across as real either."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down","review":"I am a big fan of the \\"Prey\\" books by John Sandford and this book was as good as any of those. I was thoroughly engaged by the story and read deep into the night. I was breathless at the end and never suspected who the killer was. I absolutely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bone chilling mystery","review":"Amelia Sachs is working her last shift as a beat cop when she discovers a grisly crime seen. Acting on instinct, she quickly tries to preserve the evidence, an action that antagonizes those above her in the chain of command, but draws respect from retired forensics expert Lincoln Rhyme. Paralyzed in an on-the-job accident, Rhyme is called upon to consult on this crime scene, which includes an unusual set of planted evidence, which provide clues to a series of subsquent crime scenes. Rhyme calls upon Sachs to be his eyes, ears and legs as the race to stop a serial killer begins.Set against the sprawling geography and history of Manhattan, this is a tightly woven thriller, with few wasted clues, including a few that set the stage for the very conclusion of the story. While the characters aren't the best developed, the story is well paced and the clues keep the reader guessing as the the identity of the killer until the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the end, an average book.","review":"I picked up this book on a whim. I had recently finished Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lector trilogy and was looking for something along the same style. There are only four characters with personality in this book, everybody else is very generic. The dialogue is very predictable. If you've seen any action or suspense movies, you can probably guess what any character is going to say in reaction to a given situation in the book. Also, I felt that the author kind of \\"dumbed down\\" the text. I felt like I was reading a book I would find in a junior high library. Still, it wasn't all bad. It was good enough to not get one star. Its just a very bland predictable novel. If you're thinking of buying this, I suggest you head on over to Thomas Harris's \\"Red Dragon\\" instead. Its along the same lines, but is written extremely better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast pace thriller which keeps you guessing till last page.","review":"I read The Coffin Dancer first and rushed out the next day to get this book than read it in a day. Deaver's characters are great and he makes you care about them. Really liked the chemistry between Lincoln and Amelia. Deaver also deals with Lincoln's disability in a truthful and positive manner. Story was interesting with the NYC history mixed in to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bone chiller like \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"","review":"If you have read the novels of Patricia Cornwell, you'll enjoy Jeffrey Deaver's Bone Collector. He uses detective lingo. The reader feels as though he or she was investigating the grisly crimes.. Read The Coffin Dancer.. it has the same characters to solve more gruesome plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"BONE PLEASING","review":"This is the second book by Deaver that I have read. May I say even though it is very good it is not quite as good as \\"The Coffin Dancer\\". This book seemed to be a litlle more bland. It wasn't as full of excitement and in debt thought. Even though it was lacking a few points the story line was still very, very good and the charactors seemed very life like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Hopefully there are many more to come!","review":"At first the book did not appeal to me but after having read about fifty pages, I simply could not put it down until I had finshed it.Even his German is correct (unlike in many other English / American books).Glad that Lincoln did not finish killing himself because that gives me the hope that there are many more books to come (featuring him and Amelia Sachs)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Excellent story.

I did normal roomlight recording and was very disappointed with the result.In addition, the motor (scanning head?) whines. This is picked up either through the microphone or directly throught the body and is very noticable on the playback.To be sure it was the camera, I went to our largest video retailer with my tape and used other manufacturers cameras.

Shame on anyone and everyone who continues that exploitation today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Clips Will Suffice","review":"The hipsters can praise this all they want, but they KNOW it's crap and praising it just helps in their desperate desire to feel so smug and superior to mere mortals. I can guarantee you that few of them actually own a Shaggs album and of those that do few ever listen to it. This applied to Zappa too.Sure, it has a sincerity missing in so much of today's music, but sincerity alone does not make music (and I use the term loosely) listenable. Intrigued by this band's story? That's understanding, it is a fascinating one. But if you still feel a need to hear this stuff save yourself a lot of dough and go with the sound clips.

The effect was amazing and virtually instantaneous--conversations ground to a halt, heads popped up, necks craned around, puzzled expressions abounded.

The fact that the vocals are two voices laid on top of one another on every single song, and that there is not a DIFFERENCE between them, suggests that these weren't just random studio sessions but were actually songs painstakingly written, practiced, and recorded.Truly weird.

Well, most people don't know where the 'sucking' bar actually is. This album will set you straight. This album defines sucking. You will never scoff at Bush, Britney Spears, or N'Sync again, because they're geniuses compared to these guys.Nevertheless, 'My Pal Foot Foot', 'Who Are Parents?', and 'Philosophy of the World' are actually catchy, memorable songs. They practically bleed orginality!What's more, is that while you might think they're a big ironic joke, but they're not. In fact, this album is so bad, it's irony-proof. When one laughs at this music, you laugh not at the Shaggs, but at the experience of hearing the Shaggs.So buy it already. You will not regret it, I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foot Foot is the lucky one","review":"He's dead and doesn't have to risk hearing the Shaggs.

And those of us that don't \\"get it\\" are labled philistines, but the fact that someone with a sense of humor like Frank Zappa thought it interesting and compelling really shouldn't come into play here. All these girls knew is that they were playing - sort of - their instruments, and from what I understand, coerced to do so. Remember, there is a difference between, \\"so bad it's good,\\" and \\"just plain bad.\\" Just because something like \\"My Pal Foot Foot\\" will be tattooed on your brain after listening, doesn't make it WORTH listening to.

It is like the proverbial car accident.....you can't look and yet you can't look away. I was transfixed by a sound unlike any other in the Universe.

While they're not actually better than The Beatles, they were brilliant in their own quirky way. Yes, the drummer seems to be playing a different song from the rest of the band most of the time, and the melodies mostly just climb up and down the scales, but strangely enough it works. The Philosophy of the World is hilarious. And as I've been saying for 25 years, if you don't like The Shaggs, you're square."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can never please anybody","review":"This album is really... something. It was recorded in one day in 1969. The Shaggs sound is hard to describe, since they don't sound like anybody else. They could barely play their instruments, and they didn't sing that well, either. But despite their technical shortcomings, their music has a certain naive charm to it. If you are only interested in music that is technically proficient, you probably won't like this album. But if you like music that is \\"different\\", you may get a kick out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hauntingly Bad","review":"I don't think I will ever sleep again after listening to \\"My Pal's Name is Foot Foot\\".I would walk across the desert while eating charcoal briquettes soaked in Tabasco for forty days and forty nights NOT to ever have to listen to anything Shagg-related EVER again.Shock therapy and all the Prozac in the world would never stop the haunting sounds of these banshees."},{"rating":"1","title":"LMAO!!!!!","review":"Oh...oh my god....when I listened to those samples I just had to say something. I was shocked at the number of people who thought this album 'rocked' or whatever. It's so bad...it's good. I laughed for over 3 hours listening to 'It's Halloween'....what the hell is this? Drums being played at random while the guitarist (i feel bad giving her this name) played worse then maybe my dog, while the bloody vocalist is drunk and on drugs or something! I mean come on people, what's with this stupid [stuff]?Never in my life have I heard something as bad. Never.Stay away...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they smoking...?","review":"Wow, I was left speechless. When people say that their music is interesting, is interesting some slang term for awful? Their music sounds like a cat getting hit by a truck and getting stuck in the tire and just sqeeling and hissing all the time. I truly feel sorry for their instruments.The lowest you can go is one star? I wish you could into negative stars because that's how bad their music is. I bet it is good suicide music. Their music is awful, and if you buy their cd, it is 3o minutes of laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh brother!","review":"As an answer to the praise this band has received in other reviews on this site i'd just like to make one remark: The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Cut all the intellectualizing about \\"what is music afterall?\\" . This whole thing is a farce. Although, I find some of this recording amusing, it's a joke that wears thin after about 45 seconds. Has anyone actually ever seen the so- called \\"Wiggin sisters?\\" And what's with the accents? They sound like Shonen Knife singing the Carpenter's Top of The World, yet the cover photo would indicate they're Anglo girls. This whole thing (30 years ago, Frank Zappa loved them..etc.) is a big put up job. Innocents? No one could be that naive about musicality. Even if they are real and they actually recorded it, I believe it was done with the complete awareness that if they made it sound bad enough, someone might put it on a label as a joke and maybe they'd make a few bucks. More likely it's some total studio job made to sound raw and underproduced so we could all listen and wax nostalgic about the good old days before Britney and the slicksters took over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Glasgow Crime Novel","review":"Thursday morning a security van rolls up to the Post Office on Maryhill Road, inside the staff, cleaners and four men armed with shotguns have been waiting over two hours.

This movie rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps Inspired by Yul Brynner's Gunslinger","review":"I liked THE TERMINATOR when I originally saw it. I think it was somewhat innovative and Arnold Schwarzenegger was very good as the cyborg that will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance seems to have been inspired by Yul Brynner as the gunslinger robot in WESTWORLD. Brynner's obsessively determined performance was brilliant in that film. The difference here is that you almost begin to empathize with Brynner's obsession as if perhaps he wanted to have been created as a human being and not a robot. Brynner does have his catharsis. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator has less aspirations and has only a singular purpose in this film. Schwarzenegger's performance is not exactly endearing but he does come across with a certain amount of misplaced aplomb, which adds to his absurdity and fascinating screen presence. Has it really been that many years since this came out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Review","review":"Double Triple dipping garbage of the same original Blu-Ray Release.

But the transfer to Blu-Ray is really poor. I own many Blu-Ray titles (also the DVD version of this), this is one of the worse Blu-ray transfers I've seen, quality wise. Lots of grain, and not just during the darker scenes (you will see this immediately at the start). For the life of me I cannot understand how relatively modern era movies like Terminator (1984) could have quality issues like this in Blu-Ray, while older films in Blu-Ray like Battle of the Bulge (which I also have) look far, far superior image-wise.I regret purchasing this Blu-Ray disc, my current DVD version would have sufficed. I really hope they come up with a better, truly HD restored version of this otherwise great sci-fi classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terminator","review":"I agree with some other reviewers--for a blu-ray edition the picture is awful.

His villainous status is as remarkable as his status as the hero.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the character with great passion, giving the machine it's cold, merciless attitude. Stan Winston creates one of his early greats here, giving the machine a terrifying effect, and the stop-motion animation is an endoskeleton version of the great Jason And The Argonauts skeletons.The Terminator has plenty of action and atmosphere to please, James Cameron handles it's style the way he handles his passion for filmmaking. A truly cool sci-fi tale that tells us the future might fall into the hands of the machines that we build, and that wouldn't be a surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"101% THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!","review":"Terminator is the best movie I have ever seen or will see.

I have watched it over and over and over (about 50 times) but I just can't get enough of it. The best movie ever made. No other person could bring Terminator in life as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger. I just love the highspeed chase in the end of the movie. It's much better than Terminator 2. Terminator 2 is not as scary as the original. To me, \\"The Terminator\\" is a sci-fi thriller not an sci-fi movie. There's nothing that compares to it.

The movie itself is an original and frightening action/thriller with a dark, grainy look and an '80s feel to it. The scene in the Technoir gives me chills. It moves in slow motion, then becomes fast and explosive. This film made Arnold a star, and he was born to play the \\"Terminator\\". He's chilling, realistic, and scary. At first, he didn't want to play this character of an emotionless cyborg, but after reading the script, he did. It's the role he will be remembered for for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Terminator","review":"In 2029 Los Angeles, where human and robots do battle, the androids send an uncompromising and unstoppable killing-machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger), back to the year 1984.

The humans send back a rebel soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Bihen) to protect Sarah.Executed in a vigorous and action-packed manner, \\"The Terminator\\" is excellent (and violent) entertainment. The most notable scene is the police station massacre. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a laconic, chilling performance.Overall rating: 4 starsRated R for strong violence, a scene depicts surgical treatment of an eye, language, nudity, and some sexual encounters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy now in auctions - wait!","review":"A new release of this film on DVD is in the pipeline - already a 2-disc special edition has been released this month in PAL R2 and R4 - it is expected to be out in R1 either at the end of this year or early next year.R2 & R4 DVDs have Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, deleted scenes, trailers and documentaries.

It is out in other regions, why cant they do it here? I went crazy to find this title new but was lucky enough to get it used at funcoland for 19.99 and it was disapointing"},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie that started it all","review":"Terminator is one of the greatest movies ever made and is among the top favorites for almost anyone I know. This is the film that really made James Cameron and Arnold, stars in their field.An excellent story, with perfect theme music, made this an instant classic, one you can watch over and over again. A thrilling, sci-fi, action horror classic, with a bit of a love story mixed in. The only negative critique I've ever had about the film is the scene where Arnold removes the eye, and his face clearly looks like a mask.The deleted scenes on the disk are fun to watch but they are not re-edited into the film as they did in Aliens. I wish they had done that or given you the option too, because I really enjoyed it that way. Most of the scenes were taken out for timing or pacing and otherwise could have been left in. I particularly thought the Cyberdyne ending could have been left in. I find it really enjoyable to watch deleted scenes on older favorites like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray disc modest transfer","review":"This is the fifth title I have seen in Blu-ray, and it is the weakest. I think it is due to the condition of the original master. There is much grain throughout. Black tones could be darker, colors should be more vibrant. The disc freezes for a second as Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese arrive at the Tiki Motel, and the audio drops out for a second during their love scene. I think this is also a mastering problem and not a result of the Samsung BD-P1000 (the only Blu-ray disc player currently on the market). The rest of the audio is top notch. Probably the best this film has ever sounded. I was able to pick up background noise and nuances I never heard on VHS, Laserdisc, or standard DVD. All in all, it is a modest transfer. But I remember that some of the first DVD's didn't look so hot. Maybe a re-issue of this title later on will fix any transfer issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu ray version needs to be remastered","review":"This is a great movie, however blu ray shows a lower then expected resolution and it feels - especially in the opening scene like the studio did not try and remaster the negatives so you see all these old artifacts showing up on the film.

I can finally toss my VHS copy. The features are the reason we're purchasing this one. There are 2 well made documentaries but the first thing you will want to check out are the delted scenes. This is what makes the dvd worth it. There are only 6 segments. Each feature commentary from James Cameron. You only wish he did commentary on the film. The scenes are too short to get in real insight into the film from the commentaries. The final deleted scene is really an alternative ending. This edition is 1 dvd but there are materials on both sides.

I like the movie better than before. I am ready for more Terminator movies on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly awsome movie","review":"The Terminator is an awsome movie. It has lots of action but it is not overly gory. If you watch it and think about the plot, you start to realize that this, with the exception of the time travel, could happen. We have the tecnology now. We even had it back then. They used an actual robot for the movie, which was controlled by men, but could easily have a mind of it's own. Anyways, this movie is one of the coolest movies that I have seen. For the year that it was made it has great special effects, better than any other movies of it's time. If you are looking for a great movie to watch, I suggest this. It is even better than T2, which was an awsome movie too. I suggest that you see The Terminator before T2. T2 will make so much more sense then."},{"rating":"2","title":"New 5.1 Surrond Ruins Movie","review":"I bought the Special Edition DVD three days ago and began playing it at home, the sound was wierd so I checked the languages, I found out two english audiotracks (Dolby 5.1 Surrond and Mono). With 5.1 Arnold's .45 sounds like someone is sneezing and basically every effects' sound has been changed.On the plus side the picture quality is great and the special features are even better, there's 2 trailers that you would see in a theater, 1 teaser which you would see on T.V. and 2 30 second long TV spots.

Sarah only hope is a man named Kyle Resse. Great acting by the entire cast. Arnold makes a perfect villion. This is the best of the three films.

It's kind of sad though that this and Alien(s) are like the best sci-fi over the last thirty years(basicaly, they're the best sci-fi of the 80s).The sci-fi movie isn't about exploration of the universe and dealing with irrational humanity - as usual. Instead, it's about humanity fearing the machines might get too smart(and then, of course, someone just outwiting the machines) and destroy us wonderful smart humans. Anybody ever hear of the dark ages? How about how the Judeo-Christian bible saying how evil humanity is?(you know, the flood story; wipe out all those evil others - except of course the chosen ones Jews). And of course, this story sidesteps and neutralises the fact that the problem with guns and technology isn't the technology, but the 'people' using it!I just find the psychology of humans and anti-science/technology behind the making and the fame of this movie rather striking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terminator","review":"I did not get the product advertised, it was NOT a special edition copy.

I especially liked the last fight, where we see the Terminator's real form. Oh, and there is plenty of suspense and blood, for you gore lovers. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the next two were even better. All laid out, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and if you like intense fighting and iron determination, this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mechanical masterpiece.","review":"The terminator had the best secial effects at the time and to this day it has not been ridiculed and so i state that it never will.

Linda Hamilton executed an outstanding role in this movie. I recommend this movie to those who enjoy Schwarzenegger films or action films. Add this to your movie collection today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did He Indeed \\"Come Back\\"...?","review":"It was with some dissatisfaction that I began to watch Terminator on my PS3 and 45\\" Vizio. First, I had to double-check and indeed make sure this was a Blu-Ray and not a VHS recording. Serious - the film quality is stuck with the plot... in the 80's. The sound was not that impressive either when running through a pretty darn good 5.1 system. And to top it all off, the Special Features best aspect is a decent range of subtitles. At the end of the day, when Arnold promises to be back, it seems he didn't bring the quality content with him.So, the movie itself is a classic, we all know that.

Frightening in its self but only a taste of what is to come. It seems that he is invincible and is targeting all the Sara Connors in the phone book. Each one being dispatched more violently than the last. A less robust being (Michael Biehn) also appears the same way. He too is seeking Sara.What is so intriguing about Sara Connors (Linda Hamilton)?Who will find her first?What effect can the outcome have on humankind?I thought Arnold's accent added to the character of the movie.

Horrible DVD.","review":"I am one of the biggest fans of this movie (saw it many times in the theatre when it was released, bought the soundtrack on LP, have almost everything about it), and it IS one of the BEST Sci-Fi movies ever made - especially for its small budget. That said, this is one of the worst DVDs I've seen. The only special feature you get is ONE original trailer. No \\"Making Of\\" (which I have the VHS version of), No commentary tracks (come on James Cameron! Get with it! I love your movies and would love to hear your comments!), not even any other language or subtitle tracks - nothing spectacular on this DVD at all.

James Cameron's original film is a low-budget thrillfest that truly made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star. The film follows a young carefree women as she learns that she will one day give birth to a resistance leader that will save the world. The downside is that evil robots don't want to see that happen and send a robotic Arnold back in the past to kill her long before she's even pregnant. Lots of bang for the buck with this film as the action and stunts are thrilling and brutal. Go check out the move that started this billion-dollar franchise. I recommend it for adults 18+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Die-Know-Might!","review":"This is a truly spectacular movie for the ages.For a movie made way back in 1984, this was well ahead of it's time and is a classic today.

I think it was somewhat innovative and Arnold Schwarzenegger was very good as the cyborg that will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission. Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance seems to have been inspired by Yul Brynner as the gunslinger robot in WESTWORLD. Brynner's obsessively determined performance was brilliant in that film. However, returning to the subject of this format it seems to be not what it was touted to be. Unfortunately this Blu-ray disc seems to bring out the imperfections from the master print or whatever print they used to copy THE TERMINATOR onto this disc. I found the picture very annoying to watch because of this. I can only give this product 1 star for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"MUST READ BEFORE BUYING THIS TERMINATOR DVD\\"","review":"WARNING-RIPOFF, WARNING-RIPOFF!!!

The footage that is supposed to follow is missing from both the widescreen and full screen presentations on this disc, so viewers don't get to see a very powerful and emotional moment. Also, this DVD is a no-frills release, with just the widescreen version on one side and the full screen version on the other--no trailers, nothing.

I am certain that his existance is only acknowledged by those who accidently stumble upon his name as a friend of mine did. He informed me of Mr. Wilsons extremely stupid, pointless, and disrespectful 'bit' and I was quite unpleased. Personally, I think that we should blow off Mr. Wilsons head and see if it grows back, thank you Mr. Omega Muerte for that wonderful idea.

My favorite section is the one where they break down all of the applications of various verbs and show the wide manner of meanings possible and common verb combinations used. There is also a really great section with Nouns that gives the subtle distinctions between noun variations (i.e., just a chaqueta vs. all the various types of coats).

(Easy-Photo now supports the EXIF data from my G2 further enhancing the print quality.)Other items worth mentioning: indivual ink cartridges, removable/replaceable print head, it's stylish, fast, and very, very quiet.

You will have no choice but to spend about half the cost of the printer to have the printer torn down, the pad replaced and the printer reset, unless you can do it yourself and void the warranty.Other problems with the S9000 include a tempermental print head, which requires regular cleaning (and ink waste).On our S9000 the paper alignment bar is extremely sticky, worse than any bottom-of-the-line printer we've operated.The paper handling is pretty bad, and the S9000 will occasionally pull in paper at an angle even though it has fed straight.After a year-and-a-half, our S9000 is about dead except for B&W; printing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper will not feed","review":"I have always purchased high end Epson printers whenever a new printer came out.

Its not just about football but how the town of Odessa, Texas lives and dies with every pass, run, and firstdown. Just to give you an idea, perhaps the most interesting part of the book was the discussion of the school budget, which showed some insane amount of money like $70,000 dollars spent on football to just $5,000 spent on the English department. This book is about much more than a football team, it is about the personalities that make a community."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate football and I loved the book","review":"I went to the University of Texas, where the secular religion of football continues after high school. I've been to countless games, and I always thought the quarterback just threw the ball to whoever was open. I picked up this book because I was interested in West Texas. It accurately describes the West Texas culture as I know it: endless stretches of acrid land where one makes or breaks, sinks or swims. Having traveled extensively throughout the area, I can understand the lure of football attraction.The book is phenomenally well written, and I, Miss I-never -will- go- to- pigskin-game-again, found myself reading it on the sidewalks in New York as I walked to work. Several strangers stopped me on the subway to tell me how much they enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

I am not that avid of a football fan, but as I read this book, I found myself growing a greater respect for the sport as well as the players involved in the game. This book takes you on the journey of one teams losses, and victories, and the importance and impact this sport has on the community as a whole. I found this book quite hard to put down, and highly recommend it to all teenagers. It was a simple reading book packed with loads of information including entertaining and emotional.

It's a very complex book about life in Texas. For many families in Odessa, Texas, football on Friday night is a temporary escape from an unforgiving life. Poverty is rampant in the racially segregated town. Black players are brought into the high school as meerly athletes and no thought is given to their academic future. This book brings to light many ugly things about daily life in this little town in Texas. Of course there is an exciting football plot as well. When you put it all together, there really aren't too many other books that have this kind of range. It can be a depressing read at times like many great books, but is definitely worth your time and investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"firday night highlights","review":"good book, did exactly what it said on the tin, a great insight into the life of a high school football team, but a very intense football team, coaching staff and parents and even towns people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misplaced Values","review":"Basically this is a story of high school football in Odessa Texas, where the Permian High Panthers are seen as much more than football players. The players are treated like celebrities, and the pressure and expectations placed upon them by adults living vicariously through the team's success or failure becomes too much for many. It is a sad chronicle of the pressure placed on teenage athletes by adults whose own lives are unfulfilled. Their own self esteem is based upon the performance of young adults. When those young adults \\"fail\\", they are made to feel responsible for \\"letting the town down\\".Athletics and high school sports are important and teach many valuable lessons; teamwork, hard work, sacrifice to name a few. FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, on the other hand, paints a picture of the downside of sports. It is a picture that should be seen by all those who care about our youth and what we are teaching them."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved the TV show, that does NOT mean you will like the book...","review":"I loved the TV show.

But it is a fine book about HS football."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so writing, rambles about things unrelated to the team","review":"The author writes a preface that gives away too much of the outcome of the team. He rambles on about things that are not only not related to the team but are just plain boring. The only good parts are when he talks about the players personalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are better off watching the movie","review":"I was an English major in college and later taught it. I'm loathe to ever push a movie over a book, but that is the case here. (However, the movie departs from the book in a lot of ways, and is actually much different than the book)This book is severely tedious at times, with overly-long descriptions about the dust, sweat and oil that inhabit Odessa, Texas. Bissinger goes into too much detail about the characters at times; he loses them by trying to explain every facet of their life, including the pulls and opinions of their friends and families.There are some great passages in the book, but they are few and far between the book's 400 + pages. I found the most interesting part of the book to be the obsession that the town had with the team, and the fact that the players go from 18 year old Gods to 19 year old has-beens in Odessa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what was worse","review":"Not sure what was worse, reading this 'item' or pounding my head against a concrete wall.

The team that no matter what the year has a chance at a state title. Especially in the 88-89 season. Under the command of Coach Gary Gaines the players mess around until Friday night. Thats when all of East Odessa empties in to the Panter's stadium.

There was to much about the history of Odessa Texas and not enough about the football team. It felt like I was reading a history book. I did not care when the first kid played for the Permain Panthers football team and how the town uses to be segregated. I think that H.G.Bissindiger didn't talked enough about the football team. Even when he tryed to tell you about the game he did not give you the overal play; he give you how each team scord. what did mojo have to do with this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Football Fans","review":"Having first seen the movie, I was prepared that this was not a starry-eyed wholesale endorsement of high school football, but I was still thrilled when my wife surprised me with a copy to read.I have never been so dissapointed with a book on football, or all of sports for that matter. I enjoyed Next Man Up and A Civil War, due to Feinstein's balance between negative and positive lights on the game. Bissinger, in Friday Night Lights, shows no such balance.He does not \\"follow the season\\" in any logical fashion, sometimes skipping entire games, and spends a chapter instead focusing on national politics. Honestly, you'll see the name of Michael Dukakis more than you will the name of Permian's starting quarterback.I love football, I love high school athletics, and found this book to be very annoying. Check it out in a library before you spend your dollars on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"What an anti-climatic book- very disappointing considering the acclaimed movie- I read it in a book club and we ALL agreed it was a waste of our reading time. Author just drones on and on about the city of Odessa."},{"rating":"2","title":"An classic piece of writing and story-telling","review":"This book is not your typical sports diary. Yes, this classic work chronicles the year of a high school football team. But this book is more about the crazed culture of high school football in Texas, the jock culture in high school, racism, classcism, poverty, and the abuse of high school kids all in the name of prep sports.Bissinger crafts the story well: explaining the fanaticism of high school football in Odessa by first explaining the history of the town and how they came to cling on to something as trivial as a bunch of 18-year olds -- many who will not play the game at 19 -- playing football. For many who are 25, 30, 40, 50 and older, it's quite odd that Permian High School football takes center stage in their lives. I, too, am a sports fanatic, but Permian fans are over the top. Bissinger captures all this and more.It's a riveting piece, and should be a must-read for anyone who just loves great story-telling and journalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Marches On","review":"I am a 2001 grad of Permian High School and I can say that I remember the East Side of town getting carried away with Permian football when I was younger. However, I do not remember any significant racism at all and didn't know what the \\"N\\" word meant until junior high. Odessa has changed dramatically since 1988 - the economy is much better, has more diversity, and has more stability than it used to; more businesses and corporations are coming to Odessa; our schools are much better academically; and our medical facilities are now some of the best in the state. Football also has a different place now. The Panthers have not been to the state playoffs since 1998 and have not had a winning season since then - in '99 they went 4-6 and in '00, '01, and '02 they went 5-5. This has been a mixed blessing because it has allowed other sports and also the fine arts to receive proper recognition. Friday Night Lights is a book about what Odessa used to be, not what it is now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrific book - but a bad read on Kindle!","review":"In terms of content, please reference other reviews. I am writing to talk about the way this book reads on the Kindle. I have a feeling that the original pages were scanned and converted to be read as an e-book, instead of typed as its own digital file.The font is unusual for the Kindle, and is sometimes mis-formatted. The pages take especially long to turn, which goes against Amazon's attempts to \\"make the Kindle disappear\\" - it is a constant reminder that you are reading an e-book, as opposed to other books where you forget that you're reading from a screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lights Are On In Texas","review":"Odessa is known to be a big place on dream. This story shows the light of the people who live in Odessa Texas. A high school team called the Permian Panthers play every Friday night September through December. The Permian Panthers are the \\"winningest\\" team in Texas. Odessa, a town that is rated third for most murders, doesn't stop the Permian Panthers from winning. Bobbie the running back is the best player on the team. In preseason Bobbie gets a mild injury that takes him out for six weeks. Instead of staying out for six weeks he goes back in three weeks. Bobbie has a mild knee injury he is playing on. Bobbie gets a bone-crushing hit that takes him out for the season. Mark Winchell the quarter back for the Panthers has a dad that is very hard on him because he won State. Every year the panthers have gone to State. This year they need to go and win.

I was a little worried because I knew the movie was not something I would let her watch but I figured the movie had been made to please Hollywood and the book was probably not as bad/inappropriate for a 13 year old or they wouldn't have it on the reading list. Any way she came to me three pages in and said it had the \\"f\\" word in it and \\"God damn it\\". I glanced at the pages she mentioned and we deleted the book. I figured if it was starting out with that stuff at the beginning then it wasn't going to become better for her to read as she got deeper into it. Buy with caution, especially if it is for a young adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Doesn't anyone out there find this book a tad bit cynical? How about manipulative? This author clearly has an ax to grind. There is no balance in the telling of this tale. The jacket copy claims the author writes with \\"compassion\\"; smug detachment is more like it. I have to think some of the people in this book feel seriously betrayed. Sports Illustrated tells better sports stories, and as social commentary this becomes repititious drudgery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth hurts","review":"It's been a while since I last read FNL (A friend stole my copy of the book and left town.), but I was born and raised in Odessa. And I was there at the time chronicled in the book. When Bissinger came to town doing research for his book, the football fanatics all assumed he would be writing a glorious tale of football dominance and gladly extended all that small town hospitality. However, when the book came out, people realized that he had seen beneath the surface of our backwards little burg and pulled some dirty skeletons out of our collective closet on a national stage. When he came to do book singings in the area, hospitality quickly turned to death threats. But that book was exactly what the entire town needed... a cool, refreshing glass of water thrown in our face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, many subjects touched","review":"I will not get into any details of the book, but this book touches many issues of our society.The story told in the book is also great and exciting.I definitely recommend this book to every reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The book arrived in the mail pretty much right after I ordered it and is just an outstanding book overall.

Playing on a high school football team (P.C. Pirates) where I play football in a very good conference I can't even imagine the crowd itself. Then the way these guys played without a heart was insane. Since, I come from Texas I knew that football was really big but not this big. It was truly amazing to read that the Odessa (a town) revolved around the Permian Panthers (the football team).I would completely recommend this book to everyone I met. This book is truly the best book I've read by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"... And Much, Much More","review":"I picked this up for the football, but fell in love with the clarity of the writing and the depth of feeling displayed by Bissinger for the team, the community, and the way of the world in the late 1980s. (As my roommate would say, \\"There's a lot going on there.\\") I loved how everything came to life on the page: the football especially, but also the players, and the economy, and the politics of race and sports and competition and everything that West Texas embodies of the tradition American spirit. The anthropologist in me is intrigued by all the interplay between cultural elements, and, most interestingly, the cohesion that football brings. Fascinating read on so many levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"An illuminating - and fascinating! - social commentary","review":"What an incredible book. Bissinger does an terrific job in this account of the small town Odessa, located in Texas, and its obsession with high school football. You begin to see how distorted the town's cultural values are when you see what low priority is given to education, and how much money, time and energy is spent on football. Football players are revered when they do well, but then forgotten as soon as they are no longer playing. The book gives you insights into many other conflicts and tensions within the town that are brought out by the obsession with football - race, socioeconomic differences, values. It is just about the dynamics of the town itself, as it is about football."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Football Book","review":"An accurate portrayal of high school football in West Texas. I actually played football at Midland High and my senior year we tied Permian in District. \\"Friday Night Lights\\" the movie (based on this book) is excellent as well and I highly recommend it. On many levels this book changed the landscape of not just HS sports, but sports at all levels, as it brought to light just how big football is in Texas, and at the HS level no less.

It performs well enough in my limited usage, but perhaps the biggest drawback is that it automatically turns itself off after 5 minutes when your phone is out of bluetooth range. The power connector (USB to cigarette lighter) is only for charging the internal battery. So, this means that every time you get in the car, you have to turn the unit on by pressing the power button for 2 seconds. What an oversight. Why not just make the unit wake when power is applied? Anyway, this is a deal breaker for me. My unit is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised; not compatible with all Bluetooth phones.","review":"I sent an email to Amazon because I was told by a Verizon servic rep that the Minikit was not compatible with my Bluetooth phone.

The ear piece devices were uncomfortable and picked up outside noise when talking. The GPS device had great reception, but the device was on the dash and unless I was sitting idle, others had trouble hearing me.The Minikit has great reception and since it mounts to the visor, I can speak clearly into it. I bought my wife the Minikit Slim which has some extra features that are nice but comes at a higher price. If you are looking for a basic bluetooth device with good communication at a great price, I would recommend the Minikit.

The sound quality reported by people I've talked to via the Parrot is excellent (much better than the built-in Bluetooth in my previous car, a BMW).

This was definitely a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this Parrot speaker four months ago. It was very hard to tell when the speaker was on or off. The volume knob just spins in either direction, so you have to play with that until you get the volume where you need it to be. The speaker quality was ok, clear enough to hear what's being said, but very often, the person I called had to call me back because they were getting an echo when I called them using this speaker. Two days ago, I heard a loud crackle sound, and the speaker just stopped working. My cell phone still picks up the blue tooth unit, and switches over automatically to the Parrot speaker, but I cant hear or be heard over the unit at all. I would not recommend this unit to anyone.

Otherwise, you'll be emptying the garbage 5 times a day.There is one design flaw: The can itself has occasionally slipped off the frame and landed on the floor, causing a bit of a mess.

If you have at least 10,000 BP (Battle Points) then you MAY get a gotcha borg or a \\"Data Crystal\\" which is a building block for a powerful Gotcha Borg, however, these are even MORE RARE then a gotcha borg. But, if your persistant, then you'll get a DC (Data Crystal), however, you need 2-4 different DC's, for example, a blue \\"Flame Dragon\\" (there are 2 Flame Dragons, one blue and one green) would need Data Crystals 164A & 164B, after you collect them, you see the data crystals merge into one Gotcha Borg.

It anticipated the strong need of today's viewing & reading public for easy-to-understand formulas that substitute for real thinking (& \\"self\\" understanding). Good cinematography though.

I recommend anyone in education read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Injustice!","review":"The Ayn Rand Institute should hunt down every copy of this video and destroy it. If you've read the book and haven't yet seen the movie... don't. The characters are shallow and the storyline is, well, to be desired.

The black and white DVD that I received was poorly cropped (actually cutting off the top of the characters heads at some times), but it stuck to the story and was worth the price I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fountainhead","review":"The Fountainhead was an excellent book written by Ayn Rand many years ago. I bought the movie because I had enjoyed the book so much. Unfortunately, the dialog was very choppy & the acting was way over-the-top - like William Shatner on steroids. Gary Cooper was OK, though disappointing, but the rest of the cast was awful - especially the female lead, Patricia Neal. The one strong performance was the guy who played Elsworth Toohey (sorry - don't recall his name). Otherwise, I'd suggest skipping the movie & reading the book (even though it's very long)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother seeing \\"Fountainhead.","review":"Unbelievable plot, wooden charactors mouthing Ayn Rands extreme individualist philosophies in set speeches that grate the ear.

Characters and plot were good in the novel. Even if one disagrees with the super-onesided argument against socialism (which I did), one can value the strength of Rand's arguments in the book...and enjoy the plot. Not so with the movie: poor (over)acting (reminded me of the pre-talkies over emoting), poor scipt (perhaps unavoidable when trying to condense SO much into a film format), and just dated ideas (such as a woman needed to be raped to enjoy sex), etc. I would not even consider it a B-movie classic, rather a TERRIBLE \\"A\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was better??","review":"Kinda hard to say the book was better because Ayn Rand wrote the script for this movie version of her book. You'll definitely like the movie if you haven't read the book.

I would love to see this same story done in more modern times where I believe the acting would be less in the dramatic style and seem more real to life. If you've read the book, this movie cuts out so much of what I loved in the book. I wish not only that it would be done in modern times but I can see it being done in a trilogy style to capture all the interaction of characters and the essence of the story would be more complete.

If you've read her novels you would know that her heroes are anything but emotional . They are strong willed exceptional people who don't over react to adversity. In this movie they are transformed into weaker versions of themselves making my heart drop .

HE WAS A GREAT ACTOR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I could give it a higher rating but...","review":"This movie is a good adaptation of Ayn Rand's book. The stars and direction are first rate. Considering Ms. Rand's views, never was a movie more deserving of being filmed in black and white. I always enjoy watching it on TV and am glad to hear that it will soon be in DVD format.Like most movies, the book is better. Usually this isn't much of a problem since you can go see the movie first and then read the book. Presto... you get to enjoy both of them for what they are.However, in this case the movie fails to explain (or foreshadow) why the jury at the end votes the way it does. The book makes it clear that this outcome is more than mere happenstance. I am afraid that most people watching the movie will find the outcome farfetched and avoid reading the book. For this reason alone I am lowering my grade of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking all around...","review":"While the book was groundbreaking and continues to be one of the most successful sellers in American literature, the film version also was significant in its own right. Its technological innovations continue to be discussed in film classes, however the photography, building sets, philosophical dialog, and minimalist romanticism make this a pleasantly fascinating watch for any viewer who has ground down their teeth while enduring the schlock pouring out of Hollywood over the past several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic film","review":"This is a classic film w/classic movie stars. Nothing else needs to be said other than it is based on the life of Frank Loyd Wright, the architect that broke the mold. Patricia Neal is stunning in the film but the real winner of the acting award should go to Raymond Massey for his fine performance of the newspaper mogul. Gary Cooper plays Howard Roark, the man who wouldn't conform. Great stuff!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to my classic movie collection!","review":"I love classic film and this is one of my favorites. Partly due to the fact that I love Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal together; it's no wonder these two had a long affair - they had a natural chemistry. I also have a new respect for the film after listening to an audio book of Atlas Shrugged - I now have a better understanding of the tumultuous attitude of the characters.And, one of the most profound statements ever written: \\"Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision.\\" I'll delve into the book in the near future for the complete story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An idealistic story which stands the test of time.","review":"While the movie isn't quite as in depth as the novel, the basic story is intact.

Warning: can be life-changing for impressionable youths."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Disappointment","review":"Whatever you thought of the book - and I loved it - this film adaptation is a failure. The casting, the screenplay (in which Rand herself had a hand) fail to do the book justice.

The movie wasn't as good as the book, but then what movie is ever as good as your own imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Great, Half Garbage","review":"Oh, it's hard to rate this film with stars.The problem is dramatic; Pat Neal is mesmerizing as Dominique, and Vidor moves the movie along with brilliant momentum.Then we have Gary Cooper, who seems embarrassed - as well he should - by the cartoonish dialogue. All right, Rand wants to ram her objectivist views down every available throat. But surely someone with a sense of good dialogue was near the set? Her screenplay is riddled with sentiments expressed as subtly as the 'Ka-POWS!' in the Batman TV show. Herds of sheeplike businessmen say 'But what's the good in originality?', or, 'Look here, old man, one mustn't fight popular opinion!'. It's really that banal.Too bad. I don't much care about the philosophy Rand espouses, either way. What bothers me is that a ridiculously clumsy trumpeting of it ruins what good have been a classic film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic or silly melodrama?","review":"I read this book a couple of decades ago. I knew I was supposed to love it since it's regarded a classic, but I really can't remember if I liked it or not. I just watched the movie and it's really one of the most ridiculous movies of all time. I don't know if it was a bad version of the book or not, but I am certainly not going to waste a second rereading the book to find out. Although I understand the point Ayn Rand made (over and over and over and over), I don't think she was nearly as profound as she apparently thought herself. Gary Cooper was wooden as always, and everyone's dialogue was so corny and overly-dramatic it was hard not to laugh. I bet they had a hoot during filming. Or maybe they were just embarrassed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic put on the screen","review":"Good adaptation of the classic Ayn Rand novel, but there is only so much a film maker can do with a book like The Fountainhead. Gary Cooper gave a 5 star performance, Patricia Neal 4 star. Ayn Rand fans (like me) won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayn Rand was so ahead of the game!","review":"Being an Architect I am partial to this movie and of coarse Gary Cooper was a perfect fit for his role. The amazing part is how true the movie was for it's time and even more so in today's day. Condemned by so many conformist and liberal press, it is amazing how true many of her theories have come true. Her popularity has sored more than ever. Personally I think her work should be a part of college or even high school curriculum and maybe the future of tomorrow may have a better chance. It far exceeds some of the garbage taught in universities today.

The storyline exudes high integrity-something lacking in today's political arena where people will use the press to say anything regardless of truth. The lead character is a tall, real, man of character. I would recommend this story to all students 12 to 23 who are growing and developing as young adults.

I was even told that there was a climatic car chase near the end but I discovered that they were lying through their teeth. The plot is stale. The steritipical gags are recyled from other TV shows. I can't picture Robin Williams as a womanizing car salesman. His acting for this character is [not nice]and mediocre. If you want to see something better with fantastic acting from Robin Williams then I suggest watching Jumaji or Mrs. Doubtfire..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Robin Williams Junk","review":"This is not a funny movie -- unless you enjoy using a person's personal problems as a vehicle for scenes of gratuitous sex and violence, and a lot of barely humorous wisecracks. It's a typical Robin Williams movie; how many times do you need to see him try to cackle and doubletalk his way through some serious situations in his lame attempts at humor? Robin Williams is not a comedian, and certainly is not a serious actor, which leaves no reason to view these pointless films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Williams most underrated film","review":"Robin Williams is so sleazy in this movie that it's easy to dislike the film, but it's a fine performance with great chemistry between him and Tim Robbins.

Not that the humor is that intelligent, it just doesn't hit you over the head with obvious jokes. It is a take off on the 'real' 'cookie cutter' hostage dramas, and the fun it makes of them is subtle. (For example, the cops' reaction, after disbelieving that Larry has brought explosives taped to his bike, when it is 'revealed' to them that he obtained them in Jersey. There is no over the top joke, but it is VERY funny if you are paying attention and have enough common knowledge to get it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic gore fest with humor","review":"Note quite as gory as Dead Alive (Braindead), but pretty close.

The Quest is one such movie. There are about 15 different subplots in the movie, each one lasting about 10 minutes and each one involving Van Damme wearing an outlandish costume. Every new subplot opens up another loose end, and the different subplots are only held together with poor acting (excepted by Roger Moore) and cheesy dialogue (exemplified by Roger Moore's character). The various subplots hang until the end of the movie, when Van Damme's narration simply dismisses them all. Then the entire movie turns out to be a flashback that is in turn encapsulated in a book. It's priceless.

It's amazing how many churches and other religious institutions focus their attentions on individuals headed for \\"ministry.\\" I fully agree with the author's observation that the other Christians, the ones in the so-called \\"real world,\\" are just as important but not as oft-trained.This book seeks to encourage Christians from every field and industry to live out loud for the greater cause. It covers many fields -- quite well, I might add. My only gripe is that at some points, the writing style felt a little slow. In the middle of certain chapters, I felt myself flipping ahead to see how many pages I had left before the next section began. All in all, though, I wouldn't trade in the experience of reading this book.

I give thanks every day to whatever turned me on to Ivo Papasov and these chaps are almost in the same category. Their scene is improvising electric/acoustic jazz with a taste of the leader's Greece. Exaras was born in Thessaloniki in the Macedonia prefecture of Greece, not far from fabled Thrace, the home of history's Orpheus. His instruments are the hollow body and classical guitars and his head is not in Missisippi. Oh no, he is an improviser who listens and plays in a style a little like george Benson and a lot like himself. It works quite nicely with Exaras, clarinetist Bournias and percussionist Tuncboyacian providing the Balkans taste. Bournias even trots out the zurna, a double reed Balkans bagpipe.I won't go on and on about the CD. If it sounds like your thing, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"This album has a very fresh and unique sound.This album establishes a new style in jazz,because it combines the well-known jazz music with the raw melodic lines and instruments of the whole Balkan area.I also like the great painting work of the cover.I think it is an outstanding production and it has to be heard from a wider audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but weak story.","review":"Although the animation was good (it reminded me of Disney) and the alternate universe presented was imaginative, the story itself wasn't much, kinda on the level of a Saturday morning kids cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great ones","review":"A Vietnam vet (Rutger Hauer) is blinded in action and MIA.

He returns to the states to find his old Army buddy, who's being leaned on by drug dealers. The gangsters kill the buddy's wife, and Hauer must protect her son, who is a source of unnecessary emotionalism in this movie. Hauer tracks down his buddy, kills a bunch of bad guys, and saves the day. The fight scenes are great, showing imagination and humor. I think they could have done without the kid, and the end was ridiculous and corny. But otherwise, this ranks as one of the great ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uneasy mix of action and comedy","review":"This film combines these two genres and is kind of unsuccessful.There are some interesting action scenes and it does capture the essense of the late '80's action flicks very well,but you're thankful at the end of how short it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintentionally ridiculous","review":"From beginning to end this movie was hilarious. The storyline was trite and predictable. Rutger Hauer's character was an incredibly cheesy, \\"amazing\\" blind guy who can wield a sword, tell if you're making faces at him, or find sweaty men eating potato chips in a corn field.

The trouble is those films weren't taking themselves very seriously.

While the audio mix seems a little odd in some scenes (the late Michael Kamen's brilliant score sometimes gets lost in all the sound effects and explosions), the movie looks better than it ever has, comparable to blu-ray releases of more recent movies. Yah, sure, all this eye-popping, hi-def clarity really shows the seams in the dated effects and make-up, but enjoying The Adventures of Baron Munchausen requires such a huge suspension of disbelief in the first place that I don't think many will care, and some might even find these flaws make it MORE endearing.

Terry intended this as a homage/tribute to the brilliant Czech animator Karel Zeman, whose earlier version of the Munchausen fable is still the definitive one. This version, though well-meant, is done in by too much budget and too many 'Spot-The-Star' moments. Anybody looking to really exercise that 'sense-of-wonder' should hunt down Zeman's version: despite its poor characterizations, mainly post-synch sound and general narrative torpor, it's truly unforgettable and the reason Gilliam became an animator in the first place. Though Gilliam's 'Baron' is clever and generally watchable, it too suffers from narrative torpor - which is harder to excuse with a $40- million budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I was expecting this to be really good after all the rave reviews; and no, it wasn't terrible; but it's not that great.

I listen to a wide variety of new age and electronic music and Digital Moodz manages to combine the best of what's out there and more into an excellent offering. You get a taste of the old world guitar and flutes meeting new electronic ambient sounds with a mix of haunting but pleasing vocals now and then. It sounds familiar but there is alot of uniqueness to the music which is hard to explain. There is much to keep you interested unlike alot of new age music which lately seems to be bland and boring. I am sure this will be a favorite of mine for many years to come. Can't wait to hear more for Digital Moodz. I definitely recommend this to any fan of new age, world, ambient groove or electronic music. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful CD","review":"This is a wonderful CD filled with sounds from different corners of the world. My favorite tracks are \\"Within\\", \\"Mist\\" & \\"True Virtue\\" though the entire CD is good. I give this CD my full recommendation for any one who likes excellent new age music with an ambient but upbeat atmosphere. I can't directly compare it to Deep Forest or Enigma because Digital Moodz has their own sound but if you like them you will also like Digital Moodz."},{"rating":"1","title":"This review is for the edition not the story....","review":"I opened up this book last night and had to almost immediately put it down.

The CD that accompanies the book is even better! It contais an easy database to use where you can look up just about all the information that is in the book, I believe it might even contain more than the book. Plus the picures contained on the CD are great. There are so many destinations to read about in both the book and the CD, I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to get through them all.

This is a cultural and historical study of the clan, from the founder (new legends about him are in here) to being the \\"soul of the Sabbat.\\" The reader sees quickly that this clan has rejected their humanity and has spent the centuries exploring what thier true nature is. It was a bit disturbing to read about a group so divorced from humanity. This book will help you with your role-playing, by giving you a guided tour into the differnces between humanity and the metamorphists. You will have the opportunity to play something which is alien from the way that you and I think.The one draw back is that the short list of disciplines is mostly a reprint from previous Tzimsce books."},{"rating":"2","title":"This clanbook is full of information . . .","review":"The Fiends have long been a source of hardship to play, mainly because no one understood them.

The material is chrome surface and rarely become rusted if not at all. It is best soap dish so far and I went through dozens of soap dish. I drain the water out every now and then and wipe it with a small cloth and it's shiny again. I recommend it for dorm room and hallway bathrooms where soap is used frequently and does not have time for soap to dry enough to retain the shape and hardness. It's also good for using with soft soap like the beauty bar from Clinique. I like to use the soap dish with Dove soap. Dove tends to melt easily when water is on the soap. It becomes messy.

The tabs are the only way to go. They do not break and you only need to take 2 to equal 3 vcaps! Who has time to take vitamins 3 times a day anyways? Vcaps are a good in theory but bad in practice.

There aren't any books by a Native and an anthropologist that I know of that are as enjoyable, entertaining, and informative as this one. It is the perfect accurate, objective, in-depth, real counterpoint to much of the cotton candy fluff one finds about native ways and history in the New Age, and the dead, ponderous, dry, over-intellectual tomes that usually come out an institution as prestigious as the Yale University Press.

So naturally he wants a wife to match; he turns down his ugly, clumsy, unfeeling, existing wife, Ruth (Rosanne), for a more useful one that is a novelist Mary Fisher (Meryl Streep.) What should be a happy ever after story for the new couple turns into a nightmare. Looks like Ruth intends to get more than even; she finds out his values in order of priority (home, family, career and freedom.) then she commits her life to removing his assets in that order. Her unique approach to the task is what makes the story. However it is the action and reaction of the people that will hold your attention. Will the task be accomplished? The result may surprise you.Ed Begley Jr. makes a good Bob, falling in to every trap set and suffering the consequences. See him again in \\"The Applegates\\" (1991). Only this time the bugs (Ed Begley Jr. is one) are set on revenge or at least survival which means removing humans."},{"rating":"2","title":"She-Devil","review":"The movie was excellent, love this plot and the ending very much.

Many women may secretly identify with her awkwardness in the pre-betrayal scenes, the perfect character-building for the intensity to come.Meryl Streep's elegant, intentionally overacted portrayal of the other woman is hilarious, with her prima donna character.

Older movies can be hard to find, so I was really glad to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valor RM-921C","review":"So far so good. The overhead lights are led type, not incandescant, so they have a white/bluish tint compared to the other lights in the car, and they are not as bright as my old unit that this replaced, but they work fine. The DVD player stores your place on the movie when you shut it off, so that it picks up where you left off when you turn it back on. Great sound through aux input on my sony stereo. Good picture. Seems to be built well, has a good feel. All the needed controls are at your fingertips and the remote works well too. The volume control does control the Aux output to the stereo which is nice, my old unit did not. We'll see how long it lasts, hopefully a long time. I only wish it came w/ a pair of IR headphones, but I was able to find an inexpensive universal headphone without any problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow this is better than expected!","review":"At this price I expected cheap plastic, but it even feels well made.

Adult used, as my children are not allowed to play with the DVD player. I purchased the Valor unit just over a year ago and am experiencing problems already. It did work as it's suppose to up until a week ago. Now the unit will not eject the DVD that is in there nor will it play the DVD. I will be purchasing a new Overhead DVD Player and this one will not be made by Valor. I really wish these companies would give a 3 year warranty for their products. It's obvious that nothing goes wrong when the unit is under warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Purchase","review":"This was the worst purchase I have made in a long time. First, installation wasn't typical. I expected to be able to pull my old DVD player out and just reattach new wires. Not so simple. I couldn't get it to work. However, that is not this DVD players fault. I am not a professional and they recommend a professional. I then hired a professional, when I told him what brand I bought he tried talking me out of installing it and told me to send it back. I was past my return window so that wasn't going to work. I figured, it should at least work for a little while. Well, it did, it worked for about two weeks. It now goes to a blue screen after watching for about 5 minutes. Sometimes sooner (immediately) sometimes longer. But it always makes its way to the blue screen saying \\"No Video Signal\\". This thing is complete garbage. It is also very cheaply made, I'm not going to wast my time trying to get the company to fix it or give me another one. Do yourself a favor and go with a name brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"I purchased an elph for the size and the fact it takes panaramics. At first I was happy with it, it took good pictures, was easy to load and unload, and was compact. After about 3-4 months I was in the keys with my friends when we took our last picture on the film, it would not rewind not even manually. I brought it to a camera place to see if they could get the film out and they told me to send it back to canon. The door was stuck and he did not want to ruin it. I did happen to eventually get the film out myself but the camera still did not work so I sent it in (supposively under warranty) and they wanted to charge me $75 to fix it.

The camera was a little over one year old and we had probably shot less than 8 rolls of film. Towards the end of the film, it jammed and we had to send the camera back to Canon to be fixed. After 6 weeks the camera shop called us to say that Canon had returned the camera to them with a note that said they had tried to contact us about the repair bill and because we didn't respond they assumed we didn't want to pay. We had not received any contact or quote from them. The camera shop finally managed to get hold of someone at Canon after calling them for 2 days and they quoted us $115 to fix it, which included a \\"thorough clean\\". Gee whizz. No thanks.

The camera was easy to use too. Unfortunately, the camera is poorly made, and the H light (signifying a mechanical problem) began flashing after the second roll of film. The camera lens failed to retract, and I had to take the camera to a repair shop for repairs. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Just as everyone else stated, this is a great compact, cool looking camera. Pictures have turned out okay. Some were blurry but I suspect it may be the lighting. Outdoor pics were clear as the sky. However, I have a lot of problem with loading and unloading the film. Sometimes the camera would keep rolling sounding like it would load the film but when it stops making noise the cartridge symbol blinks asking you to put in the film. And when it finally loads correctly and finishes rewinding the film, the door gets stuck and would not open. It's quite frustrating. I'm going to get a refund and I suggest not getting this camera at all especially for this price. You should probably go with their digital elph camera instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My hubby purchased this as a present for me. During the first roll of film the \\"H\\" light started flashing and I haven't been able to get the camera working since. Have changed the battery.

It's broke and I can't get it working! I took it to the Camera Shop and they said it would cost $110.00 to fix it! Forget it! I'm going back to 35MM - the film is cheaper and it cost a lot less to get developed. How much easier was the APS after all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined my trip!","review":"I have to say I am completely disappointed with this product. I purchased it from Best Buy the day before I left for a trip to Utah. The first roll: it stopped taking pictures after the 17th one. I had to put in a new roll. The second roll: it stopped functioning after the 22nd picture. I was devastated. I developed the pictures and most of them have red eyes, and the quality is horrible. I am shocked that this product passed Canon's quality controls. I have another Canon camera that I am crazy about. I have returned the new one; I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon.com before buying it.

I've developed 4 rolls of film so far and I'm not at all impressed by the quality of the photos. My biggest complaint is red eyes.

I did however take some panoramic landscapes and they came out awesome. On another note, just like other people have mentioned, the camera looks cool and is small enough to fit in your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKEN AFTER 1 USE!!","review":"Yeah, it's cute, but it doesn't work too well. The first roll was fine, and thereafter, the film wouldn't load properly. It took 8+ tries to get the film loaded the second time around. In the middle of my third roll, the camera just stopped working. The lens didn't engage after opening the shutter door.I'm in the process of returning the camera to Cannon, which will take 3 weeks before I see it again.I'm pretty unhappy with this cutie. If you buy it, get some kind of extended warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable Pricing","review":"Amazon had listed the Canon Elph Z3 for $129.94 and now they raised the price to $149.88.

The movie started out great and it seemed I had a true classic on my hands but as time wore on I realized what a [bad movie this was]. The story is incredibly weak and goes in a totally opposite direction than what you'd expect, favoring badly done humor instead of throwing in some sorely needed combat sequences. The fight scenes themselves are well done half the time and boring the other half. If you're a fan of Jet and want to see a well done collaboration between him and Wong Jing, check out Deadly China Hero or Lord of the Wu Tang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy \\"THE NEW LEGEND OF SHAOLIN\\" instead!!!","review":"Columbia Tristar completly raped the original \\"The New Legend of Shaolin\\" and gave it a new name. The voice actors are horrible especialy the voice of Jet Li. The sound effects are inconsistent with the Kung Fu genre. Many really good scenes were deleted.

But this is a pretty sorry release for it. So Tai Seng is releasing widescreen laser disc masters again? Niiicccee. Wait for a better release. At least that one might not have a Ric Meyers commentary on there. If there's a sure sign of a lack of care from a company releasing kung fu films, it's Meyers' name anywhere on the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Monkey (1993) is Better.","review":"It's sad to see Americans put down Hong Kong martial arts movies. I encourage anyone that liked the old Shaw Brothers stuff (like 5 Deadly Venoms) to RUN and get these newer movies. They easily blow Hollywood away (except The Matrix). I was watching bootleg versions of these movies 6 years ago in Chinatown, so don't listen to these \\"I'm a real martial artist and...\\" people. They're the same ones that made Chuck Norris a star. Hollywood can't buy the 'eye' these HK directors have. See \\"Iron Monkey\\" too...it's REALLY good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the ORIGINAL instead!","review":"Not realizing that the American distributor had decided to edit the film, (which was already edited and complete, so this is extremely rude and arrogant), I rented this one. And was a bit puzzled at some of the dialogue. Then I found out about the real version, NEW LEGEND OF SHAOLIN and had to go elsewhere to buy it. What a difference!! Not only were scenes there that had been cut from this shlocky version, but entire conversations were different!! (I use subtitling only so can't vouch for the dubbed.) It made a HUGE difference to the film, which is just plain fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jet Li s Worst","review":"Some critics dubbed this movie on its dvd release in Europe; it being ones of Jet Li s best movies. If so I think they either must have seen the wrong movie or been half asleep during it, because this it without a doubt one of his worst. The story is terrible, lacking originality, realism and even a true storyline. At times they try to much, to many sideslines, and at others (most) too little. The martial arts are even worse, lacking any reality. Not only that but it really looks bad. Matrix and many other movies present unrealistic martial art, but at least they have the excuse of looking good, or having some excuse in the story (Matrix is an unreal world to begin with), this has neither. To top it of the acting [stinks], as do the SFX, the subs make it worse (if that is possible). Dont buy this, its not worth it even IF your a JEt Li fan. If it was possible to not give it any stars, I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for you if you loved him in his American premier LW4","review":"I fell for Jet Li after seeing him in Leathal Weapon 4.If you are not familiar with the Honk Kong type of movie style,you will be terribly dissapointed,this movie will seem obsurd and terribly staged.It doesn't give you the opportunity to really experience Jet's great talent for the martial arts,it's all done with wires and \\"smoke and mirrors\\" so to speak.Wait around for future \\"American made\\" movies starring Jet Li,there will be plenty coming since his great reception in Lethal Weapon 4.Be patient and wait,and if you can't the best thing to do is rent or buy,\\"Fist of Legend\\",\\"Hitman\\",or \\"Bodyguard from Beijing\\".These movies don't get into the silly comedy and ridiculous antics that are in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"movie\\" is an insult!","review":"Being a martial artist myself, I loved Lethal Weapon 4.

The English subtitles are humorously bad translations, and the DVD does not have many features found on more recent releases, but the widescreen format is much appreciated in this lush drama of revenge and obsession. The fight sequences are well done and the plot moves along both quickly and logically. If you enjoy martial arts films, this is definitely one to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story and fighting","review":"The fight scenes in this movie from beginning and close to the end were incredible. Jet and boy in this movie were great. Thinking beginning of this movie will get your attention, but the very end gets a little crazy I won't spoil it. I recommend getting the dub version, because a lot is going on and it will be hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmm","review":"Ok, first of all, I didn't like the evil guy in his little silver car. This movie could have been very good, but something about it didn't make it as good as it should have been. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie a lot, I've never seen Jet Li look as sexy as he does in this movie! And Xie Maio is such a talented litle martial artist! When, him and Jet Li fight together, all I can say is, wow. If you liked The Kung Fu Master (I Loooooooved it) I think you'll apreciate this one, because they both have a similar fantasy element to it. All and all I like this movie, watch it if you like Jet Li."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Great product especially if you have difficulty holding binoculars steady enough to read things far away.

But I had seen this movie before, so I knew what it was like. The story is as good as any of the Sinbad stories. It has a good cast with known artists. Patrick Wayne is good as Sinbad. Of course the Ray Harryhausen effects are good, as always for the time, and the type. It's a fun movie, so don't get too serious about it. Enjoy the campiness of the genre. Yes, they might have selected a 'darker' actor for Sinbad, who is obviously an Arab, even a Muslum (references in dialogue to Allah), but remember it's a story... a movie. Just enjoy.

After convincing my girlfriend that it wasn't as bad as it looked, we took it home.Needless to say she made it to about the \\"attack of the killer walrus\\" scene before walking out.

It is a shame that this didn't turn out the way Ray wanted it to. He never had a big budget for his effect and time was a big factor. Given the circumstances it is a wonderful effort! It is the weakest of the three Sinbad films, but it is still worth owning if your a fan. Ray's effects never get old to me. The DVD transfer is good,but they all deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger","review":"Well I have to say I always have enjoyed this movie, it was actually the first Sinbad movie I have ever witness and I was pretty much in awe of it as a kid, watching it on DVD on the widescreen still takes me back to those days, even though it wasn't done with ILM effect standards for me its more about the suspension of belief and going back it a more innocent and certainly less technical time. To redo a Harryhausen movie would be like colorizing black and white classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally enjoyable SInbad film","review":"I really liked this film, I dont see why some dont, it has great stop animation and Patrick Watne was not that bad as Sinbad.

What it is, is a roughly hour long documentary on 'investigators' in the phenomenon. It's a look at the variety of everyday joes that have an interest in this. It's nothing special and the 'educated expert' does nothing more than summarize Ivan Sanderson's book on classifying unknown homonids.

I think some of the people reviewing it here on Amazon take it and themselves a little too seriously.It was quirky and fun and sweet all at the same time. Included is a light biography of Einstein and the bizarre events that took place after his death concerning his brain. Even a little Relativity is thrown in. This is not a serious book and shouldn't be approached as one. I don't think it is one of the great books of our time, but it did provide an interesting escape.I started readng it, thinking it was fiction, only to discover it is for the most part a factual account.

What I got was a dull read narrated by someone who's sense of adventure was evidently hamstrung. The whole thing turned into a detailing of the quirks of the professor, interspersed with bits of \\"wow, cool, I'm in a car with a dissected brain!\\". Eating breakfast at a diner is not an adventure. Staying at motels, ditto. I waded through nearly half the book in foolhardy optimism thinking something might happen. Anything. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can tell he writes for Esquire","review":"This book is just one long-winded Esquire article...a topic with a catchy enough premise to suck you in, words that are put together well enough that you don't put it down immediately after picking it up, but in the end, it goes absolutely nowhere.

Sometimes magazine articles -- from which this was expanded -- are only a few pages long for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"How I envied the formaldehyde-soaked brain","review":"I needn't waste the reader's time, as has Paterniti, by expounding at great length upon a simple kernel of thesis. I found Paterniti's prose style to be painfully affected. It meandered clumsily through a tangle of disconnected self-musings that so permeated the book, that what promised to be an inherently gripping narrative sank into oblivion. Perhaps most irksome, Paterniti was too busy obsessing about his failure to do anything with life, that he also failed to learn any physics. If one is going to wax philosophical regarding the implications of a great physical theory, one ought to go to the trouble to understand even the basics. In short, reading this book made me wish my brain was the one in the jar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashing Mr Albert","review":"Very disappointed by this book and can't believe it was a top seller. Someone gave it to be as a birthday present and I will quickly pass it on to someone I don't like.As an adventure trip across the USA it is lacking, gives a poor introduction to Einstein's life and works, and Harvey is in someway a bystander to Paterniti's philosophical mutterings about nothing in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Words","review":"I have waited for a book from Mr. Paterniti since I read his brilliant 1997 article on Einstein's brain in Harper's Magazine, but Mr. Albert is deeply disappointing. Given a book length format the author has the time and space to go on about his apparently dwindling affair and his theories of love (\\"You lose each other and find each other again. Every day. Until love gathers the turtles and birds of your world and encompasses them, too.\\"). He labors mightily to draw clever parallels between his own life, Dr. Harvey's, Einstein's, and the laws of physics, but he rarely succeeds with grace.There are gems to be found, but I don't think it's worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"The book is just OK. A friend told me that inspired by the success of this project, the author got a job as a Federal Baggage Screener to write an expose of this profession (although he claims that he just wanted to be a Federal Baggage Screener), and has been doing the rounds of TV interviews (CNN, FOXNews(unfair and biased), Nickelodeon, etc) to boost sales. He's been attacked by some of the interviewers for not being straight about his intentions to write an expose (but he claims that he just wanted to be a Federal Baggage Screener.)

Be warned though, if you're looking for the same old story of boy meets girl, or boy blows up boy, etc., you won't find it here. The beauty of this book is that the story comes from within. Mr. P's humorous introspection often found me experiencing my own. Maybe it was the book, maybe it was the time I read it, but whatever it was, it helped change the way I look at life. Wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kerouac meets Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil","review":"I read this book in a single day, laughing out loud every few pages and ignoring incoming phonecalls, visitors, and mealtimes along the way--whatever might come between me and Driving Mr. Albert. It's a quirky, sweet, smart, and sometimes sad tale built on the backs of three great characters--Michael Paterniti, Dr. Harvey, and Einstein's brain. The writing is stunning straight through, Paterniti's reflections on life and love belong in Bartlett's, and the mad trio's visits to Los Alamos, Vegas, and William S. Burroughs poise this book as the 21st century version of On The Road. A thrilling, fun read... I can't recommend it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Super book - different than anything else I've ever read.

Hmm, there's a hook we haven't seen before. \\"And now for something completely different.\\" It's a good mix of Einstein's life and thought, oddball humor, oddball trivia, and travelogue that works well in the hands of a talented author. I'll read it again. I've always admired Einstein, and Paterniti writes well. I have much respect for Paterniti. Look at the premise. In the hands of a hack, the end result would really suck. Paterniti's a real author, and perhaps if I type his name enough times I'll remember how to spell it. It's even harder than my name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading, poorly written and boring....","review":"...need I say more?...the book is really about this middle aged writer with marital problems who conjures up this presumably at least partly true tale of finding the guy that has Einstein's brain in a jar and accompanying him on a trip to deliver the remains to Einstein's daughter...mostly it is a mechanism for the writer to expunge angst over his failing marriage...I believe most if not all of the \\"adventures\\" of the road trip are made up...and observing the author wallow in self-pity is boring...skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The road trip to nowhere!","review":"Perhaps, my level of anticipation and expectations were too high thinking that the book, Driving Mr. Albert, would be an amusing road trip with insights to Einstein's life and mind. The book seemed more about the author's own crumby life, and his angst ridden love for Sara (page 187). In the beginning of his road trip with Dr. Harvey, as they traverse states heading west past Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, his attempt to create metaphors describing the numbing white lines lapses into jaded cliches. His writing is endless drivel and unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I expected Driving Mr. Albert to be more of a reflection or retropsective about Albert Einstein. I expected to learn a lot about Albert Einstein, his philosophies, his family, his contributions to society, little-known facts, etc.. Instead, it was in my opinion a fairly bland recollection of Mr. Paterniti's trip with the doctor and the brain. I'm sure it was an interesting trip for Mr. Paterniti, but it wasn't too interesting or insightful for me. My expectations were much different..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull listing of minutiae","review":"If you are looking for an interesting book about traveling across the country along with some insight on the mathematical genius Albert Einstein, keep looking.This book is little more than a listing of minutiae as the author drives a tired old man across the country.Reading this agonizing list of every little thing the author saw, smell, said, and tasted you have to ask yourself if he was paid by the word. At best this book is an extended version of the old \\"How I spent my summer\\" essays we had to write in grammar school.I kept reading hoping that there was some reason the author undertook this project. I looked in vain for a character I could like or some punch line at the end. But alas the book ends as dull as it began.Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left undone","review":"Even with the relatively short amount of words used in this book, I couldn't keep interested. The short quips about relativity are the same old textbook stuff that you read and re-read in countless other more entertaining books on Einstein.

From the jacket, you think it will be a whodoneit, but that is misleading. This is more \\"watch the young woman avoid danger\\" type of books. Basically, the heroine is hired as a governess for a precocious 13 year old girl, who happens to be a famous playwright. Said playwright is tired of writing, and runs away to her uncle in Yorkshire. In the meantime, the playwright meets up with a mysterious cousin named Jeremy, who warns her to \\"beware of relations\\". Soon, the trio has to avoid \\"accidents\\", as someone close wants them dead. But who? Is it the aunt who hired the heroine? The cousin? Or is it the \\"Slipper Killer\\" who is loose about town.

None of the Sinbad movies will never surpass The 7th voyage of Sinbad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Harryhausen","review":"I vividly remember seeing The Golden Voyage of Sinbad as a child one Christmas and it both terrified and thrilled me. Years later, it still sticks in my mind. The film kicks off with Sinbad (John Philip Law) setting sail for an uncharted island with a beautiful slave girl (Caroline Munro) and his motley crew. Along the way, he meets up with a mysterious vizier and does battle with the evil sorcerer Koura (Tom Baker who would later go on to play Doctor Who) who is on a quest to find the fabled Fountain of Destiny.As with any Harryhausen vehicle, though, the monsters steal the show. Exciting as the final battle between a centaur and griffin is, the one you'll always remember is the six-armed sword-wielding goddess Kali. That scene alone is worth the price. The film has dated amazingly well and is a fitting testament to Harryhausen's genius.

In the first ten minutes of the film, I knew I was in for a treat when the female lead killed twenty or so thugs with her samurai sword, while completely butt-naked. What's not to love?But this film has a lot more going for it than just graphic violence and kinky sex. The director's style of filmaking, the cinematography, the hypnotic imagery, and the soundtrack are just amazing. If you're like me, you'll find yourself humming the theme song.Is it an erotic art-house flick or an exploitation film? You decide. This film is, in my opinion, a true cinematic masterpiece.

Lacking something to fill her time she reads stories on a public cable channel having her own show. It is truly captivating to listen to Tandy read these children's fairy tales that we all have grown up with. That is the special thing in the movie. An ad exec discovers her played by Stephanie Zimbalist and tries to make Grace over for network tv. Along the way Grace meets Alex- the ad exec's daughter whose mother (Zimbalist) never has time for her and they develop a relationship which is nice to see. This movie shows the importance of being yourself and when people are trying to change you- how to stick to your guns and not cave in to pressure and how tough it can be to find something to fill your hours as an older person who isn't working. Overall, a great movie that shows the importance of family and friends and staying true to who you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon is shipping DVD-Rs not the Image DVD release","review":"Just a word of warning, the DVD of The Story Lady that Amazon is currently shipping is not the edition advertised.

The cover looks nothing like what you see on Amazon, and it's not the high-quality Image Entertainment release. The cover art is an ugly, distorted looking image, and appears to be duplicated on a color copier.The biggest reason you should not buy a DVD-R: it has no monetary value in the after-market, if you want to sell/trade it to a store in the future. Anybody can duplicate a commercial DVD; duplicates are always worthless, except as archival back-ups.This is not a review of the movie, it's a review of the product itself and of Amazon's failure to respond to numerous complaints about this junk. You will be spending a high amount of money for something that has no value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schtick and slick","review":"I rented this movie after not seeing it for a while and it is still hilarious. Steve Martin and Michael Caine are superb as adversaries competing to defraud women in the Riviera. They are both con-men, but very different in how they go about it. It is a great story of one-upsmanship, until they are both brought to their knees by Glenne Headley (stellar as always). I can't add much that hasn't already been said, but if you enjoy smart comedies, check out this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality. Plays properly in US players.","review":"The recording quality is excellent. I briefly compared the opening scene with the DVD version and could see that the colors are more natural and the credits are sharper, so this is an improvement.

My critical eye detects some room for additional remastering, but I believe I can safely say that you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always fun","review":"We have seen this at least 5 times now and it's a film you can still laugh at each and every time.

No explosions or violence. Amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie","review":"Another one I wanted for my personal collection.

Another hilarious movie! It's about these 2 con-men who scam women for their money. Freddy Benson is a crass, loud American. Laurence Jameson is a suave, urbane European. Their common ground is that they both are confidence men, and they meet in a train compartment as Benson is scamming his way across Europe, taking advantage of women's generosity. The two are forced into a rivalry, which culminates in a wager to see who can be the first to bilk $50,000 out of American heiress Janet Colgate. Then comes a twist ending that'll leave you cracking up for days. This is a must see for anyone who has good taste in movies. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Martin at his best!","review":"Steve Martin is classic here. He is so funny as he works with Michael Caine. Martin does his various impersonations hilarously.

Steve Martin and Michael Caine each bring thier own brand of comedy to this delightfully funny movie. Steve Martin is Freddy Benson a loud mouthed obnoxious American and Michael Caine is a suave, sophisticated frenchman. They way they play off each other is genius. Steve Martin preformance is especially great with all of the ad libbing he does, especially when he plays at being Caine's half witted brother \\"Ruprick\\".

It really is the best of the eighties. Steve Martin is funny while Michael cane is smooth. They're both out for glory and riches. And, the find is in Janet. A real fiery one. She's just as sticky as they are, but even more. Good old Steve knows how to handle any role. So, they both play Janet, but it ends up to be more of a game between each other.

I have never experienced this defect in any other cd, regardless of the source.I responded in the recommended format requesting a replacement, but no response was made by AMAZON.COM nor the vendor, MUSIC MUSIC CDS. This proved to be an UNSATISFACTORY purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The brutal side of war","review":"This book doesn't really have a plot. It's rather an account of what happened at the siege of the town of Breda in 1625, when the Spanish army and its allies surrounded the Dutch and their allies. Our normal protagonist Captain Alatriste is featured, but the main line is really about his young helper Inigo. We are treated (?) to the foot soldier's view of war, which is not glorious for them, while the aristocracy prances and preens in their finery. Even so, we see that these upper class men knew how to fight, and even die, for their king. There's really nothing heroic in this book, which I see as a type of transition from the first two books in this series to the last two books, which will be published later. This is like an \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" for the early 17th century. The author tells a horrific strory, and tells it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved the first installment of this series: a Dumas-like swashbuckler that felt both wonderfully old-fashioned and subtly modern. It was also suspenseful, as was the second book, which was not as thrilling as the first and often bogged down with excessively long descriptive passages. Still, I was looking forward to \\"The Sun Over Breda.'' Alas, a disappointment. No character development to speak of, and not much plot either. Just a detailed description of a military operation: trench warfare of long ago, a seige, a battle. Interesting if you're a military history buff, I suppose, but not much of a story (and since the reader knows from the get-go that Alatriste and Inigo will survive, not much doubt about the outcome either). I'd give the next installment a chance, but if it plods like \\"Breda,'' I'll be giving up on Alatriste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest in the series","review":"I've been enjoying the Captain Alatriste novels but I have to say this is the weakest in the series. It tells how the captain and his young ward Inigo take part in the brutal Spanish war in the Netherlands. There is little sword play and the villains who enliven the other books in the series make no appearance here. Instead, we have awful descriptions of battles and atrocities. It doesn't help that I felt strongly that Alatriste and Inigo are on the wrong side. The Spanish had no business in the Netherlands and represented a backward, repressive, intolerant, racist ideology. Inigo constantly refers to the enemy as heretics bound for hell. Of course, this is historically accurate -- but in a book like this one must root for the heroes and identify with them and it's impossible to do so here. I kept hoping the Spanish would lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Not Great","review":"This is the third book in the Captain Alatriste series that I have read and the weakest. Since I am a devoted fan of the series, I do not expect each book to excel it's predecessor. I look at \\"The Sun Over Breda\\" as somewhat of a diversion from the two books which proceeded it. Previous reviewers have accurately identified how this tale is different and why it is a slower read than its antecedents. Still, I found it very interesting as a detailed description of what 17th century warfare was like and why any attempts to romanticize it are far from the mark. The book motivated me to do research into the siege of Breda and the classic Valasquez painting The Surrender of Breda, which added to my enjoyment of the book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone just starting the Captain Alatriste series, but for those of us already hooked on it, it is a worthwhile read and I've just purchased the fourth book and am looking forward to reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always entertaining!","review":"Once again Captain Alatriste saves the day. Another entertaining and couragueous story from this fine author. Looking forward to the upcoming book in this series. Do yourself a favor, start at the first one and read them through, you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next one","review":"I wish Amazon would just allow us to rate these items and not require the paragraph. others have expressed the merits of this work well enough and I don't have the time to write more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"Being a fan of this genre and of Perez-Reverte in particular, I could not wait for the translation of this book and bought the Spanish version with an eye to reading it as a summer project. The English version arrived in the US market before summer and trumped this plan and many other projects, but not, I am sad to say, for good reason. This book is a huge disappointment. The previous books of the series were swashbuckling mysteries interplaying characters of various levels of Spanish society at the time. Essential to the stories was character development which included the motivations, prejudices and lifestyles of the various players. Perez-Reverte is a master at this and the first two read like a delightful combination of Jorge Amado and Dumas. In contrast, Breda reads like a frontline chronicle and like war, reduces character motivation to survival and nationalism. We really expect better from one of the worlds most famous living authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful read","review":"Just finished this wonderful book. It's amazingly funny, warm, intersting and also unbelievable but thats what gives it its charm. Wonderfully written, Fantastic Characters and an interesting mystery.

I'm reminded of poetic authors like Richard Hugo. The author has a gift for evoking physical environment and getting inside the skin of her heroine. We can feel the weight of her clothes and at times more physical detail than we need. She's a little young for hot flashes but that could happen. Her marriage seems puzzling but totally realistic. If this book begins a series, these developments should unfold in interesting ways.The novel takes a sharp, bizarre turn with no warning. That's why I awarded 4 stars instead of 5. There's no reason for these characters to have some of these off-beat experiences (to say the least)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pool rake","review":"This product was shipped very quickly and is well made.

It's almost as if nirvana were palying the song with J. Homme still at vocals. Just friggin great. Another standout track is \\"Spiders and Vinegroons\\". It's almost there.

It was homage to the man who created a generation of special effects movies, this one included.Stop-action animation has a dated look now, but but it goes with the costuming and sets of the time. The sword-fighting skeleton, the cylcops, dragon, Roc, and minor figures are all incredible achievements. It takes a very special kind of eye to see natural motion and break that into cel-length pieces, but Harryhausen had that knack. Harryhaussen was also central in developing the camera and photo-composition techniques needed, and probably still used today.Arabian Knights purists are probably asking themselves where the dragon and cyclops came from. Don't worry about it - this is entertainment, not scholarship.

As for the blu-ray transfer and disc itself there are several problems I've had.- First off the transfer is full screen and not wide screen. I cannot fathom why this was done as the regular DVD was in wide screen.- Overall the resolution is only slightly better than the original but only in some places. In others it's very grainy.- The colors... pumping up the colors to day-glo levels just doesn't work for me. Yes the colors were a bit muted in the original but what they've done is just silly.- There are no extras to speak of (and the extras mentioned in other reviews are in the regular DVD release ONLY).I honestly can't recommend anyone purchase this version of the film over the regular DVD widescreen release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Blu-Ray Transfer Ever","review":"The video quatity is the worst I have ever seem when watching a movie on blu-ray.

They should never have released this movie on Blu-ray if they could not clean up the picture any better than what they did. If \\"Gone With The Wind\\" from 1939 can look as great as it does why does this movie from 1958 look so bad?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very poor Blu-Ray transfer","review":"Fans of this film, be warned. This is the absolute WORST Blu-Ray transfer I've ever seen. It even rates poorly for a standard def release. Half of the frames were out of focus, and the in-focus shots were way overly grainy. The colors were nice, yes, but that's the only positive thing to say about this one. If you don't believe me, simply wait a couple of weeks until Hi-Def digest reviews the release, which I guarantee will confirm my conclusions.For the record, my Blu-Ray library is over 50 titles, and I use a Panasonic BD 300 player and a 50\\" Panasonic plasma.Again, be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Special Features?","review":"Gosh, I would expect some special features with a blu ray release but according to the info above it has nothing.What a disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have remastered this classic!","review":"If you have the DVD version do not buy the Blu-Ray version-they are identical in quality as far as picture goes.

Some of his fights are tolerable but there is a scene with a helicopter that made my stomach turn in its total disregard of reality. I know, I know, you fans of spiritual kung-fu are mad at me now but be aware that this movie isn't set up that way. Frankly, I'd rather watch a Van-Dammage movie before enduring the torture of viewing this ... again.

Jet Li plays the stuntman for Asia's leading action hero, who's famous for doing his own stunts (wink, wink). The parody of Jackie Chan is hilarious, depicting \\"Frankie\\" as a bumbling boob with an inflated movie star ego. The whole movie moves briskly and has enough decent action and oddball humor to keep one deeply entertained.

Anyone who knows enough about Jackie and his manager, Willie Chan (no relation), can see why this movie has that reputation. I like both Jackie Chan and Jet Li. I bought this movie to see Jet's performance. He was the only good thing in the movie. I cringed whenever Jacky Cheung appeared because his character was too buffoonish. The only enjoyable parts of the movie had Jet. His story-thread was good. The story-thread involving Jacky Cheung was boring and too clownish for me to appreciate. It is as if the director wanted to have two movies in one, but they are too dissimilar to blend together. I don't care that it was designed to make fun of Jackie Chan. I care that it was too silly to accept as 'fun.'

Sure, there are several versions of the Song of Myself, but if you want to read Whitman, read the original. The first version is the most powerful, and Whitman toned it down over the years, turning it into \\"poetry\\" rather than his initial burst of enthusiasm. There are several editions of the poem that will let you get the true texts: for example, the Library of America's complete Whitman has both the first version of Leaves of Grass and the \\"deathbed\\" version, which Whitman revised shortly before his death. There are other versions throughout Whitman's career, as he added poems to the Leaves, and tinkered with existing poems. But this book is a sham. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typographical Errors","review":"I LOVE the poetry, but this edition has typographical errors, some of them pretty important.

The charts were handy guides on what every household should have on hand in order to prepare for emergencies of many kinds. The author recommended several different kinds of \\"survival packs\\" one can prepare for use at home or while out and about -- even an extremely portable \\"pocket pack\\" to help one get safely out of an urban terrorist attack.

Another NWOBHM band of the era, Def Leppard, began producing pop music around this time which paled in comparison to their early rock stuff, and their WORST pop music is better than this album!

Donning the disguise of a wealthy woman, she checks into the hotel and with the aid of her missing neighbor's niece, discovers a Bluebeard might be at work.REVIEW:A fun read, not too deep (not deep at all, actually), and if you're a fan of Miss Withers, it will satisfy you.

This should be a book about divorce and dealing with the process, not a thinly-veiled political commentary. Contrary to what is written in this book, conservatives and their governmental policies are not to blame for the increase in divorce rates.

It offers some good ideas and ways to look at divorce by means that other people have tried. It pushes the fact that though divorces are stressful and most usually ugly... they do not have to be that way if both parties work hard and can find a common ground. I guarantee you this has been most stressful for myself after my husband's infidelities.

They sent out replacement right away. The replacement worked fine until the first heavy rain. Now the sensor looks like it had been submerged into water and again no matter how much i try to adjust the knobs (ya, that's another pain point); it's staying on.

The characters however, are far from wonderful. What could have been a fun story about a family's trip to the zoo, was instead a story about a miserable family who could not get along. As a mother you are looking for positive stories to read to your children. This story did not provide anything positive. I was embarrassed to read this book to my child. Neither one of us enjoyed it at all. I would not recommend any books by Anthony Browne for families. Most of which I feel are very negative, and should not be marketed to children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My child didn't care for this book, and I didn't much appreciate it either. We expected a story about a family's trip to the zoo, but the story was primarily about the family. The father was grumpy and lied about his child's age, trying to get a better price. He also called his child a brat. (Adults in children's story books should be good role models.) The mother never smiled or said anything positive. Her picture portrayed her as no more than a child herself. The children fought and complained. \\"The Zoo\\" was only a setting for a story about a negative family tolerating an unpleasant day. Not appropriate for a children's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zoo Is True","review":"This book should be required reading for Zoo staff and Zoo visitors alike. ZOO is full of the ugly truth that surrounds so many zoo visits. I know. I work at a zoo. This book is appropriatly meloncholy, giving the reader{if they have'nt already] very mixed feelings about these institutions. The characters are real and if just one reader can see themselves in these characters and change for the better,dreams do come true.As always, Anthony Browne's illistrations are haunting and rich. the text is subtle, giving the reader an opportunity to read between the lines as they look between the bars on cages,to find their own perspective.

Perhaps it's a cultural thing and Americans just don't get the humor of it? I don't know...

We sat down to read it this evening and we got thgouth about 4 pages and I closed tha book and asked to get something that wasn't neasrly as offensive. I understand the point of view of zoo haters such as Mr. Browne, but I don't appreciae being ambushed in such a way that belittles the family and puts fathers in such a negative hateful light. I love my wife and children, and don't believe that most faithful husbands and loving fathers resemble anything close to the father that Mr. Browne portrays. I'm sorry he had a rotten childhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disfunctional family at the zoo","review":"This is not your average story of a family going to the zoo.

OK, I \\"get it\\" that zoos are not the most noble creations of humankind, but do we have to shove that down a preschooler's throat so soon?

An action movie with a pacing problem.","review":"This movie has a serious pacing problem. It runs very slow in most of the non-action parts, but runs quickly in the action sequences. The dialog is terrible. Give nervous actors non-natural dialog and the whole movie looks more like a bad high school production. Molly Ringwald character tends to ramble on and on. Midway through, the movie forgets it is in 3D. One sequence in particular, walking across the desert, goes on and on.I watched Spacehunter in 1983 in the theater. It was my first 3D movie. I thought it was a good b-movie at the time. Viewing the same movie now shows me it had lots of ideas but not much money.

The movie is about a down on his luck adventurer/bounty hunter named Wolff (Peter Strauss) who must find three beauties who have been stranded on a planet and captured by some weirdo named Overdog (Michael Ironside). Along the way Wolff meets up with Nikki (Molly Ringwald) who is a local urchin who agrees to help him for food. I won't bore you with anymore about the plot, because there isn't any more.This movie should of been a career killer to everyone involved so I'm guessing that Ringwald already had signed the contract for Sixteen Candles and well, Peter Strauss' career is what it is. In the end I would pass on this film unless you have a desire to see what Molly Ringwald did before she was a famous or unless you are a lover of really bad B movies.

Our baby will not be arriving for two more months, but I am on modified bedrest and can no longer step over the gate we had been using. This one is very well built and easy to install, does not damage the walls at all, and is easy to use! It costs significantly less than other pressure mounted gates and is the only one I have seen with a threshold to prevent tripping. Our main purpose for this gate right now is to keep the dogs out of the dinning room. My only gripe is that our cats have both attempted to squeeze through the bars and ended up stuck and needing help. This is probably no fault of the manufacturer. We are working to teach our lazy cats to jump over the gate. So, overall, a really great gate! But be cautious if you have cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"This gate seemed good when I first installed it but, after 3 months the small pieces of plastic that hold the gate in place when closed has broken. That is one of the few pieces of plastic on this gate but in a very crucial spot. The foot pedal was also very hard to use and eventually made the gate hands free no longer as you would often need to support yourself before slamming down on the pedal. I am very disappointed in this gate and would not recommend it for anyone. I normally assume that you get what you pay for, so I expected a lot more from this gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gate Made","review":"This is the third gate we have purchased--- And the best at that.

Because, this one has absolutely no flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy so far","review":"I'm very picky when it comes to the design of products (what can I say, I'm an engineer...). So far I'm very happy. I had no problems installing it, needed no extensions (for a bedroom door), and for a pressure unit, it is very secure. On top of that it is hands free - obviously a benefit when both arms are full. Only minor complaint is that the lock pin, which takes all the force when your kid is trying to open the door, is plastic.I'm only giving 4 stars because we haven't had it long enough to see if any of the parts broke that previous posters mentioned (pedal, hinge, lock pin, etc.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate but not enough adjustment","review":"This gate works really well except it doesn't adjust very well. When tightening the top to the right amount the bottom is too tight and there is no way to fix that. We however have just ignored that and do enjoy the gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for toddlers.

My friend bought two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier than top-latch designs","review":"I have twins, and so I'm always carrying either both of them or an armload of stuff. Thus, a top-latch type gate was really out of the question. This gate lets you through hands-free! The pressure mount is a lot stronger than I thought it would be. Because you tighten the gate using a wrench (included) it holds in place. I ordered this when my twins were just beginning to crawl around and get into things, and now at 20 months, it's just as useful. What's great is that even though they've figured out how to open the gate, they aren't heavy enough to make it work! Now if only this applied to other \\"child-proofing\\" stuff...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use. Hard to climb over.","review":"I bought this gate after reading the positive reviews, and I'm very happy with the purchase. The hands-free latch works great. You just step on the pedal, and you can kind of knee the gate open. Although my daughter figured out how it worked, there was no way for her to get enough weight on the foot pedal to unlatch the gate. It turned out, too, that as an infant/toddler/two year old, she was quite an agile and early climber. Nevertheless, she was unable to climb over this gate until she turned 2 and 1/2. By that time, we were only using it for extra safety at night, and felt fine taking it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best money ever spent","review":"My husband and I wanted to get a gate that would last us for a long time. I did some research and we decided the Hands Free gate was the one that seemed to fit our needs the most. We had purchase cheaper gates in the past and they lasted only a short time before they broke. The Hands Free gate is so strong, I don't feel like my baby could pull it down like other gates. It's so easy to use when your hands are full, and it doesn't make marks on our walls. I was concerned about the foot pedal breaking like other reviews mentioned, but I think they are making it stronger because it doesn't seem like it's plastic. It's definetly worth the money for a VERY reliable gate!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best baby gate","review":"I LOVE this gate!!!!! I tried those mesh gates first for our dog. What a pain. You either had to step over them or remove them so you could walk thru. I was always breaking the wooden teeth. When my baby came along, my child care provider turned me on to this gate.

I now give these as gifts at baby showers."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding gate","review":"I bought 6 other gates and none of them fit on my stairwell because I have molding trim around the bottom.

Very convenient, easy to use. Easy to adjust to size of door. Very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gate","review":"I don't write many reviews, but this gate is worth it. We have had this gate for 4 years. Our oldest boy, now 5, only recently has been able to put enough pressure on the step to open the gate. The last few months, he has picked up the habit of swinging on the gate when it is open (though of course he is not allowed), yet it has not moved or been damaged in any way. Now, with child #3, I still don't need to replace the gate.Other reviews cover many of the benefits - the pressure installation, the truly hands-free opening and the general ease of use. One other benefit is the \\"mini ramp\\" on the bar across the bottom. I have never once tripped over the bar in four years, though I have at friends' houses when their gates did not have this feature.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate","review":"I have no complaints about this gate - I love it and am getting another one for another room in our house. Being able to step and knock the gate with your knee when you are holding your baby is really helpful. My husband installed it on a standard door frame. You have to follow the instructions to get it to fit snuggly, but once you have it installed properly, it is solid and won't go anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"barrier gate, NOT a baby gate!","review":"This gate was great for a barrier gate for my school age kids and for a temporay gate for our baby. It would be good for pets.However, when my baby turned 12 months he figured how to take off the foot press, when he applied a little pressure to the gate without the foot press the gate would open. Therefor, he was free to rome the house and we caught him heading head first down the stairs within seconds of pushing this gate open. This gate needs to be remodified! I feel bad that I have to be negative-- this is not our nature! However, our kids come first!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible hHazard when used for stairs","review":"I bought this to be used on my stairways. No problem while going up the stairs, but while coming down it's difficult to push the pedal with baby in hand (or even with hands free) as there is hardly any spacee between the pedal and the stair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it's job, but needs some improvements","review":"We needed a gate to separate the great room from the hallway with all the bedrooms and bathrooms off it to keep my baby and dogs out of there when we weren't watching. This one does an alright job. It doesn't look terrible (like some of the gates I've seen) and it's high enough to keep my large dogs from trying to jump over.The gate is opened by pushing the foot pedal on the bottom. The pedal is a bit unstable and the mechanism that opens the gate is in the rod above the pedal, pushing down allows the nubs on the door to come free. Unfortunately ours make a really loud squeak when you do this, and I can't figure out how to oil the interior mechanism to keep it from doing this. Because of this, we have to leave the gate open while the baby is napping to avoid waking her up with it. I also don't like the bottom brace because it's easy to stub your toe on when you're distracted.Overall it's functional, but the squeak limits its usefulness for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gate","review":"We got a puppy and I needed a gate to keep it in the kitchen. I wanted something that wouldnt be offensive looking but would do the job. This is perfect! It is so simple to use. So effective! Worth every penny it cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extensions are mandatory","review":"Extensions should automatically come with this gate because no one has a doorway small enough for the gate to work by itself. The gate is flimsy if you extend the rods to the full capacity, so basically it doesn't extend to 34\\" without jeopardizing the security of the gate. The gate only extends to 31\\" safely. Overall I returned both gates for the Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate which is better because the extensions were already included in the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important Safety Tip","review":"Yeah, thanks, Egon. The instructions mention quite clearly that this gate is NOT recommended for the top of the stairs. It would have been better for me if I had known this BEFORE I ordered the gate and began to install it, though.

My husband and I have both bumped into it pretty hard and it didn't budge, so when our 10 month old stands at it I'm not worried about him pulling it out of the doorway. We love the fact that it's hands free - step down on the pedal and push open with your knee. Extremely handy when you're carrying your baby.

I am talking about the two protruding plastic things by the step and directly above it where you would place your hand to swing open. When these break off, they are not reparable. I cannot superglue. There is no glue that will glue the very thing that makes this gate close. BAD gate. Also, this gate has the tendency to swing back at you. Kids got hit in the face.

However the gate opening was EXTREMELY narrow! To fit through the gate you would need to be slender and not be carrying anything, especially not an infant car seat. The gate itself also did not fit my stair opening, which is also not a wide space. There is an additional piece that could be purchased for wide spaces, but at this point I no longer wanted to keep the item, so I sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic doesn't hold up","review":"Great idea, but the cheap and easily-broken plastic parts in critical spots (foot pedal which is constantly being stomped on, of course! and hinge) render the product less than ideal. The company replaced the foot pedal twice, but the pieces under the actual pedal broke, and the gate became very difficult to open. Last night, the plastic hinge broke, so I'm off to buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first BUT...","review":"We bought the gate so that our three older children did not have to climb over a gate. They are 9,6 and 3 years old. Our 19 month old was able to master this gate in three weeks by watching everyone else open the gate. He is only 28 pounds but by jumping on the pedal and pushing the door, he is able to open the gate making it usless."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only the foot pedal was more sturdy","review":"We have been through 2 of these gates now. Both lasted about 3 months each. The problem is the foot pedal. After a while it begins to weaken and eventually it completely breaks off into pieces, leaving the gate unusable. Great while it works. Have taken both back and exchanged them. Also you have to readjust occasionally as it does loosen and slip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first. Only lasted 4 months.","review":"Not sure how long the many glowing reviewers for this product actually owned the gate before writing their reviews. We had it 4 months and it no longer works without slamming the gate shut. The mechanism on the bottom of the actual gate itself (which is not adjustable, unlike the top) no longer moves smoothly into the gate, allowing the gate to shut. For pennies more The First Years (manufacturer of the gate) could have made a much more robust design that would have lasted for years. Instead they decided to save a few cents per copy and made a defective product, which I unfortunately spent $50.00 on."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed construction","review":"The product is a great idea, but after a few months of use the foot pedals on the two I bought both broke off.Do not buy this product until this problem is fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"NORA WHEATON,IL","review":"We purchased this baby gate and like it very much. I did have to convince my husband to purchase it at the time. We use it in the doorway to our basement and it has been very handy to use the stepper to open it. Our son is now almost two and has stepped on the stepper himself without opening it. It has been safe to our satisfaction. Definitely worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wears Out Easily","review":"The gate was great at first. Very east to install and operate. After 4 months of use the footpdeal began to bend and eventually broke off, rendering the gate useless. I never bought another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never trip over another gate!","review":"This gate is great! It is extremely easy for any adult to open this gate...Hands Free! That's important. Parents' hands are usually full. Plus, there is no awkward \\"jumping over\\" that has to be done with this gate. Another plus, no hardware is necessary to secure a snug fit. One suggestion I would have would be to measure your doorway before you buy this and realize you need an extention. Most standard doorways are fine, but you never know! One complaint: It isn't made for use on a doorway WITH a door. The gate will still fit firmly and will still work well, but because of the foot pedal, you won't be able to shut the door. Something to consider! I prefer to not use the door with our nursery, so I'd but another one if I had it to do over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"We love this gate. We liked it because it was pressure mounted. The foot pedal lets you open the door both ways. We've have it for 2 months. So Perfect that we wish it was bigger so that we could install it in the other wall, but the extensions that come with it aren't long enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Gate","review":"I used this gate to keep my dogs out of the bedroom but still allow my cats access. It fits securely in the doorway without having to drill holes and has stood up to the beating my dogs have given it. The hands free part is great for when your hands are full and to keep from having to take the gate on and off all the time. I would recommend this gate to anyone looking to secure kids, dogs, etc. in/out of an area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Unsafe for Toddlers!","review":"I purchased this item because it seemed to be the answer to my issue of always having to manually put up and take down my current gate to keep my one year old from going near the stairs. Unfortunately, this item is not safe at all. The \\"lock\\" mechanism is about a quarter of an inch long which means that the slightest touch will allow the gate swing open. If a child were to lean on it or bang on it as they usually do, this gate flies open. Needless to say, I have returned the item to Amazon for a refund. Please consider another option and avoid running the risk of injury to your little one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"baby got stuck","review":"I owned this gate with my 2nd child. It broke after only 4 months. I tried it again with my 3rd child thinking that perhaps it was just a fluke that it broke. However, it is EXTREMEMLY DANGEROUS. My son is 12 months old, and in the past week, he has gotten his knee stuck 5 times! Thankfully, somebody was with me each time, so one adult could pry at the bars of the gate, while the other greased his knee with butter and gently tried to pull it out. Tonight, however, it really hurt his knee/thigh. VERY BAD PRODUCT. THIS GATE HURTS KIDS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Durable","review":"Install gate 4 months ago in a nursery at our church and everyone including myself thought it was nice, easy to use and fit our needs. But after last Sunday I found it laying<br />aside, so I ask what's wrong? The lady said it quit working, and would not unlock. I took it apart to see what failed. I found the unlocking bar broke at the bottom end. I was made of very thin metal. What good is a gate made to last many years on the outside,but won't take daily use for 4 months? Sorry the product was not worth the price I paid for it and I feel it was just another ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"The newer 'arched top' gate does NOT have the roll-over threshold at the bottom.","review":"We have an older version of this gate that we really like. The one without the arch on the top of the gate part.It has a plastic molded ramp-like piece that fits onto the bottom so that things can be rolled through the gate easily. Its great for our daughter that pushes things with wheels around.The newer version of this gate (same Y3600 model number) that has the arched gate does NOT include the ramp-like threshold and simply has a metal strut that goes across the bottom.It isnt roll-friendly. Its being returned and we are going to look for the another one of the older ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop the search... this is the gate!","review":"Before I got pregnant we purchased almost every gate on the market in an effort to try to corral our 3 dogs. Gate after gate failed the tests, and soon we gave up on the idea entirely.When we found out the baby was on the way I was not very hopeful that we would find a gate that would hold up to the 3 dogs and the baby. We purchased the hands free gate with low expectations, but we were extrememly impressed to find that this gate really works!!It's easy to install, use and it's secure!! Our 8 month old can stand on one side, the 3 dogs on the other and no matter how hard any of them try, the gate won't budge. This is the best baby product we've every purchased and we rave about it to anyone who will listen!! We're very impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very secure at 34\\"","review":"I am very happy with this gate and would recommend it. Very secure, and easy to install. Looks good, too.Here is just a little info I would have liked to know beforehand:Our doorway is just under 33.5\\" wide at the bottom, 34\\" at the top, so I purchased 1 extension, thinking the gate would not be very secure without it at the upper end of the 29-34\\" range specified. But with the extension, it's just too wide to fit. Without the extension, it is not wobbly at all, and as secure as you can get without a permenant gate. I wouldn't go past 34\\", though. If the extension fits, I'd use it.Since it's pressure mounted, the top of the gate is an inch away from the latch when it's not installed. When properly installed, it's squeezed together for a perfect fit.The pressure mounting pads are located right at the bottom of the wall. We have a small 1/2\\" wood molding around our kitchen floor, and had to remove a small section of it to have a flat surface for them. Not a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gate I've Ever Found!","review":"Perfect for an autistic child! The gate arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The set up was so easy I didn't even need to look at the directions. You don't need any extra tools, just the small plastic wrench that comes with the gate. Make sure to keep it in a safe place so you can tighten things up every now and then. My son is almost 3 years old and has autism. Every gate we've ever had, he could get out of. Most of the times he ended up breaking them! This gate is perfect, too tall to climb over and too strong to wiggle loose. If anybody could take this gate to its limits, it would be my son. We've had the gate for over two months now, and it's still as strong as the day I set it up. The foot pedal is great too! Hands free entry is a breeze and it's strong enough to keep a 7 year old in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Gate","review":"Affordable durable baby gate. It was easy enough for me to install and keeps my two year old son in were he is supposed to be. The bars are made so he can not climb it. I thought the foot pedal would be a pain because he could figure it out. It is nice when you have your hands full and it is tough enough so that he cant push it down. Great investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best baby gate, really does work hands free","review":"This is the best baby gate I've ever used or seen. It's very sturdy, and fits tightly in the 29\\" entry way to my kitchen. Despite my baby's best effort the gate doesn't budge a millimeter when he pulls on it. The best part though is the foot pedal. It really does work hands free, just step down on the pedal and nudge it open with your knee. You do have to put a lot of weight on the pedal to open it, but this is good, because no matter how much a baby or toddler pushes or jumps on the pedal it won't open for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hands free gate!!!","review":"Easy to install on took maybe 8 minutes. Looks great, sturdy and the locking mechanism is constructed well. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter opened it at 12 months","review":"This is a great gate if you have a child that won't try everything she can to open it. My daughter quickly figured out that if she jumped on the foot pedal a few times, it would open it. Now my daughter is very determined and resourceful. Kids that are more content and calm might be fine with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product at a great price.....","review":"We bought this gate for our daughter's room 3 years ago. It was very easy to install, no extra hardware, no holes or drilling. Fits right into her bedroom door. I like the fact that it swings in both directions and you just use your foot to open it. Great for those times when you have your hands full of laundry. I also like the fact that a child cannot open the gate by standing on the lever because it needs a certain amount of pressure to open. This gate is very sturdy and reliable. The price is good too. Well worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great baby gate","review":"This gate is great. It is very easy to install and once installed it takes the abuse kids give it (pull and push on it, etc). My 4 year old can open it by jumping on the foot pedal (I'm sure that is not recommended)and the gate doesn't budge from the wall. My toddler, however, cannot open it no matter what she tries. I highly recommed this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Works","review":"i brought this gate for my new apartment. I wanted to have a gate that was high enough for my lil puppy to not jump over and was not too hard for me to move freely through the space,and this was the one! I read a few other reviews which made me decide to buy this gate. Although it says its for children if you have a small dog under about 20lbs, this will owrk for u too. I even bumped into it accidently and it stayed pretty much in place.It is lil tricky to put together but once you get in place it was worth a lil confusion!I'm Very Happy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed!","review":"This gate was exactly what we were looking for. Easy assembly & easy operation. It is sturdy, despite not having to screw it into the wall. Definitely not for the stairs, but nice for high traffic areas where parents are constantly passing through. Truly - No hands! Gate opens either way. Also easy to remove and put back up - when it is in the way (holiday parties!) Worth the money - we may even get another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not come as shown in photographs","review":"really like this gate, love the foot pedal, the problem I have is that there are 7 photographs of the gate, 5 of which show a ramp at the bottom bar to prevent tripping. 2, 5, 6, 7, 8. While photos 6,7,8 look like customer provided photos, #2 is definately a manufacture provided photograph. the gate arrived today and it does not have the bottom plastic ramp that my other first years foot pedal gates have. . . Really stinks that they don't say that they have stopped shipping the bottom trip ramp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but did not hold up","review":"We were excited to find a good gate that we could get shipped to us(military family overseas). Thing is, it broke within the first week! The spring inside busted so it would not stay locked. It worked for a while even with the broken spring. After a while tho, our dog and daughter both figured out how to open it. :P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, well constructed, and easy installation...","review":"Utilized as a pet gate on a staircase, it meets our ongoing needs and continues to work without a hitch. Certainly would recommend it without question. Found the overall purchase, with an extension added as a separate item, more cost effective via Amazon instead of the other sellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gate great for dogs too!!","review":"Our escape artist dachshund was able to climb over our previous mesh gate. With the vertical bars on this gate she has no choice but to stay in the laundry room. Gate was easy to setup. The top brackets must be tightened a lot to get the top latch to catch."},{"rating":"2","title":"very secure","review":"was a quick assembly. my doorway has a threshold so i didn't need the included ramp. took about 5 minutes to get it out of the box and in place in the doorway, including reading the instrucions. and then, since this was to keep my dog out of the kitchen and let the cats go where they want, i cut the center bar out with a sabre saw while the gate was in the doorway. of course i voided the warranty and i'm sure the manufacturer doesn't recommend doing that, but the gate didn't move at all while i was cutting. the modification took longer than assembling the gate in the first place and of course if you do this, wear gloves and eye protection. also, i adjusted it as tightly as possible before trying this. when you think you have it adjusted tightly, use the included square headed wrench to tighten it even more. not worth the risk not to"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Gate","review":"I have 38 kids who live on my street. So when it came time to buy a baby gate for my 9 month old, I had a number of professional mom's to consult. This was the only gate that got 5 star rating by it's users. Most of the gates eventually caused damage to the wall b/c the older kids would hang on the gate and rip it out. This gate is very easy to install and use. I did it myself in 5 minutes. And it can be kept open after the baby is in bed, so it is easy for my husband and I to walk around our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice for the price","review":"I really like this gate, and it's one of the more affordable gates out there.It was fairly easy to install (no holes in the wall!), and my husband and I feel that it easy to use.Our only complaint is that the opening is a little narrow when you're carrying a baby on your hip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate to get!!","review":"I purchased this gate at Babies R Us, but read the reviews first from Amazon. I just purchased a toddler bed for my child and the gate is used to keep her in her bedroom at night. The gate was so easy to put together and fits perfectly at the entrance of her bedroom door. To open it, all you do is step on the foot pedal, which is needs weight to open. The only problem I have now, is that my child closes the gate all the time. When it's suppose to stay open. Oh, well!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT","review":"I tried a few different gates before coming across this one. We use this at the top of our stairs that lead directly into a play room, so we needed something that would be incredibly secure & safe. It is a heavy traffic area and we have not had any trouble. The foot release requires enough pressure that if I am sitting and try to open the gate with my hand, I have to use the weight of my upper body to open the gate. I feel incredibly confident that my daughter won't be able to let herself out."},{"rating":"2","title":"flawless gate","review":"This is the best baby product i have purchased since my son was born 13 months ago. I have many wonderful baby items, that i thoroughly enjoy, but this is the first one that has no apparent flaws. It was extremely easy to install, even with two extensions (required for wider doorways/hallways)(no tools needed), is sturdy, looks good, prevents my son from going into unwanted territory, and is comfortable for adults. The bars are conviently spaced (not too far, not too close). I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish We'd Gotten it Sooner","review":"I stalled on buying baby gates because I wasn't sure where I wanted to put them or how many or what kind. After reviewing this gate online we purchased and installed it in the kitchen doorway that leads to the front hall. Like another reviewer's this is a high traffic doorway and we've already put it to a lot of use over one weekend. The narrow-ish opening doesn't seem too restrictive for us and the hands free aspect makes this a real winner. Very easy to use and it relatches itself very easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh well, it was worth a try","review":"The upper hinge broke.

If you have molding, there might not be enough area for the pads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for stairs especially and perhaps all together","review":"I seriously dislike this unit for preventing the baby from going up or down a set of stairs. Going down the stairs with a baby in your arms can be dangerous with the center piece having a floor attached \\"bump component;\\" even despite the curve they have added to not catch your foot (it still does catch at times). It has it's pluses comparing to other units I have seen so far. For one, you do not have to drill the walls to attach it. However, at the top of a stairwell there is no escaping that (having to drill) to have safety, as far as I can see. I am returning this one & going to look for one that attaches to the walls and does not have anything to trip over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"We tried several gates and this is the best!

He's not hurt, thankfully, but clearly the gate isn't very effective. The gate was properly installed and securely closed, but he was able to open it by standing on the foot pedal while holding onto the top of the gate.The gate itself seems well-constructed and is very easy for my husband and I to use; however, because it's also so easy for our baby to use, we'll be replacing it with a different gate tonight.I can't recommend this gate for installation in critical areas of your home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legs can get stuck between the bars","review":"I thought this was the best gate out there until our 22 month old daughter got her leg stuck between the bars. Since they are made of such durable metal, the bars had to be sawed in half to get her leg out because her leg was turning blue. Now I see why the inexpensive wooden ones with plastic are better. I went back and looked at the instruction manual to see if I was somehow misusing the gate and the only thing I could see related to this incident was \\"never leave child unattended\\". The gate was in her bedroom doorway and I was in the next room for 5 minutes when she got her leg stuck. Until this incident, we thought this was the best gate ever and never even had any problems with the plastic pedal breaking. I never even thought about legs getting stuck between the bars when we bought this gate, but before posting this review, I've read all the other reviews and saw 2 or 3 with the same comment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design - 15 month old pulls up foot pedal","review":"Our 15 month old grandson is able to pull up on the foot pedal and remove it, then push the gate open.

We didn't want to put a solid door b/c they get sad when they can't see us so after reading ALL of the reviews and seeing nothing really negative I figured this was my last chance and ordered it. This is by far the BEST purchase I have made for the puppies. Relatively inexpensive and we have not had a single problem with the gate or the puppies since purchasing.

We've got two large dogs and one very mobile 14 month old, and this has kept all three where they're supposed to be. It's easy enough to install that it goes to Grandma's with no problem.Only issue is that after constant use, the spring in the release step seems to be acting up a little and it's a bit harder to open, but this is definitely worth the price. The door is secure when closed, and there's no way a precocious toddler is getting through there. We are very happy with this gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to set up but *don't* try to use on banisters...","review":"DO NOT try to use for stairs with wooden banisters.

I needed two extentions, but even with them it only takes a few mins. to install. It opens just like they claim it does and my three year old can not open it, no matter how hard she tries. My only problem with it is that the foot petal can pinch bare feet if you don't put your foot on it just right. But it only takes a few times of being pinched to remember the right way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, Easy-to-Use Gate","review":"This gate is very easy to setup and has worked very effectively in keeping our home office protected from our one-and-a-half-year-old.

I feel much safer with this gate up than the others. With the tension gates, I would take them down, walk through, and then try to put them back up every time. That was a hassle not to mention I didn't always get tension tight and the gate would fall down. That also caused a lot of wear and tear on my doorway walls. This gate, just push the lever, open and shut, period!

We love the gate as it was easy to install and is very convenient with the gate opening both ways.The only probably we recently found with the gate is that our son gets very upset when we go into the kitchen and he puts his little legs in between the bars. He's gotten his leg stuck in the bars twice already and now has an ugly bruise on the inside and outside of his thigh.Other than that this gate is the absolute best one that we have found!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best gate ever!!!","review":"We are so glad that we bought this gate. We use it in the entrance to our son's room. It keeps him in and our 3 dogs out. Completly hands free is such a plus!!!!!! Simple to use!!! Fits very snug...it isn't going anywhere. The vertical only slats are great because our son tries to climb this gate and I truely believe that if we had bought a traditional gate with vertical and horizontal slats that he would be able to climb it!!! I recommended this to all our friends already!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands Free Gate","review":"We love this gate. It is used at the top of the stairs. I bought the extention also, due to reading customer reviews, but it was not needed. This gate is so easy to use, the best I have ever seen. None of our visitors or houseguests have ever needed help with it, nor an explaination of how it works. Easy. Well worth paying a higher price for a great gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate!","review":"I think this gate works great. I have it installed in the doorway of my daughters room. Because I have two dogs I was worried that the dogs would be in her room when she was sleeping or playing. I love that the gate swings both ways. Sometimes I will have the gate open just enough so it doesn't lock, but on the side where the dogs can't push it open. They would have to somehow pull it towards them to open it and they're not smart enough to do that! This way it's quieter for me to get in and out of her room when she's sleeping. It's wonderful and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep kids in, pets out","review":"We registered for this gate and thankfully received it as a gift just after our son was born. Up until now, it has been installed at his bedroom door to keep the 2 dogs and 2 cats out of his room.He's just beginning to crawl, so we're going to buy one or two more for other parts of the house. It's so easy to open and fits very securely in the doorway. What a difference from those old wooden ones that you had to step over or take completely down to get through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Gate!","review":"This gate is wonderful! We really like the fact that it is pressure mounted not wall mounted - no holes in the wall. We can move it to another doorway. The foot pedal is great as is the wide open swing. Also works great for our dogs. We ended up buying two extensions to fit our doorway. Do not recommend more than 1 or 2 extensions though - it becomes a bit wobbly. A must have item for parents who need a gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate","review":"This is a great gate over all--convenient, sturdy, etc. We use it at the top of the stairs.

It's totally safe for Very very active toddlers. My son started climb & walking @ 9 months. Every other gate we had he could climb & of course got stuck. There is no way for toddlers to climb this gate. Beleive me my son has tried.This is the best gate out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"We have tried so many types of gates and this one is by far the best I have seen. I honestly don't see how any of the other gates are even going to stay on the market. This one is so incredibly easy to install (about 8 minutes, the only tool you need is included in the box).Very simple and practical to use. Once installed, just step on the pedal and nudge the door with your knee. It takes probably half a second to walk through.Excellent product; I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!","review":"We love this gate!! The hands-free aspect is terrific even when your hands aren't full carrying something. It just opens so easily and quickly! And, although the box says it's good until age 24 months or so, we've had 3, 4, and 5 year olds over who aren't able to open it. (The tighter you make the tension, the more pressure is required on the pedal in order to open the gate.)Our doorway was extra wide and required the gate plus 3 extensions. It's still totally stable.We love too that, because it's tension mounted, there will be no holes in our doorframe when we (eventually!) don't need to barricade our children in!It's a terrific gate and we'd highly recommend it. We're just sad that it doesn't work at the top of our stairs (the bar across the bottom would be a potential trip hazard). Otherwise, we would have bought two of these gates!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a complete piece of junk. Where is the quality control?","review":"I have never purchased an item that had as many defects as this gate. I bought two, and didn't even bother opening the second one. Three of the four pressure bolts had severe defects in the threads, making them unusable. The foot lock worked ok, but the top was at least an inch and a half from making contact with the brace.I guess everyone else on here got a good one, but to me this is not even worthy of a single star, which I can't do. I also left my feedback on the manufacturer's homepage. 100% unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars as a gate - 1 star as a stairway gate","review":"Very nice sturdy gate, pressure mounted, easy to install looks and works great. As long as you install it to a flat surface like a doorway or a hallway. I do not recomment it for using as a stair gate. I purchased two of them to install on our stairway however, hands free paddle does not work well on stairways. I would have kept the gate if itwasnt hands free, which initially I though was a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised!!","review":"This gate was advertised as \\"Fits all standard doorways 29\\" to 34\\" wide\\". Our opening is 33 inches and the gate does not fit. I was dissappointed. This is the classic pitfall of buying online. It is so difficult to unpack and then repack to return. Will stick to local retailers in the future. Rather pay a couple dollars more for the convenience than loose the service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit in a larger doorway and can't find extension","review":"I thought the gate looked great and bought it and brought it home and the first thing I discovered is it only fits in an ordinary doorway - anything a little larger and it needs an extension. The First Years web site said that the gate extension kit was available at Babies R us - it was not and not on their web site either - and I couldn't find it on the web anywhere either using all the different search engines. I guess I'll just return it and start over if a call to the First Years doesn't resolve this."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok for doorway with no door...","review":"I wanted to put this on a bedroom doorway, and put it up so it was level (took a little while) but the bedroom door would not close because the foot peddle on this gate was too wide. I was easy to open with foot but I neede the door to shut so I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandmother disappointed in product","review":"I looked at a lot of gates and thought this one looked the best. For one thing I only need it at times when my grandchildren visit from out of state which is not as often as we would like since they are all over 2000 miles away. This one was better than the wooden ones which fall down so easily and are a nuisance to open and close. I liked the idea that it could be installed without a lot of hardware and putting holes in my walls. By appearances it looked like it would do the job of keeping my grandchildren in the parts of the house where we wanted them without the adults having to canstantly keep them out of rooms that are off limits. The theory was great--the reality was different. Within the first day of their visit, my 27 month old grandson not only had figured out how the gate opened but he was also able to open it on his own and thus defeated the whole purpose of the gate. I spent a lot of money on something that didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This gate is really a great product. I love the fact that you don't have to hardware mount the gate (no drilling into the doorways required), and it's still very sturdy. It was incredibly easy to install, and is very safe and secure. My 18 month son knows how the gate opens, but cannot open it because of the weight required to push down on the lever. The only negatives I encountered were:1) The first Hands Free gate I purchased was not painted properly, so I had to return it for another one.2) I had to buy the 5\\" gate extension for the gate to fit in the doorway. So, in the end, there are additional costs if the opening you intend to use the gate for is not that narrow. But all in all, it's totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS GATE!!! BUYING MORE!!!","review":"I have had this gate for 6 months with no problems. I can see how the pedal could break and cause a problem however, This gate works so well in my house, it would be worth a little inconvenience if I had to replace the pedal or return the gate for a replacement. Even with that possibility I still rate it 5 stars!! It is located in the most traveled area of my house and it works beautifully!!! Besides my daughter, I also have 3 dogs that have tried to get through to the other side without causing any damage!!! I contacted First Years about this gate because I WANT MORE!! Only problem is it only goes to 34\\". I need wider for my other openings. I have been informed that they have created and shipped out extensions which will add up to 5\\" per side, to be sold exclusively at Toys R Us. I have contacted our local store and they have received them in stock. On my way to buy 2 more!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Foot pedal breaks and is choke hazard","review":"I love the idea of this gate. It worked great for a few months. But we have had three foot pedals and replacements that have now broken. The gate is made of durable metal but for some reason they chose to make the foot pedal out of flimsy plastic. Not only is this inconvenient to have to keep getting replacement parts IT IS ALSO A CHOKE HAZARD. The supporting plastic breaks off in very small pieces which could easily be swallowed by a small child. If they could just fix the foot pedal issue I would have no problem giving this gate 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the dimensions?","review":"Where did you hide the details: Height, width, etc. How can I determine if this will fit? I would have bought it instantly if I knew it would fit or if I could buy extensions to make it fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"We recieved 2 of these gates as shower gifts. My husband put one up right away so I didn't have to climb over the old one that we use for the pets. So far I love this gate. It is easy enough to open with your foot but I don't think it will be that easy for baby to open for quite some time. The only thing I was not thrilled with is it fits in a narrow opening. If your opening is slightly wider you have to purchase extensions which are an additional 15.00 each. We still love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not well built.","review":"Getting the gate to open and close is dang near impossible without extremely fine tuning the wall \\"brackets.\\" The idea is there, using a foot pedal to open it, but the follow through and build quality is basically crap. I ended up trimming back the little pins that go into the locking mechanism, to allow for easier opening and closing. Even with the modifications, the foot petal was coming off after maybe 50-100 openings. Also, you have to adjust the tension on the wall brackets about once a week or so, to keep it opening and closing properly and without tons of force.I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable and Convenient","review":"Utilized these for our stairs and they work very well. I was surprised how nice they looked once they arrived. Being able to utilize a step to unlatch the gate is very nice to have, seeing as our kid or some other object seems to be in our hands every time we go up and down the stairs.However, we required two extensions on each of the gates we purchased in order to get to the appropriate width for our staircases so I would recommend making sure you measure your stairs before ordering this gate and the necessary extensions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comes with its own giant trip bar!","review":"The bar across the bottom is very tall and creates a terrible trip hazard. We boxed this item up and returned it as we imagined ourselves, baby in hand, falling down the stairs after we tripped over this gate. Really silly design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was flimsy","review":"I have several baby gates so it's not that I didn't install it right. Its just that my daughter could rip this one right out. The others that I had held up when she would do her monkey in a cage routine but this one would rip out. It holds on for a while but still she can tear it down. So I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate!","review":"I'm someone who does a lot of research before making a purchase to ensure quality. After reading many of the reviews, I decided to purchase it. I was skeptical at how stable and secure a 'pressure-mounted' gate would actually be. But, after installing the gate, I found it to be very sturdy. I'm not very handy but the gate was very easy to assemble and install. My baby pushes on it and pulls up to stand and it does not even budge.Although this gate is not very cheap (pricey when you also have to buy the extensions), I would recommend it as it is easy to use, stable, and made of sturdy metal. We've been given compliments from other parents who bought cheaper, wooden gates at how nice it looks and how solid it feels.I'm very satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install and easy to use. Not for the top of the stairs.","review":"This a very good gate, it is easy to install and opening it is really hands-free. It comes with a base, so there is no change of triping over the bottom bar as it happens with some other gates.One important note: it should not be used at the top of the stairs. Although it is sturdy, it is pressure mounted and it is not as safe as hardware mounted ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gate Ever","review":"I have several gates in my house for unusual spaces, stairs, etc.I absolutely love this gate. This is by far the best from all the gates I own. The only downside is the width. It only works for narrow spaces even with the extension, I use mine for doors only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent back...","review":"The gate did not fit into the entrance of our staircase and although the website of the manufacturer claims that there are extensions, none could be found on the site.Even though I could not complete the installation, the product itself did not inspire much confidence that it was going to withstand what we demanded of it, namely keeping our toddler daughter from falling down the stairs.In addition, the pieces used to put together the gate were of poor quality and tolerance. One only wishes that the manufacturers of such products understood that when dealing with safety, short-cuts in quality should never be tolerated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart way too quickly","review":"So we had a little bit of an interesting situation. My husband and I were moving in to my parents' house after they built their house. We were preparing to live in the house about 1 year in advance, which is when I purchased this gate and installed it at my parents' house for when they had my daughter over there. It was barely used for the good part of that year, left open most of the time. Right before we moved in, my daughter ran into the gate (wasn't hurt, thank goodness) but it broke apart. Not only was the outside covered in plastic, the entire hinge was made of plastic! Are you kidding me? That much for a gate and you can't even give me a durable hinge? Sorry, but this was a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Quality Product!","review":"After reading all the rave reviews, I ordered this product. After I opened it, I found that the construction quality was poor and the directions were equally disappointing. Not sure what the others were so excited about. My gate was soldered improperly so that it was so bent that the door could not be closed correctly. I tried my best to bend the metal frame and door but it was just too far off the mark. I am returning the gate today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly","review":"We love this sturdy, easy gate. It works best in a doorway that you want closed off for sure.

We have a 4 month old though and will probably be using it for the same purpose for her. It came mostly assembled already, which was nice.

We bought several gates prior to purchasing these and found them all difficult to get in and out of while holding our child. This gate is tremendous.

We fixed the pedal with duct tape and were able to use the gate for a couple months thereafter. Now, one of the two plastic tabs that secure/lock the gate closed is jammed inside of the gate and the remaining tab is too flimsy to hold. I will return it for a different one as soon as possible!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta have this baby gate!","review":"This is by far the best baby gate on the market. I first saw this gate at a relatives house and after reading Amazon reviews decided to purchase one. They're more pricey thatn others, but well worth it. The rubber grips on the side allow for easy installation without having to drill holes in your doorway. The foot pedal allows for easy, handsfree, movement through the gate. It took me about 6-7 minutes to assemble and install once delivered. I'll be purchasing another one in the near future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not high enough","review":"This seems to be well made but I have a 4 month old toy poodle. Weighs 3.2 pounds.

We encountered one problem: The gate is designed to be mounted flush to the floor, and our doorway has quarter round molding along the floor. So, the bottom pressure pads would not work correctly. Technically one would need to remove or cut the molding. Our solution was to position the gate above the molding with a strip of wood underneath for support. If the bottom pressure pads were located an inch or so off the floor it would be a better design. The gate closes with a gentle push but does not close automatically, which may not suit everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Picture","review":"Afther searching everywhere for Arm & Hammer 36 hour w/baking soda, it was recommeded to me to go to Amazon.

His book dates from the Spanish colonization through the election of Alfonsin.

There is only a little attention paid to the mission systems in the Chaco and other surrounding areas. (for more on the Chaco See The Chaco Mission Frontier by James Saeger). This book does provide an excellent overview of the countries history without going into too much depth. Economics is a major focus of the book as well as the politics of the peronist era. The Falklands conflict is one of the last major pieces covered and is done very well. This is a great book to get a bearing on Argentina's history and then decide where you want to read more.

Because it was much smaller than our old SLR, taking it everywhere was easy. Unfortunately, the photos were never really standouts. It barely beat the performance of a couple throw away cameras we grabbed on trips! I didn't expect professional quality, but the colors were often washed out. Then came the \\"H\\". Apparently a lot of other Canon Sure Shot and Elph owners have discovered this nasty little flashing error. Like the others we've reset and replaced batteries and cleaned the contacts- to no avail.

When it does actually stop blinking, well, then, you get a really nice photo. But try it yourself - it's difficult to get the stupid light to stop blinking.

It's the original definition of \\"Wacky Hijinks.\\" And I don't even care about cars, but I loved ogling the top-notch machines they put together for this baby (and for anyone who knows the story behind the movie's production, the use of the Jaguar gag is priceless).

The open road calls and a great adventure is afoot with some classic charactors who may or may not have anything to do with Hollywood. The cameo appearance of Linda Vaughn at the end of the film is worth the price of admission. Now that I've had the video for so many years, I love to just let it run to fill the room with the great sounds of performance engines while I work on other things - heck, I know the script by heart. I recommend this film to anyone whose looking for a well done, just plain fun movie with no political agenda or moral message to get in the way.

That said, this was a very enjoyable movie, with clever dialogue, memorable villains and unpredictable plot turns. The picture quality suffered a few times due to age, but the colors were fairly vivid. What I found most refreshing having seen a few of the more recent Pierce Brosnin Bond films was the lack of frenetic editing and pounding music during the action/fight scenes.

Sean Connery once again plays James Bond (once again is perfect in the role). Goldfinger is a great villain (played by Gert Frobe). Harold Sakata is good as Oddjob and Honor Blackman does a good job as Galore. This is one of the more popular 007 movies. It really does deserve 5 stars. The special edition DVD has excellent features and the picture and sound, as always, is supreme.(The next in the James Bond movie series is Thunderball)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My All-Time Favorite Bond!","review":"This is my favorite of the Bond franchise. This movie also shows fantastic on dvd. The music was awesome, along with the title song, \\"Goldfinger\\". Sean Connery was so slick, charming, smart, and dashing. He is absolutely my favorite Bond character. No other actor who played Bond could say, \\"My name is Bond, James Bond\\", so esquisitely as Sean Connery.It may be a little corney, but Bond always got his orders, killed the bad guy, got the girl; mission solved in the end. He did this all in the duty of his Country, England.The story is a little bit out there, with Goldfinger wanting to steal from Fort Knox. Good luck with that one in real life, ha, ha. I think the main characters did a fine job acting in this film. There was never a boring moment for me in this picture. I've watched it soooo many times over the years. This Bond movie may not have some of the more high-tech thrills and chills such as some of the other Bond movies, but for that time period, this one is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond , James Bond , and this is the one movie that made him the Coolest","review":"What man doesn't want to be him. And what woman doesn't want to be with him. He is the COOLEST. I've seen every bond film made, more than once. And this one still remains his best. Who doesn't remember Odd Job , and that deadly derby he wore and tossed. Or Goldfinger, who's named perfectly, for his love of gold. And than you have Shirley Eaton in that Black Bikini. Now that's memorable. But the Car steals the movie. The Aston Martin DB5. With it's Ejector Seat , Bullit proof shield , Machine Guns , Tire Slashers, and revolving license plate. Even today, that is the Best movie car of all time. And Sean Connery , the Best Bond. Now with all these bests, how can this not be the Best Bond Film."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"okay so my cousin and I watched this movie and I was amazed at how stupid it was there are one or two good parts but really nothing else the good scenes are the one at the end at fort knox and the begining where he blows up the building althouth it did get a high rating by critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldfinger","review":"I would like to say that \\"Goldfinger\\" is the most overrated James Bond movie ever. It is boring, and it isn't about SPECTRE or about Cold War, as the best movies in the series are. Goldfinger is a common villain, without anything to make him memorable. I even think that his henchman, Oddjob, is better. Also, Pussy Galore is one of the worst Bond girls ever, and she doesn't even have that much screen time. The only bright spot about this movie is the Aston Martin, even though it started the hardware trend that have ruined the series.Personally, I put this one rigth beside \\"Moonraker\\", \\"Diamonds are Forever\\" and the Pierce Brosnan films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldclinker. Disappointing.","review":"I thought it would be fun to see a Bond movie. Mostly, I've only seen parts of movies on the tv when i was a kid. The movie started out pretty well, with modest intrigue and pacing as it presented the Bond gadgets and women. However, the second half really drags and is just one non-sequiter after another. I mean, there's supposed to be a litte suspense and cleverness, right? Of course, the movie is not about plot, but after awhile the bone head script is really annoying. Also, the movie feels dated, the action is slow and cheesy, and it's shot in a very clunky and dull style. Just like the duck on Sean's head in the opening sequence, this one is for the birds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be in American Film Institutes Top 100","review":"Strangely, the James Bond classics did not make it into the top 100. Goldfinger has it all. The John Barry soundtrack, the interesting set designs, the intro graphics, good photography, good script, good acting etc. These films were new and fresh, there was nothing like it before and have influenced a ton of action films since. There's nothing wrong with the Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, The Sound Of Music, and so on. There're all good in their own kind of way. However, some of these films seem really dated and stale and don't hold up very well and they do not generate the level of continued enthusiasm as the classic Bond films. Who knows, maybe next time around AFI will take a second look and give James Bond a few votes. Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, take your pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the top 2 james bond movies of all time","review":"More than likely you've seen this movie but if not here's a brief take. James Bond secret agent for the british empire is on assignment investigating goldfinger. He is and international \\"businessman\\" who simply loves gold. He has stock piled millions of dollars of gold in various countries around the world. He plans to well, without spoiling to much, he plans on attacking fort knox (where the usa supply of gold is kept) to throw off the world enonomy and become even richer and more powerful. Generally acknowledged as one of the best bond movies of all time, you won't be dissapointed! As a side note my pick for best bond movie #2, casino royale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"I have been a Bond fan since I was young. I recently got a blu-ray player for the holidays and was looking to upgrade my movie collection. This was an excellent edition. I love the remastery of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie at the time, but not for modern viewers","review":"I understand this was an awesome movie at the time. New ideas, cutting edge technologies, and great actions created the future of the movie when it was released. Sadly, the time went by so fast, and this movie could not survive the future itself generated. Now, all the attractiveness washed out, Goldfinger only looks a ridiculous and dull movie to me. I would put 5 stars for the historical importance, but can give only two for what I have enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"An epic","review":"Goldfinger is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

Looks like a cheap tape transfer. Can't believe MGM would besmirch their name with this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOND EPIC","review":"GOLDFINGER is the best of the 007 series. This outing is flawless, with Sean in great form. If he was going to bail out on the series, this would have been the time with him ultimately on top. Thankfully, he stuck around 3 more times, or Bond scholars in later years would have had an even more intense debate on their plates. The dialogue and high camp is equal to the gadgets and (for the time) technology. \\"My name is Pussy Galore.\\" BOND: I must be dreaming. And of course the CIA eating at Kentucky Fried Chicken, presumably the original Louisville store. I didn't see The Colonel behind the counter. A timeless classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and sharp picture!","review":"Whoever produces Blu-Ray succeeds again with Goldfinger. I have the DVD and you can really tell the difference between them both. The quality is almost perfect with great sharpness and color plus the great audio too! The movie is widescreen in 1:66:1 format and there are two black bars on each side, but that shouldn't keep you from buying this great movie on Blu-Ray. I would recommend this to anyone who is a James Bond fan who doesn't have the Blu-Ray version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably the Best","review":"Taken in context of when Goldfinger was made, it's understandable why it's so widely considered as the best Bond. The title is classic and well publicized, as well as the name of the lead female role, Pussy Galore. Apparently many fans think Honor Blackman was an unattractive choice, but apart from her somewhat stern voice and people's unrealistic standards, she was a beautiful girl. There's even a nice little tid-bit on her by Sick-Boy in the movie Trainspotting, another excellent film. Sean Connery's performance as Bond was at it's peak and director Guy Hamilton did his best take on Fleming's famous spy. Ranging from Miami to Scotland, Switzerland, and Kentucky, the locations were all well portrayed. The plot is solid, intriguing and was transferred onto the screen with believability. My only major point of criticism is the instantaneous knocking out and waking up of the troops during the climax, but hey, Bond is ficticious and it's a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun and exciting Bond adventure","review":"Goldfinger is the third film in the Bond series and starring Sean Connery. Goldfinger just may be the most exciting Bond adventure. It has its full of heart pounding action and humor. It also has some very good music in it. Sean Connery is excellent in it as 007. Also it has one the very best of the Bond enemies in it Oddjob. He is truly evil, but he is likable evil. He is a great character in this film. If you want Bond it doesn;t get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"RECREATES ORIGINAL THEATRICAL EXPERIENCE","review":"Only the sound quality is not comparable to more modern movies - probably due to master audio limitations. However, the DVD when viewed on a 50 inch projection via S jack - has extraordinary sharpness and color - faithfully recreating the original movie experience - once only available for those fortunate enough to have seen this movie in its original form back almost 35 yrs ago.Let the critics rave about FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE as an art form. Sorry but GOLDFINGER is the essence of James Bond. In fact - GOLDFINGER athough number 3 in the lineup - is the breakaway hit that made the James Bond Series a world wide phenomenon.When Jill Matterson (Shirley Eaton), perched high above the Fontainbleu Hotel swimming pool, - says to Bond \\"and who are you?\\" and Connery replies \\"Bond, James Bond\\" - THAT IS BOND in all its glory.More than a movie - extraordinary entertainment and just plain fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Midas Touch?","review":"While it is a very good movie, it just doesn't strike me as well as Live and Let Die. It's plot was good, but the great US Army battle scene steered away from traditional Bond action. Also, a \\"slow-moving laser\\" with the quote, You have nothing of use to me Mr. Bond, do not go together. It is definatly a top 5 Bond movie, but not 1. It deserves about a 4.4 rating all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pink Panther","review":"If you get \\"The Connery Classics\\" versions they come with a animated episode of \\"The Pink Panther\\".

Actually third in the series, Hamilton's \\"Goldfinger\\" dispensed with the earnest conventions of the spy flick for something cheekier and loads more fun: arch quips, cartoonish enemies, luxury sportwear, and exotic femme fatales. (Still, his most iconic image has to be actress Shirley Eaton--naked, gold-plated,and sprawled lifeless across a bed.) \\"Goldfinger\\" also introduces Bond's tricked-out Aston Martin and his inventive helpmate, Q, played by the wonderful Desmond Llewelyn, while Frobe, Sakata, and \\"Avengers\\" alum Blackman prove to be among the most formidable nemeses in the Bond franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"This third 007 movie gets three AAA's!","review":"\\"Goldfinger\\", made in 1965, was a very action-packed movie, with a funny cast as well as suitable settings. In the beginning of the movie, James Bond is assigned his mission and learns about Auric Goldfinger by playing a \\"social\\" game of golf, but then Bond finds out that Goldfinger has an orginization named Auric Enterprises, Inc., and James Bond goes through dangerous hoops trying to find out about this company.Later, Goldfinger's name is explained as his interest for gold is revealed, and Bond later learns that Goldfinger is targeting the world's economy and planning to rob the world's biggest bank, along with an \\"Operation: Grandslam\\". So, with this wonderful plot revealed, the movie has taken form and gets into the good part, where it proves it's a movie worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Um... Not the Best but still Good","review":"I love James Bond. Especially the old ones but this one I didn't like as much. It just seemed too boring. But the only problem is I hate when all the movie is is stunts and battles. In the beginning they make Goldfinger look like a fat pig! He's barely even scarey. Sure I liked this film but I think it gets rated too high. If you want to see a good one with Connery see Diamonds are Forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympic Gold","review":"Goldfinger is bought to new life with DVD technology.

He just lost control! GRRM has a good imagination, but lacks an \\"inner editor\\".He keeps inventing new subplots and characters, spreading your attention so thin that you essentially stop caring about the story. The story arc is broken.The most laughable thing about GRRM introducing new characters (even minor ones) is when he crams whole background stories in blocks of a few sentences... while quite a few of these minor characters could be omitted altogether. He seems in love with his own imagination, unable to let go. I don't think it's greed... it's incompetence.Oh... and GRRM's recommendation on Robin Hobb's \\"Assassin's Quest\\" books: \\"A diamond in a sea of zircons\\" is spot-on... his own writing is definitely one of the zircons. Read Robin Hobb instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent writing around mediocre material","review":"While the skill displayed in Mr Martin's narrative hasn't diminished, it is the case in all novels that some characters are more interesting than others. A Feast For Crows seems fixed the less interesting of the characters we've seen. While there are high points through the story, it seems overall lackluster beside the other entries in A Song of Fire and Ice, but if you're invested in the series, I doubt that there's any way you could gloss over this title.If you're not yet invested in the series, a really good set of Cliff's Notes might be an option in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feast for Crows","review":"The whole collection is readable and entertaining, although I found some books better than others.

Can't wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Famine for Readers","review":"'A Feast for Crows' has turned out to be a famine for readers who were expecting far more of Martin after his first three books. This one is so boring that I found myself actually skipping passages just to get through it. After waiting so long for an ending to this tale, I was very disappointed. I recommend that everyone skip this one and just hope the next one is better.I don't know what happened to Martin, but he has certainly gone downhill. Or perhaps he collaborated on this book with Robert Jordan, whose books also drag on and on, with no end in sight."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Effort","review":"After criticizing the latest Tad Williams novel, \\"Shadowmarch\\", as being a pale George R. R. Martin imitation, I am now forced to classify \\"A Feast For Crows\\" as...a pale George R. R. Martin imitation.That same lethargic pacing, that same ambivalent suspense level, that same eye-tiring, can-I-put-this-down-now, how-many-pages-do-I-have-left feeling while reading it.Recipe for this book: take the last few books of \\"A Song Of Ice And Fire\\", remove the most interesting characters, and in their place add reams of geneology (of minor persons), pages and pages of useless exposition, and endless paragraphs advancing obscure sub-plots.Hopefully, fan reaction (and the lagging sales figures) will convince Martin to fix the problems. If not, let's hope his editor does, or this once-great series will fail to live up to the promise of its outstanding first three volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"GRRM has lost a reader","review":"After reading other reviews I am confused as to why many gave 5 out of 5 stars, then go on to voice complaints and list several limitations of the novel. If you didn't like sections of the novel, why give it 5 stars!Perhaps my expectations were too high, like many I waited eagerly, checking GRRM's website at least a few times a month, until Nov 8th and the release of Feast. The misgivings of the novel I found summed up quite nicely by Ross Blackman's review, so I will not repeat them.Can the series be salvaged by upcoming books in the series? I could not care less. I don't care when Dragons is released, I'm not going to hold my breath nor pay $28.00 for it. Maybe in 10 years I will see it in a bargain book bin at a used bookstore and pick it up, because somewhere in the back of my mind the title and author sound vaguely familiar."},{"rating":"1","title":"non delivery of the book","review":"the book wasa sapose to be deliverd on the 16.12.2011 and didn't come until today so the rate is very bad if there is any rate at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book","review":"This is another great book in the ASOIAF series. I am reading it again for the 2nd time and I like it much more this time around than the first. Of course we all want to read about our favorite POV characters (Tyrion, Jon Snow, Dany, etc.) but this book is still very interesting and fun. Not as exciting as the other books but still very solid. Samwell's story is very interesting and so is the Iron Born story. The parts at King's Landing are a bit dry but they end wonderful. I just hope GRRM finishes the next book soon. It's killing me and a lot of other people too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Person below me nailed it","review":"That's about all I have to say.

It totally IGNORES the main characters that were set and introduced in the first 3 books. The queen targaryn in the south, Bran, Rickon, John Snow, Tyrion, and so many more. Where are their points of view that solidified the first 3 books in the first place?How do you go from forming a emotional attachment between the reader and the characters the author introduces as main characters and totally, TOTALLY devoids this fourth book of their presences after 4 years of waiting? Seriously is this author hemorraging from some kind of brain disfunction?I'm at exactly 1/2 way through the book now and I'm so disgusted with it that I will most likely not finish it. I seriously wish I could get a refund for this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more","review":"Let me start by saying I have not read this book, and I will not read it. I have read the previous three books and I refuse to keep spending money, time and patience on authors that seem to value money and ego more than providing their readers with good books. Milking the cow for all it is worth and writing sagas ad infinitum is for me, just too much. Mr. Martin can count me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feast for lazy plotting","review":"I can only imagine how disappointing this book must have been for the people waiting since 2000 for it. No plot line of any interest is advanced in this book. The fact it took seven extra years for DwD puts a lie to Martin's explaination about having too much to write. Clearly he has lost interest in his creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't feel like I've only read half a book","review":"So after killing off half the characters, Martin decides that really the best way to divvy up his monster series is to provide us with a story with only the remaining characters we don't like?Ok don't get me wrong, Jaime has alot of development, Cersei is certainly interesting reading and Brienne is A-OK.But quite frankly I suspect Martin realised that fourth books in epic fantasy series are always terribly bland and because he is a compelling accomplished author, he needed to do something drastic to not buck the trend.The most frustrating thing is that his lack of attention to the more interesting characters in the series is explained at the end, not sure whether its an apology or a stout F U"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, verbose and difficult to follow","review":"My title says it all. With 1000+ reviews I won't say anything that hasn't already been said in much greater detail. I simply want to add my vote for the record and to balance out the astounding 5 star reviews (those have to be from friends,relatives and publishers). This fourth book is a major disappointment if you were expecting a continuation of the plot lines from the first three books. Instead, it lays the groundwork for new characters in what appears to be a never-ending series and speads waaaay too much time on Cersei."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feast of Crows","review":"The first three books in this series really drew you into the characters. You had your favorites and you rooted for them. Then in the fourth book, A Feast for Crows, most of them disappear and there is no closing. Arya's ending in this book is ridiculous. It's like the author wanted to get rid of 80% of our favorites and bring in characters that we have no interest in and I have to admit I lost track of the outrageous plots. It was very hard to get through this book and I truly have no desire to go on to read the 5th one."},{"rating":"1","title":"At this rate, he or I will likely be dead before the series is done","review":"Many of us have been waiting for years (going on six now) for book five in this series which will now be at least seven books long. Let's see, do the math, at six year intervals it will be 2023 before we see an end in sight. That's providing that he really does have book five finished by the end of the year (2011). I don't know about anyone else, but I'm done. He or I will likely be dead before he finishes. Time to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overkill and boring","review":"Wow was this a let down. A bunch of Story lines with dead ends. Names and places that mean nothing and have no relevance. Martin killed everyone off in the last book and struggles to make the story continue with any depth. He covers it with so many names and places it doesn't make any sense and kills trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it all end?","review":"I just have to get this off my chest: this book is tedious. Yes, I'm among the legions who read the first three Fire and Ice books and kept checking Martin's website for news of the fourth. Like many, I preordered. Before I had a chance to start reading, I saw the bad reviews start pouring out, so I delayed reading A Feast for Crows, fearing Robert Jordan syndrome. When I finally started reading, my worst fears were realized, and I've felt pure disappointment. As many others have said here, too many characters, too little plot advancement.Every night I read one chapter, hoping that something will happen. Every night I count the pages till the end, and it seems interminable. You can see Martin's world expanding but with no purpose. Martin seems to be writing for himself, fogetting his readers. All that talent wasted on noodling his navel. Time to find the next series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a Disappointment","review":"I hate to say it - since I loved the first three books - but it really isn't worth the trouble... To me, it read like a history textbook. There were more pages dedicated to the names, lineages, and the shield crests of characters that are ancillary to the tale than actual \\"goings on\\" or action in the story. Quite a disappointment, especially after a delay of well over a year in the publishing of the book.Frankly, I was waiting for Nynaeve to start the braid pulling..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAHHHH....THE AUDIO BOOK SUCKS...WAHHHH","review":"For all the cry babies who are griping about the 'BOOK' in audio form, grow up.It's disgustingly sad that you need to have a work of such depth and style read to you like some pre-school child.

The result is a facinating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking a page from Jordan?","review":"I have been a big fan of Martins but I fear after reading FOC he may be going down the road of Robert Jordan(hook you and string you along for the next ten years) I rushed out and bought the book immediatley but with the next book I will patiently wait for the library to have it available so I do not waste my money on a monotony of story lines. Mr. Martin can we expect another eight books in this series?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Passing Wind","review":"A lot of build up and fluff. You can speak that this is only 1/2 the book that Martin wanted to publish but with such a time gap between books and no substantial story line, all the characters and individual story lines are vanishing from my memory. To me, this book was a waste of both my money and time. I wish I could have skipped this book and since I probably will not lose any important story line information since I am starting to forget it anyway. I will state that the first three books were amazing and I am hoping the next book redeems my faith for what Martin has done in his first three books. My recommendation, skip this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hundred Rabbit Trails","review":"This book is the first in the series in which I feel like there is no coherent plot or story line. I'm not sure who are the protagonists or the antagonists. I've almost forgotten why I enjoyed the story line in the previous books so much in the first place. I found myself at the end of this book not just skimming paragraphs but skipping them entirely because of the tedium. After reading this we are now faced with choices. Do we continue to drudge on hoping that the story can be revitalized to its previous greatness? Or do we decide this is a waste of our time as there are a lot of good stories out there to read and we only have a finite time on this earth to read them? As for my part, I have invested to much time already to just give up. If A Dance With Dragons is not a vast improvement then I'll be leaving this series unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not add one bit to the story","review":"Let me begin with the disclaimer that both me & my wife thoroughly enjoyed reading the first three books. We were really looking forward to an enjoyable & exhilarating book 4. But alas - what a disappointment !!!Martin seems to have to written this book for only one apparent reason - revenue; he deliberately skirts progressing the real story, instead focusing on side-stories & lesser characters. Tyrion & Daenerys are NOT EVEN mentioned. Arya, Sansa, Catelyn, Jon's stories hardly develop with non-nonsensical side plots engulfing them.The author even blatantly admits avoiding the real story in the end with the excuse that \\"he did not to avoid the story of the other lesser important people\\".As a reader though, it left us frustrated - reading the book for over a month it felt a tremendous waste of time.We are in two minds to pick up book 5.In sum our advise - skip this book completely; you will not have missed the main story a bit...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first book was great, the second ok, and the third was terrible.","review":"Some think the book is about character development, which shows the depth of Martin's writing.

What happened ???","review":"I was SO EXCITED for the release of this book after reading the others. I was listening to it on audio-book and 1/2 way through I phoned my partner-in-audio-book-reading who was just finishing the 1/2 half...and I asked -- is there ANY story line in this book? His answer was \\"no\\". I didn't bother with the second half of the book. Apparently the author adds a bit at the end explaining that it is really is just a way to introduce people...but it doesn't really tell us much about them. I'm skipping this one and will pick up the new charaters in the next book...don't feel like I'm missing anything here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real low mark in an otherwise marvellous serie.","review":"I'm sorry to say it but this book was a chore to go through. Only one or two chapters (like where Brienne fights Biter) were exiting.In the end of the book the author explains that instead of splitting one book into two parts, he decided to make two separate books which in short resulted in putting all the booring characters into this book. Big mistake I'd say.As in all his books the writing is excellent but here you rarely got that nice urge of wanting to read the next page.Anyways... The other books in this serie are absolutely marvellous and likely the remaining books will be as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooooo disappointed!","review":"I found the first three books utterly engrossing and devoured them in record time, loving every storyline and the author's writing style, despite the fact that some of my favorite characters were horribly slaughtered. I could not wait for A Feast for Crows and had almost given up hope that it would ever be released. Now, after years of anticipation, I'm slogging through it, searching for a story. Yes, the attention to detail is glorious, but for me, meaningless. I want attention paid to the characters and storylines that matter; instead, I'm overwhelmed with names, places, histories, mythologies, geneologies . . . . . . I find myself skipping entire chapters just to get to something interesting. It would never have occurred to me to skip a single word of the previous three books. I can only hope the next book will be better. Regardless of what I think of A Feast for Crows, I intend to see the series through because the initial story was so incredibly compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song of Ice and Fire jumps the shark","review":"The Song of Ice and Fire started out with a bang, giving me hopes that a modern author might equal the likes of Tolkien. But AFFC turned out to be a total let-down, sinking the series from potential classic to a never-ending marathon that you wish had never begun.As the series title would imply, the story is supposed to be about ice (short for the evil creatures raising havoc in the north) and fire (the dragons), but neither dragons nor northern evil spirits get any real attention in the book. It seems GRRM has lost interest in actually telling a story, preferring to introduce a never-ending stream of characters, who criss-cross the same lands without any apparent purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long book about nothing......","review":"I loved the first three books. This book reminds me of Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\", if you read it. It started out great and then just took a detour. Book focuses on too many characters and much plotting by them. I think this book lost focus all together compared to the previous three books. I have a feeling that if I skip this book altogether and read the next one I wouldn't miss much. Granted the next book is in line with the first three.Author gives very good description of places and characters travel but nothing happens. Some minor character got killed here and there, another character took its place and that is about it.Very disappointing, but still gave it two starts because the first three books were GREAT and hoping the next book will be like the first three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second half is just boring","review":"Books becomes increasing boring with each chapter. Sexual content (lesbian, 13 year old girls) is increasingly added for no apparent reason.

All of them started with promising groundbreaking epic fantasy stories in the nineties (Eye of the World: 1990, Wizards First Rule: 1994, Game of Thrones: 1996). And unfortunately all started to lose control of their story circa book four of their series. And guess what? The complaints were always the same: MOVE THE PLOTLINE ALREADY!Length can be forgiven as long as there is meaningful plot development. It's about the story; not the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"One point off for publishing...","review":"I understand the dilemma. The book is just too big to publish in a single volume. Hooray! More of the Seven Kingdoms to enjoy! That's a dilemma I can appreciate. However, I'm not sure I approve of the way the division was done. How much ground are we going to be rehashing in the next volume by going back in time to cover events being experienced by the characters not seen in this book?That aside, I have to say how much I love this series. I have been waiting with bated breath for this book for years, and my only disappointment, as I have mentioned, is with the editing decision to remove several characters until the next book. Several of my favorite characters, I might add. For the past week, I have lived in the Seven Kingdoms. When I was not actively reading, I was wishing I was reading. When I was reading, I was scolding myself to read slower, and make it last. I need more!MR.

The introduction of new characters and plot elements that will be important in the rest of the series has slowed the action and the story does not move forward as it did before. The author is in the middle game. The ease of the opening, where the moves are predetermined, is gone. The swift pace of the endgame is yet to come. With that in mind, it is possible to sit back and enjoy the new characters and situations without jumping up and down, yelling \\"What happened to TYRION.\\" Possible but not easy.In addition, the decision to devide Volume Four into two parts means that we are only seeing part of the story. While it does come from a publishing decision and not the author's decision, it is the main reason I am happy giving the book only four stars. I expect that the other half-volume will be transitional also and some will be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The power behind the throne.","review":"I discovered this series about 3 months ago.

It just drags on with minor characters, side stories that don't really contribute, etc, etc. I see many other reviews that also agree. Where the heck were the editors? This smells of greed. Instead of editing this down to a tighter, more interesting read, I believe the publisher let George run wild and by his own admission break this into two books (twice the profit!).I'll still give the next one a try since I'm invested, but if it's just as boring I'm done with the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all downhill after 'Storm of Swords'","review":"After all the epic, back-stabbery of the previous volume, 'Feast for Crows' takes a while to get going as the initial chapters start off from the perspective of new characters and locales but once this one picks up steam it offers everything that one would expect from this series - particularly the final fifth of the book. And yes, while most of the complaints of this volume are valid I found the extra attention to detail and minutiae a somewhat nice change of pace and appreciated the added layers of world building that fleshes out this world in ways that appeal to the most OCD of lore-hounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first 3","review":"This book is every bit as good as the first 3.

I am probably not going to spend any further money or time on this series. The writing is interesting and superb writing, however, it has broken clear from any sort of plot and characters that were built up in the last three books. I am now of the mind frame of who cares what happens next.

I'm pretty sure he explicitly singled out all the boring/obnoxious characters to write about (Brienne, Cersei, Sansa, the mother-whatshername.. etc)The whole book could be summarized in A SENTENCE.I've come to the conclusion that Martin's been replaced by an impostor. There is no other way to explain how such a good series could collapse so fast. Or he could have taken lessons from Robert Jordan called \\"How To Ruin A Wonderful Series!\\"Anyways, I had to write something just to bring the rating down. THERE IS NO WAY THIS IS A 4 STAR BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long walk for a small drink","review":"I began to realize that the problem with Martin's capacity to kill off characters on a whim (which is starting and cool at the time) tends to kill all the momentum that he creates to that point in time.This book felt like one of Robert Jordon's books between 6-9. Nothing happened and you know that it will be forever till you see the next real book. I know that he split the book but my understanding is that he will focus on the other characters. So all that means is that we can expect very little progress in their lives as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"After 4,000 pages and 14 years, this is where we are? Really? The book was too big so we've split it into two parallel books? Again, really?The first three books were outstanding. Time to start getting some resolution here. Get on with it or pull the plug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer desperately in need of editor and strong handed agent.","review":"Perhaps it was inevitable (but certainly not necessary) that Martin would hit a creative wall. Following the rather spectacular third installment, Feast for Crows is an example of a writer treading water, producing mounds of details that really go nowhere. Sure, for the detail obsessed, knowing the biblical equivilants of what king \\"beget\\" whom (and correspondingly, who chopped off whose head) will be enormously satisfying - I am sure those are the same ones who feel a need (no, responsibility) to learn Klingon before they can truly understand Star Trek... Or maybe, they can be that much more \\"correct\\" at the next Renaissance fair).The sense of inertia in this latest installment is Martin fairly screaming his need for a strong handed agent or editor. Stop dithering and get on with it Man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something beautiful gone horribly wrong","review":"The first three books in the series were absolutely wonderful. This one was awful. Way too much information! Our small, compact world is blown completely open. Martin definitely did not bother to edit this one. And it shows. Oh, does it show. I thought the first three books were incredible. This one is a piece of junk. Don't read it! You'll not only be saving yourself time, you'll save yourself the potential agony of seeing a series you loved utterly ruined."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do books like this get published?","review":"I love this story and the characters in it but it has become so complex that I can't keep track of all of the peripheral characters. Especially when they are referred to by their first name or their last name or their title or their nickname, all in one paragraph.With such long lag times between books it is impossible to remember all of the minutiae that Martin packs into his stories. He should give his readers a break and let the editors do their jobs. Wait for the next one to come out before you read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough going","review":"Many of the characters in Martin's saga face fearsome odds as they slog around Westeros and elsewhere, through snow, rain and blistering heat. I felt their pain -- often this monsterously long book felt like a slow march to an uncertain destination.A few faithful characters keep parts of the tale alive - Brienne, Arya - but I found myself skipping whole pages filled with names, lineage, obtuse history, or back stories of back stories. But most of all, I missed Tyrion.Too bad, the first few books are very, very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reader of the Audio Book Takes Away from a Good Story","review":"The story is good, I understanding breaking this apart from \\"A Dance With Dragons\\". Content is pretty much up to par with the first three books.But I've listened to these all on audiobooks, and the reader of this one simply isn't cut out for the job. The first three books were very professionally read by a reader that sounded like he slipped right out of the story. I keep expecting the reader of this one to break into \\"Bueller?....Bueller?....Bueller?\\"Very monotone, no expression. It's sad how much this can distract from a good book. Crossing my fingers in hopes that a different reader was brought on board for \\"ADWD\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"meandering...a tough one to get through","review":"A disappointing book...after LOVING the first 3 books, it now officially feels like Martin is milking a cash cow. Nevertheless, highlights for me were the Jaime and Brienne's chapters. The rest...slow...meandering...Debating whether or not I want to continue on to the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I really enjoyed the first three books but was SO disappointed with this one. Talk about going nowhere with a lot of words. I probably enjoyed 1 in 10 to 20 chapters. The rest just felt like fluff...no substance to speak of and I can't even say that (most of it) is setting the stage for things to come in any obvious way. Most of it was a huge struggle for me to even get through because it was so unbelievably boring, especially following Storm of Swords, which was probably my favorite of the series so far.On the positive side, I did learn a lot more about the characters, despite the stagnant plot development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Going","review":"You are invested in the series. You need to read this book because things are developing, and you don't want to miss out. This book will barely hold your attention, yet you will slog on, so that went the next book comes out you can read it. I read the previous three books in a week. This is the shortest of the series and it took a month. Looking forward to the next just so it can talk about characters I actually care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzz","review":"Sooooo disappointed. I loved the first three books and kept waiting for this one to capture my interest. Sounds like the newest addition just adds to the overwritten, told-not-shown, barely-edited spiral this awesome series has devolved into. 'Tis a pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"The first two books of these series were amazingly good. The third was good, but dragged a bit. This was so bloated and useless. The characters you care about from the beginning of the series are not written about. New characters that are boring and do not do anything for the plot are introduced. (Who cares about the Ironmen?!). I thought this was going to wrap up the series, but it just was filler used as an excuse to write more books and make more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been condensed to 200 pages","review":"... and actually, it probably could have been condensed to 100 pages. The very few interesting sections (i.e. the bits about Arya) were precisely very few. Most of the book was Cersei and Jaime and Brienne. Cersei is approximately Lady Macbeth and nothing really needed to be said, except that she's neurotic and evil. Finally by the end of the book she got locked up. Jaime is really kind of tedious. Brienne... I'm sympathetic to her, but she sort of wandered around a lot, and accomplished exactly nothing, except that she got a little bit eaten. Why did we have to spend so much time on her.I'd excerpt, pretty much, just the last couple chapters of Cersei, the stuff about Dorne, and the Arya stuff, oh and the Kings moot - and skip the rest of the the book. I skimmed the vast majority of it. SO boring. At least the book before, and the book after, were enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowly Going Nowhere","review":"Ok the overly wrought descriptions of everything make this book drag on and on and...well you get it. I eagerly devoured the first three books and was so excited to get A Feast, but man is it disappointing. I find myself skimming through much of the Iron Island plot and sadly miss hearing more about Tyrion and Dany. I understand Martin is trying to weave a rich tapestry of the different kingdoms and is gradually introducing us to all of the houses and their individual trials and tribulations but this book is often times boring and tedious. The journey or quest of these characters is tiresome and while the formula worked well for the last three books (partly I think, because the characters were likable and at times deplorable and Martin would hit you with three or four plot twists at a time) these characters and these journeys are annoying. I can understand conceptually why he explains everything in such detail but it is starting to read like a text book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on point","review":"Tell a story...don't force readers to trudge through your spewings. Get an editor and LISTEN to him/her!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To be continued...","review":"Well, I finally finished reading the book today. I had a hard time following it at first but that was because I don't like new story lines added to an already moving plot. On the other hand in the overall picture I believe it's only going to make the story better. I did miss hearing from all of the characters in this book but beggars can't be choosers half a book is better then no book. In typical George Martin fashion anything and anyone is fair game. Overall this is a very good book and I can't wait till the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feast for Crows leaves crumbs for the reader","review":"The Song of Ice and Fire has turned to glacial ice and a fizzle.I could not stop reading the first three books, but this turned into slow moving minor characters fully centered on side events and blundering, I mean political manuevering. While it is good that GRRM has worked on fully developing his fantasy, does he really have to tell us every stupefying detail? I know many like neverending soap operas and will like what has turned into a soap opera fantasy, but GRRM has almost lost the rest of us. The characters in the earlier books that died were heartbreaking (or satisfying if they were villians), but in this book, I was wishing for their demise and disappointed that GRRM did not kill off enough of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"deeply saddened","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews before I invested time and money. I was so dissappointed. I generally speed read over the fluff so when I finished this book in three days I was deeply saddened to have not gotten any news of some of my favorite characters. I have read the reviews on Dances with Dragons and it looks like more of the same. I wont be making the same mistake twice. It will be difficult to leave in the middle, leave so many questions about my favorite characters but from the review of book five even if I read it, I will not get any satisfaction. So I will just patiently wait for book six read those reviews and judge whether it is worth getting back into the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"moves too slow","review":"Those people that gave it a three were being kind in memory of the first three books. Do not expect anything as good as the first three books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This one just seemed to go on and on and on without anything really happening. Books one and two in the series were really good reads though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha???","review":"After reading the first 3000 pages in the series non-stop, and loving every word, it was like suddenly hitting a brick wall. Brienne, Cersei, ok ... but where is Jon, Arya, Cat? At page 400 or so I peeked at the end of the book and saw a little note from the author that explained things - my favorite characters would be in the NEXT book! Ok, well, I'm ok with that and back on track and have ordered book five from Amazon UK, because I don't want to wait another 6 to 8 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this is from Martin","review":"I greatly enjoy the first few books in the series and was greatly surprised when I read this one. It seems Martin was too daring and bold with his killing off of main characters in the previous books in the series. Now what we are left with are mostly uninteresting characters and some of the characters that we have come to love have changed enough that they seem like a different person altogether. Killing off interesting main characters is not the problem it's when an author chooses to clean house and gets rid of MOST of the characters that actually made the stories so great is really the problem. We could loss one or two good characters but Martin killed so many of them. This book really does feel like a different book entirely from the series. I'm hoping the next book will introduce some new and more interesting characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Addendum for book 3?","review":"George R. R. Martin is one of the best authors of fiction at this time. However book 4 entirely lacks the pacing and reason for being found in books 1 thru 3. This volume does not cohere. It is a discursion that is not that interesting and does not further the grand plot. I also feel disappointed at the wait involved, as I discovered I had forgotten some of the previous material. I hope book 5 gets back on track, and resumes the blistering pace of the first three books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I looked at this series for years before I purchased my first book. I thought it would be more fantasy, but not true. I recommend the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzz","review":"Holy smokes, was this book boring. In this non-page-turner, Martin seems more interested in indulging his fetish for turning a phrase -- phrase after phrase after phrase -- than in advancing the various plot-lines. This was already a little bit true in #3 but it's especially true here. I finished the tome mainly as a matter of principle. But I've now officially soured on attempting #5 and am sorely tempted to let HBO filter any subsequent volumes for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feast for Crows","review":"More characters introduced. Little follow-up on The Wall or other \\"left hanging\\" situaions like the two younger sons (Wolf) or the animals themselves. It's time to start wrapping it up, and putting all the pieces together for me! Insofar as Kindle goes -- it is difficult to go back to the pages which list characters and relationships and then return to your reading page. I am holding off on reading book 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A Feast for Crows comes nowhere near its predecessors. The plot is at best thin, and the novel becomes a travelogue for Martin's more uninteresting characters as they journey from point A to B. Where is that sharp, tight novel with characters to care about and a plot that surprises? If you do not expect too much from this book, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"I am such a huge fan of the series and plowed through the first 3 books. I couldn't put them down. After the long patient wait for Feast For Crows I find myself very disappointed. It doesn't even come close to the excitment the previous books put you through. But, Alas, it is a must read regardless (if your a fan of the series). Just drink LOTS of coffee, finish it & pray the next book is back on track & is released a little sooner than 5 years! 5 years???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make It Fly!","review":"My brother-in-law introduced this series to me 2 years ago. I picked up A Game of Thrones and didn't emerge until I finished Storm of Swords. I loved it! I couldn't imagine how all you day one, die hard fans of Martin had managed to wait so long for the next installment. My own anticipation was keen to say the least. But, oh boy!...I threw A Feast for Crows down at one point and told my husband (and his brother) that I was done with Martin. If I had to read one more chapter on Cersei I would gag! There wasn't enough \\"good\\" character chapters to balance her out. She is not even excitingly evil. She is just despicable mixed with foolish. Why can't Martin throw her out the moon door, too? MAKE HER FLY! I would be glad to shove. Heck, maybe even throw this book out with her. Okay, in all seriousness, I did finished the book. It was tough but I feel it was for the greater good. It had a few merits. Here's hoping for a better 5! I haven't lost faith completely..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they change the narrator?","review":"I share the concern of many of the reviewers who wonder if Martin will take twelve years to tie up all the loose threads he's woven into this amazing series, but even so this book still delivers a wonderful story with compelling characters and adroit writing.However, why on earth did they switch narrators? Roy Dotrice was an amazing reader. In fact, much of my enjoyment of the first three books was due to his narration, which made even Martin's obsession with long and detailed accounts of what everyone is wearing worth listening too, and the voices of each of the characters brought the dialogue and even the folk songs to a whole new level of brillance. It was jarring and disappointing to have a different narrator, even if that narrator was a good, which unfortunately he is not.One of the biggest disappointments in my audio book listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After reading the first three books in a non stop fashion I found this fourth book boring and I was not excited to pick it up and read it at the end of the day. The characters and plot lines were dull. However as it is the fourth book in the series I guess I have to plod through it. I hope the fifth installment, if it ever gets released, is back to the excitement and the interesting plot lines of the first three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious at best - avoid","review":"This was really terrible, no one you are interested in is in it. Wait till the next book is out and just skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Rich Story","review":"I wasnt sure about this series in the first couple of books, however now the story has me captive. I would give it 5 stars but as with all previous books in this series I find the \\"gazillion\\" characters a bit overwhelming at times. Also there are some chapters that I think, \\"really, we had to write about that?\\"Otherwise, the story flows beautifully. I took it on a week long vacation and couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I'm done with this series","review":"I could not put down A Game of Thrones the first time I picked it up. And this was well before there was a television series on HBO. I thought it was one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. I liked the second book as well, but not as much. And I didn't care for all the supernatural elements that emerged so heavily in the third book, but I kept going. I'm almost finished with this, the fourth book in the series, and I give up. I find myself so bored by this book that I don't care if I finish it. It just doesn't hold my attention. Maybe too many Starks and other characters I like were killed off. Maybe too many of the relationships between characters that I enjoy were severed. Maybe there are just too many characters that I don't care about or like reading from their point of view being introduced, or too many characters period. I'm not exactly sure what the problem is, I just know that it does not make for good reading anymore and I give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment x ten","review":"I could not put down the first three books. They were amazing.Feast of Crows was a huge disappointment. I HATED it. Did someone else write it?Does my Mr. Martin have a brain tumor?And surprise, surprise, Dance of Dragons is also a bomb!In both books, the author brings in dozens of characters that mean nothing, do nothing to advance the storyand then they vanish. All at the expense of the characters we've come to know and care about.What a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Plot Thickens...","review":"I can't believe I waited years for this book, then didn't open it right away because of the negative reviews. This is a most excellent book. Sure, I wonder what Tyrion and and Jon are up to, but we'll find out soon enough, next year hopefully. In 2020 when the last book is published, we'll be able to objectively look back and judge whether George delivered on the promise of the incredible story arc we all imagine. Honestly, George is doing an excellent job with this series, we should thank the seven gods that he continues to amaze and entertain us. To the complaining knuckleheads out there, save up a few coppers and buy a clue, will ya?Ken Coffman is the author of Steel Waters and five other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, but expected more.","review":"Definitely not the best of the series but enjoyed it. I still prefer books 1 & 3. I just wish I could read the maps for this series in the Kindle versions, the printing is just way too small and I don't think there is any way to increase their size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series :)","review":"If I had read this when it first came out I probably would have given it 4 stars because so many people were missing out of this book and I wanted so badly to learn about what happened to Tyrion but since the next book is out it is easier for me to let that slide.George R.R. Martin has a way with words and keeping you hooked not just with a cliffhanger at the end but in the start, middle and end of his books that make you want to keep reading. I found myself thinking that there is a lot of setup but nothing really, really interesting going on then I read the next page and am like WTF!? I was planning on putting the next book off for a little while to wait closer to the next book but I am off to buy it now because I just have to know what happens to Arya, hopefully she is in the next one!Amazing series from an amazing writer if for some reason you are reading this and have not started the series yet you really should asap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It (Enough)","review":"I see what he's doing here. I just wrapped up this book. It's not the fastest in the series, but it's pretty necessary for the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly disappointed","review":"The first three books in this series were top notch and I pre-ordered Feast for Crows with high anticipation. Martin really disappoints his fans in this one. While he has said that this book was necessary to prevent a huge novel from emerging, the majority of the book I found boring in the extreme and found myself skimming forward to my favorite characters chapters. The Arya chapters are the only ones that I found kept me enraptured like I was throughout the first three novels. I have been diappointed in other long series before. Robert Jordan's encyclopedic series is an excellent example of a really good story that the author murders by trying to extend the story to generate more books (and $) at the cost of the reader (I will never read Jordan again). I really hope that Martin does not follow the same road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio version","review":"I have not finished the book so I don't want to give an opinion about the book itself, but I have listened to the first two CDs. The reader used for this book is more disgraceful than the most ridiculous impression of William Shattner. The way he reads mocks every word of the story, with non-sensicle pacing and changes in intensity that make it difficult to keep up with the volume control. The first three books had a reader that was the best I've ever heard, this one is simply the worst. Please Random House and George Martin bring back Roy Dotrice.I had trouble listening to this in the car because he goes from whispers to shouts, I could not find a volume setting where I could hear all the words and my ears weren't bleeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Robert Jordan?","review":"The other reviews, covering how painfully slow this book is, are spot on. All that I can think of are Robert Jordan's tedious books four, five, six and seven (\\"The Shadow Rising,\\" \\"Fires of Heaven,\\" \\"Lord of Chaos\\" and \\"A Crown of Swords\\").Is Martin walking down the road that Jordan took years ago? I hope not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upsetting","review":"too much time between books and a very very weak 4th book - it seems he is too caught up with his HBO series to actually FINISH the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Epic stories ever written.","review":"Maybe the best story I've ever read. Epic in span. The books look intimidating in size, but they read fast. There are no good guys and bad guys, just characters with their own motivations. At the end of the first book, I had my favorite character and my most hated characters(two brothers); at the end of the third book the brothers were my favorite characters. The character development in this story is second to none. This series of books would appeal to non science-fiction fans. I can't recommend it enough. The only thing that scares me is that there are at least 2, probably 3, more books to come, and the author is gray-haired and over weight. I pray this series is completed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fantastic trilogy, a middling n-ogy","review":"The first book established characters, a world, and managed to have an interesting plot. A large part of that plot came to an end in book 3. I figured the fourth book would follow the first and establish new characters and have an interesting plot. It did neither.Book four floundered along and I was only able to skim it and not read the entire book. This has happened to me before in another series, the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan. Apparently, when an author meets with amazing success with a series, there is a strong urge to crank out lots of pages and not worry about keeping the readers interested. This author uses the same devices to crank out boring page after boring page, meaningless detail and frivolous trivia.This series has definitely jumped the shark."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feast for Crows","review":"I found it extremely hard to continue reading, the characters that once held my interest have since been eliminated, the only reason I read it throughout was simply to complete the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"If the Lord of the Rings could be written as a trilogy. . .","review":"If Tolken could write a thoughtful, rich epic like the Lord of the Rings as a trilogy, certainly Martin could have done the same, and should have. This forth book is a disappointment. I'm sad to say the series is beginning to feel more like a drawn out cash-cow than the great work of fiction it could have been. With every new book I hear a cash register ringing somewhere. . . I'll not be reading the next book. Even if i do i'll certainly never buy it. Sorry, Martin, you're a brilliant writer but i can't help but feel you've drawn this series out for the cash.Update:I've given it a bit more time and while I still believe the story could have been condensed, the rich characters and complex story line (not to mention the quality of prose) makes for enjoyable reading. If upgraded review to 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"well , it's George RR Martin , so the quality still in the story , i think that this book and the next are a transition in thestory , a preparation to a new phase of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Filler","review":"The Others are not mentioned. Tyrion and Daenerys do not appear. Jon Snow hardly does. Nothing major happens not even close to what happens in the prior books.

What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disaapointment after the third three","review":"It was near impossible to put the book down during the the first three books but the fourth one it was hard to pick it up because there was hardly any intrigue, story or that feeling of what happens next. I don't think it was because of the missing characters (though they are sorely missed throughout the book), its also the way the story was told that changed. In the first three books, I would excitedly wait for the next time the story was being told by a particular character but would get so consumed by the next character that wouldn't even mind if the previous character didn't emerge for numerous chapters. Maybe Mr. Martin killed the intriguing characters too quickly/abruptly and had to do with fillers in this one. I just hope the next one is not as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wheel of ..um Song of Ice and Fire! yeah that's it","review":"I swore I would never read another fantasy series after the mess that was (is? who cares?) the wheel of time, that goes around and around and around... But I gave the first one a shot and WOW! AWESOME! BEST EVER! I loved it, as I did the 2nd and 3rd in the series. But, AFFC is painfully boring and plodding. I'm struggling to finish it and wonder if I have been sucked into another money machine of an unending series. Blah! Is the next one the last?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and drawn out!","review":"Can't really add much to to other reviews. The author is focusing on to many point of views which is really getting annoying. It takes multiple books to accomplish what you could normally get done in a few chapters. The most frustrating thing is he often focuses on non primary characters and events that leave you wandering why it was even included in the book. Also, the constant \\"sex scenes\\" are getting annoying. It is starting to sound like some old perv who hasn't gotten any for a while. Maybe if he did he could do a better job and get back to what made the first books so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"He lost it.","review":"It was a bad mistake to divide this story and the next by characters.

I just hoping the next book will be back to the old format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tangential, disappointing","review":"I was looking forward to Feast of Crows, believing I'd find out what happened to the remaining Stark family members and further enjoy the development of their characters. With every chapter and point of view from yet another little known character, I found myself saying - out loud - \\"focus George, focus.\\" He never did. I truly hope the next book returns to the story as laid out in the first couple of books and these loose fluttering extraneous characters either fly off in the wind or somehow come together in some meaningful, believable way. I would hate to have the Stark and the direwolves' story line left unanswered at the end of five books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole lot of pages, Knights, Lords and attendant Ladies and gory death....","review":"Right up my alley. Got the boxed four book set when the show hit HBO. Liked the characters and thought, 'this'll be cool'. And it was until book \\"A Feast for Crows\\". When Sandor speaks to Arya while breaking their fast one chilly morning after the 'Red Wedding', he says 'About your mother...' I blew beer out of my nose. And then it gets phoned in. But you know what? I'm invested, for the long slog. I want to see what happens with Daenerys and Euron Crow's Eye. It's one hell of a game. I just hope book five isn't Tweeted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough!","review":"If you are a true fan and trust the genius of the author, you will LOVE book 4! I loved the new characters introduced in this book, and could appreciate the fact that some of my old favorites were off elsewhere doing other things. It adds a little mystery and excitement to not hear from them for a book. I can't wait to find out what they have been doing in A Dance with Dragons. Honestly, I think book 3 and 4 are the best. 1 & 2 are obviously awesome, too, but book 3 will blow your mind book 4 is just as much fun. Can't get enough of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well it is not a storm of swords","review":"After reading the Exilarating story,you just want to keep reading through it and see how it is going to unfold and resolve; me as an anime lover I don't mind about fillers,because it shows me more details of characters I know and love or at least love to hate,in this book you will get plenty of both ,if you like to read and if you are engulfed by aoiaf like I am this is a good book, not poorly written or uninteresting but not focused on main cool characters,let's say its more from the point of view of king's landing,good reading though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not buying anything G R R Martin until entire series is complete!","review":"Hooked on the first 3 books; then read the most recent and was unsatisfied completely. It went all over the place.Now, after 5 years of waiting, I've decided to not purchase anything related to Martin until the entire series is completed - not just the next book, all of them.

I could not wait for Feast of Crows to come out. After the first 50 pages, and nodding off several times I knew something was wrong. Simple put, it was boring. The author seems to have lost his voice and intensity. The characters lacked action, interest and engagement. They were flat and the plot wandered around aimlessly. I forced myself to finish when I realized there was another book coming out. Also, I was hoping that it would pick up.Save yourself some cash borrow it from the library or just skip it and go with Dance of the Dragons.Oh, I don't buy blaming the publisher. The author needs to control how his material is released and this book stands on its own merit not what it could have been or how it is related to the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated Book Number Four, Won't Be Buying Number Five","review":"Oh what drivel.This fourth in the series goes on and on and on, with no resolution of anything and most of the interesting characters missing.I've made three attempts to finish this long-winded book of drivel and stopped midway through every time. I finally gave the book to my rabbits to eat (they enjoy a good book!)The first three books were phenomenal. Fast paced and filled with character-driven plot and intrigue. The fourth one is nothing more than a long book written to take as much money from Martin's fans as possible.Did I say, total drivel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the last two hundred pages made up for the beginning and middle","review":"I agree with both sides of reviewers on this issue. Yes-we have been spoiled by the writing of George's first three books.Yes-in large part there are too many character perspectives and Yes-for a while it does not move the pace along. However the last two hundred pages left us with cliffhangers involving all the main characters, Arya, Sansa, Cersei, Jaime and Brienne. While I admit I am disappointed that I will not get the answers to these characters' problems until Book Six, I knew this was going to be the case, because I have been paying attention and was aware he had split the character perspectives into two books.Please do not discount what a talented author he is. The comments out of Jaime's mouth outside the walls of Riverrun was worth the price of the book alone.When is Feast of Dragons coming out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better now that I know","review":"Book seemed a little useless until I learned that the last book went in step with this one just from other characters POV.

What was the word Brienne shouted? According to the reviews for A Dance With Dragons, we'll never know. Why all the new characters when we haven't finished with the the old? I was enthralled with the first three books, not so much with this one and I may not read the last (two if you want paperback). If I could ask one question it would be, \\"Really George???\\" Get new editors or learn how to finish a story. I hope the HBO series producers/directors take heed and give us something more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETELY UNREADABLE!","review":"With this fourth book, Martin does to his series what Lucas did to Star Wars. While the first two books in the series were enjoyable even in their density, and while the third book though weak was at least engaging, the most recent book is so bloated and seeming off plot, that I simply couldn't finish it. I've warned others about getting into this series that seemingly has no end. What a fantastic disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feast For Crows","review":"What a disappointment! Martin's lame explanation at the end (what a relief!) of \\"Feast\\" did nothing to appease the disgust and frustration I felt almost immediately upon beginning the book and everything to reinforce my decision that I, for one, will not be reading any more \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" books.Martin succeeded in his cheap attempt to crank out a mindnumbingly lackluster collection of words.I took pity on his characters, not for the misfortunes that befell them in the book, but for being used so badly by their creator.Cross Martin off my list of authors to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the opposite of page turner","review":"Okay, I'm perverse, I liked reading these books because they are only mildly interesting and VERY easy to put down, its great bathroom reading, but only there, and oh my god, who cares about all the customs, food, family trees if they are not in service to the story, yes, yes yes, all you Renaisance pleasure faire groupies love this stuff, but its not about the writing, which mostly sucks, there was one glorious point in all the four books that achieved something close to good writing where the dragon queen does not give up her one dragon and takes the army of slaves, this was an emotionally well wrought and satisfying plot turn, most everything else goes too slowly, and in strange, inappropriate directions, the worst problem is that I like the idea of complex characters changing through time, but this effort is buried in the sludge of extraneous detail and confusing, episodic inclusion of unimportant characters and actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Goodness for Amazon.Com!","review":"I loved the first three books in this series and was eager to buy this volume. Fortunately I read the reviews on this site and saved my money. This was a good thing, because I borrowed the book from the library and was truly disgusted. George Martin is a terrific writer. There is no excuse for this tedious drivel. It is clearly an attempt to make more money by drawing out a story to fit two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"many names, but very little story","review":"A Feast for Crows is a great disappointment. It focuses largely on minor characters, and despite the great length of the novel, very little happens. There is much travelling, but not much happens on arrival. More and more characters are introduced, more and more names, lengthy genealogies,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak effort-longwinded, disjointed, and unecessarily confusing","review":"This series was wonderful starting out and i was hooked on book one. The books have been getting weaker and weaker with this latest installment making me feel as if i have wasted my time. Too many characters in and out of the story without little development for the reader and after thousands of pages without proper reintroduction to the reader. Disjointed and weak effort on this book that started weak already in book 3. I have formally given up on this series after such great promise in the first two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disapointment!!","review":"I read the first 3 books in this series in less than 10 days (many sleepless nights!) My biggest annoyance was all the extraneous geneology and minor character details but the story was so good I pushed through anyhow. This new book is a slap in the face, basically it has mostly minor characters and nothing happens.Where is this guy's editor? It is not like he doesn't have enough interesting main characters already. Why not write about them? Yes, I know about the supposed 2000 page book split in half etc but he could have written the good book first. Instead we have to wait till 2007! I think he should write 2 versions of every book from now on one version with the great stories characters & twists the other with all the genealogy, excessive details and minor characters. Lets see which version sells better.Bottom Line , I feel betrayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle","review":"Why is this book NOT available for Kindle? I know several others who've downloaded it in the past, but it now is not available for US customers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overly Critical","review":"I think most of these reviews have been way too critical of AFfC. It is basically group think at this point. People come here to read the reviews of this book BEFORE they read it, and it's fate is pretty much sealed.With that being said, this book is probably the weakest of the 4 (not sure about ADwD). That doesn't justify one star reviews. If the first 3 were five stars, this is four at the leeast. It is still a good book! The Cersei, Jamie and Arya chapters are all great. The Iron Island and Dorne chapters give you good insight into other locations in Westeros. The Brienne and Sam chapters left me wanting more. Like all the books, it starts slow and ends strong.Summmary: If you have read the first 3 books, you absolutley should read this one. I thought it had similar pacing to the first book. AFfC may be more subtle then the other books, but it is still great none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this book really necessary?","review":"I loved \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" \\"Clash of Kings,\\" and \\"A Storm of Swords,\\" but while reading \\"Feast\\" I started to get...bored. And in my growing boredom, I asked myself: Why is this series so long? Why does Martin need seven huge novels to tell a story he could easily tell in four? Basically Martin's been writing the same story since the first novel, and I hate the addition of new houses and characters in Feast. They detract from the story and merely add to Martin's growing list of near one hundred characters. This is a prime example of something good that's gotten out of hand, just like Hollywood sequels. The superficial need to extend a story destroys the original and much loved effect of the first novel and leaves the reader with an unsatisfying end to what could be an awesome epic. Let's trim the fat here, Martin, and get back to leaner, meaner storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"Martin has fallen into the worst tendency of fantasy writers--writing too many words about characters and events that are not interesting to read about in the first place. This book deals with minor characters that keep getting introduced, and worse, nothing actually happens throughout the book. Most chapters can be taken out/skipped without losing anything. I myself got bored and stopped reading half way through the book. I definitely will not be getting the next book either because it looks like Martin has come to value quantity over quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"The whiners and haters have it all wrong. This book was an excellent addition to the series. I loved it and I can't wait for more! The only possible way to view it in even a slightly negative light is to compare it to the previous books, as Martin is still the best there is. Ok, so the book largely covers only half of the characters of previous books, saving the simultaneous actions of the other characters for the next book, and that means it was slightly less epic. And I never really cared for Cersei that much, and she is covered in great depth in this book. Those are the best I can do for complaints. And then again, I never cared much for the House Greyjoy and the Iron Islanders, but this book really added lots of interest for me, so I expect any future Cersei stories to be quite fasciniating. And thanks to the splitting of the book in half, we shouldn't have to wait quite so long for the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible writer","review":"I am amazed by George R. R. Martin. Yes, this is a weaker book than the others but it is only half of the book, the rest will come. He is just amazing with his characters, they are fascinating. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, read it slow and easy and can't wait for the next!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A feast for the author and no one else","review":"The series becomes ever more long winded with each book.By the 3rd book it was becoming plain the author was indulging himself. This one is just a complete bore, almost bizarre in the pointlessness of some of the chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated series","review":"I started with the first book and got hooked by the setting, although the constant shifting from one character to another became annoying. I read the second and third, although the series became depressing (with everyone dying almost) and the alternate chapters of characters becoming more annoying as it became increasingly difficult to remember where the story left off with each succeeding character. The third book actually became rather boring but I ordered the fourth book anyway as some of the characters were interesting enough to want to find out what happens, although the slaughter of Robb and Catelyn was truly depressing. Finally, half way through the fourth I gave up and quit reading as I really didn't care what happened to the characters anymore and the individual plots were more and more diverging. I felt like George R R Martin seemed to have lost the thread of the original premise of his series and was just extending the plots to make more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If I hadn't loved the first three books in A Song of Ice and Fire so much, I wouldn't have been so disappointed by this installment. I expected to have trouble putting it down like I have with the others. Instead I had trouble picking it up. Finishing it was a chore. The book felt about twice as long as it needed to be and introduced a lot of point-of-view characters you only see once and just don't care about. There are a few interesting plot developments and I'm curious to see where they lead to, but I hope A Dance With Dragons picks up the pace again or else I might be giving up on the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the plot go?","review":"I began reading this set of novels after watching HBO season 1 'Game of Thrones'. The idea of a fortified ice wall which kept at bay an evil that isn't really defined was very original in my opinion as was the fantasy world of mainly human characters. The first three books in this series kept my attention because the plot went forward at a slow but steady pace. During this book though, the plot stagnated and many new characters were woven into the story which created way too many threads to maintain my interest since not one of the threads progressed the main plot line introduced in the original novel.I would rate this book a 2 and the series as a whole a 3 with the concept a 5.I am not sure what HBO plans to do with the 'Game of Throne' series because I think all of the good stuff has been used up in season 1. They might get a season 2 out of it if they focus on the War of the 5 Kings, but once they get to the material in this novel...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost interest in Book 4","review":"I agree with many others reviewing this book, and the series as a whole. I was really into the series with the first two books, though I was very angry about the Red Wedding (was the book 2 or 3?) and the knocking out of Robb and Catlyn from the game of thrones. They were wonderful characters that deserved more ink. By the third book I was getting bored with the plot, which seems to have gone very far astray, as has many of the characters, and began to wonder why the author was introducing so many minor characters that add nothing to the original story. Speaking of too many characters, and the lost plot, killing off interesting characters and not speaking of some others only left me wondering what was the point of book 4? I'm almost at the end and feel cheated. I will not bother continuing on. Mr. Martin, I just don't care anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've enjoyed all of the books in the series up to this one. It was boring and lost my interest.

George, how can you do this to your fans?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The series has jumped the shark with this release","review":"This book was a dissapointing failure.I was a huge fan of the previous 3 novels and really anticipated this one. After all the delays and given the long time the author worked on it, it just had to be good, right?Guess not.Many of the strongest characters in the series are not even present. The story line is langid and uninteresting. Minor characters are pushed to the front and we are forced to accompany them on circuitous errands.The overarching series plot, which galloped in the previous three novels, has practically frozen to a standstill. I wish his publisher had burned the thing and told him he needed to start over.It has all the reek of being churned out. Hope the next one saves the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Disappointed","review":"The First 3 Novels of this series is awesome! That being said, and long wait for the 4 enstallement to grace bookstore retail shelves, this Feast of Crows was a huge disappointment. There was very little story line. Most of the novel was belabored with geneaologies of newly introduced characters that borders on cruelty to the reader. Action? Limited. Favorite characters from the past books in play? Limited or none at all.Intrigue and strategy that was the series trademark - confusing that left one with the sence of hopelessness. Faith alone is the only reason to read this book or perhaps the hope that it would bridge into a 5th book akin to the greatness of the first 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Jordan","review":"Oh, how I long for the days when a fantasy did not require 15 books to be completed. Remember The Lord of the Rings? It was told in a mere 3 books and had more intellect than all of George Martin's and Robert Jordan's books combined.I'm sorry, George, but I'm afraid I'm going to give up on you much like I gave up on Robert Jordan at Book 10 of the Wheel of Time. I just don't have the patience for 400 page books with a storyline moving at a pace slightly slower than a snail.

I'd have given all of the other three books 5 stars without hesitation, but this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly good enough","review":"The book drags on in a plodding style reminiscent of the later works of Robert Jordan.

But honestly, how did he think taking away a lot of the best characters would make everyone content for years until he came out with the ADWD (also would have hurt my expectations, if they weren't already obliterated by this book). The worst part of the whole thing is that he went from the best book, to the worst one. The different is so blatant that I got half-way through this one, and was like, seriously? This whole book is based around this? What can anyone say but he's still an excellent author, but he got greedy expanding his trilogy (which would have been amazing and more memorable) into something that's toppling down the hill. I don't know if I'll read 6 . . . Then again, who knows, time heals all wounds.Give me another five years till book 6 comes out, and I might forgive him for his 'slow dance with dragons'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not nearly as bad as the reviews would leave you to believe.","review":"I was skeptical of the book because I read reviews here before purchasing it. I am glad I decided to!Let's start off with the obvious. You will not be reading much about Jon Snow nor much about Tyrion nor much about Bran and Rickon.What this book does is spend a good deal more time on the peripheral developments in Westeros. Namely those of the Iron Islands, the Tullys, the Freys, The Vale, Brave Companions and notable characters such as Samwell Tarly, Jamie Lannister and Cersei Lannister. If these characters and houses offer very little interest then you probably won't like the book much. I would urge you to read however as they become very interesting stories as the book nears a close. I almost feel depressed that A Dance with Dragons will not be resuming some of these wonderful stories but that is for another book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so.","review":"Martin uses this phrase aptly in Feast for Crows, and I can't claim to do it justice in the title of this review. His writing is the same quality & fun it's always been, and [most of] the characters are still rich and believable. Nevertheless, Feast is good writing, not a great novel. It contains detail that is neither enjoyable to read nor relevant to the main line- except perhaps forcibly so. Rather than tying things together, the story needlessly grows broader and more complex. I repeat a sentiment echoed in other reviews that perhaps the \\"original\\" plan was better. Editing 1500 pages- or 2500- into 800 pages of an exclamatory continuation of the first three volumes might have yielded a better read than two separately cluttered volumes. I could ease up a little by looking at Feast as part 1 of volume 4, and part 2 is of course not out yet. Perhaps A Dance With Dragons will help redeem Feast, but each of the first three stood on their own. Unfortunately, number four does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallow Fluff.

To be honest at the end of Storm of Swords I didn't see how Martin was going to salvage his tattered masterpiece. Killing and resuscitating Catelyn, killing Robb, dismissing Joras, parting Arya from Sandor, kicking Tyrion out of King's Landing, having Jon turn down Winterfell... the point is this series might just be over. Martin's new characters are wooden and one-dimensional. Brienne the determined, Ceries the frantic, Jaime the weak... these characters were far more interesting in their previous incarnations. I couldn't even finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does GRRM care how angry readers are getting?","review":"A Feast for Crows was a huge disappointment to almost everyone. GRRM new it was a pretty poor effort and he offered some weak explanations in his web site - the entire work was too long for one volume, Dances with Dragons was coming soon, he had writer's block, he had to go to this convention and that convention, yadda, yadda, yadda....... I'm pretty angry that GRRM, whom we all thought would fill the void created when Robert Jordan turned into a literary prima donna, seems so dismissive of readers' frustration with the time between books and the short comings of Feast For Crows. Is there any point in my or other readers getting angry? Probably not. GRRM will finish Dances With Dragons in his own good time, and readers will buy it as quickly as drug addicts going through withdrawal. If Dances With Dragons does not get the series back on track I'm finished with it. I won't get sucked into another Wheel Of Time morass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't even finish it.","review":"This book literally made me angry. While reading the book, at first I kept thinking that maybe the next chapter would be about a character I actually cared about, but then I got about 500 pages into it when I had to come on Amazon and read the reviews to see if the book ever gets any better. Basically all the reviews are right. Every character and storyline you care about is almost completely ignored or not even covered.I guess the good news is maybe HBO can actually do something with the story.

You know like a movie you can leave for 20 minutes and don't have to pause because you know you won't miss anything. I find myself wondering why I even read the book, so I read it again. Still nothing happened. Here is an author that had me hooked by the second page of each of his last three books. He has taken the.... hmmmm.... say...least interesting of the characters and made us follow the same old hum drum of their lives for what seems like forever.

I can't believe they chose to release this with a new narrator. Roy Dotrice is a much better narrator for this series, and after listening to the first three novels (hours and hours!) his voice has become the characters to me. I just can't make the adjustment to John Lee.Random House, if you're listening, please re-release this (unabridged - as always) with Roy Dotrice reading. I'd rather have a delay in the release of future books than lose Roy Dotrice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without Roy Dotrice its just not the same :(","review":"The absolute worst thing audio books can do is change a good narrator in the middle of a series. I loved the first 3 books and Roy Dotrice was Great. I wish I knew why they changed narrators in mid series. That totally sucks!! I don't have time to read the books and depend totally on audio books. When it happened in Stephen King's Dark Tower series at least King explains that the original narrator was in a serious accident and could no longer narrate. So what is the reason Mr. Dotrice did not do book 4. I hope it is a good reason because I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another in a long series...","review":"George R.R.

GRRM's prose is becoming verbose, redundant, and therefore boring. It's as if he wanted to extend the series to seven books for his publishers, not his art. GRRM's three prior books were completely outstanding in every area of literature.It is my hope that he does not fall into the 'Robert Jordan' syndrome. Instead of expanding his already excellent characters, he chose to lengthen this book, by creating more mediocre characters, with little or no true relevance to increase or forward the story.Remember, from his very own website, his initial intention was to write four or five books.I agree with his first assumption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm could it be...","review":"...that Martin is taking advice from Jordan?

A Feast for Crows spends too much time on previously minor characters (Asha and the other Greyjoys and the sisters of a dead prince)and I had to ask myself multiple times \\"Why am I supposed to care about these people?\\". Nothing much happens and I found the book extremely tedious and very disappointing. Not worth the time to read it! I hope that the next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mystical All My Children & General Hospital in the making","review":"Who said in the mystical distant land, they don't have All My Children & General Hospital series? I have had a feeling that the stories keep going on & on after reading book 2 and yes, book 3 has indeed confirmed my nagging feeling. But I tried to finish it to see if there is any closure on Book 4. Well, about 100 pages into book 4, I have to put down to search in internet to see if King Martin has some plans for other books. Yep, he did plan to have book 7. For now.Book 4 is a totally waste of time leading to another waste of time and then to another waste of time, to infinity if King Martin's health permits. The series should close around book 3 and at worse book 4. But King Martin keeps go on & on with his very \\"inventive\\" & petty plots and many plots really do insult reader intelligence. But I have to tip my hat as King Martin is the best in milking cows by stuffing his books with junks. See you at book 100."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am just hard to convince","review":"Even after reading all the reviews...I went ahead and bought this compilation of outtakes.... as that what it seems to be to me. Boring to the max. The author should be ashamed...reminds me of Frank herbert's son and the Dune series...should not have been published. Searching Google, I found out there are websites to download this book (and the next) in a pdf format...for free. Glad I did. The next book, A Dance with Dragons, stinks worse than this one...and they want $14.99 for it!

However, there is one significant problem....No Roy Dotrice! John Lee narrates this installation of George R. R. Martin's \\"A song of Ice and Fire\\" series with talent, but not the talent that could have been offered by Roy Dotrice, the narrator of the last three installments. Consider petition Random House for another publication with Dotrice as the voice. Go to petitiononline.com/4Dotrice/petition.html to let your voice be heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"I looked forward to this book with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed. None of the characters (with the possible exception of Samwise) are worth \\"rooting\\" for. The ones like Breanna who seem to have some integrity are killed off. It might be just like real life, but I read fantasy for fun, not existential philosophy. I really doubt I will buy the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy Writing","review":"I have one short comment. I hope Mr. Martin never uses the phrase, \\"half a hundred\\" again. Why he used it so often in this book is beyond me, but I'm afraid it represents a certain laziness on the part of both author and editor. This is not a petty concern; it represents a summary of other sloppy writing practices evident in the book. With such an interesting plot and characters, the writing should not be lazy.With respect,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for TV Movie?","review":"I really hate to say this but I think that this book was written for a TV series. How else does it make sense that it is so lame? It really does read like a soap-operaand I am sad that such a promising series is whimpering out. Slogging through pages and pages to get to the meat of the matter is not fun.When I find myself \\"speed-reading\\" instead of \\"re-reading\\" chapters I know something has gone amiss with the author.In spite of the (what one review called sadistic)awful treatment the most likeable characters get I was entrenched in finding out the history of this fantasy world.Now I feel meh....why bother....I will just be disappointed. Read if you must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not disappoint","review":"A Feast For Crows is written in a quite interesting manor. Essentially, this book (and the next) were written together, but due to the size of the story half of the characters were pulled out and published in book, and the other half will (one would guess) have their stories told in the next. That being said, so long as one is not waiting to read about one or two particular characters (which may or may not have appeared in this book) this book will not disappoint. Martin's writing style is still as thrilling and the story is just as unpredictable. I can not wait for the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This feast will leave you hungry ... in a bad way ....","review":"With each release in the series up until this point, Mr. Martin seemed to up the ante on quality, excitement, pacing, and plotting. In contrast to the magic growing throughout Westeros, Martin seems to have lost the magic touch with this entry. Points of view are added that seem to bear very little importance to the overall story. Even worse, they plod along drearily.Most of the viewpoints we've come to love don't even appear in this novel. Which would be fine, if of course, what was in their place felt as if it had a point. Being interesting to read would also be a bonus. Ultimately this novel failed me more than it succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as great as the rest","review":"Kind of a slow read, but if you're already hooked, you have to read through it.

Needless to say, this required diligence and a patience I normally don't possess, and a bottle of excedrin.Mr. Martin could've made this story phenominal if he'd just stuck to the characters the first book started with, the Starks. This latest installment bored me to tears, to be honest, and I really reaaaaally don't care to read about Circe. Her chapters were predictable to the point where I'd find myself laughing about how she's just 'another bad guy.' In fact the vast majority of the book could have just been over-written with chapters all about the Starks, with maybe a few about other big players in the story.I'm begging of you, Martin, please for the love of Pete, stick to the interesting stuff, or I'm going to need a stronger pain reliever to sit through the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It is amazing how rich and full the first three books were and how amazing that this book was full of nothing. I was very happy to finish this last book it was like a burden was lifted off of me. I'm sorry to say that I found this book was a waste of my time. Knowing me I will give the next book a try.

Then he gets a major case of writer's block for HOW many years???!! Yes, a sub-par effort. He's trying to dig himself out of the hole he created. I really enjoyed the first 3 books - a fantastic effort.

I loved the first and second books, the third less so and this even less.There are too way many characters. Once the books took off like Wildfire, it seems the editor got lazy and just him run amok and everything passed muster. Way too many scenes that don't progress the story. Too many repetitive battles and jousting for power. A book, even ones this size, shouldn't need to list 80 pages of explanatory houses/characters at the end of each book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"Disturbed by the seemingly gratuitous violence against women.

Martin obviously doesn't know how to edit himself. He seems to feel the need to fully develop every thought or idea that comes into his head. He is an incredible writer but certainly has a problem with resolve. This book is soley focused on what i think are the less interesting characters. I would either skip this book or skim through it as much as possible. The fifth book is so much better! I can not wait for the next book. Martin better hold true to his word and finish this series in seven books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure how this ended up in the humor section...","review":"This book truly does not deserve all the bad reviws it's been getting. Every book in the series has been phenomenal, although even though it doesn't really make sense to say it's the worst book in the series, one could still say it's the least good. Nonetheless, the book is a much better read for any fantasy fan than half the stuff people read now anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lease of the series but still great","review":"This one focuses too much on Cercie and the Maiden of Quarth Brie. The Dornish story is good addition and at first the Ironmen are annoying but starts wrapping things together.

However, this forth one of the series was a giant disappoint. (Feast for Crows) It was so bad that I left the last three jackets each containing six CD's at my family house.

The characters that kept me wanting to read more--Tyrion, Arya, Bran, Stannis, Jon--are barely mentioned. The writer knew many of his fans would feel let down, as indicated in his epilogue. One thing I did enjoy was seeing the other side of Jaime, who became one of my favorite characters. But, as far as I'm concerned, most of the book is a self-indulging dragging out of the story and a grating tease. I'm holding off before committing to book 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow. Robert Jordan-esque","review":"I am really afraid of the next book. A Feast for Crows was really slow and disappointing . It got bogged down in minor detail while glossing over the more interesting aspects of the story (The Mountain, The Hound) nonwithstanding George's statement that he focused on some characters more than others on purpose. I think he made a mistake. The beauty of the series so far was the fact that we saw the events played out through several points of view at the time - that is the whole crux of the Song Of Ice and Fire. All that changed with A Feast For Crows. I am very nervous that the series will descend into a tragical, neverending farce that Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time has become. I woved not to read any more of Robert Jordan's dross beyond Crossroads of Twilight. I am worried that I may have to make the same decision about George RR Martin after this book. I hope that the next book brings us more of what got all of us hooked on his work in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a huge DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!","review":"First 3 books are excellent. This is one disappointing, lame excuse for a 4th book. Read the other reviews. I have nothing to add. They are correct. Most of the characters and story lines in the other books have been abandoned. Did he forget what he wrote in the 3rd book? The authors even adds a last page trying to justify why this 4th book is not as good as the other 3- lets you know he knows it was a stinker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"I can't believe what a waste of time this book was, and I was shocked to find out that the 5th installment has been delayed for years (the pre-order fooled me), but it's also just the other points of view during the same time period? Then why the delay?This installment was deadly boring and repetitive. I couldn't have cared less about the new characters. I couldn't even keep them straight. It just went nowhere, but the whole time I figured at least the story line would wrap up with the next book, one way or another. When I got to the final chapter, I almost threw my kindle across the room.Will I buy the next book? Not unless I see a whole heck of a lot of positive reviews saying that he redeemed himself (or his editor, rather) and that it is the final installment that wraps everything up.

As much as I enjoy the rich detail and depth of character in this series I found that I had to power through large sections of this book, hoping that it would get better. A great deal of time was spent attempting to develop characters that just weren't very interesting. After reading interminable chapters of Sansa/Alayne I still don't care about her.This book wasn't bad, it was just too damn long. It was also a terrible disappointment coming on the heels of book 3 which was excellent. It would have benefited from some aggressive editing, and books 4 and 5 should have remained a single volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell off the track","review":"This is a prime example of lazy writing and zero editing.

Fantastic reads in all of them. Talked to my son and learned this series is one of his favorite.

I'm finishing number 4 just because I want to finish it, but looking forward to my next book whatever it might be.So, all in all the first three are splendid and definitely worth the time from cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, this book is horrible.","review":"After reading the first three books in the series and loving pretty much every page, A Feast for Crows was a horrible disappointment. Others have already said it better, but plot-wise, almost nothing happens in this book. Oh, you will learn about characters and more characters and the back history of their houses, but nothing interesting actually happens here. I cannot tell you how many times I fell asleep while reading it.To add insult to injury, several of your favorite and infamous characters from Book 1-3 don't even make an appearance. It's hard to imagine what Martin was thinking here.God help HBO if they try to make this boring book into a 13 episode season.

When I finished this one, I was not very happy with it but I had hopes it would be salvaged by A Dance with Dragons. In a way, it is. This book was a little slow for me and wasn't very entertaining but when compared with Dance with Dragons (the next book in the series) this one is like War and Peace.All I can say is that, looking back, I wish I had stopped at the end of Storm of Swords.

Up to now I have only heard Roy Dotrice, so it's entirely possible I just got used to Mr. Dotrice, but John Lee grates on my ear like crazy - I could not listen to him for even one chapter. All the stresses sounded wrong and the voices were completely different. It just lost something. Again, I don't know if it's just the shift from what I'm used to, but I would advise going with Mr. Dotrice as opposed to Mr. Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part one of an epic book","review":"Contrary to what I thought I was getting into, A Feast for Crows isn't the whole book. No it is half of the stories in the Song of Ice and Fire world based on where the characters are geographically.

After listening for so many hours (audio book 1-3) to his rich skilled voice, emerging me into the world of Westeros....this new narrator is like black is to white. What a let down.

True it does not move quite as fast as the others, but it provides us with a backdrop and mood for the coming books. It seems to me we needed this book to tie up loose ends left open in A Storm of Swords and to provide us with new plots for A Dance with Dragons (Book 5). The absence of some of the main characters lets me anticipate what might happen, leaving me actually thinking about it. While it is not AS good as the previous three of the series it is no 'mummers farce' in comparison"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not up to par","review":"Yes GRRM is still the King of fantasy writing. Yes there are times I'm on the edge of my seat, but not enough times for a tomb such as this. GRRM must be trying to get into the World Guiness Book of records for having the most characters in a series. However, he is asking way too much for the average reader (say myself) to keep track of who is who plus their parentage. Just stick to the meat. The Lannisters, Starks, and Daenerys. Everything else is just fluff. But truely, this review is hard to do since the book is incomplete. Now that's power to publish a book that isn't finished. I think Martin and Stephen King are a part of some secret society where they truely believe that the dumb masses will just buy anything they put out...again in this case (myself)...it's probably true. So when is the next book coming out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to the next one.","review":"Martin delivers another solid book filled with his fascinating and vexing mix of revealing just enough plotline and history to make the readers satisfied and hunger for more. The major complaint here is the lack of completion, but Martin throws more and more characters into the mix, even though there's an awful lot of Cersei and Jaime, who dominate the book.The good thing, of course, is the afterward that says there's already pages and pages of characters like Tyrion, Jon, and of course Bran, who has the biggest cliffhanger of all the characters after A Clash of Kings. The book is an excellent continuation and will make you wait as impatiently for the next book as you did for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow but picks up","review":"I read a lot of the reviews and criticism of the book.

Shame on George Martin. Woe to all that thirst for the greatness of the original three. Will we once again be fed words worthy of a King or are we Crows that must feast on what Scraps we are given.From what I hear of the next novel, it is the latter.I feel Martin has lost the entrance to the world and looks in from a distance. I hope he finds his way back again, with help if necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I think reading the reviews was helpful & gave me a good overview of what to expect.

Get on with the story already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Read this right after part 3 in hope of resurrection for the saga. I must concur with most of the fans that this is a loser and the story has gotten too rambling as opposed to the earlier character driven adventure and politesse. I read all that bollocks blaming publishers and etc., but the content is what did this one in. I won't be reading book 5 unless there's thunderous reviews and much talk of having resurrected the drama of the first two installments. I found myself forgetting who some characters were, since they weren't interesting anyway. Perhaps too many?I watched part one of the mini-series based on Game of Thrones this past week, and it was awesome. What a bloody grim world the cinematography portrayed, just like the story was lifted from the written word, as I had pictured it in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"I absolutely loved the first three books. They were well-written, and the stories were facinating and intriguing. I couldn''t put the books down. This book, however, was basically a waste of time. Reading it was an absolute chore - -something I did because I already has so much emotional capital invested in the story. This book moved the story not an inch. I don't know who to blame, the author or the editors; but I believe the editors at fault. The book is still well written, but Mr. Martin has gone down the path of Robert Jordan, a series I gave up on a long time ago. I hope the next book restores the luster to a series that is now tainted."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could return it....I would.","review":"I loved the first three books in this series, couldn't put them down. I waited on pins and needles for months, following the official website, dreaming of what this book might contain. I'm so dissappointed, I could cry. It's slow, boring, and did I say slow? I can appreciate detail, but when the detail has no purpose, and goes on and on for pages,then it's easy to put the book down (not a good characteristic for a novel). If I hadn't spilled taco sauce all over it, I would return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you reveiwers","review":"To all of you fans of Geogre RR, I thank you for your input to \\"A Feast for Crows\\". I will not read this book even though I enjoyed his first three. Having just recently discovered Mr Martin in the past three months, I have read the first three and have not had to wait and wait for him to write another. I agree with many that Mr Martin rambles on with no end in sight. He is a very gifted writer, yet I don't think even he knows where this story is going. Soon his book \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" will be available in July. I sincerely hope that Martin writes about the Danerys character and Tyrion and Jon Snow. They are the most interesting characters in his story. I am looking forward to a little bit of closure in this new novel. I believe that there will be as there are only two more books to write to finish his \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. I just have to wonder how long I will have to wait to be able to read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a Song, not a Jingle!","review":"All of the negative reviews for this book boggle me - or rather the dominate reason behind the negativity - that the reviewers favorite character makes too brief an appearance or none at all. This would make sense to me if The Song of Fire and Ice was about a certain set of characters, but as was made abundantly clear in A Game of Thrones, the Song is the main character, not the people who compose it. I am surprised that anyone can finish book one, let along three books, without that becoming painfully clear.This is a wonderfully written book. Like many I wanted to see more of Arya, Tyrion and Hodor, but any disappointment I feel stems from my desire for instant gratification. This series is brandy, not tequilla. Savor it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty, brutish, and (should have been) shorter","review":"My summary says it all - the series that started with such promise ends with a dark, dull, sickening thud. If you enjoy reading about the darkest types of violence, torture and rape then this is for you. Plus, despite being overrun with needless pages on 3rd-rate characters, this is NOT the conclusion - surprise surprise, there are more books to buy!What a disappointment after a solid book one this series turned out to be. I think it's the only Fantasy series I ever started but didn't finish (will not be buying book 5)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible reader/dull story","review":"Having listened to the first three books on CD read brilliantly by Roy Dotrice, I wonder why they switched to John Lee for Book IV on CD.

Back to Roy Dotrice and John Snow and Jamie and the Imp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"I absolutely loved the first book. Great characters, great concepts. That book alone carried my through a extra couple books of the misery that follows. Anyone with a scrap of decency gets mauled as the story continues. You are left with the despicable characters.

That's what GRRM seems to have done with the 4th in his Fire and Ice series. It's short on story and entertainment and long (very long) on padding (that I didn't care about - and I bet you won't either). The first three books were fun to read. This one, which will be my last, was a chore (and a bore).Do you think he did it for the money? Cause for sure, the guy can write - he proved it with three in a row. But this one was a swing and a miss, and a swing and a miss, and ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This series has become increasingly disappointing. I always have respect for an author who can kill main characters, however this is ridiculous. There is almost no one left to care about. All the \\"good guys\\" are basically dead or lost or engaging in questionable moral activity. I think George R.R. Martin is a sex starved & cynical man. I'm not sure I'm going to be able to finish this series. Why bother? Also, I'm going to punch the next person who compares him to Tolkien."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treading Water","review":"I felt like I had been conned by the time I was mid-way through this book. It is a complete time-waster. Feels like the author had simply lost his way and had to keep the series alive with irrelevant stories about mostly irrelevant characters and plot lines. I finished it because there may be a few details in it that will be relevant to the books that follow. If there is a Cliff Notes for this volume, get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Review","review":"This is my first review its a shame its a negative one.Three very long books leading to this one had me hooked into the lives of the main characters, good and evil. He wove a tale that had me believing that good characters did bad things and the most corrupted could find redemption in good actions. Then he threw that all out the window and marched along on a new pace - one of inaction, tensionless drolling, and monotonous diaries. All this while ignoring the characters we most wanted to hear about.Felt let down and disappointed, never mind onward and upward to more books immediatly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"falling into the same slide as other epics","review":"Definatly not worth the wait, not only that he allowed his publishers to print only half the book. GRRM has fallen into the same genra now as Jordan, Goodkind, and other epics fantasy authors.. these people need to take a class in how to end a good saga while it is still good.. Sadly we will get another 4 or 5 books like this, truthfully we dont need as many, but apparently he needs more money to buy more of his precious knights... A shame, the seriees started off so good, now it will end in shambles"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feast for Fools","review":"Mr Martin has jumped the rails with this lost in the woods tale. I could tolerate the changing character POVs in the first three books even though I found Mr. Martin's habit of killing off the most interesting of the lot annoying, but in this book he not only kills, maims and discards the good he keeps and focuses on the bad. Why would anyone move on to the inevitable next book, when there is no one of any interest left. Surely the base for this series is not so desperate for reading material they will keep reading when nothing is left to read. I hear there is a fifth novel, glee! Only at gunpoint, I'm off to find a graphic novel or kiddie book, something with some substance. After this Great Expectations sounds like an exciting read. Do the right thing stop at book two and make up your own ending. You'll be happier and better served."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betrayed","review":"I was expecting a continuation of the major cliff-hangers left from book 3 and was disappointed to find a book about a bunch of \\"B\\" characters.

Too bad you stopped caring about your readers after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A noodling free jam","review":"Haha, this is truly a soap opera without end, throw in an occasional perceived resolutionFriday which actually creates more trouble, and go on and on and on, even repeating long long verbatim passages from earlier books, until this final Noodle of Noodles.Final for me, that is, I'm off this trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler","review":"I read all four books in this series in about a month. And I loved the first 3, but this one seems like filler. All my favorite charactors are virtually missing. I'm gonna read the next one with the hopes that it will improve.If you're looking for the best fantasy series, I'd recommend Steven Erickson."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANGRY","review":"I am so sick of authors with gigantic unfinished works. Someone gave the first 3 books to me for Christmas, and I purchased the fourth myself. I've enjoyed the series up to this point, but when I came online to find the next, i discovered it isn't yet published.This reeks to me of Robert Jordan. I am sick of unfinished series! There should be a frigging warning label on the cover of the first novel that the series isn't finished. I am on the verge of just stopping where I am in book 4 and waiting for the series to be finished before I read anymore...... If it ever does get finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"George what have you done to your masterpiece?","review":"I happen to have been an enormous fan of this series. At least until now. Martin produced significantly more material than the publisher wanted to pack into one book. Rather than rotate through his entire cast of characters in this book he has chosen to focus on just a few. So no John, no Bran, no Tyrion, no Dany and her dragons. Of the characters I like best we see only a few chapters devoted to Arya while of the characters I like the least we get page after page after (gloriously written yet insufferable) page. ARRRGH! Don't bother skipping ahead to get to the good stuff, it's simply not in this book.Boo!Hiss!I can't wait to get the next installment, rip out the chapters, and interleave them as they should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Shame","review":"Like everyone else that has written a review for this book I also loved the first three books in this series. Honestly, the best I have ever read. I tracked the progress of A Feast for Crows for years in excited anticipation. My wait has sadly been in vane...This book is a complete disappointment. All I see is an author or publisher or combination of both trying to make more money. Why would you, Mr. Martin, produce a book that is so obviously trying to drag out a story with endless/useless detail just so you can continue a series beyond necessity and earn a few extra dollars? Where is the want and desire to produce great literature? In my opinion, Mr. Martin came so very close to creating one of the world's best fantasy series but instead opted for greed and has ruined the potential. This book is a waist of time and I recommend no one read it.What a shame..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not My Favorite - Still Hard To Put Down","review":"This is a great book. Don't get me wrong. Read it and you will understand why only 4 stars. But read it you MUST. I will not be a spoiler. I personally never read reviews until I am done. Even that is perilous as there are some who are spoilers who purposely will ruin the next book. Just a warning. I Highly recommend this series to everyone. They are obviously well written and you will be quite satisfied. After finishing book 3 I joined audible.com and purchased the versions expertly narrated by Roy Dotrice. As an aside, I never thought I'd say this but I am also addicted to the Kindle Fire HD.

I was so looking forward to this book, now I am not so eager to see the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!","review":"Sorry Mr. Martin, but I, as well as others, think this book had one main point - to net some coin (maybe the secondary reason was just wanting to get something to the clamouring readers). I have been touting the series as the best since Tolkien...until this book.Most of this work could have been put into one chapter each of the main characters and this would likely have sustained the original story. A few chapters in I became bored with the book and the onslaught of character names. The editors should be red-faced over this book which is the downfall of an amazing series thusfar. Great reading is always a combination of great writing AND great editing and the latter was certainly missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I read some of the reviews claming that thr book was boring and umeventful. so at first i was kinda unsure if i wantd to get it. but after reading it i dont understand what you guys are talking about. George Martin is an exallent story teller and i really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the lot.","review":"This is the best of the Song of Ice and Fire novels, mainly because the stalest characters are set aside for the majority of the book. It also contains what is, for my money, the best character arc in the series. It's unfortunate that the sequel undoes this volume's most beautiful work."},{"rating":"2","title":"these books are the best","review":"another great book in the series. if the 7 come out on time at at this level this will be a true masterpiece. lets just hope martin finishes before he has a stroke or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If anyone is hoping for a happy ending - or any ending at all, you're not going to get it in this book. The characters wander around until they're killed in some senseless and/or horrible way. No plot at all! These books have become increasingly misogynistic - very disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, uh.....dragon withdrawal here","review":"Okay, you are going to buy this anyway. So that's not what this review is about cause we all have to have this book, you know that. But I'm totally lost on this one. I gave it 2 stars because of the huge conglomeration of people, names, politics, and just freekin STUFF that Mr. Martin somehow manages to keep track of cause I sure can't. I am going to follow the advice of previous reviewers and skip this one and pray to Orlando Bloom and Hugh Jackman (I worship these guys, the two sexiest monkeys on the planet)that he gives us a synopsis in the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"he sold out","review":"this is a sorry attempt to stretch out the series to make more royalties from his publisher. i would be shocked if he finished the series in six books as he originally planned. i am very disappointed. the genre and writing is very different from his first three novels in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would compare to Tolkien only because there'es noone better to compare to","review":"Great book, great author great, series. This is one of the best high fantasy author's I have read in quite some time. I can only compare to Tolkien the work is exceptionally complete, all the sub stories wrap together with pure beauty. The kind of books you can't put down till there none left I have already ordered the pre-release on the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish","review":"There is not a lot that I can say about this book that so many others have not already said. Nothing major really happens in this book to advance the overall story of the series. We get a view of Martin's world through the eyes of a bunch of characters that I really didn't find interesting nor important.I actually stopped listening about 1/3 of the way through and read the synopsis on Wikipedia to see if there was anything interesting that I might have missed. There wasn't.While his character POV style is interesting, the non-linearity of this technique is downright annoying in this book. Brienne's search for Sansa that goes on and on and on and on (while the reader already knows she's safe and sound elsewhere) was absolutely mind-numbing.I finally gave up and moved on to another book. I am currently listening to \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" and, it is slightly better than this one, however, it is no where near as good as the first books in this series. I fear that the author has lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bore","review":"I'll keep this short since previous reviewer's mentioned the same feelings I've had. This is a totally different book from the first 3, centering on new characters that were rarely mentioned before. Large amounts of story happen behind the scenes and we never get to read about the important plot points. Most are just mentioned in passing, usually one or two lines. There are large amounts of dreams and scenes that do not carry the story foward, you can skip pages of descriptions and dreams without losing any plot points. Overall, a very boring and tedious book after reading the first three. Very disappointed, I may stop reading this series all together. It seems like George R.R. Martin is now just in it for the money. Very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Letdown","review":"I'm so disappointed with this installment of Thrones I lost all desire to continue with the series. The story just drones on and on. There is very little action , just a lot of words that really do not help move the story along. Boring.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters, not enough action","review":"Its tedious. But I keep on reading since Im hoping for some action same as in the first three books. By now Im almost through and am very dissapointed. Am not going for the fifth book. Whats the point since the reviews say its more of the same on and on and no action? The author got stuck in his story and cant figure out how to end it. Its a pity. This fourth book should have been the last and ended with fireworks. Not just continuing with a flow of new boring characters that you have no chance of remembering anyway. Its just filler. There are so many other good books out there that I prefer to read instead of the next in the series. I hope you have patience if you buy this and the next and apparently also the sixth. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Okay, I rarely write reviews but this just had to be done. What happened? I was so eager to read this book after the way the last book ended. Then I buy the 4th book & I just find myself skipping around trying to find the characters I'm interested in! I think I honestly skipped half the book & now I don't know if I should by the 5th because of all the bad reviews. Why did Martin do this to us, he's an excellent writer so surely he must have known that the books were heading nowhere? That the characters were getting lost? It's like bad sex, eager to start but near the end, you just realize there's not really going to be a satisfying climax (Tyrion might have liked that comment...if you could find him anywhere)."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the heck!","review":"I got hooked into the Game of Thrones series and read the first 3 books relatively quickly. I will say that I not necessarily a great sword and sandals - fantasy kinda guy, but loved the first 3 books. I also enjoyed the HBO adaptation that I watched streaming on Amazon. But this book.... not so much. I am a pretty bright IMHO and an avid reader, but I can honestly say after reading almost half of this book, I have no friggin' idea what is going on. There! I said it! Perhaps reading short snippets on my commute train is the problem. Or maybe the e-reader is not the best way to go. Either way, I might as well start the book again.... OMG! The horror! Because folks, I ain't gettin' it. I just ordered Bradybury's Martian Chronicles and may have an extended interlude from the Game of Thrones. Hopefully, with fresh eyes, it will start to click with me. Cheers and happy reading! Your pal, Keith"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I have no idea why so many disliked this book. I thought it was excellent. I am very excited about the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journeys and Changes","review":"In this fourth volume of A Song of Ice and Fire begun with volume one, A Game of Thrones, the author has us wondering and wandering with the characters as they vie for castles, seek safe havens and continue the wars and intrigues that will, hopefully, lead to peace in the country of Westeros among gods and men. It is the men (and women!) who must decide. Even seeking safety has its perils. While Martin's writing is as compelling in this volume as in the previous three, I gave the book one less star as the story is somewhat more fragmented in this volume with new characters to focus on and less said about the ones readers have come to know. While much of the saga has a Middle Ages sort of ring to it, we are reminded that this is a fictional land with the presence of giants, mammoths and the undead. More so than in the last three volumes, this story feels very incomplete and another volume is eagerly anticipated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had enough of this series","review":"I am sick of my favorite people dying!!! What author kills off so many of the main starting characters!!! I have had enough with this series and will not continue with anymore of the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"just finished on my kiindle and unlike some here i was not disappointed. the pace is a bit slower than the others but no less entertaining. glad i am a latecomer to the series as i can hardly wait for the fifth installment next month...i need my tyrion fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dis-interested at best","review":"I hate to trivialize my review so much - but I did not care a single iota about what I was reading. I found myself having to search old character lists for references to the obscure folks being featured in this episode, wondering why I was being subjected to the events occuring in this book and worst of all - I had no desire to even read the upcoming Dance w/ Dragons upon completion. I fondly remember staying up late with the lights on to read Game of Thrones and endlessly chatting about the end of Storm of Swords. It's almost as if this latest installment was a Story-Published-In-The-Same-Universe as GRR Martin's Song of Fire and Ice for as much enjoyment as I got out of it. This was a chore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear !!","review":"Just put down the book after going through about 10 chapters. Oh Dear....it's been so long since the first 3 books that I had trouble getting back into the story. The Characters I wanted to know more about, Jon Snow, Bran, Danerys aren't in this book at all. I flipped to the back and read he's saved them all for another book to focus on those characters. This is the like the wheel of time all over again....nothing much happens in the book, it tooks ages for the publisher to release it and now I've to wait until next year to read about the characters I care about ?!! Dooh !! I'll probably pick it back up when I've nothing else to read but I'll be waiting for the paperback of his next book this time.....I feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment leads to first review, ever","review":"I'm one of the ones who pre-ordered this book and waited impatiently through the recurring delays for the release of this book. I had high hopes that Martin would not sucker his fans into having to buy yet another book after this one to get to the end of this story. This seems to be the trend with fantasy authors these days, and frankly, I'm getting fed up with it. This book needed some heavy editing, and if it had been edited, maybe yet another book would not have been necessary. I was very taken with Martin's writing style in the first three books, and I found it refreshingly different, but when it's strung out, it can be excruciatingly boring. I will not pre-order the next book, but will wait for good reviews before buying. Caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"To be succinct: I loved the first 3 books. This book was not as engaging as a 600+ page book needs to be and I am very concerned that To Dance with Dragons will not answer the cliffhangers present in this book.There are a number of cliffhangers in this book - some real good ones. In fact, just when I was considering giving up on this one it started to get interesting and the fate of some major characters is really left up in the air. Then it ends and there is a note from Mr. Martin explaining how all the other narratives will be in the next book - BUT - when will we find out the fate of the stories in this book? Book 6? Long and a bit dull with no pay-off for two more books is just asking a bit too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"900+ pages for what?","review":"One could skip this book completely and not miss a beat in the series. It's full of character no one cares about and a hundred pages of rape and murder. Also, Cersei is a sociopath. The end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have stopped with book 3","review":"I loved the first three books in this series, but book four is definitely a disappointment. Most of the interesting characters from the earlier books are left out of this book; the most compelling plot lines from book three are left unresolved; a whole new, seemingly irrelevant plot with new characters in another country is introduced; we spend most of our time with Jaime and Cersei, whose introspections become frankly tedious; and pretty much nobody seems to get anywhere. The book feels like a holding pattern.Most disappointing of all was to reach the end of book four and find out that book five isn't published, and quite possibly never will be. With all due respect to the author, who is clearly a terrific writer, this book adds little value to the series and its content should have been left to wait for the more interesting material to be done, if ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycott this series","review":"Shame about Martin, when he started the series it had such promise. This book was, as he admits on his website, only half of a book and to add insult to injury he wants his fans to stop bugging him because he will finish the other half when he gets round to it. Since his last update on his own site was January 2008 when he said that he had no idea when the next volume, which will bring the series about half way would be finished, I would not hold my breath. Personally I shall be boycotting his books in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"Like putting together what promises to be a beautiful puzzle, only to find out that the most important peices are missing. If he writes what should have been the rest of this book any time soon, I'll have to edit this review and give it more stars. But this book was written way too long ago to have the story left unresolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrgh","review":"I think he could have made this a five book series rather than a seven. While I have enjoyed the format and the character development, and the plot twists, its started to get hackneyed. Every time you start to take an interest in a character they are cruelly maimed or killed. We get it, life is tough, and if you are in any way involved with anyone in power, you are going to die a horrible death. If you are a nobody, you still die horribly, but with less ink. If you are cute and spunky, you die slower. And if we start to run out of the hundreds of cannon fodder characters, we just introduce new ones.I don't know if I'm going to buy the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, no editor?","review":"As much as I loved books 1, 2 and 3, I was deeply disappointed in 4 for the same reasons others have stated: the book is sorely in need of an editing. Martin is a very talented writer and I enjoyed the book once I lowered my expectatons; but I was deeply discouraged to lose another favorite author to bloated book syndrome. I have nothing against massive tomes provided they go beyond the plot equivalent of playing with your food. My former favorite author, Robert Jordan, has done the same with his last several books. Have these authors become so big because of their early successes that no editor feels worthy enough to call them on the carpet for their self-indulgence? Ultimately, he is the author and is free to do as he will. But it would be nice to be respected as a reader by authors delivering on the goods and not padding a series, whether for financial profit or just because they enjoy writing the series so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"character homogenization","review":"My fundamental critique: Unlike the 1st three novels, all the characters now sound alike--they're all cunning, plotting, scheming. In his effort to advance the bifurcated but converging story line, and with the overabundance of new characters to assimilate/introduce, Martin lost hold of character development. The result? Reading quickly became a chore. Like another reviewer, I couldn't even attempt the teaser chapter for the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rasher of suet.","review":"My nuncle and I rarely agree on anything, but we both mislike this entry in the series. Whereas George R.R. Martin has offered more or less leal service to his fans in previous works, rendering his reader a rasher of savory and succulent bacon, the entry in question was more like eating a shirt of rusted chain over a jerkin of boiled leather.In all seriousness, this is what happens when an author decides the characters in a character driven narrative transcend the plot so entirely, there ceases to be a need for a real plot. Whatever the characters are doing, no matter how trivial, is interesting because the characters are intrinsically complex and worth examining. Wrong. (Though I must admit for the sake of determining bias, I was not as impressed with the series as a whole up to this point as some, though I found it entertaining)I give it two stars because I have certainly encountered much worse. However this was definitely a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can skip this one","review":"It looks like many have already said this, but this book is meaningless filler between three very good books and what I hope will be a good fifth book.

This has worked for me as each character's story has stayed fresh in my mind. I've finished Jaime, Brienne and Sam and am still left with many questions. This is not as fun a read as the first three books. The story is moving along very slowly and I find myself skipping over extremely descriptive sections regarding food, clothing or the scenery. I thought ADWD was the last book, but just read that there are a total of 7? Yikes - might have to take a break and read some other things. It's almost become work reading these books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feast of Crows","review":"I love the book and the series. Goerge Martin is a skilled writer and story teller. his presentation follows a story line but he keeps me guessing as to what will happen next. His words draw detail pictures of scenes and descriptions of people in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on the same level as the rest","review":"So granted, the writing is still great and the overall plot is still thickening. No loss of interest there.The thing that bugs you in this part is how slow the events are moving... the message George leaves at the end kind of clarifies this a bit, and you go like: ohhhh ok! But still, the chapters feel so much longer and the story moves at a drastically slow pace.The characters focused on here are relatively \\"new\\" and you feel like you don't have a strong connection to them as you did to the previous ones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad","review":"Disappointing and boring. If you're interested in what's happening with your favorite characters from the first three books don't look here. Chapter after chapter of new characters introduced who add nothing to the continuation of the story and GRRM fails miserably in making any of them interesting enough to want to read about.I kept going to other books and coming back to this one in hopes it would get better. It never did. The book simply goes nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feast for Crows","review":"Book four in the ongoing saga of Martin's captivating story of heroic men and women and the despicable machinations of power hungry people.

Don't bother with this book!","review":"I absolutely loved the first three books in this series. After reading several negative reviews on this book I was hesitant, but how bad could it be right? I really wish I had never started this series of books. This book was so bad that I wish I could unread the first 3 and not be \\"into\\" this series. There are plenty of other reviews that give spoilers so go read them if you want the details. I am boycotting the next book (already published) and waiting for reviews of the 6th to see if the author pulls his head out. I have concluded that the authors propensity for killing off the heroes isn't a clever plot twist, but simply his inability to fully develop a story to the end (or even the middle). Unless the sixth book gets great reviews, I recommend simply stopping after the third and being content with an unfinished story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment after books 1-3","review":"Other reviewers have said it better than I can. I read book 4 in the series despite the lukewarm reviews, but this will be the last. After reading this book and reading the reviews on book 5, it seems that after book 3, each book is getting progressively uninspired. I'm not normally one to abandon a series once I'm hooked, but after reading the book 5 reviews and seeing the $14.99 Kindle price for book 5.... I'm done with this series. The first 3 books were good for the genre, but far from great literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost it's charm","review":"Loved the first but this book was all over the place.

I was a big fan of the first three and ignored the bad reviews for Feast and now I regret it since it was a waste of time and money. I've never would have expected it after the first three but the fourth is a much inferior installment in terms of narrative, style, and especially pacing. I would encourage anyone thinking about buying this to first read some reviews for Feast AND the 5th book Dragons and consider those reviews together before deciding to continue investing in this unfinished series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite but still phenominal","review":"To go through a book this big in so short a time must mean it's gold and it is, this volume nay not be as alluring as the others with its lack of characters like Dany and Jon but the writing is superb and the flow is,as always, perfect. Martin does not disappoint!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad :-(","review":"Simply replace almost the entirety of AFFC with the phrase \\"time passes\\". I'm disgusted with how this book was done. Worse is that Martin has locked himself into this split format for the next book. Don't waste your time on this book. Wikipedia the plot points and pray the next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think it will ever be finished!","review":"I read the first three installment in the supposed four part series, and waited eagerly for years for the \\"final installment\\". It came out, finally, in 2005. But it seems it was only Part One of Book 4. It's now been over 5 years waiting for Part 2 of Book 4 (now called Book 5, acknowledged by the author as the \\"good half\\" of, well, whatever it is), and the author's website hasn't even published an estimated completion date since 2008. Now I see that there are plans for a sixth and seventh volume! When? Nobody knows!I don't recommend anybody start ANY of these books until the \\"final\\" installment has at LEAST a firm publishing date.Come on, George, I'm growing old waiting for this series to finally end. It's just too much work carrying the torch. I give up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels like I just lost my best friend.","review":"I wanna crawl into my bed and weep for the loss of my friend.I dont think I have EVER been thing disappointed on a book before.The first 3 books were absolute daunting and extraordinary.I had never read an author that could surprise so much, I toldmyself \\"expect the unexpected from him\\" and even though I did hestill surprised me in the best way,But now, ohhhh now, he surprised me by creating a book I am dreadingand simply can not finish. I feel the responsibility to continue readingbut I don't want to. It is torture, its bad. I continue wondering WHATHAPPENED?! WHY IS THIS SO BAD?!I miss Jon, Dany and Tyron, and even though I still have Arya, Sansaand Jamie its still not good enough. What with all the new booooooringcharacters and storylines?. It seriously needs major editing!I am truly disappointed and I need to mournthe lost of the amazing saga of books that took the wrong turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feast of Crows","review":"Some time in the book I was expecting the tempo to pick-up. At last, the final chapters did so. I had order book 5 before I finished the \\"Crows.\\" Much to my chagrin. Wasted dollars. I should have spent the money on lottery tickets. T least I would have had a few hours of entertainmet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reviews made me think I'd hate it...","review":"I went into this book with lowered expectations. Fortunately, somebody warned me that certain crucial characters are completely missing from the book.With all that in mind: this book is wonderful. Martin uses the chapter titles to assure us that some of these characters aren't going to get much screen time. These characters are crucial to showing us parts of Martin's world we'd never otherwise know, and by the end, we can clearly see how each of them is building to Martin's endgame.And yes, some of our favorite characters are missing, but the story *about* those characters continues.I loved this as much as any of the previous books in the series. It's lush, it's fascinating, and I don't in any way envy HBO the task of somehow turning this into ten episodes. The arcs that some of our central characters go through are remarkably elegant. I'm glad I didn't miss out on this part of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not whining. I have simply done what every author wants.","review":"Simply put, George Martin has been in the fits of terrible writers block for some time. I recognize it, because I live the nightmare. Why he felt the need to be dishonest and say that he split the books to keep their length down is anyone's guess. I am upset at his decision to do so for two reasons: 1)I feel a close connection with the characters and the desire to know their fate is very real for me and hasn't been sated for several years now, and 2)the author obviously fibbed when his readers would likely have accepted an honest but delayed attempt to attain the literary successes of his past. This series has been incredible until this entry. I'm sure that you know that, Mr. Martin. The interwoven strands were a part of the magic. Give us more of the tale soon and be straight with us in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking back at my November 15, 2005 review","review":"Check out what I wrote on November 15, 2005, and tell me now if you still think I am wrong about this travesty...[..]Where is Dance of Dragons?The man will not finish this series, and in 15 years or so, some poor hack will be left to glue together 12 boxes of notes into a semi-coherent \\"conclusion\\" akin to Christopher Tolkien's \\"Unfinished Tales\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very taken with the first three books in the series. You cannot know how disappointed I was in this book after reading those. I read all ofA Feast for Crows. At times, I considered not finishing it, but I hoped that it would become as interesting and enjoyable as the first three books. I will keep those books in my library but as far as I care, this book can go in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I absolutely tore through the 1st two books. The story was fascinating, twists and turns abounded. I couldn't put it down. The 3rd book I struggled with (and I am a quick reader). This book I never made it all the way through. I keep thinking I will finish it, but its been months and I haven't even tried. If he would write more about the characters I am already interested in, instead of rehashing stories already told and introducing even more new characters, than I would have probably torn through it already. So disappointed. I really do love this series, feel for the characters, and want to know what happens!! I have enjoyed the HBO series so far. Here's to hoping the next book is better...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fonzi has just jumped the shark","review":"I remember being a kid and really loving happy days. Then Fonzi jumped the shark and created an industry expression for the moment that a show/series/story crosses the line and goes down the toilet.GRRM could have written an excellent book 4, wrapped up the key stories, and gone down in SF/Fantasy history as the new Tolkien. Instead he starts a NEW story line set that has little to nothing to do with books 1-2-3 of game of thrones.Had this been #1, it would be maybe 3-4 stars. As #4, it flat out sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Added depth","review":"This book gave more attention to characters that had been minor characters in the earlier books and added more color and depth to the entire series. It also went into more detail about places that had previously only been mentioned by name. It whet my appetite for the final book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so bad - please save this series with book 5","review":"This book almost made me want to cry it was so bad...especially after how terrific the first three books were. Others have summed it up...\\"nothing happens\\".Another major dissapointment is the new reader of the audio edition of this book. The reader of the first three audio books was fantastic - really professional and top notch. This current reader of Feast is just awful - can't differentiate his rich deep voice to make any characters sound different than the next.Please George - back to the drawing board and go back to the formula of the first three books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm afraid Martin has lost his magic touch.","review":"This book compensates me for all the sleep I've lost over the previous, wonderful, books. It is a wonderful replacement for any sleeping pills you might need - dull, extremely slow and focuses on all the wrong (i.e. boring / annoying) characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feast for Crows","review":"I fully enjoyed the first three books of the series and could not wait for A Feast for Crows. However, the book was not captivating and read like a soap opera. I would recommend skipping this book and hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series - everyone should read these!!","review":"This is a wonderful series of novels that any reader will enjoy and I'm thrilled about this latest edition. Even for those who don't normally read fantasy novels, give these a try, you won't regret it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should've, Could've, Would've","review":"Martin's good. The series is good, but Martin left out a bunch of characters in this book, so I give it four stars. Yes, Martin expained why, but IMHO, he should've given us a little less for each character and spread it out to the next book as needed.Martin's a talented writer. I'm sure he could've done this task. I would've, and I'm neither talented nor a writer. I just try to look good when I type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Roy? And why not both parts at the same time?","review":"As a person who normally gallops through reading material as part of my job, I luxuriate in hearing the occasional book that's worth the time to listen to slowly. Hearing a book gives me time to absorb all of the details, to picture each scene and facial expression, and to immerse myself in the world of the writer. Listening to Roy Dotrice made the many hours spent listening to the first three books sing. I couldn't wait to hear what happened to each person -- not each character, but each individual. I do hope Random House has the good sense to redo this book with Roy and make sure that he does the later volumes as well -- even if it holds up the release. John Lee reads some books well. This is just NOT one of them. Please get Roy back!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the GRRM bash","review":"I will admit that this book had not lived up to the expectations as the previous books had set, it has a lack of urgency in it that can be frustrating. However this an excellent book! It provides great amount of depth to the supporting cast and gets you excited for book 5.All of you who are bashing GRRM as if you are entitled to a series finish, you are not entitled to a darn thing and deserve nothing. Go back to your nerd blogs and dissect why Warhammer is superior to DnD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So torn.","review":"Have you read the bible cover-to-cover? It feels a bit like reading AFFC - there're are just times when this begins to read as so many begats. This ship begat that house, that house begat that son...I find myself skimming through lengthy passages of banner descriptions & houses & their heroes, because honestly, even if ser so-and-so will become important later, I won't remember him until his chapters come. And come I'm sure they will. Or, we'll just abruptly find out he's been beheaded and his head is tarred and awaiting further inspection.He may've lost me on this one. I devoured the first three, I fretted over certain characters, I bemoaned their grim circumstances and I would say I'm as invested as any reader could be, but I'm not buying the next one, I don't think. I'll catch up when HBO boils it back down to a bit more meat and less Genesis-flavored-potatoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogged in Batches of Boring Blather","review":"This is the worst read in the series thus far. Characters from the previous books are pushed off stage by an invasion of new characters accompanied by ponderous descriptions of their family tree, their history, their plots, and their exploits. Martin says he omitted old characters on purpose because the book was getting too big - yeah right! I think the editor forgot to strap on Martin's reins and he went trotting down his favorite path - tangents. Martin brings characters into a scene and then launches a laborious epic about a character's history or relatives. Good fiction has good pace and the pace in this book is glacial at times. It's a great book to practice your speed reading as you vault over the parsley searching for the meat."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible...","review":"Such a let down after the epic third book. iA thousand pages and nothing actually happens? theres definitely an art to thatHad to fight to finish the book, and hearing that the 5th book is more of the same really makes me not want to continue this series and just wait for the 5th season on HBO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done and wish I had the time back","review":"I was warned that the main characters do not appear in it but I had already purchased the set. The first three were good reads but at times switching between so many \\"main\\" characters can be distracting. At least in the first three the characters were not that bad to read about. In this Arya but in the end she just seemed a lost distraction leading away from what I felt was the story I was following. Jaime in the end became the best to read about though by far other characters in the previous books were more enjoyable.This book could easily have been accomplished in a three chapter prologue skipping many dull details. This looks to me to be more boring Jordan'esk ramblings to continue on a story that author appears to know the end game but doesn't know how to get their quickly enough. This book is so sad when first showed promise. One word should be taught to them, trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"steaming pile of cr@p","review":"I refuse to believe that the same author who wrote the first three books of the series also wrote this horrible terrible \\"book\\". It is even more laughable that the george martin took five years, more time than the time taken to write *all* the other three preceding novels, to come up with this steaming pile of cr@p.Now compound that with the fact that it has been another five years since AFFC came out and there is no sign of the fifth book. In 2004-05 george martin said that the next book was ready to be published. A man of his word truly.As I said before, I refuse to believe that books 1-3 and book 4 are the work of the same author. I call shenanigans on this. If book 4 is written by george rr martin then he stole books 1-3 from some unnamed author. there I have said it.Do not buy or read this book. Do not start the series if you haven't already. The first 3 books were great but the original author is missing and some untalented imposter has taken over the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"It is hard to believe how bad this book is. Like many readers, I love the earlier Song of Fire and Ice books. That is why it is hard to believe how boring and tiresome this novel is by comparison. The book goes on and on, tediously focusing on the least interesting storylines. The book is just filler, and pretty dull filler at that. How disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"After waiting impatiently for months, it has been disconcerting to discover this latest in what had been arguably the best read since Tolkien, did not even hold my attention. I cannot work up much enthusiasm for any of the newly introduced characters, nor indeed, remember enough to distinguish them from anyone else. Further, (for the audio book listener) the reader for this last book is certainly no match for the reader of the first three books. Why can't the publishers have at least gotten the readers together so that the listener doesn't have to contend with a different pronounciation of almost every major character name? It was too good to be true. Did Mr. Martin have a junior author help out with this last, and least of a great series? Please, take your vitamins, commune with the muse and do the magic once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many pages, so little tension","review":"Reading this book was a vast disappointment after book 3. It seems Martin may have peaked early in this series. I found that I had to force myself to continue reading to finish this book. Not very much action and the continuity is totally absent due to the changing perspectives of unsympathetic characters. Book 4 offers all the excitement of watching a bag of popcorn in the microwave, with the caveat that all the corn has popped in volume 3. You keep waiting and waiting for something to catch fire, but alas there is not even any smoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah","review":"Nothing exciting happens.Almost nothing written about the interesting characters mentioned at the end of the last book.Just a bunch of plotting by Lanisters to control everything.I'm glad I didn't buy this book.I wish I would have stopped at the first one.No more Martin for me. DONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book goes nowhere slowly. We know where the characters left off at the end of book 3 and by the end of this book it feels as if nothing happened. There is the usual character death, political intrigue and general plot movement, but when the last page turns you have to ask 'How are things different now than when I started' and the answer is 'not very different'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"GRRM spends too much time focusing on characters (both old and new) that readers will have a hard time caring about especially coming from the end of Storm of Swords. There's no mention of Tyrion or Daenerys, and only brief mentions of Jon Snow. It's very hard to care about these new characters, who are introduced at a feverish pace, when nothing is mentioned about the characters we do care about.And the character arcs are belabored to the point of outright frustration. Cersei's arc did not need repeated chapters of foreshadowing. Brienne's wandering is sheer navel-gazing boredom, ending with a cheap cliffhanger. Sure, the plot moves forward (at glacial pace), but was it a story that needed 700 pages to be told. Absolutely not."},{"rating":"1","title":"The audio book narration is so horrible, you'll buy the paperback.","review":"The narrator used here is NOT the same as the first three books. Horrible x 1000. Pass. Avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Sad....","review":"I dont know what it was about this book... I loved the first three! Even when he would make up new characters (probably to replace all the main characters that were killed in the previous novel) he still kept them intriguing and well developed. I started this book hoping that at least some of the original characters would appear sometime in the novel, but instead i was bombarded with dozens of new names to remember. I know this was only half of the book and the other half will tell of the previous characters' stories, but this doesnt make any sense... why didnt he incorporate them into this book, so at least some familiarity would be present... is the next book only going to be the new characters from the last book or the original characters? I couldnt even finish this book leading me to place all four books on the shelf. I might pick it up sometime again when i can find nothing good, but for now they collect dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feast for Crows","review":"This series started out fast moving and exciting. As a new book would come out, things started to slow down. In this latest book, I found nothing exciting, interesting, or fast moving. Mr. Martin is an excellent writer, BUT he tries to put too much background into each personality which lengthens the book and increases the boring aspect. I was actually looking forward to this book, and had paid for it 18-months before it FINALLY was released. If the same happens for book 5, this reader can do without it. The theme is excellent, the characters are fantastic and the settings are very good. I don't need to read 20 pages about how green/brown the grass is, how cold and deep a stream is, or how beautiful/gruesome a person is. This book could have been written with a least half the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope the editor commits seppuku","review":"I'm less than halfway through the book, but at about page 300 recognized this was nowhere near as good as the first three books. In fact, it was crap.While I haven't finished the book, looking at reviews confirms this is a piece of crap book. Anyone associated with the publishing of this book (including the author) should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Martin seems intent on dragging this series out as long as possible, which promises to result in it whithering on the vine. It could be a GREAT 5 or even 6 book series, but Martin seems to be going the way of Terry Goodkind.This book was full of way too much lead-up, and it ended just a half-step down the road from where it began. It also made it clear that any conclusion to the series is miles away. Honestly, I was disappointed that I purchased the hardcover, because this book, in hte end, just didn't go anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"It seems that Martin is following in the footsteps of Jordan. He wrote a few good books and then just filled the pages with fluff to add another book. Please do not buy this book. It only encourages other authors to do the same thing. There is nothing in this book that you need to know to continue the story. I will wait until the next book hits the library or the used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"A disappointment as vast as the world GRRM is writing in. Like so very many others, I loved the first three. I waited with baited breath for this one. I followed the website updates. I ripped open the amazon package that contained my pre-ordered copy.And waited for something to happen. Anything.Because I dutifully followed the updates, I knew not to expect to see many characters. And I was still disappointed. There's no plot advancement. Fine. I could handle that. But there's no deepening of character as there once once with Jaime, no changes of heart or mind, no GROWTH.After the meat of the first three, this is unsalted broth. And just about as satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Game of Thrones\\" emotionally damaging","review":"I am so sorry I spent the time it took to read all five of the George R. R. Martin books in this series. I only continued because I was waiting for some sort of \\"justice\\" for the characters I had come to love. Instead, the author killed every single one in truly gruesome and heartbreaking ways, while leaving the bad people to go on. What I was left with was emotional upset and horrific mental images. This is one author I never want to meet - his mind and heart are truly frightening to me. I will never read another word by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"the magic is gone","review":"This book definitely was not worth the wait. I wish he would just hire Brandon Sanderson to finish the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"<<May contain spoiler info>>After 3 great books I was really looking forward to this one, like many others who have commented here. And just like them, I was let down. None of the main storylines were developed in this book and instead we get to hear about Brienne and her useless struggle since she falls to the same demise as other main characters have previously. And in the end we are not even left with any cliffhangers that would compel someone to read the next book! So what was the point of that? Nothing but 5 weeks of wated time on a longwinded book. My suggestion is read a brief synopsis of this one and sign-up to get the next book, Dance of Dragons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"The decision to split the trilogy and make it 3a and 3b was certainly the worst I have ever seen. The story plot is not advancing at the same speed than 1 and 2 and the book as it is right now is just boring. Even worse, although Martin promised to publish 3b soon after the 3a release, he is not even close to finishing up.This must be a debacle from the editor/publisher point of view, whoever did not convince him to make it a straight trilogy had more dollar signs in his eyes than the reader in mind. I will certainly not buy the next book. I am deeply dissapointed that such a great storyline and interesting characters are dying this way....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls way short of expectation.","review":"After the awesomeness of A Storm of Swords (Oberyn Martell aka the Red Viper is amazing!) Feast is a veritable snooze fest. Nothing of note happens and the pages are dominated by characters I couldn't care less about (that's being too harsh maybe not all but I couldn't care less about Cersei though). GRRM thinks he's the next Tolkien but Tolkien was consistent! Consistently good in the LOTR series, the Hobbit as well as the Silmarillon. GRRM is way too inconsistent. I would rank Storm alongside the Two Towers but Feast really is such a shocking fall from grace. It feels like Martin is trying to stretch the series over seven books by using filler material. Jaime, Cersei and Brienne are not even amongst the five most important characters in Ice and Fire in the grand scheme of things yet they take up 70% of this novel. Relative to Martins previous work this book is worth less than two stars.-rant over"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragging along","review":"The other books in this series were pretty good reads. After the last one I swore I wasn't going to continue. I caved in and went ahead and got it,this one took off on a whole new direction and I don't see any end in sight. Probably not going to finish the series too far off the original path."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a mighty cast to a skeleton crew","review":"In Game of Thrones, I could hardly keep track of the 200 characters in the book. It felt epic in only for the cast. (Amongst other things!) In Feast for Crows, I am finding that the characters are scarce, at least those that seam to matter. Am only half way through though and love this series.Great read for all 4 so far! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the minority - Liked it!","review":"I started Feast of Crows with much trepidation after reading the other reviews. I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed the slower pace of this and A Dance with Dragons. I liked the more detailed background of the minor characters. I felt more connected to the story lines. I especially enjoyed the Cersei chapters and celebrated her comeuppance. I think the slower pace was necessary after the third book. It is possible that a reorganization of the chapters of all five books might make for a better and less confusing story line, but overall - I am still enchanted and awaiting the sixth chapter of the saga. I recommend ignoring the negative reviews and approaching the fourth and fifth books with an open mind - you might be surprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Love this series.

This book was a waste of time and money. It seems to only have been written to give the masses another book to buy. The story should have ended in storm of swords, because there is NOTHING about any of the characters you care about in this book. This is just filler, pure and simple, so much so that even GRRM had to write a few pages at the end explaining why he doesn't include anything about the characters you care about in this book, and to try to get you to by the next. Do yourself a favor and read some reviews of Dance with Dragons before you buy that too. Sad to say that this book killed off the series for me. It is boring, doesn't have anything to keep you interested, and introduces new characthers that you don't car about, because you want to know WTF happened after storm of swords."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring until the end.

Martin is like a coach who in an important game plays his second team while the first team rides the bench. The more profound characters in whom mysteries and angst are deeply invested (Jon, Sandor, Tyrion, Dany etc.) are only shadows.For many of Martin's audience to praise the novel with 5 stars because they understand it is a 'setup novel' compounds an irrational 'Jordanesque' perception.

It seems we may have another Robert Jordan on our hands (not in writing style, story, etc.) with too many characters and very little forward movement of the story. I am getting frustrated with fantasy series that take 5 - 10 years to complete. My advice, wait for paperback. If you're really wise, wait for the rest of the book in hopes that the story moves forward significantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lengthy digression","review":"The first three were as spectacular as this one is a flop. Most chapters, with a good editor on them, would have been deleted. I wish the crows could pick this dead corpse apart and leave the slate clean for us... since it can't I still have hope Martin will actually listen to the critics and make a save with the next book... which likely I'll wait for in paperback! Save your money on this one, skip it if you can, you'll miss a lot of Cercei paranoid and power hungry delusion and an idiot journey of Brienne of Tarth. A few chapters are worth printing... the ones on Arya. That's it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a disappointment","review":"After going through the first 3 books I was waiting anxously to the arrival of the fourth one.I read the review stating it is too slow paced with many words spent on food and clothes descriptions, but still I went ahead and bought it only to find it is too slow paced with many words spent on food and clothes descriptions. This books really feels like an effort to create another 1000 page volume with no real content.I will certainly trust the reviews before buying the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feast for Crows","review":"Well, it finally happened; the excitement has petered out. The great story from the previous books has been watered down and downright drowned in worthless dialogue. There are so many characters that I could care less about. Great characters of the past books have not had so much as a reference, two hundred pages into the book. This reminds me of my loss of interest in The Wheel of Time series where great character stories are sacrificed for the sake of volume and dragging out the series. No wonder this book took so long to be released; it stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded, lackluster and generally disappointing","review":"I read Storm of Swords and was excited to get my teeth into The Feast for Crows. This book didn't address any of the cliffhanger in Swords, didn't speak from the point of view of Tyrion, Jon or Daenerys, and dragged on in descriptive prose for pages without any human dialogue. I found myself skipping through just to find something of substance. He introduces a lot of knew characters briefly but none that could hold my attention for very long. Jamie's sarcasm is the only thing that kept me reading for as long as I did but at 60% I think I'm going to call it quits. I can't help but wonder how this will play out on the HBO series. I'll read the reviews on book 5 before I make the committment. Such a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author has lost his way!","review":"The series started out great and pulled in you with the characters and the story lines.Unfortunetly book 4 is the start of George just unraveling his mind on paper.

But, this one is a total flop with almost no forward movement to the plot line.

I'm in a real quandary whether to bother with the next book...if it is more of the same, think I'll pass.Martin needs to get back to the basics and story writing style of the earlier books!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Martin go back and rewrite this book?","review":"I love this series and the first 3 books get a 5 star rating from me. That said if this is what he has come up with for the next two books, He should rewrite them! In this Book he goes off on tangents. If the Hound is dead, drop the subject. What is with Mother Stark still being alive? Beric? So many characters we don't need to know about. He should have stuck with the main characters and not the minor ones. It's very disappointing to read the first three and expect more in the next one and not get it. I am reading two other books while reading this one, I never did this before. I keep going back to see if it will get any better. So sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"a feast for crows","review":"This is an excellent series for the fantasy fanatic.

Unfortunately I was disappointed. Not much actually happens in this book, and the Cersie and Brianne storylines, which are the majority of this book, are incredibly boring. I hope the next book is better, although the initial reviews for it don't appear promising. Might take a break from the book series for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"CROWS MISSES THE MARK","review":"After the first three books in this series all of which I give 5 stars, A Feast for Crows was a tedious and almost painful read at times. Some legitimate setup was necessary for the future but much of this book is boring filler about nothing. ( Seriously, WHO CARES what Alayne(Sansa) is going to wear for her ride down the mountain, whether her shoes fit or not,and who cares how many times little Robert spits up ? He's fragile, we get it.) Mr Martin needs to win our respect and our interest back in A Dance with Dragons. He absolutely enraged us by killing off almost all of the Starks after getting us to love them in the first book. Then of all things he has one of the finest swordsmen of all, Jamie Lannister, lose his sword hand. What ?! That makes about as much sense as Stephen King making Roland the Gunslinger lose his right hand in the Dark Tower series. A Feast for Crows could have been half as long. A Dance With Dragons needs to win back our respect and fevered interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Won't Let Me Give It ZERO Stars or I Would!","review":"This book is awful. At some point between the publication of Storm of Swords and this book, Martin decided that the series would be better if it went for seven books. Based upon the quality of this book, that was a poor decision. Nothing happens in this book. Nothing happens in the NEXT book, either. Martin is just milking the story, it is blatant cash grab, and it does not look like he is ever going to finish the story.Save your time and your money. Hopefully HBO will take over the series and finish it right. Martin can't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped mess","review":"The first book was somewhat interesting, but then I believe the author got carried away with his fairly decent reviews. Too many characters, religious twaddle, incest, fights between families/kingdoms,and a never ending plot/story. Does not even come close to \\"The Lord of The Rings\\" as mentioned in some reviews. Can't even get a decent resale price to get rid of these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on George for releasing this book","review":"It is not up to the standards of the rest of the series and is even totally boring in some places. Maybe what should have happened is that the two books should be ONE book with some editing and ego trimmed. I am upset that I wasted my money on a hardcover, and I loved the other books in the series. I've rarely been so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't think it would look this used.","review":"I bought the book used and it looked like it was in decent condition before shipping. However, I'll never know. The book I received had a bent back cover, folded pages, and a partially torn front cover. The damage looked to be caused by the poor packing job. Luckily for me, I was just looking for a cheap used copy of the book. If you are looking for something that looks nice in your collection, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4","review":"The book contained very little action or resolution but lots of details on certain characters, especially Cersei.

Number 6 Had better be awesome or I'm not buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"If you like serious, mature fantasy, this is for you. It's less about the socery and swordplay, and more about the conflicts between flawed people and struggling nations. The many characters are well-developed and complex, originating from differing backgrounds, nations, races, religions and political constructs. I found it refreshing that the author seemed to refuse to take sides with any of the characters; good and evil is exposed in them all, and found myself constantly changing allegiances. The history of the nations and ruling families of this series overwhelms me at times. However, I got used to it and stopped trying to understand every nuance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help Please","review":"I need help on this one...

What ..... I was on disk 2 of A Feast of Crows, when I found this. Did I miss a book in between, it doesn't seem so. But I can't find a bridge from one book to the other. Or was my last disk (24) damaged. But I find it hard to believe that so much could have happened to key players on one disk. Something seems very wrong. Please can any one help me.

Danys sits on her teak bench and does nothing but listen to complaints. Too many characters not integral to the plot. George must be bored as well with his mainstay characters to have abandoned them so callously. And the Others?

I am not sure that I am going to like reading the next book as it occurs at the same time as this book with the rest of the characters. I think it would have been much better to do them chronologically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happens","review":"I didn't mind reading it, but it didn't advance the plot much. It would have been just as satisfying to read a summary of what happened. For this reason, I will not be reading the next book in the series. One thing did bother me. I saw a quote from the second season on the show that mentioned things that have not happened yet in this book.I think this shows that the editor/producer of the show knows that the book is boring and has just started taking the interesting parts of the next book(s).The other thing that bothered me was with all the switching around of the POV for each chapter, by the time it got back to that character, I had forgotten what was happening to them and didn't really care too much.Basically these books read more like a history instead of a story where you empathize with one or two main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of first four!","review":"Books 1-3 were great. Book 4 was a major disappointment. Too many new characters and plot lines. Not enough attention to existing/prior characters. Author should have done the opposite of what he did. Focus on all the characters with half the content instead of half the characters (several new). Hope book 5 is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace Be With You Always","review":"This one was a b@&%$ ! That's what George r.r. Martin said in the acknowledgments of this book, and he was right. At points in this book, i felt as if i wanted to burn it, other times I was very much intrigued by it, yet by the time i finished it I realized that it was worth reading for two reasons: it refreshed my memory of the other three books and set the stage for the next one. This felt more like a skeleton, and the next book will fill in the details, and i think this book will come together nicely after reading the next one. At least that is the hope. Peace be with you always!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine effort for any other Author... for Martin.. not very good","review":"There is not much that advances the story here. Over 25% of the book deals with Cersei and Arya's story seems to be a second thought.The development of the Iron Born was terrific... but Brienne and Jaime's stories offered very little that was interesting.This was advertised as 'All the story of half the characters ' a reasonable approach by my thinking. Unfortunately, it ends the novel with stories unfinished... here is the issue with that... we have to wait for him to finish 'Dance with Dragons' before he even STARTS the book that may (or may not) finish the characters from this one.Jordan lost me after the 7th book in The Wheel of Time (I should have stopped after book 5) and Goodkind lost me during Faith of the Fallen... depending on how long I wait for 'Dance,' Martin may have lost me here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a slog","review":"Nothing I can say that others haven't but I wanted to be sure that my 1 star was counted in the ratings.

Don't waste your time reading this fourth book. It is horrible. To be more descriptive, it is dead boring. After looking at the reviews for the fifth book, I will not be wasting my money or time on it. It appears that book 5 rivals the drivel of Feast for Crows. So sad. The first three books were phenomenal, one of the best series I had ever read. It seems the author is trying to squeeze as much money out of this series as he can by droning on for hours with little or no forward progression in the story line. Such a shame. It had the potential to be a great classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"dragging on to nowhere","review":"The first 2 books were good, the third started to feel like a long road to nowhere.

Way too detailed (ok, he can make up like 1000 medieval sounding names, yay), and way too BORING.And, the idea of splitting it by character not time was a disaster BEFORE he took multiple years of producing mini-nothing-works, and spending his time getting feted by fans at geek conventions. Given the separation between the books, the character instead of time split is now Germany invades Russia level stupid.Watching a great talent destroy itself like this in utter self-indulgent (Crows, and the waste of the last few years) is very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumped the Shark","review":"With this book the Song of Ice and Fire series has completely 'jumped the shark'. What was a rather innovative approach to modern fantasy has now succumbed to the temptation of producing an endless series of epic books.Long, rambling and self indulgent, the book has no discernable plot as far as I can tell. The compelling action and pace of the series so far has been abandoned in favour of what I assume us cynic attempt to extend the series and make more money.To make matters worse, the book just stops! Right where it starts getting interesting and things begin to happen .. with the promise that we'll have to wait for tweo books to get resolution.If you've read the previous books, keep with it, you can only hope the next one gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"After years of waiting Martin bores us to death with book 4","review":"I read the first three books in Martins saga. Even though he can painfully drag on with mondain discriptions of scenes. He at least had a interesting story to tell with colorful characters that you loved and hated. For some reason he has chosen to kill all the interesting characters leaving us with the left over characters to fight over a realm that is basically nothing. He ignores the Dragon Princess who is the only remaining character with any interest. I can't believe it took him so long to write this book. He should refund everyone who bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good progression of the story","review":"I had read reviews that this book did not adequately advance the plot of the A Song of Ice and Fire series.

Amazing book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PHAGH!","review":"Just finished, and all I can say is, Why?Why was it so necessary to split the original book in two?-- Wouldn't a good bit of editing have served to condense things?Martin is a brilliant writer-- all the characters have texture and edges, and each has unique qualities. I find I like parts of them and dislike parts. But are they all necessary?I found myself skimming over the heraldries (\\"bob was the [...] of joe, a landless lord whose family were distant cousins of house jehosephat....\\"), and searching for those few bits that advanced the plot.I had not realized there were six books planned-- I only hope that Mr. Martin (or his editor) can get his verbal diarrhea under control before six turns into 12 or more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I remember completely enjoying the first books in this series, but after waiting so long to finally continue I just can't get back into the flow. It's a struggle to get engaged, almost impossible to remember who's who, or why I should even care.To many characters trying to do to much to move the story forward in a way that captures the readers attention and draws them back into that world.Maybe I'll need to reread the entire series, but after trying to plow through this volume I'm not sure it's worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a Feast.","review":"This book was indeed bloated, not with needless words, but with whole needless chapters! It contains literally hundreds of pages of virtually nothing but people wandering from place to place with no action, no plot advancement, no character development and devoid even of interesting dialogue. Ok, that's a bit harsh, but from a \\"The Master\\" it's just rude.This would be a disappointing book from even an unkown author, but for GRRM it's a slap in the face to his fans. I suggest waiting until the \\"second half\\" of it comes out and hope by some miracle it makes up for this yawn-fest. Also, buy the paperback because you'll get so frustrated you'll want to slam the book into your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"The read is not worth wait.","review":"I love the series and the first three books were all excellent. However, in Feast of Crows, Martin's writing is out of control. Rather than offer the cop out that the book grew big enough to be two novels, Feast of Crows should have been edited with the same ruthlessness Martin showed the Starks in the series. This book is encumbered by surplus characters and overburdened by pointless scenes.

I don't consider Cersei and Jaime Lannister; Arya and Sansa Stark minor. This installment advances the story fairly well. Actually, I am concerned for the opposite reason: I want to see what else happens to THESE characters (the ending makes you wonder)- if Mr. Martin is going to focus on the rest of the characters in the next book I feel I will be missing out. Either way I have no complaints with the direction this story is going. Also, I love the fact that these books are far from cliche- I haven't seen one \\"happy ending\\" yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Agree More with Ross Blackman","review":"Rather echoing Ross Blackman's review, I will just say that the literary diarrhea that has afflicted Martin in this volume will probably cause me to skip the rest of his series. Having woven the rich tapestry of characters, families and locales that made the first 3 volumes so satisfying to read, Martin should have begun to consolidate and resolve the myriad storylines. He could even have changed narrative voice to provide variety to what is becoming a monotonous device of switching from one character's story to another. In this book, it feels like one is condemned to watch an endless series of late night reruns with someone changing the channel every 5 minutes.Wake up, Mr. Martin, before you ruin both the story and your repuration."},{"rating":"1","title":"major letdown","review":"After reading the first three books one right after the other, I couldn't wait to get to the \\"end\\". Well, there is no end. So if you prefer a finite plot line, with some tonal variation, quit while you're ahead. Instead of bringing loose ends together, Martin has just created more of them.

It stars Roger Moore as James Bond, who I feel is the most suited person to play Bond, and performs probably his best outing as 007. From amazing locations to the amazing Lotus Esprit V8, that turns into a submarine..... Babara Bach plays the Russian agent XXX perfectly and plays of Moore brilliantly..... A must buy for all spy film lovers....."},{"rating":"1","title":"the spy who loved me , a review by xelah1234","review":"I personly think that this is one of the worst bond films amaginable.

When Allied and Soviet nuclear submarines go missing its up to 007 and the beautiful Soviet agent XXX to uncover a sinister plot that puts the entire world in jeopardy. The film is action-packed with a great plot, a lot of humor, and great preformaces.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bond - especially Caroline Munro as femme fatale","review":"Roger Moore is very good as Bond, but it is femme fatale Caroline Munro who, for me,steals the film. Tall, shapely, with gorgeous eyes she is in the film for an all too shorttime, her helicopter destroyed by a missile fired from Bond's underwater Lotus sports car.This DVD special edition includes many extras - a documentary about the \\"making of\\", tv adstheatrical trailers and much more.

The spy who loved me has a good solid story, even though it does share similarities with you only live twice. barbara bach played an excellent russian agent and she was cool, and yet never took anything away from bond. the lotus is an exciting car even today and the action scenes with it are very exciting. the movie is a little light on the gadgets. the end fight is big and grand and exciting. the dvd features are excellent and the 41min documentry is very informative, with short interviews with jaws and some of the bond girls as well as the director etc. the digital sound is clear, but there is very little use of the rear speakers, especally compared to world is not enough. but it is still an excellent movie and a good addition to your dvd libary."},{"rating":"1","title":"And that's just for the gadgets","review":"I can't believe there was a time when I loved all the Bond films without reservation. Now that they are being rereleased I started to purchase them...and now have stopped. Goldfinger is still briliant, but TSWLM is just vile. Barbara Bach as XXX is a babe, but one of the most vacuous performances on film. I used to slam on Denise (\\"I get to play a scientist\\") Richards in The World Is Not Enough, but compared to Bach she's Meryl Streep with a hot bod. Get a pulse. Roger Moore saunters through this venture in his classic English stoicism with just a bit too much of Al Gore's stiffness. Yes, the gadgets are good, but even they lent themselves to Austin Powers style farce. This flick is too campy for a good action film but not campy enough to be a camp classic. Sad to say, but the more recent Pierce Brosnan Bond flicks far surpass this '70's drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear oh dear","review":"Well, it's a romp for sure but not one of the best Bond's (unless you're really into 70's kitsch).

More funny than thrilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moore's second best","review":"This is truly a great film. It has non stop action from beginning to end. Roger Moore gives an outstanding performanc, and the villian has the most diabolical plot of any Bond Movie. Outside of For your Eyes Only, and Goldfinger this is the best in the series. A must see even for non Bond fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bond's best","review":"I think The SPY Who Loves Me is the second best Bond film there is. I love the Lotus and Karl Stromberg, the perfect villian. JAWS is also cool to. This is the perfect movie to follow The Man With The Golden Gun. Bond is up with a shipping magnate and has a great adventure in this film. What also makes this movie neat, is also the movies that come before and after it. You must rent this one. Let alone buy it.

The red uniforms for the villain's crew are also a leftover from '60s tackiness.The first 80 minutes of this movie are worth watching a number of times. The last 40 minutes can be skipped, thanks to modern science.UNDER SEIGE, a Steven Segal movie, is a better directed, and more exciting thriller set on board a ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"The spy who loved me","review":"A good price,plays perfectly,and arrived on time,and tracking was easy.

The book's subtitle sums up its goal and contents well: \\"Learning how Christians can walk hand-in-hand when they don't see eye-to-eye.\\" The authors, while academically sound, are writing from their own first-hand experiences. The book is well-balanced, and offers tools to help Christians build rich relationships with other followers of Christ outside of their own faith community without discounting or giving up the distinctives of their faith community."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the Best","review":"Apparently Kitaro wanted a means of recycling all of his past work so he called it all his 'best.'

The only problem that I could find wrong with the book is that it is very drawn out. Lestat will be talking about one topic and then switch off to a completely different one only to lead back to the previous idea. Quite a bit of repititon. Yet very entertaining. See for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"not her best...","review":"an excellent book, but not the best in the series. Lestat did wine too much and I got a little tired of everyone being able to just toss Lestat around...it just seemed as if the mortals were (at times) more powerful than he was.I did like the part about God and the Devil in the cafe...it made me think."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I thought this book was absolutely wonderful. I could feel everything that Lestat was feeling. I missed the books in between the Interview and this one, but I really felt like I knew what was happening.

I am a real vampire buff, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was fantastic!","review":"I am a huge fan of Anne Rice but after reading this book I will be a dedicated fan forever. It's amazing to me how she just pulls you right into a story and keeps you wanting more after the read is over. I found this book to be beautiful as well as exciting. Her vivid descriptions and beautifully described characters literally make you fall in love with her vampires. Any time I read another vampire book by another author or watch a vampire movie I am always comparing them to Anne Rice's vampire works. I am completely enthralled by her books and I hope she continues with the vampire genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lestat comes way out of the closet","review":"I thought the first 3 vampire books were great. Then Rice tried to make a forth book in what should have been a trilogy. More subtle signs of affection between vampires to help them cope with their immortality is replaced with rampant homosexuality in thought, word, and deed. It got boring very quickly when page after page has Lestat wanting to have sex with anything that moves. His character along with half the characters in the book turned into a bunch of gays that didn't have the interesting sides they showed in the previous books. It makes me wonder if Rice got a hefty sum of money from the gay community to make a book portraying even vampires as homosexual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Read","review":"I was really suprised that I liked this one as well as I did. I have read some really bad reviews of this book, but I found the story line really engaging. It was entertaining to see how Lestat handled being human and how he had forgotten all about the simple things. The sexual tension displayed between Lestat and David was tantalizing. I was a little confused by how easily Lestat allowed himself to be misled by Raglan, but I guess he was so deperate to experience being human again that he just didn't care. The visuals in this book are really intense as usual for Anne, and her character descriptions are spot on. This book moved up in my list to top 3 favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks the quality of the series","review":"After the 3 mesmerizing pieces in the series you are in for a great disappointment :(The story just don't belong to the Vampire Chronicles - neither with quality of the plot nor with the literal art that distinguishes the first 3 partsGood news is that I didn't give up on the series and the fifth book is as good as the first threeYou can read enough of the plot in the book description and if David Talbot didn't prove to be important for the whole series I would recommend skipping this book and picking up the next one in the series.

Action packed the whole way through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and predictable","review":"I've been on a vampire kick of late and decided to read the next book in the Vampire Chronicles. I read \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" and \\"The Queen of the Damned\\" over 15 years ago when I was in high school. I was disappointed in this book for the lack of imagination and tedium. Unless my memory fails me, this book seems nothing like the first three stories (I didn't read \\"The Interview with the Vampire\\" but saw the film). I remember them being full of adventure, mystery, and sensuality. I remember them having interesting stories to tell. \\"The Tale of the Body Thief\\" seemed very predictable to me...I guessed all the major plot twists from the very beginning. The words felt heavy and tedious to read. If you have to know what happens in this book, I'd just read the synopsis on Wikipedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Ann Rice book of all time...!!","review":"This is byfar her best that I've read.

Excellent...!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Anne Rice But...","review":"I have always been a big Ann Rice fan and have read most of her books. The tale of the body thief was an interesting tale where Lestat has the opportunity to become human by switching bodies with a human by astral projection. It sounds like the beginning of a fantastic journey, but unfortunately, I was disappointed. It just seemed like there was something missing in the story. There was lots of potential, but most of it was left untapped. I consider this the weakest of all the Vampire Chronicles series."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE STUPIDITY OF THIS BOOK IS AMAZING AND STRANGE","review":"First off, Lestat is dumber than paint in this book. \\"Duh...I'll give this crook superhuman strength and immortality and duh...he'll give it back to me for a little bit of cash.\\" Secondly, not only is Lestat dumb but the plot as well is getting out of hand. I mean, a BODYSNATCHER? really."},{"rating":"1","title":"a 1/3 worth reading","review":"I was told that this could be a stand alone book and was fairly good, because I never read Interview or the rest, but I tried it anyways, based on that it was stand alone and good. The stand alone was right. You didn't have to read the previous ones to pick this up and read it, whenever there was a reference to back story, it was explained. In full. Multiple times. This was my biggest problem with the book actually, the repeat re-read of details over and over just bored me to tears. Then there was the story. This was not good, if anything non-existant. A good editor could have carved this down to a 50 page story, it was mostly just lamenting over the past. I know that was the point of wanting to be human, but did it ever just drag on. Now I did like the perspective of how the vampire felt and his removal from society, and some of the longing for old ways was good, but there was JUST TOO MUCH OF IT!!! anyways, I can't say this was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe a little bit disappointing but it's a book to read","review":"The Chronicles of Vampire are really my favourite books. But I don't think that The Tale of the Body Thief is my favourite. I love it, of course, but the beginning is a little bit borring. I had some difficulties to enter in the story; even if after I devoured the rest of the book. What's more it may disappoint some readers because the story is not really in the line of the other Chronicles. My advice is to take the time to read it and don't give up in the first pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"At 4.5/5 stars, this book is a wonderful installment to the Vampire Chronicles. Aside the new tales of the vampires (Armand, Vittorio, Pandora), this is the last REALLY good book in the Vampire Chronicles. After the thrilling tale of the Queen of the Damned, this book provides a good continuation of Lestat's adventures. Put together (Interview, Lestat, Queen of the Damned, and this book), they make for a very solid tetralogy and represent Ms. Rice's best work.It's really too bad that after this she decided to concentrate more on religion with Memnoch the Devil. If she had written more books true to Lestat's original character with less religious twaddle, the rest of the Vampire Chronicles would have remained solid gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad","review":"This was not a bad book, but not that special either. I found the whole introduction to the Body Thief and who he was (the first half of the novel) rather unneccary,as the title and the summary already had made that clear. I liked the pages about sunlight, laughed during Lestat's first night as a human again, disliked Grethchen the Nun (but nevertheless cried at their seeing again when he's back a vampire), absolutely loved but also cried during the scene where he seeks help from Louis and Louis rejects him outrightly and you have Lestat crying in the rain, saying \\"I don't want to stay human, I don't want to save my soul\\". I really loved that part, and that's the whole fourth star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly bad","review":"I can't believe I still read this book, even after a friend told me not to bother. Rice gives WAY too much information on the workings of the human body, and Lestat having sex with a nun was just plain bad taste. The previous three works were classic, but this one should be left to collect dust on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and captivating","review":"This is the story of Lestat. The vampire Lestat made a deal to switch bodies with a man, but of course the man went back on the deal and never offered to switch back! This story is about the hunt to return Lestats soul to his body. His only real companion is David Talbot after the other immortals turn their backs on Lestat, forcing him to deal with his own mistakes. The power of Lestat is seen in both his spirit and body through out this master piece. But as always with Lestat, he doesnt learn the lesson, \\"be careful what you wish for.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms Rice should have stopped after 3 books","review":"This fourth volume of THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES is a real disappointment. After the seductive perfection of her original trilogy, Rice has taken Lestat (whom she is obviously besotted with) and jettisoned all the rest of the characters we came to know and love in the first three books. Also, the story takes the vampire legends way out into left field, with Lestat actually inhabiting a mortal's body. Interesting stuff, but Lestat on his own gets tiresome; I found myself hoping that Louis or Armand or Marius would show up. After a certain point, without the others as a buffer, Lestat becomes quite tedious and the book ends up being boring. Somehow this volume doesn't fit with the first three; Ms Rice should have left it as a trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"It's hard for me to believe that this book is in the same series as the other three books in this set. I don't know what happened when this book was penned, but it isn't even in the same class as the others as far as I am concerned. I spent much of the time I was reading this book bored out of my mind and wondering how the same author could have possibly written this.The characters didn't have much life, (even for the undead) and the descriptions over every little thing were just overkill. The main character came across as rather duncical and naive which was sad considering how exciting and determined he was in other books. I really can'the recommend this one, but the rest of the series is great and definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love the chronicle, I wouldn't skip this one.","review":"I'm about half way through, and just loving it. Very much enjoying David as a central focus. I am not finding much in the way of the criticisms that others have had of the book. Maybe their expectations were too high, as some of the other chronicles are just phenomenal. I DON\\"T recommend this one if you're just staring with these books. You should know the characters a bit first. But like I said, I wouldn't skip this one, and you couldn't pay me to stop reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tale of the Body Thief","review":"A homorous tale that keeps one amused as Lestat deals with the everyday challanges of being mortal. Again, Anne Rice does a wonderful job of spinning a tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Salatious, and Intoxicating","review":"Welcome back to the world of the vamipre Lestat! Years have passed since his rock-star-gig and he's yet to learn his lesson, this time falling into the \\"Angel\\" trap of allowing himself to switch bodies with a mortal. A criminal, sociopathic, body-stealing mortal. The Tale of the Body Thief is more than just Lestat's quest to return himself to his \\"graceful, eligant\\" body, but a tale of Faust-like philosophy; of how an angelic, atheistic nun can come to love a vampiric devil; of mortality, for all its ups and downs; and, most importantly, of Hamlet's eternal question, what it is like to be.If you're a fan of the series - especially of Interview with the Vampire and The Vampire Lestat, it's a must read. If you prefered Queen of the Damned for its world-reaching, apocolpyse-bringing narrative, why not skip ahead... for Memnoch the Devil awaits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rice","review":"Anne Rice is the best in Vampire Novels.

First of all, David Talbot gay!?, give us a break! Reading this new development in the Vampire Chronicles made me realise how much they are starting to have plots as ridiculous as Dallas. If we had been given hints in Queen of the Damned of his homosexual inclinations, well, then it would have been credible, but not this way, out of the blue. What next? Lestat and Talbot have a baby and call him Adonis?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason trilogies are effective","review":"This is where Anne Rice really started to lose me. I was never a huge fan of her work but i did enjoy the first three books in the series, especially Queen of the Damned. A bit too homoerotic and whistfully romantic for my tastes. Basically she's turning the series here into harlequin romance fodder, only with bisexual vampires instead of fabio-like characters. The best thing that can be said for this book is that it's not nearly as bad as the abyssmal Memnoch, one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and stupid","review":"The whole concept of stealing a body is interesting, but this jumbled hack-work was a major disappointment. The tradition of making boring living characters into boring vampires continues with the addition of David Talbot, who is about as intriguing and interesting as a gum-spot on the bottom of my shoe. These books used to be deep and metaphysical and brooding - with the thrust of Rice's work now with Lestat, they've degenerated into high adventure...what's next? An Indiana Jones vampire? And I thought portions of QUEEN OF THE DAMNED were a disappointment; I shouldn't even have picked this book up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is When","review":"Sadly, this novel and Taltos mark the point where Anne Rice \\"jumped the shark\\". \\"The Witching Hour\\" and \\"Queen of the Damned\\" were her last two good novels, and they were great.

The summary first intrigued me however when i read what happens when Lestat gives his body up for that of a human? It was very boring and was really a chore to plod through the pages. I barely finished it and had to rely on those bribed reviews to keep myself going! I don't know what it was, but I felt that within that book, there was something lacking and there wasn't any depth to the book, none at all. WOuld have been better if I was wise enough to borrow it from the library instead of spending my own money for it.

The fact that Louis said that he wouldn't make Lestat a vampire and that he would never give the Dark Gift to anyone must have taken guts. But then you should read Merrick... but oh well.

They were refreshing and new! That were exciting! That is, until this novel came out. The one pictures is a Knopf Canada first edition that I bought as soon as this novel was released. Unfortunately it was a mistake.I loved the first three novels in the Chronicles, but this one is radically different. It takes place in the present time which isn't too bad. Lestat, becomes human once again and has quite an adventure.I felt like I was reading a Superman novel. Lestat was relegated to superhero status whom had just swallowed Kryptonite and lost all his powers. The love scenes in the novel we all guys! Not my fetish, I'd prefer not to hear about how my once favorite vampire would secretly love to sleep with his friends.Lestat and this novel got so wishy washy that it was the last of the Anne Rice novels I ever read, and I loved Anne Rice's previous works!

My supervisor gave me his copies of \\"QoD\\" and \\"The Tale of the Vampire Thief\\" which I read first. From the moment I began reading The Vampire Thief, I knew I would thoroughly enjoy it.The emotional display Lestat went through, the banishment from those he loved, his talks with his beloved Claudia, and the near loss of his life made my heart weep. I cried when Lestat cried, I was angry when he was angry. I went on that rollercoaster ride with him.I have since read the first three of the chronicles and they all are amazing, but this book touched me so deeply that I am currently re-reading it for the third time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two friends find trout, nymphs and adventure in Portugal.","review":"I can't believe this book is out of print!

Fine if you're wearing a belt, but not so good if you're in shorts or sweats. In addition, the magnetic clasp has been replaced by Velcro. Cheaper to reproduce I'm sure, but Velcro is problematic in a lot of ways. Even so, Velcro is more secure, which is a concern if you're active. Still, there are some bonuses. First, it's a three-pack. Second, it fits the iPod Nano (mine is 2nd generation, 2GB) very nicely. Third, the design allows the screen to be protected and still give you access to the control wheel, even in the case.

Tom Cruise is great as Joel Goodsen, he projects the kind of innocence that I think a lot of us who grew up in the burbs in the 80's had. That time was kind of a throwback, although there was a little drug use such as the pot in the movie, I think the drug culture was not as big as in the mid 60's and 70's. AIDS had still not hit yet. Reagan was king and most kids were nice kids trying to do good in school, please their parents, and set themselves up for a productive future, as Joel in the movie. The story is good, although a little unbeleivable, as a small mistake Joel makes becomes a huge problem. Mainly it reminds me a lot of guys I went to high school with, the clothes we wore, having to ride a bike around instead of driving. All the stuff high school kids in the 80's did and had. It is a great movie and a classic from the era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teasing but Unfulfilling","review":"I am a great fan of Risky Business, but this edition is pretty disappointing. The picture quality and sound are fine, but you'd think with the advent of Blu-Ray and all of its storage capacity, that they could have actually spliced the director's cut last scene onto the movie! Instead, you have to watch the scene on its own, so it's impossible to tell how it really flows with the film.Also, I'd love to watch the commentary, but I refuse to watch it picture-in-picture, which is really distracting. Once again, where is the option to turn off the picture-in-picture?I'd love to buy Blu-Ray, bit it seems that you really need to wait and buy discs that take full advantage of the medium...otherwise it's a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Youthful curiosity releases inner corruption, and many new life lessons","review":"Risky Business is a Tom Cruise classic film, which has a narrative that focuses on young men looking for thrills, as they approach adulthood.

There's a cute car chase and a nice scene with Dad's Porsche going into Lake Michigan but much of the rest is slightly yucky. This movie came out when the big AIDS explosion was taking place -- but you'd never guess from watching this. Some of the interplay between Cruise and his parents recalls The Graduate but without the bite of that classic. There is also a character called Guido, a mafiosi type who seems like an incredibly gentle gangster to audiences that have become familiar with the brutality of The Sopranos.

The film starts promisingly, then plummets to absurd depths. Not as bad as \\"View to a Kill,\\" but pretty close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad, considering...","review":"This could have been a lot worse. It must be understood that Ian Fleming died while writing the novel, and the publishing company finished it. The book was very weak as a result, so the writers had to come up with something fresh. The result is not all that memorable, though Christopher Lee makes a decent villain as always. Herve Villechaize is Lee's sidekick, and is probably the best thing in the film. Plot-wise, Bond learns there is a contract taken out on him, while he has to find a solar-energy disk of some sort. Moore still looks a little uncomfortable and confused about what Bond is supposed to be like. He gets it right in the next film, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst?","review":"In its day, this was considered the worst Bond movie of all time.

Maybe not as action-packed and exciting as his previous \\"Live And Let Die\\", but still quite clever and interesting! Christopher Lee plays as the villian, Francisco Scaramanga, an expert assassin who's out to kill Bond. His weapon: A gold-made pistol. ONE SHOT AND IT'S LIGHTS OUT! But that's not his only intention. Scaramanga will stop at nothing to retrieve the priceless Solex Agitator energy converter, which absorbs power from the sun!With the help of a Hong Kong friend, the beautiful Miss Goodnight, and the return of the funny Louisiana sheriff, D.W.

A BIG NO!!!!!, not even Christopher Lee could save this movie. Bond has been targeted by an assassin who uses a golden gun, but wait he's stolen the solex agitator energy converter. So Bond must go after him, this movie bogs itself down. From being imprisoned in a karate school, then trying to escape using the \\"Judo chop\\". An inside joke, to Bond and Scaramanga scareing off in a duel of pistols in a fun house. This movie is better than Moonraker, but not by much, I consider this one and Moonraker to be Moore's worst outings as Bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Lousy. Not as bad as View to A Kill or Moonraker","review":"Tired and old, and it was only Roger Moore's second outing as Bond.

This movie ranks third as the most awful in the series, behind View to a Kill and Moonraker."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"This is by far the worst entry in the series.

Otherwise absolutlely terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BOND WILL BE BOND","review":"Let's face it, you don't watch James Bond movies to be moved to cinematic awe. James Bond movies are Saturday Morning cartoons...........for adults. This is one of the better all around entertaining ones. There are laughs, beautiful women, an interesting villan, who, for once, is not after world domination, pretty decent stunts, fun gagets and gorgeous locations. For as improbable some of the escapes are and absurd some of the scenarios are, the movie is just plain good escapism. Knick-Knack is the most clever side-kick since Odd-Job and GoodNight supplies both eye-candy and brainless stunts to fill incredible holes in reality, sprinkled liberally throughout the movie. None-the-less, it's a fun escape for a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"great movie, has all of the bond stuff you want in a movie, and more CLASSIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! one of the best bond 's of all time"},{"rating":"2","title":"The man with the golden gun (special edition)","review":"James bond movies are not great movies, but good entertainment. I like when comedy is associated with this kind of movies.

A Very thin plot. And what is this ? Frustrated with the situation 'M' asks 'Q' to shut up and 'Q' lets 'M' go without a return remark. A truly hilarious moment is when Bond does a one-kick knockout during a Martial Arts fight. Nick Nack is very annoyable most of the times. Christopher Lee could not give right justice to the character of Fransisco Scaramanga. He was never that chilling. The broken bridge jump was good but was ruined by the terrible Sound effect. The Golden Gun which could be folded into a lighter was a good weapon , a perfect match to the Walther PPK though. The giant maze created by Scaramanga is quite good but there's nothing in this movie which can be enjoyed by a Bond fan. Neither there is enough suspense nor there is enough action. Don't bother if you haven't bought or rented this one. You can consider yourself lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"the man with the golden movie","review":"i disagree with most of the reviews by customers,they say it's one of the worst bond films ever.i love this movie.roger moores second try at bond he really didn't work for the role.he's the yellow belly bond.the movies good..knick knack is an unforgettable character.the plot great.christopher lee -scaramanga was cousins with ian fleming who wrote the novel and all of the james bond novels.this movie is solid gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the Best Bond Film Ever","review":"This could very well be the best Bond film ever.

I contacted MGM and they said it was a problem with compatibility between the DVD and some RCA models. Doesn't explain why my PC wouldn't run it correctly, but does explain why it was fine in a friend's Panasonic unit that I tried it in while troubleshooting. You would think that MGM online tech support would give a better answer than \\"it doesn't work with some RCA players.

This film shows us what an evil Bond would look like. Scaramanga is a darker version of Bond himself. His talents are equal to Bond's, and the last duel between Scaramanga and Bond is quite thrilling. Roger Moore and Christopher Lee give great performances. Outside of the worst Bond Girl(Mary Goodnight), this is a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond no.9","review":"Roger Moore's second outing as the debionare Jame Bond falls far short of the classic Bond films that fans have come to love, with Man with the Golden Gun being one of the weakest in the franchise. The film does have some good points; some good action scenes, impressive locations and Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. But the car chases and other action set-pieces feel laboured and not up to par with the extravegant likes of Diamonds are Forever (1971) or Live and Let Die (1973). Still, it's Bond, and fans love it. The more discerning however will no doubt pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"007 Fires Blanks","review":"Redneck comic relief, lackluster villains and a title song by Lulu! This is James Bond? \\"The Man With the Golden Gun\\" (1974) remains one of the dullest 007 adventures, with Roger Moore as a lightweight Bond. There is a terrific car stunt, but that's about it. Not surprisingly, this was the least successful 007 film in terms of box-office earnings."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intensely Groovy Theatre of The Bizzare","review":"Folks, listen to me: This is the best Bond movie ever made, and Roger Moore is the best Bond. You can argue, but chew on this, Admiral Skeptic: Name one movie that Sean Connery made that had a midget, a flying car, a giant laser, and Bond threatening to blow a man's genitals off with a rifle. That's right; there aren't any. Checkmate, Connery.This film is a brilliantly surreal entry into the Bond series. It's a clear departure from Connery's films, where he had to stop the KGB from destroying the world. Moore is called in to stop an overpaid hitman and his midget from selling solar power to the UN (or something similar.) Adapted as I am for describing awesomeness, I can't begin to describe this film's grovvy factor, but I can tell you it's somewhere between ChocoTacos and regular tacos."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film was waiting to (...).......no Moore!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love James Bond films but I was not enthusiastic about The Man with The Golden Gun. The film centers around Scaramanga, a hit man who uses million dollar bullets to kill his enemies. The script needed work and I found there to be very little fight scenes in this film. Goodnight, Bond's female companion, represented absolute stupidity like the script, especially during the closet scene. The golden gun looked like a piece of cardboard sprayed with golden spraypaint and the car scene,....well I need not say anymore. Roger Moore in my opinion lacks the smoothness and coolness of Sean Connery. What happened to the dry martini..shaken not stirred? If you like cheesy kung - fu scenes, rednecks in rivers, naive women, grown men suckering young boys and Fantasy Island's \\"Tattoo\\" all bundled into unforgettable package of nonsense, then this is a must see movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really fun movie.","review":"It is probably the worst of the Bond movies, but The Man With The Golden Gun isn't bad. Its fun to see the stunts and Christopher Lee is probably the best bad guy in the entire series. This is the cult favorite of series, but in my opinion it doesn't compare to Goldfinger or OHMSS. Its still great though and worth a couple of watchings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, there is a defect, but....","review":"As many of you know, the DVD is defective starting at Chapter 21, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't buy this DVD.What the defect appears to be is simply bad encoding: the colors scramble, the audio becomes skippy and garbled.PS2 can recover from the defect with nothing more than a slight hesitation where the defect first occurs. My DVD-ROM on my computer recovered from the defect after about 1 minute of play time, but my stand-alone DVD player never recovered, leaving the rest of the movie messed-up and totally worthless.I hope this will help someone who wants the movie but has heard about the defect. It really depends on the ability of your DVD player/software as to how bad the defect will come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Golden Bomb","review":"This film is a turkey. Plain and simple. I made the mistake of reading the book first, then seeing this movie. First of all: the Bond girls. First there is Mary Goodnight. Though a strong character in the book, she is a buffoon in the movie. She spends a lot of time scantly clad or trapped in a closet or the trunk of a car. At least she's pretty. Then there's Andrea Anders. She's not as pretty, but at least defend herself. However, she gives Bond some info about Scaramanga, and is bumped off. Another thing: the title character. Christopher Lee's Scaramanga just doesn't seem threatening, and at some points, we pity him. Nick Nack (a miniature Oddjob) steals the show. Even the 360-Degree car jump, the best stunt in the film, is ruined with a slide whistle-like sound effect. (Jeers for bringing back J.W. Pepper.) I do give the makers of this movie credit for one thing: they recovered from this dud and made \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\", one of the best in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden Dud","review":"The DVD version - or least the two seperate copies that I have come across - have some sort of encryption error from the middle of Scene 21 onwards to the end (right where Bond drives through the car dealership's showroom window in the AMC Hornet).The video on the DVD appears blank black and the the audio track is severely clipped.I do not know if this applies to all copies made, but it certain does to the both that I have tried to view. I have tried to contact MGM as well to no avail to see if they can replace these badly-pressed DVDs. An awful Bond movie made worse by the fact that I cannot actually watch it... you have been warned!ADDED LATER - MGM eventually issued replacement copies if you contacted them through their website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Bond Film, But Great DVD","review":"\\"The Man With The Golden Gun\\" is the worst film in the James Bond series. Its characters are weak, its humor, corny, and the production values are simply bellow Bond standards. The main problem with it is that the story is uninteresting. Even though the villainous title character (Christopher Lee) is one of the few genuine attractions, everything around him seems to be out of place, or just plain ludicrous. It's a shame that the few good bits get ruined by something uninspired. The amazing car stunt over the bridge is scored badly, John Barry's music is only good in parts, and Maud Adams, a beautiful and interesting character, gets killed off just when we start to like her. However, I should point out that the DVD for the film is very well made and includes two very interesting documentaries: one on the making of the film, the other on the stuntmen behind the film series. Add two stars just for the DVD bonuses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and in perfect condition","review":"I ordered The Man With The Golden Gun on blu ray, and the shipment came in quickly and in perfect condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time of revenge !","review":"The man with golden gun may be - if you want - the most enigmatic film among the entire saga of Moore as 007. This time the film focuses around a personal revenge who shows us the unforgettable Christopher Lee as Scaramanga, the best villain after Connery \`s entries. Despite the film is quite static, there is the second sensible homage to The Lady of Shanghai in the hall of the mirrors where the climax of the film happens (The other one was Enter the dragon, just one year ago).Entertained and very funny sequences obeyed the necessity to make a visible demarcation respect the previous entries that twisted seriously the character of Bond, James Bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with xbox dvd playback kit","review":"Do not get this if all you got for a dvd player is an xbox dvd playback kit.

At least when I first saw it, I was not disappointed. Moore showed some real nastiness and menace in this film to get info on Scaramanga. Great score by Barry, although I don't really care about the song or the titles. Also very funny in bits. Britt Ekland is suitable comedic in her bumbling dumb blonde role, and so is Herve Villachaize as a miniature Oddjob. The end of the film in which we are shown Nick Nack's fate had me in stitches.

It featured Hollywood Native American favorite Graham Greene, so she figured we might like it. What we got were some of the best laughs ever elicited from a bad movie. The coming of age ceremony was the best, and to this day my brother and I still make fun of the line, \\"With the blessings of the spirits, you are now a man.\\" Maybe kids 8 and under haven't fully developed a sense of irony and sarcasm to realize what a gem of a bad movie this truly is, but anyone in their teenage years will appreciate it for a true stinker to be ridiculed after the manner of Battlefield Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't lose out watch Lost in the Barrens","review":"This is good family entertainment for older children. A very well done production, that shows courage, fortitude and growing friendship.Two boys face the challenges of being lost on a frozen waste of northern Canada. There is also the challenge of cross culture adjustment, not only between the white boy and native american boy, but of the white boy facing a whole new living standard when he must leave his boarding school and move in with his uncle, who lives in the canadian wilderness. There is plenty of tension and suspense, as well as many redeeming scenes of valor and fortitude.Lost in the Barrens"},{"rating":"1","title":"i didnt like the movie","review":"i Thought the movie left out alot of detail from the book. i would recommend if you wanted to know the story you should read the novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost, yet you'll find something worthy.","review":"This DVD was recommended to me by a friend.

I have snag through many, many, different mics from standard dymanics to high end condensors, and this is as good as it gets. I'm not going to say this is better than a Shure KSM9 or a neumann kms105, but it is every bit as good, and less than half the price. If you are buying one of those its for the vanity and then name. Also rode customer service is GREAT.They actually quickly help you solve any issue, or just give advice on use, or anything you need. Try and contact shure... thier customer service is just another way to suck more money from you. Also Rode gives 10 year warranties on thier mics, lets see shure or neumann do that!!

Some excellent animation to show what is out there but you may notice that the scientists say different numbers when speaking about the \\"facts\\"!As a University educated science major I found not enough new material but for kids or lay people this could be a very interesting leap into the theories going around. Starting with the Big Bang theory was a mistake I think as it has all but totally been abandoned. The \\"Law\\" of \\"conservation of energy\\" dictates that you can not get something from nothing!

All eight episodes are mind-blowing and have changed my perspective on life, the universe and everything. The ONLY thing that is bad is the sound quality.

The reader from Pacific NW really missed the point of the whole book. It's not to be read as a manual, but rather a light hearted (tongue-in-cheek) book that certainly offers good advice on a subject most of us are interested in, but also keeps you amused along the way.

But a quick skim had me smiling. Imagine instructions to make out a hammock (delicately of course), to keep your sleeping bag dry, and some erogenous games to play in the \\"woods\\", even if that means your own backyard. Guess it makes for a pretty fun gift for \\"back to nature\\" friends and as such it's a good laugh. Don't expect to end up becoming Fabio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly enjoyable read","review":"A friend told me about this book. It manages to be both interesting and informative and provides a wealth of useful information--like the ABCs of romantic dining al fresco, what to pack in your safe sex first aid kit, and how to protect yourself from bugs without poisoning your partner--while keeping the tone lighthearted and sexy. Can't wait to try out some of this stuff on my next camping trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Arcade Fun","review":"Typically, when I view Rally races on TV, it's all about the single lane dirt paths (I hesitate to call them tracks), tight turns, and dense foliage. CMR2 has wider paths and friendlier tracks than I've seen on TV. Don't get me wrong, the combination of the physics (don't roll your car in a corner!), sense of speed, and the animation of the car & the suspension as it traverses an undulating track, this is a must buy. Much like the first, the experience gets better and better the more you play, which says a lot considering the rush you get playing it for the first time. I've read there's other games that capture more of the \\"simulation\\" part of Rallying, but if you're just a fan of racing and you'd love go to sliding around gravel corners at 70 MPH, pick this game up."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This game is a brilliant game. If you like racing games you will love this. Even if your not a big fan of racing games you will love this game. The amount of tracks is truely amazing, even though there is a lot of them every single one of them is very good. The graphics are great, its very realistic. You will be stuck playing this game for hours on end. The only bad bit about it is when your not playing it your not very happy. It truely is amazing. A must Buy! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"This is one of those movies that you're either \\"all in\\" or \\"fold before the flop.\\" As a big fan of Bruce Willis and his early work on Moonlighting, this movie has a really lighthearted theme for anybody who can suspend disbelief and just love the smarta## comedy of people who go with the flow. Anybody who is too serious won't like this movie, but those who can relax will love the surreal ride. I love it, and have for several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boom! Side by Side!

It is still a laughable goofy movie. For those of you that are a bit more high brow with your humor, this probably isn't for you. Everything is totally unrealistic, but if you can let yourself go and just laugh, you are in for a enjoyable time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Past It's Sell By Date","review":"Well, where do I start? Bruce Willis was great in Moonlighting and Die Hard, Andie MacDowell was great in a number of films: Four Weddings and a Funeral, Green Card, Ground Hog Day and others.Unfortunately, Hudson Hawk was thoroughly disappointing. Some 21 years since it's release and the film's story line, writing and acting has not aged well. Bruce comes off as a buffoon who can't act and the story line is just plain awful.Truly one of the worst films I've watched in ages.If you're trying to decide if this movie is for you, at least borrow it from your local library. I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch this. Better yet, go for a walk, you'll get much more satisfaction from a stroll in the sunshine instead of watching this travesty of acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt play!","review":"Well I like this movie I had seen it a while back but this one is for another country! It will not play on US dvd players! Wasted my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some fun scenes, but needs a MAJOR revision.","review":"Hudson Hawk....Hmm...Where to start? This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'll admit that while it's bad, there are a few entertaining aspects of it. I especially liked the scenes where Willis had to deal with a bunch of agents codenamed after candybars. But seriously, the movie never gets funny, original, or action-packed enough to the point of paying eight bucks to see it. Predictable, stupid, and utterly lame, ( the running joke is that Willis has been in jail so long, he doesn't know what Nintendo is) Hudson Hawk only deserves to be seen on television when reruns of Seinfeld or Cheers isn't on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and Original","review":"An enjoyable cast of brilliant actors come together is this almost surreal, yet well-made comedy. The critics gave it bad reviews, most likely due to the fact that nothing in this movie would ACTUALLY happen. Those critics are the same people who shouted out \\"ya right\\" when ET made the bikes fly to safety. The comedic acting is genuine and sincere, adding a hint of depth to each character, keeping you in the action, and allowing you to even identify with each character. I found the movie extremely refreshing, entertaining, and funny! A 'must own' for me! BTW: The reason they are singing is to keep track of time when they have to split up."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU CAN SEE THE JOKES COMING A MILE AWAY ZZZzzzzzzzzZZzzzzz!","review":"My friend felt I needed to see this film, so he lent it to me. I had never seen it before and after 15 minutes I was telling my wife who was watching with me, what was about to happen next. The jokes are so old and tired I couldn't believe they were using them! I would rather watch the Three Stooges(Not that there is anything wrong with that!)At least the Stooges are really old classic shorts that were making history. The comparison to the Stooges is that the jokes in this movies are as old as the jokes in the Stooges shorts. This movie just isn't very good and isn't very funny unless you think a person slipping on a banana peel or a pie in the face is funny?...HEE HEE HEE HAW HAW!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Terrible\\"","review":"This movie, if not the worst movie I have ever seen, is right up there.

I'm sure there are certain people that like this, but I just thought it was totally silly and not any good. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny...","review":"Funny! Not the movie, but the fact that one reviewer insinuated that Bruce Willis himself should have written most of the positive reviews of this movie! Actually, Bruce Willis once said during an interview that he regretted ever participating in this lousy movie but that he just couldn't be choosy at the time. You must smile at the fact that so many reviewers found it worth 4-5 stars.Watch \\"The Whole Nine Yards\\" for a jazzy flick with Bruce or \\"City Hall\\" for serious movie with a few nice old songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leftover 80's action comedy reject! Blech!","review":"Only Bruce Willis could come up with such a self indulgent talewhere he gets to sing. In fact the \\"singing thieves\\"bit is in fact the best part of the movie. The story is a mess, the characters are forgettable, the performances are ridiculous.One might think they were GOING for laughs and absurdity here but that's not exactly the case as at every other turn they try to dazzle us with action and effects sequences. (explosions that go boom. whee.)It isn't funny. None of the over the top performances are funny. The plot has enough loopholes to make you think that the script was written by an 80's sitcom writer, and all of it smacks as bits left over from Willis' Moonlighting days. Thank God he eventually learned how to act three years later with Pulp Fiction. The only interesting thing about this movie other than the timed singing bit is that a very young David Caruso is in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This turkey flew the coop!","review":"The movie attempted to be cute, funny, and witty. It was a dismal and abyssmal failure. The best part of the entire film was the ending credits. I don't know how desperate Bruce Willis was when he made this film, but I'm certain that he now has night sweats dreaming about his involvement in this turkey.

The action and plot in this is use to make fun of todays typical action films. The poor admiration this generated when released was to the fact that people were expecting Die Hard 3. I Think anyone with a good sence of humor should take a look at Hudson Hawk."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I fast-forwarded through 20 minutes of this movie just to get to the end and see what happened. My curiosity was not rewarded. My thought was, \\"What a stupid movie.\\" It's two redeeming factors are the location (Italy) and the fabulous music used to time the robberies. Other than that, it was crass, shallow, and a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a criminal waste of money sober","review":"Just because I don't understand a film doesn't necessarily make it bad. But not understanding the point of Hudson Hawk (HH) at all doesn't make it a good film either. HH is a serious waste of resources and acting talent and not a traditional movie in terms of direction, plot or effect. In fact HH is at best a work in progress looking for all of the factors that comprise a true movie. Only die hard fans and the movies so bad its good brigade, will endorse HH. For the rest its slow torture and unsurprising that no follow up HH2/3 ensued or is ever likely to. Shame! HH is one movie I saw on release that forced me to leave the cinema well before the end. Be warned HH is a criminal waste of money sober and unless you have the required intake of alcohol to connect with this ridiculous farce - you the audience will feel the biggest fool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, just misunderstood!","review":"I was walking with two friends, one of whom really enjoyed this film (as I did) and one of whom disliked it intensely. The friend who disliked the film said to the two of us, \\"I'm sorry, but you can't build a whole movie on Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello wisecracking with each other.\\" We looked at him in disbelief and said, in unison, \\"YES you can!!!\\"That pretty well sums up the Hudson Hawk experience. If you go into it expecting a typical Bruce Willis film, you'll be disappointed. It's a fast-paced film full of bizarre humor and great lines and scenes. The closest comparison I can draw would be if you were to mix up the \\"Taming of the Shrew\\" episode of Moonlighting and a 60s action film. The dialog is quick-paced, and there's *nothing* in the film which isn't a joke. If you're looking for a serious or sane film, look elsewhere. But one way or the other, if you've ever wanted to really laugh at Bruce Willis, this is the film to do it in. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"do yourself a favor and BUY THIS!!!!!!","review":"Like a lot of people, I hated this movie until i actually watched it. My wife and i quote it all the time. They really acheived what they were after. I for one do not believe it was marketed properly when it was in theaters and therefore no one liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie but not exactly as I remember it.","review":"When I first saw this movie I interpreted it to be a straight up action/adventure movie. Not seeing the movie in over 20 years this interpretation is how I remembered it. I watched the movie recently and it was completely different from my memory. Not a bad film but I completely forgot about the comedy aspect of it and how it wasn't really a serious action/adventure piece in the style of the Die Hard series."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and irreverent with a side of the surreal","review":"I love this movie. I don't care who knows it. I think I understand why some people didn't get it - I once found it in a video store in the \\"Drama\\" section. And I admit it probably takes more than one viewing to really be able to follow along - especially some of the stranger scene cuts. But it's funny. Really funny. Sure it's over the top, but that's the point. It's imminently quotable, and the special effects and action are actually quite good. But the viewer has to go in expecting a surreal farce. Otherwise, of course they'll be disappointed. Everyone I've ever introduced Hudson Hawk to has thoroughly enjoyed the watching. In fact, I feel a little sorry for anyone who didn't get it when they saw it; they're truly missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you say \\"guilty pleasure?\\"","review":"There plenty of movies that I consider guilty pleasures. There's the Ernest P. Worrell movies, there's the first Mortal Kombat movie, there's the '76 King Kong remake.....and there's this.Hudson Hawk was critically panned at the time of its release, and soon it won three Razzies: Worst Director, Screenplay, and Picture of 1991. It's been neglected ever since people called it one of the worst movies ever made. But IS it one of the worst movies ever made? Well, compared to most movies that have been released in the new millennium (like Catwoman and Alone in the Dark), it shouldn't be. Yes, it's stupid. Yes, it's over the top. But hey, that's why I love it. I love the ridiculous humor, and I love the action. It does hold up pretty well, in my opinion. I respect critics' opinions about this movie, but personally, I can't help but enjoy it from beginning to end. This is one guilty pleasure that I will NEVER forget!Grade: B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous irreverent fun!","review":"Hudson Hawk is a cult classic full of over-the-top antics and truly irreverent tongue-in-cheek humor.

It was specific and well-defined and it's name was \\"Die Hard Movies.\\" Inside the niche he could do no wrong, but this success started him thinking he could do anything and succeed at anything because he was just so darned talented and charming. And Hollywood tends to indulge its successful stars and that's how we wind up in movie theaters with our mouths agape and thinking \\"Oh no! It's not a dream; this is real and there's nothing I can do about it.\\" When Bruce Willis needed a friend, someone at the studio to sit him down and say \\"Bruce, this script is a dog. Only one thing comes from dogs and that's exactly what the movie will be. Back away from this script and take a trip to Maui until your next Die Hard movie.\\" But, sadly, no one did say those things and be that friend to Mr. Willis. And we're stuck with the memory of this piece of dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of worst films of the last 25 years","review":"This is a stunningly awful movie. I went to see it when it first came out, and is one of only a handful of films that I walked out on. It's hard to believe the number of 4 and 5 star reviews of this film posted. This illustrates a problem with the reviews of DVDs on Amazon -- that basically only people that already like the movie are going to buy the DVD and review it.

I liken it to movies like Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Kuffs; they move quickly from scene to goofy scene with only a loose plot-line and one-liners to tie them together.If you're looking for a Oscar award-winning movie that redefines human nature and brings us all together into one peaceful nation, this is NOT it.

Sadly they are not. I had bought a JC Penny Cooks set about 5 years or so ago and the lids fit all the frying pans -- I really though this one would do the same. The frying pans are all shallower than what I am accustomed to as well. I am happy with the set, but must remove one start for incompatible lids for the frying pans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookin' Up a Storm","review":"My T-Fal 10-piece nonstick is great addition to my kitchen.

My roommate has managed to put a few scratched in the bottom of a few so they are not indestructible but, on the other hand, he is a bit careless.

I've had sets from Wal-Mart that lasted longer albeit they were a bit thinner but the nonstick coating held up better on those than on these. I don't like how bulky the handles are on the dutch oven, they take up a lot of room (width) in my dishwasher. Not to mention the scoop style handles are super weird. I was just hoping that although these are inexpensive they'd be a step up from buying the cheapest crap wal-mart sells but realistically they weren't any better at all. In fact the pots and pans these were to replace are still in my posession and heat more easily than these ones do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best set of pots I own","review":"Durability, style and guarantee is what this product really offers!

Oh well...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I bought this set for less than 5 dollars more (including taxes) than the price being asked here, at a local Walmart store. It looks and feel well built but the finish is not perfect; there is a spot of silver paint near the venting hole of one of the glass lids and one of the metal tabs on the steamer fell off. Other than that this set looks solid. Only time will tell if it is durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad luck with this set","review":"I don't know if I got a set that wasn't properly coated or what. Based on other reviews I thought this would be good cookware. I used the fry pan twice and the non-stick coating was extremely scratched and the coating coming off in several spots. I did not abuse it, I have a cheap [$$$] set of Mirro cookware I have used over 15 years before the coating finally started to come off. I sent this set back without bothering to try any of the other pans in the set. Very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pans chip after 2 weeks of use.","review":"I really wanted to like this set but I ended up returning it for a $120 stainless steel (and harder to clean) set that didn't scratch leaving teflon in my food.

But the inside does wear off and now I wonder how safe they actually are and how much of the wearing off stuff gets in your blood stream. I dropped the one pot and it dented really bad. Next time I will use stainless steel. Feel safer with that. I wont by this product again.JJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not last","review":"I've owned two sets of t-fal cookware and both had to be replaced after two years of use. The non stick surface will wear away with regular use. I'm currently looking into investing in cookware that will last a life time, such as cast iron. It may cost more, but over time, will save money because it will not need to be replaced every few years. If you want something that will last, do not buy t-fal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Those 3 covers sitting on the pots shown in the picture DON NOT FIT the 3 pans shown in the picture. First time EVER I have encountered this problem. RIP OFF AT ANY PRICE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item for cost.","review":"This is most assuredly NOT the T-Fal I grew up with and using. That said it is a good starter set and the vented lids are a plus for sure. I wish the frying pans had them as well though. The weight is relatively light and they came out of the box misshapen even without the box being crushed or damaged in any way. You CAN shape them back simply by habd, (indicating again that light weight to them). I have used them and washed them all several times and they are good even heaters with a great \\"slide\\" to them with things like pancackes, eggs and even melted cheese. A good value overall thus far, but spend a few extra dollars if looking for something in the more long term category."},{"rating":"1","title":"T-Fal Initiatives 10-Piece Nonstick Inside and Out","review":"I thought these were going to be a great replacement for an old mis-matched set of t-fal I had gotten from a storage auction. I received them quickly but didn't open them until months later since we were going to be moving overseas and I wanted to use the new pots and pans at our new house. I was disappointed to see the \\"red dot\\" was gone and that instead of a smooth bottom these have grooves on the bottom. They work terrible on our stove here in Germany (they have the smooth top kind). Luckily I had saved a few of the pots and pans from the old set so I've been able to go back to those but I was really disappointed with this set. It was not was I was expecting at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I'm always leery of buying certain things online when you can't see the quality of manufacture first. Cookware is one of them. I thought with t-fals name and the price that this stuff would be pretty good. It's not. This is low end walmart ware or even nearly dollar store quality stuff. All the pans are very light with thin bottoms. I don't expect it to last a year. junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, not the highest quality","review":"Well worth the price, got a couple scratches from using a metal spatchula.

And they are absolutely wonderful. I love that they are non-stick inside and out. They are light weight but very durable. I bought these because my last set of T-Fal pots and Pans I bought over 20 years ago needed replacement with some pieces. In the past I bought miscellaneous replacement pans, but they would only last a year or two, nothing stood up to my T-Fal set. I am very happy with my new set and I'm sure these will last 20+ years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set","review":"I really love my T-Fal set and am looking forward to purchasing more items from this line, my only complaint about them is that the teflon seems to scratch away pretty easy - but a quick fix for that is dont let your husband eat out of the pan with a metal utensil :) The pans cook great and I just love the way they are made - one little piece of advice: hand wash these if you want them to keep thier color. Putting them in the dishwasher will make them turn grey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best brand for non-stick!","review":"My first purchase from the T-Fal line was the breakfast griddle and BBQ skillet in one, which I absolutely love. I was not even using my pots anymore, unless I had to, due to the difficulty in cleaning them. I decided to purchase a new set. After reading the reviews of the T-fal pots and my previous purchase I was very eager to purchase them again. I purchased the initiatives set since it came with one more skillet and I really did not see a major difference between the other sets. Let me say that it is the best set of pots ever. They are so easy to clean and the food always comes out wonderful. Also, I love the little steam vents that they come with on the lids, now nothing ever boils over. I personally feel that T-Fal is the best in the non-stick department and would recommend them in a heartbeat if you need to purchase anything non-stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lids are terrible","review":"No complaints about the saute or sauce pans, the lid design is terrible. Aside from the fact that the sealing mechanism doesn't seal properly, the whole setup is so flimsy one of my lids is completely unusable. My recommendation, is to avoid this set and look for a set with less fancy and more sturdy lids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set","review":"I've had these for a few years and they are great. The non-stick is not as non-sticky anymore, but that's mostly due to the beating I placed on them. These are highly recommended for the price, and I'd buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it..","review":"This product are awesome.. I just wish I bought the bigger sizes..Next time I will.

I would never buy any other brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good a bargain as it would seem","review":"This set seemed like a great deal until the knob for the lid of the dutch oven broke off and T-Fal refused to replace it, even at my expense. T-Fal \\"customer service\\" suggested I go to home depot and purchase a metal knob for a cabinet to use in it's place. Not a great substitute.I will NEVER purchase pots from T-Fal again. They don't value their loyal customers and they don't stand behind their products"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Price, Needs More Lids","review":"The only thing I wish this set had was better interchangable lids. The price was a steal on Gold Box Day. I was hoping they would be along the lines of my Calphalon, but are not nearly as heavy or durable. These are a great starter set for a Wedding Gift or Graduation Gift. They should last 5-10 yrs if cared for properly.

There's something for everyone and every musical taste on this album. Its so great to hear such fantastic music from a group of relative \\"unknowns.\\" At this rate, they won't be unknown for long. Their songs are fresh, enjoyable and definitely something new for this millenium.

If you care about the direction popular music should be taking, do yourself a favor and get this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic,stupid, ridiculous, and inane","review":"If there was ever a stupid and idiotic idea for a movie, this is it. Any kind of aliens from any planet invading any place would make more sense than this movie. The only redeeming feature is Brando's performance, which in the context of the plot, writing, and other performances, is a miracle.This movie idea and script is straight out of the trash. A five year old kid could write a better script. Each and every executive who ok'ed this movie should be fired and never work again in film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inventive, original and funny","review":"It's rare that a Hollywood comedy is truly original, but this one manages forthe great majority of the time.Terrific supporting performances throughout (especially by Paul Benedict,and the complexly off-the-wall Maximllian Schell), and Brando is brilliantenough that he can somehow pull off a simultaneous outrageous self-parody,while still getting us to take the character seriously enough to follow thestory and even like the guy.And Matthew Broderick, always solid, deserves kudos for not getting blownoff the screen by Brando's much bigger than life charisma.This is full of odd and inventive moments, and while the ending is a bit pat,for most of it's length it's joyfully completely unpredictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of shipping and handleing prices","review":"The product was very good. However I didn't think the shipping and handleing was marked clear enough, it should be stated before you even get to the final part. When I tried to cancel my order, after I relized the gum would be $8, I was unable to cancel it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm a big James Woods fan and came across this movie here. I have never heard of it and it is not available at any of the video stores in my area. So I ordered it because of all the positive reviews here, but wound up turning it off in the middle. It was real long, uninteresting, and was taking too long for anything to happen. If you haven't seen this movie before, I would recommend you not buy this yet, like I did. Try checking out \\"Indictment\\" or \\"Dirty Pictures\\", two of Woods's best movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"True believer","review":"another of those non-mainstream James Woods movies that turns out to be the one you remember forever. I honestly don't know how Woods can get so much emotion into a character.This is probably his greatest work (with Diggstown right there) and you will be able to experience his characters Frustration, pain, and relief right along side him. A touch of humor to lighten but mostly the best dramatic court scenes and flat out grit will have you recommending this to strangers on the street."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites Ever!","review":"Keeping this short...\\"True Believer\\" is a film that my husband and I watch at least twice a year, and never get tired of! It's a superb combination of murder mystery, courtroom drama, and redemption story. Clever, quick-moving, superbly acted (with a dazzling performance from James Woods at the center), and full of delicious witty surprises, like the wonderful character of \\"Cecil (He likes it pronounced See-Sill) Skell\\", the much-needed witness who can re-open an old murder case, but who resides in a mental institution, and is convinced that the Telephone Company killed President Kennedy. A wonderful movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortrac Review","review":"I had one just like it that work great for six years.

The Comfortrac relieves all my cervical symptoms."},{"rating":"1","title":"City of Angels was way better!","review":"Save your $3.50 DVD rental fee. If you're looking for a movie that will make you feel like City of Angels made you feel, look elsewhere! Sorry, my vote is for Hollywood. The director of Wings admits that there was no script before shooting began. The extras that came with the Wings DVD, interviews and info on Berlin, were more entertaining than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"They always have been here.","review":"Whether or not you believe in angels, this is a view you should like. \\"Wings of Desire\\" (or \\"Angels over Berlin\\" in the German release) looks at angels in a way that feel right. They have always been here, even before \`time'. They view and record all things that happen and try to understand humans. There are many, but we focus in on two. They try (sometimes with limited success) to help people who need a little boast, but can not directly interact.. they cannot move or change anything that is solid. And, sad to say, they only see in black and white. So when one angel yearns to touch, to feel, to taste coffee, he looses his immortality and is brought into the real world. The divided city of Berlin serves as the backdrop for the separation of humans and angels.... And it is into the no-man land between the walls that he crosses over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing fantasy","review":"In director Wim Wenders' universe, we are all observed by silent, eternal angels who are invisible to all but children. They wander through the world like ghosts, privy to our thoughts but unable to participate in the world. The first two thirds or so of this film shows us what this existence is like. There is virtually no plot; rather, we are treated to evocative visuals while the thoughts of various Berliners unfold on the soundtrack--sometimes they are intriguing non sequiturs and sometimes fascinating philosophical questions. This is the strongest part of the film. When the angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz) assumes mortality out of love for a beautiful trapeze artist, the ensuing romance seems rather abrupt and unconvincing. To be continued..."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing film","review":"This is an amazing film. It was my favorite film of all time until Prospero's Books, and it still my second favorite. When are there going to be more Wim Wenders DVDs? Anyway, the DVD is pretty light on the bonus features. Given how long it has taken for this to come out, it would have been great to have more (or any), but the transfer is good and that is the most important thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, but beautiful","review":"I own the british version of the DVD. The story here does move very slowly (I need to be in the right mood to watch it). If you don't like slower-paced, philosophical movies, don't buy this. If you do, you definately need to see this film at least once, especially if you're a fan of City of Angels.The cinematography is beautiful and the dialogue is wonderful. I especially like the \\"Als das Kind, Kind war...\\" sequences. Very poetic. Peter Falk was really incredible in this movie too. Throughout the movie, I find myself looking forward to the next Peter Falk scene.I do have a problem with the subtitles. They are not always correct translations of the dialogue. Generally the translations make stronger statements than what was said in German (which is often meant to be a little ambiguous). I also really think that the German title is a better, more beautiful description of the movie: Der Himmel Ueber Berlin - The Sky Over Berlin.If you like art house movies, it's a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wings of Desire","review":"Great movie definitely makes you appreciate the little things and see everything from a different perspective. Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a movie with a good meaning and message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wings of Desire","review":"What a great movie. It arrived ahead of time and packaged well. If you haven't watched this version and only the one with Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage (City of Angels) your in for a treat. Peter Falk is amazing.

It is perfection. Mesmerizing from the first moment, you are drawn in by the symbolism, the spiritual (not necessarily religious) atmosphere, amazingly creative and artistic filming, brilliant dialog, and above all else, the perfect performance by Peter Falk playing... well... Peter Falk.Watch this movie. Buy this movie. Give this movie as a gift. Perfect for any intellectual on your Christmas list. This is truly the art of cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"So European it hurts...","review":"Angels walking and hovering about Berlin wearing trench coats and very 80's pony-tails...can you get more European than that? Wim Wenders makes a movie whose central theme \\"image.\\" The angels, unseen except by young children, walk among mortals, quietly listening, studying and somehow helping. I would like to describe the plot, but it seems so irrelevent in comparison to the images we see. How can you appreciate an angel wanting to become human (so he can find love with a trapeze artist) when you've got another angel flying through the subway system only to have an image of a bevy of bombers raging in on the city in old WWII footage while an old German recites Peter Handke poetry, \\"Was kinder kinder was...\\"? A great movie, and defintely the most European movie I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes and eww...","review":"I have friends who might be into this stuff, if only because they like the old and the strange. Me, I'm just like -- Is this \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\"?I think I might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if I picked up the script. As it is, this just barely seems to translate into a movie, and--forgive me for I have my own opinion--\\"City of Angels\\" was a good movie. Too bad if you don't like all this \\"contemporary nonsense.\\" I feel like it worked.My opinion: it's long, it's boring, it's hard to hear. Even if it has a message, I just can't relate to it. So maybe that's my problem.Your opinion: your own. keep it. you're lucky I gave it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch this at night when you want to get to sleep","review":"Like the reviewer who said the movie makes you ask the question: \\"Why am I here?\\" I too asked that question while watching this movie. This movie is my candidate for the most boring movie I've ever seen. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a -3.5. It would have been even lower except there are some nice clips of old Berlin. The movie plot wasn't believable and the acting was mediocre. It's one of those movies where I constantly was imagining what the cast and crew on the other side of the camera were doing.There. That's it. I've wasted enough time on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but too slow to be enjoyable.","review":"I wonder if bad subtitles ruined the film but it was SO PAINFULLY SLOW I found it impossible to sit through. I wonder if it picked up but I couldn't tolerate it. It's also unbelievable past the normal suspension of disbelief.

Why are we alive, why do I (Wim Winders) exist?----- to make dull films I suppose, what does mankind mean, what is it all about, what is nirvana------oh, grabbing a beer and watching the NFL for most of us poor Amis. Or thinking about lesbian sex! This type film is for the Woody Allen crowd, you know, the eurotrash lovers who hate all American films. Go see a good foreign film, like Seven Samauri, The Hidden Fortress, or Manon of the Spring.Be honest now.

Come on now, be honest.-------There I thought so."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERESTIMATED!!","review":"This is one of the most overestimated films I have ever seen.

Avoid this unless you have a hard time time sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Perhaps because I had been so entranced by \\"City of Angels,\\" the remake of this film, my disappointment is great. This is a somber, dreary film with subtitles that don't seem to make sense in colloquial English.

I'm not even going to say it's in the Top 10 of all time. I will say that it may be the film that most touched me inside; to this day, it is the ONLY film that I choose to watch at least once every year.... There is no middle ground with this movie, and that's one mark of a classic.To me, the movie is one of the most humane and warmly existential movies I've ever seen; probably the most. ... It asks big questions. It is not obvious. It allows the audience to participate in the thoughts and desires of its characters. It is a sublimely patient film. And, it looks fabulous to boot, with great performances.I love this movie. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD & fast delivery","review":"My wife and I enjoyed this movie. It was interesting to see Germany and hear the language again since we had lived their many years ago when I was stationed there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This movie was far off the beaten path. Very disjointed. The dialogue, particularly Peter Falk's part, is totally improvised. The 'Hat' scene was especially painful.Not sure how this film gets such high ratings from so many reviewers. So much potential, so little substance. It was a chore to sit through, waiting for ..... anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending Ruined It","review":"Begins with superb concept, capable actors, fresh cinematography. But ONLY Peter Falk holds our interest. Then the director has no clue what to do. Nick Cave's poseur song and the woman's trite monologue undo every ounce of resonance. Roger Ebert is dead wrong about this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I saw City of Angels, and read that it was based on Wings of Desire which was supposed to be more of an artistic film; the film was in German with subtitles, which I was aware of, but it was just really difficult getting into it and it was very long; maybe in English it would have made a difference.....maybe not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grainy - Despite Being a Criterion Collection","review":"This rating is strictly based on the image quality of the blu-ray disc.

If you already have the standard DVD copy, you might want to save your money and pass on this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ingmar Bergman meets...the Euro-Goths!","review":"I watched this believing that this was a \\"masterpiece\\" that I was supposed to be in awe of. After nearly two-and-half hours, I still couldn't figure out why (and I absolutely LOVE certain art house flicks). Along with other previous critics' laments, this film is too long, too self-absorbed in both its visuals and its dialogue (i.e., beautiful shots and existential drivel do not a great movie make), and is, ultimately, extremely pretentious. But the very WORST part for this viewer was having to suffer through Nick Cave at HIS mid-'80s angst-ridden worst! Mixed with the moody, brooding B&W footage, oddly chosen camera angles, and mystic back-story, the film amounts to Bergmanesque pseudo-meaningful drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sure Cure for Depression","review":"Somehow this story--about an angel who wants to be human--persuades you that it's wonderful to be alive. It manages this in spite of the fact that many of the humans shown are miserable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Film","review":"This movie is my all time favorite. A great story with beautiful filming. I have never been disappointed by any of Wim Wenders films. Bruno Ganz has a stellar performance in this excellent film of angels over Berlin. Definitely good for anyone looking to get into German movies, or just for anyone who wants to see how a real movie is made.(Don't see the awful hollywood spin off of this movie, City of Angels.

The rugged locations and well-crafted plot are reminders of this series' great early years, but the producers made a big mistake when they scaled this Bond movie back to human size... they no longer had a human to play him."},{"rating":"1","title":"License to snooze...","review":"I don't understand the great reviews that this movie has gotten. I am a huge Roger Moore fan but this was the worst entry in his stellar decade-long run. Everything seems re-hashed in this movie. The submarine plot thing was done in \\"Spy\\" as was the ski-slope-shooting thing. The villains are boring and the punchlines are much less witty than in previous films. Even the black jack scene is anti-climactic! And who the heck created that Bebe character? The opening sequence is the only saving grace but even that is not worth the purchase price. And, as another reviewer pointed out, the grand finale leaves much to be desired. If you want the best plot/landscape/villain/action combo of all the Bond movies featuring Roger Moore, stick with \\"Spy\\", \\"Octopussy\\", \\"Live\\" or \\"View\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Your Eyes Only Blu-Ray..will not load..","review":"I have ordered this disc twice from Amazon and both discs I have received will not load past the FBI warning.

The action is weak, the story is weak, and the Bond girls are weak. If you ranked them all they would be at the bottom of the list. When I see reviews about how good this Bond film is, I want to pull my hair out. Roger Moore is too camp after Connery And Lazenby. It is like Wathing Batman from the 60's after watching Tim Burton's version.

The film begins with Bond finally killing off arch-nemesis Blofeld, and then kicks its viewer into a tangled web of Russians, smugglers, and drug dealers.

This film ties its itself to where ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE left off. Bond has some unfinished buisiness to take care of in the pre-title squence and then this Cold War plot takes off from there. There is a lot of action and Bill Cont's score works well with it. This is the one Roger Moore Bond film that fits in with some of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like a made for TV movie","review":"This movie had a boring villain, no gadgets, a terrible soundtrack, and just didn't seem like a bond film at all. Maybe it's just that I don't like Roger Moore, but I found this movie to be very boring, especially when compared with any of the earlier films with Sean Connery or George Lazenby. The plot was pretty lame as well. Moore tries to retrieve some machine that would controll British submarines while some double crossing british guy tries to sell it to the Russians. A lot of the other reviewers seemed impressed with the stunts and action scenes, and I would have to agree that they weren't too bad, which is the only reason this film got two stars. A good Bond film however will have a fairly compelling storyline where the action scenes flow into it. In this movie though, it seemed like the entire film was just one big excuse for Bond to get chased down a mountain by guys on motorcycles. If only Moore could make another film like The Spy Who Loved Me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best of a Bad Lot","review":"On the Roger Moore meter, \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" is a definite improvement over the depressing wretchedness of \\"Live and Let Die,\\" \\"Man With the Golden Gun\\" and \\"Moonraker\\" -- and it has a bit more depth than the lavish yet redundant \\"Spy Who Loved Me.\\" However, it isn't a terribly memorable adventure and the villains are forgettable. On the other hand, Moore gives his best 007 performance and the pre-credit sequence is quite fun. Even though \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" is a nice change of pace from the usual Bond formula, it still lacks the sparkle of the early Connery classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Bond","review":"It's a little hokey by today's standards, but still very good.

I've bought six, and none work on my Sony, Samsung or LG players - but all the other James Bond titles work. Apparently more than 70% of customers cannot play this DVD Blu-Ray. Read on.For many but apparently not all, the problems can be fixed by doing a firmware update on one's Blu-ray player. Unfortunately, Fox has not exactly been helpful or, publicly at least, on top of this problem; to date they've made no official statement and are steering angry customers toward hardware manufacturers.Reportedly the disc is encoded with a corrupt Java file; for this reason, and because so many consumers are running into trouble getting this title to play at all - and the fact that Fox has yet to announce a recall - I can't recommend it, at least not until the problems are properly addressed.Amazon.com is GREAT because they will refund your money. But FOX needs to recall this disc, that's where the fix is at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching paint peel...","review":"A mind-numbingly dull Bond film, with walking wax manniquin Roger Moore as 007. Lots of athleticism, as Bond plows through the Winter Olympics sport by sport, deep sea dives, mountain climbs, Zambonis, and wrecklessly races a European mini in order to save the world from nuclear annihilation. The trouble with this film is it is very much a product of the times: the early '80s clothes and even the design of all the vehicles are all hideous, and the film itself has the look and feel of a television show like \\"Rockford Files\\" or \\"Magnum P.I.,\\" just without the redeeming humor. The \\"Bond girls,\\" mainly emaciated stick figures, are so bad that James even kicks one out of bed early in the show. Plus, the title song is by Sheena Easton... need I say more?Eminently skippable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The name is Bored........Very Bored!","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a die hard Bond fan, especially Connery and Moore. After the brilliance of \\"The Spy who Loved Me\\" and \\"Moonraker\\", one would expect another masterpiece. Instead, It's \\"B-Movie\\" Bond at his finest. If you can overlook the bad acting, lack of plot, lack of continuity, zero character development, and disco soundtrack, you may find something interesting about this film. Definite \\"Mystery Science Theater\\" material. The goofy celebrity look-alike henchman and choppy dialogue is classic. A Farce! For completionists only!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger Moore's \\"From Russia With Love\\"","review":"\\"For Your Eyes Only\\" abandons the high tech gadgetry and focuses on story, suspence and even romance.

A little known killing in 1970 became the spark that set this town on fire literally and emotionally in pushing the white people of this community to start to accept the civil rights of blacks in that area. Ben Chavis,cousin of the black murdered man, went on to lead the NAACP and other causes for blacks nationally after leading protests in his home town of Oxford. Even though not as well known as Birmingham, Selma, and the like, it was a very important part of the civil rights movement in the 1970's. I recommend it highly and hope others buy it and watch it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent represntation .","review":"I have read the book and seen the movie. The book involves more than the movie. As happens with a lot of books,in order to have a regular length movie,some of the book is not told.

I live in a very similar area not far from the town in which all this occurred. My father was the District Attorney in this case.

At the end of the movie was probobly the largest gunfight in Bond history. The gunfight was Japanese Secret Survice Agents/Ninjas vs. Blofeld's guards. I spotted one mess up in the fight. If u watched \\"the making of YOLT\\" you'll know that one stuntman (ninja) broke his ankle when he landed inside the crater.

Except for the fact that Kissy, the bond girl is only in the movie for about 20 minutes. It is so dumb why they cut the other one off. Well anyways, a space capsule was captured and hijacked. The Americans think the Soviets did it. Next, another capsule is captured and believe that the Americans did this to retaliate. The tension between the two could create another war. James Bond is sent to Japan to investigate. There, he finds the evil leader of SPECTRE has done this so when the 2 most military countrys destroy eachother. When that has happened, Blofeld will take opporitunity to seize the world. There was a lot of action in this movie. Like.1. The Space capsule hijack2. The building fight.3.

What makes this movie unique, are the sets, locales, it's generally temperate nature, and the gadgetry: being held to a nice minimum. Yet the plot, critiqued by many, I thought was generally engrossing and perfectly reasonable for a Bond film! There is the further addition of the well known, and deservedly appreciated, theme song, composed by John Barry, and sung by Nancy Sinatra! The even, steady pace of the film I thought so enjoyable I would conclude this as one of the more successful of the Bond films, and rather more adult orientated; but also sufficiently subdued so that the whole family can watch. A rather different Bond film which I believe to be Connery's finest; and a wonderful film merely to enjoy, and relax by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite James Bond Movie","review":"Now I know that a lot of critics and fans have criticized this movie over the years, but I steadfastly maintain that it is my favorite. Roald Dahl's screenplay is clever, fantastical without going over the top, and builds steadily to a great climax. It is a parade of tongue-in-cheek fun from beginning to end. The sets reached new heights (who can forget Blofeld's lair inside a hollowed out volcano?). John Barry's score is among his best (On Her Majesty's Secret Service had the best score, and the movie was the best of the non-Connery films). And Connery (still the only actor who truly was James Bond) serves up the appropriate level of droll, ironic detachment throughout. Just enjoy this one.

It lacks everything that makes a Bond film Enjoyable. The Story and Screenplay are two of the Weaker of any Bond film, and Donald Pleasance as Blofeld appears Far too late in the film to make an Impression.

A weak story and a bland villian, Blofeld (Donald Pleasence), who is nowhere near as colorful as most Bond villians are. Although, the title song (performed by Nancy Sinatra) is one of the best. The film is a big dissapointment, and just doesn't compare to Dr. No, From Russia With Love, or Goldfinger. The film is slow at times, and seems much longer than it actually is.

She is simply INCREDIBLE. And what a voice! She isn't missing one thing. I'll never forget the first time I saw the movie. I'll never forget the price she payed for her failure to kill Bond. Blofeld fed her to his piranhas. That's cruel. Well, leave it to the screenwriter, Roald Dahl. He serves up cruelty very well, especially in his books, which I can't even read. I hate him.

The movie is a mindless romp from one fistfight and shootout to the next. I was nearly bored out of my mind. The movie also has the worst Bond villain. I mean sure, Blofeld is a good villain, but how can we hate a guy we meet fifteen minutes before the movie ends? The Bond girls are another proplem. One saves Bond's live and proves to be the predecssor to girls Anya Amasova and Wai Lin. I love her, but then . . . I can't spoil anything for you, so you'll (sadly) have to see the movie.

Simon, a pastor of a successful church, neglects his family and all three of his children have major issues that they struggle with.

Some readers will gain inspiration from Loretta as she works to evolve from a stand by your man pastor's wife to an assertive partner who can influence her husband to devote more time to his family.This was a quick read, but a disappointing one for me. All three of the kids seem to have better versions of them in other black novels. I didn't feel that any of them were very well developed. Perhaps Billingsley has devoted fans who will forgive what may not be her best work, but for me, this book was weak and I'll be looking elsewhere for my next dive into black fiction.2 stars--SD"},{"rating":"1","title":"The lady's crazy","review":"Because I had a father who put his ministry first, I could really identify with this situation.

THIS IS NOT CHRISTIAN FICTION! It's a regular fiction book about a church. I dont know if its the bookstores putting it in the Christian fiction section or what, but this book is like Casting the First Stone. Its just about the church. I talked with a bookstore owner who explained it to me and after reading, I totally agree. Even still, I just dont understand what's wrong with having a few curse words. Its not excessive and it only comes from people who you would expect to use foul language (ie, drug addicts and baby mamas). Its not like the minister is cussing. Plus, Church Folks (which I loved by the way) had ministers saying much worse stuff. This book is soo good and I highly suggest it.

I borrowed the book from her, and was very saddened to find that there was as much cursing and vulgarity in the book as there is in ANY OLE BOOK YOU PICK UP off the shelf. There are ways to depict certain actions and behaviors, without blatently \\"putting it out there\\". The storyline is very perdictable which makes it a quick read.

Didn't get a chance to read the reviews here first (and I'm glad I didn't or I probably would not have bought it!). I quickly snapped a roll of 24-exposure film to try the camera out and see if we wanted to keep it.The pictures came out BEAUTIFULLY! I took some indoors, some out. Some with the fully automatic point-and-shoot, and expermimented with the potrait mode, sports action mode, and night mode. They all came out fantastically!It's like having two cameras in one - a fully automatic no-brainer point and shoot as well as some features that allow you to be more creative and experimental with photography if you want to. Also a great zoom.Canon must have corrected the issues that some of the eariler reviewers posted, because I did not experience any of these problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent camera ,highly recommended!","review":"I was surprised to read all the negative reviews about the canon z155. My own experience with this camera has been basically positive. Since purchasing the camera 7 months ago, the majority of my prints have been sharp, clear, colors bright and true to life. The only drawback i can think of is the pictures do tend to blur when using full zoom without a tripod. I dont think this is specifically Canon's problem, though, because photography books all recommend using a tripod when using a high zoom. At 155mm, one needs a very steady hand or the pictures blur. When I do use a tripod, even my pictures at the highest zoom come out crystal clear. I'd recommend this camera anytime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blurry Pictures!!!","review":"I was very disappointed when I got my film developed from the Canon Z155!!

Even the outdoor zoomed pics were not top quality!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera, clear pics, pretty easy to use","review":"Overall I'm happy with this camera. I had to replace a point and shoot pentax. I'm pretty happy with the pics I get with this point and shoot. I've gotten a few blurry ones, that I may have moved.

I call Canon's technical support line and they are not being very helpful at all. They went over with me the procedures that I already know.

This book, while apparently sincere and well intended is to well documented history what the National Enquirer is to serious journalism. The author presents photos, supposedly of her kin, which also supposedly resemble those of Jesse James and his family. Well, maybe not quite. It's easy to see the differences with the naked eye. The best judge of all this might be the author's family. Do a web search under the author's name for a feature article, in which she sought an exhumation order for her Courtney/\\"James\\" ancestor to the chagrin of other relatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to list any credible evidence","review":"Betty Dorsett Duke's book gives very vague evidence that her great grandfather, James Lafayette Courtney, was in fact Jesse Woodson James.

It has endured as a beloved favorite to all three of my boys. I think that children can really identify with Max and his thoughts. When he is sent to his room for misbehavior, his imagination helps him to run away to where the wild things are and collect his thoughts. I believe that the author must remember what its like to be a child and feel like no one understands, and not quite understanding yourself. Ruling the wild things helps Max understand that he just wants to feel loved, and helps parents to keep in mind that such outbursts from children are generally cries for attention--for someone to love them best of all. Mr. Sendak understands children! When you read this book it will transport you back to your own childhood and you will remember that lost feeling of being a child. Bravo, Maurice!

It's high adventure that appeals to every roaming fantasy a young boy has. It's about wearing a wolf-suit, exploration, taming monsters, and becoming a King. It was also the very first book I read to my son. The greatest moment was when, at 2 years of age, I was on the train and these two lovely old ladies approached him and started cooing and making faces. And with a very serious expression my son raised his hand, and said in his 2 year old gibberish, \\"Ve stweill.\\" It was only later that I realised he was doing exactly as Max had done when he tames the monsters with his magic trick, and says: \\"Be Still!\\"It's the book I read to him when he had a three day stay at the hospital and it stopped him crying.

Max is able to tame these Wild Things by commanding them to be still and so they think that Max is the Wildest Wild Thing of them all. While I loved this story, the pictures were also somewhat scary and areis capable of frightening a child. If there really were monsters under my bed when I was a kid, I always imagined that they looked liked the Wild Things.

Maybe it's that I hadn't seen it in years, but I'd forgotten how amazing this book really is. It seemed to perfectly fit as a metaphor for what the past year of my life had become... when I had gone off to live where the wild things are, only to find the light to still be on when I came back home.I realise this book has been around much longer than I have, but I know it will live on to touch our lives for many generations to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book years ago!","review":"I enjoyed this book years ago!

Now, that's staying power!To make a long story short, I finally had the joy of reading it and have passed it on to my grandchildren. It's a wonderful, imaginative story. I enjoyed Sendak's style; his streams of consciousness made for smooth reading. And I can tell my grandkids are enjoying it, too. Johnny's reading it now, and he has the broadest smile on his face!

He is the \\"king of all wild things,\\" and then he sails home to his room and his nice, hot dinner. Children should enjoy this book, and not be too afraid of this imaginative land of make believe. The monsters are done in a cartoon style and have recently been employed in an advertisement aired on Massachusetts television.

He had a lot of fun there, but missed home, so he came back, and his supper was still warm (I love that line).

Like Stephen Ambrose, De Voto was a huge fan of L&C. The whole Course of Empire leads up to the L&C expedition. It really helps to put the expedition in historical perspective. More than that, it puts the early history of North America in persective, no small task. Because De Voto cares about the explorers he describes, it's full of great stories. (Writing in the early 1950s, he did not have to worry about being politically correct. But the facts speak for themselves.) A big book and worth the effort. No problem for readers of Undaunted Courage.

There are many stories within a story here, and I recommend it to anyone willing to wait out a slow beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent use of language and symbolism; enjoyable character","review":"I taught Tar Baby in a 12 Honors class. Each time I read the novel I appreciate it that much more. The characters are carefully drawn, unveiling their idiosyncracies layer by layer. Valerian's retreat into the greenhouse where he must learn how to get plants to bloom and ants to walk the other way is both amusing and pathetic. What I have found particularly enjoyable is Morrison's use of symbolism. The woman in the yellow dress, the tar pit, etc. all weave together to form a powerful novel. Perhaps not quite as arresting as Beloved, Tar Baby certainly deserves high marks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Morrison's Best","review":"After reading Tar Baby I was left a bit confused and not happy in the least. When you read Morrison, there is a certain caliber that one expects to see and this novel is completely lacking. It had an interesting plot but the characters were flat and uninteresting. Issues are brought up but not explored as they could be. Overall, I was not impressed with this novel. As always, there are beautful parts but certainly this is not her best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best book, but okay","review":"I didn't like this novel that much. toni morrison could have had better dialouge. there was too much vulgarity.

I purchased this CD mainly because of the reviews I had read online. I was a little unsure because I have the CD of their's entitled \\"Flippin Out\\" and found it uneven. There are great songs i.e. \\"Where I Fund My Heaven\\" and there are the not so great. This CD is quite another story. Solid from top to bottom. Song like \\"Every Thing Is Wrong\\" and \\"The Big Lie\\" have hit written all over them. I just wish they could get some exposure on radio.

Now that we're in the hangover phase of that, this is just what's needed to bring back some solid ground for popular music. Maybe I'm biased since I grew up with most of these guys in the tiny obscure Northern New York town of Potsdam, but listening to how catchy and polished this album is, I'm really surprised they haven't managed to hit it big. Oh well, it's a solid album from top to bottom and it's still worth having in your collection. Also check out Full On Bloom and Flippin' Out, featuring the song \\"Where I Find My Heaven\\" from the awesome movie Dumb & Dumber!"},{"rating":"2","title":"power pop lives on","review":"The Gigolo Aunts are a throwback to the heyday of 80's shimmering, jangly power pop. A couple of the tracks, especially the lush opening song, are reminiscent of the Posies. On other tracks they sound like a 90's version of the Three O'Clock (anybody remember them?); still others recall the Grapes of Wrath. The lead singer has a perfect pop tenor voice -- ranging from sweet crooning to urgent breathiness -- that reminds me of a little of Scott Miller of Game Theory. So yes, this has all been done before, but these guys carry on the proud tradition wonderfully. Check out especially the first three tracks, which come just about as close to pop heaven as you can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"CANDY ROCK THAT SHOULD APPEAL TO ANY 13 YEAR OLD","review":"I PICKED UP THIS CD BECAUSE I HEARD A GREAT DEAL OF REVIEWS ON THIS BAND AND MOST OF THEM WERE GOOD.

I rank it as one of the most realistic films about gang life on the west coast. The contrast between the police officers and the gangsters is a strong one. The police are shown to be a gang of their own. The movie centers on two police officers in the pd gang unit, trying to survive, make a change and get along with eachother. Colors is a must see, and if you're a crime movie buff, this film belongs in your collection. It's heaps better than Blood In, Blood Out, and focuses more on the human side of street thugs and police officers. 5 stars, nothing less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD won't play in the USA","review":"I bought three DVDs from this vendor and the DVDs are in European codes which means they won't play in the United States unless you own a \\"special\\" DVD player.

It unsettled the masses. He did the same almost 20 years later with COLORS, a frightfully realistic look at urban gang warfare in Los Angeles. Hopper has always been a talent, both in front and behind the camera. COLORS could only be handled by the likes of an independent spirit like Hopper: It's tough, brutal, no watered down studio gloss, no techno effects. Hopper is an actors director and Robert Duvall and Sean Penn are a perfect fit. The oft told cop story of the veteran and the novice gets an injection of new life: the partners don't like each other, they tolerate each other for the sake of survival. Duvall and Penn give strong expected performances and the story rifles along free of expected cliches. Ice-T, in his rapper days (pre LAW & ORDER: SVU) is featured on the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Realistic Police Movie I've Ever Seen...","review":"I like this film because it is all 100% accurate as far as what it was like to work CRASH."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the movie but..","review":"im a big colors fan but when my order came the dvd was cracked and wouldnt play the messed up part is only the disc was cracked the case was brand new!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"4th and 5th editions are completely different","review":"I ordered the solutions manual for the 4th edition, but Amazon sent the 5th edition one.

I love this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even hilariously bad","review":"As I popped Moonraker into my VCR, I expected a sidesplittingly hilarious action movie (you know, so inept its funny), but ended up with the exact opposite. I figured Bond traveling into space would be funny, kind of like Battlefield Earth or even End of Days. Moonraker, as it turned out was by far the most boring Bond movie and by the time he made it into space I didn't care anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"The novel featured a plot to destroy London by Nazis seeking revenge with a rocket. That book was fantastic. This film is tripe. Hugo Drax is no longer a deranged Nazi, but more like Bill Gates in space and with nerve gas. Why does Drax want to do this? We don't know and we don't care. Richard Keil's return as Jaws and a small cameo appearance by the KGB Director Gogol are the only high-spots. Why do all of these people know that Bond is after them? Is Bond's cover story posted on the Internet? The villain is just dumb and Moore makes loyal fans suffer through this comic strip/film. Fortunately, Dalton took over in eight years. AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond Bombs Out!!","review":"Don't let the one star rating fool you - this one is a BOMB and the worst serving on offer from the \\"McBond\\" series (worse still than 1973's L&LD and 1974's TMWTGG combined!!!). After 1977's superb TSWLM the owners of the Bond Franchise dished up this tripe almost as an unintended parody of the series. After a fantastic teaser, M/raker quickly plunges into a quagmire of high farce. Not even Jaws can save this movie from itself. Contains the most hilariously absurd movie scene I've ever seen: Bond wrapping a floppy Boa Constrictor around himself. Unfortunately the snake lost and Bond saved the day yet again (Whooppee!). Worse still, Moore performed his excruciating interpretation of Bond on 3 more occasions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost killed the franchise.","review":"The only reason to watch this awful Bond episode is for the lovely Corrine Clery. I'd recomend \\"Story Of O\\" instead for that reason. Roger Moore should have never been cast as Bond to begin with. His quips in this movie and the ridiculous Jaws character give fuel to every Austin Powers parody. Thank goodness the Connery films will always be available to the true bond fan and that the current films like \\"Tomorrow...\\" are being produced with thought and creativity. Check the grammar of any positive reviews of this movie. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond movie? don' t make me laugh","review":"This is probably the WORST James Bond movie in the series. Roger Moore puns and puns and puns, but does nothing spectacular. It is Star Wars with martinis. Bond was meant to be cold, cunning and ruthless. Not silly, joking and a pansy. Jaws is more of an orthodonist's nightmare than a Bond villain. If you want a good Bond see Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, or any of the UNDERRATED Timothy Dalton movies.... NOT THIS ONE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond met Star Wars","review":"Is that the first Bond film who put him out into the space?check out Star Wars with Harrison Ford or Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker please!! they will entertain ya more & more!The Bond story makes no really sense...the director shot the locations in Brazil, in Venice, in the USA and finally in the space!! the man who played the role of Darth Vader, has changed the name Hugo Drax!PS: only for die hard Bond fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If your a true bond fan","review":"This movie is not worth seeing unless you are a die hard James Bond Fan(Me).Most of the stuff in this goes way over the top:The whole space sequence-had to be the worst scene; way too farfechedToo much comical crap-Roger Moore lacked seriousness in this oneJaws falling in Love-Very wierd (another reason why the move was comical)This Movie had it's good points too:Lots of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN, LOTS!!!The wrist watch was coolThe boat chase in mexico was the most memerable sceneThats Really much it for this one. It's only worth seeing if you are a true die hard James Bond fan(ME)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"In a series of painfully absurd Bond films this is the absolute worst. Nothing in this film makes one want to watch it. From the ridiculous acting to the most wooden, unappealing Bond girl ever (even though Lois Chiles is beautiful she's hardly the hottest babe in the film), by way of the most boring Bond nemesis ever, this is completely uninspired dreck.Only one of the usual suspects is at the rendez-vous: beautiful scenery (with yet another visit to the Rio festival). As a bonus you do get a cartoonish appearance by Jaws who finally finds true love with a cute blonde. Ya right!!! If you never watch this film you will miss nothing from the Bond universe and you will have saved 2 hours to do something worthwhile. It doesn't even deserve the few words I have devoted to it. Shame on me!The overall rating of 4 stars for this film shows up Amazon's ratings for what they really are: unreliable and best served with a mound of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"A half-hearted... no, make that quarter-hearted attempt to cash in on the sci-fi craze of the late 70's. Jaws is back. Whoopee. He survives several five-hundred foot falls, and, get this, a re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. Without a spaceship. Roger Moore... sorry, but you're no Sean Connery. The special effects, well, maybe they looked really cool in 1979, but now they look more than primitive. A plot that makes no sense, too much silliness, and the most annoyingly slooooooow motion zero gravity scene ever. Skip it and Live and Let Die. Actually, no. Listen to the first couple minutes of Live and Let Die. Mr. McCarteny's theme song is worth the money paid to rent it. But this pile of... uh... bad stuff? Avoid it like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far-fetched, but fun movie","review":"I enjoyed this movie. It has an interesting, if far-fetched plot, beautiful location shots, neat villains, sexy women, and plenty of action. \\"Moonraker\\" usually gets negative reviews from the critics and is ranked as one of the weaker Bond films. This is probably due to the last 20-25 minutes of the movie. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but it's something you would expect to see in Star Wars rather than James Bond. Star Wars and Star Trek: The Motion Picture had been released around this time, and their success may have inspired the Bond producers to imitate much of the outer space action. That was probably a mistake. Overall though, I found \\"Moonraker\\" to be a fun movie to watch. The DVD picture quality is very good, and like all James Bond DVD's, it has an excellent documentary on how the movie was made. The audio commentary is also informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"007 Becomes a Live-Action Cartoon","review":"\\"Moonraker\\" (1979) has little to do with James Bond and everything to do with Looney Toons. The 007 producers have turned Richard Kiel's once-menacing Jaws into Wile E. Coyote. Roger Moore sleepwalks through the whole thing, occasionally stepping aside for the usual plethora of stunt doubles. To be fair, the pre-credit sequence is quite good and Drax remains a truly memorable villain. Otherwise, a definite low point in the Bond series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell?","review":"After the monumental sucecess of The Spy Who Loved Me Pinewood Studious releases this junk. With the desire of sci-fi film in the late 70s they make a sort of sci-fi movie with no sucecess. There is absoulutly no action and dumb villians (except for Jaws) and a stupid climax. I would give 5 stars if this were grading the special effects, they're great. But this isn't grading the effects so be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is pretty bad","review":"Moonraker was a mistake.

Roger Moore looks like a tired 007. There is barely any emotion shown in the movie by Moore and it lacks dynamic performances. The film is also a bit disjointed and the plot is not well tied together. Gotta love Jaws though...he is a great henchman! But, there is even a laser gun...Star Wars anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the opening sequence. The rest was just awful","review":"The thrilling opening stunt and Shirley Bassey title song get you revved up. You expect a good story, with the old James Bond, plus girls, thrills and gimmicks. Instead, you're subjected to a rehash of a plot that echoes OHMSS, You Only Live Twice, and Diamonds are Forever, a wimpy villain, and the return of Jaws, who in this film becomes a good guy and dates a woman who appears like a mountain maid. If you had never seen a movie before (not just a Bond movie) you might like this crud. Only \\"A View to a Kill\\" is worse. Devoid of excitement and story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another 007 Dud","review":"\\"Moonraker\\" made a lot of money when it was first released, but it holds up terribly now -- along with most of the Roger Moore Bonds.

I was really impressed with the quality of the video--an excellent transfer all around. I never saw Moonraker on the big screen so this disc was a real treat. The audio is excellent as well. Initially I wasn't sure how the sound would come out on my surround system but the Dolby 5.1 track had my subwoofer rockin' and the remastered soundtrack is first rate.

That aside, Moonraker is ridiculous. It is an absolute disgrace to the Bond series. It takes Bond and turns him into a slapstick comedy character, and the movie is absolutely BORING. I wasn't a big fan of Moore, but The Spy Who Loves Me and For Your Eyes only are masterpieces next to this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"EW!

Well let those reviews warn you- Bond and space do not match.I'm not going to mention the plot here since it's just plain ridiculous. But this is indeed the third worst Bond movie ever. When Cubby came up with the idea for this abortion, he said something like \\"It's not science fiction, it's science fact.\\" Well if we're supposed to believe that Space in real life is Star Warsish, than this is indeed \\"Science fact\\"- a Turd of one, that is.It's just a complete and utter disaster. A completely inane and stupid plot, a bored looking and sweaty Moore, a cheesy-as-all-hell final fight, this all equals an incredibly cheap and cheesy Bond that's disgusting and just plain awful.

It's the most underated James Bond movie (along with A VIEW TO A KILL!)! Roger Moore is just as good as ever,the Bond girl isn't that bad,and it's the return of Jaws. If you liked other films like GOLDFINGER and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, I would think you would like MOONRAKER. The only problems I have with this movie is that the villain,Drax, isn't, in my opinion one of the better villains in the series and the plot is very similar to TSWLM. Other than that, MOONRAKER is a pretty good movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Out of this world\\"","review":"This film did not do well with movie critics and Bond fans in general,because most think that Bond and Sci-fi dont mix, but I enjoy it very much and here's why. 1.Hugo Drax is probably the most sinister villian of all the Bond films, he tries to destroy the entire human race and start a society of physicaly pefect human beings. 2. Jaws is back after his apperance in \\"The spy who loved me\\", and he is probably the most famous of all Bond henchmen. I love the way Bond always gives him a smile when he see's him, I cant help but laugh. 3. This film has the best location scenery ever in Rio...simply breath-taking. 4. This is the last film in the collection where we see the original \\"M\\" (Bernard Lee) 5. Great fight scenes 6. Lots of laughs. This movie is very underated, check it out and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marred By Silliness","review":"The first of the truly tainted Moore entries isn't so bad for the first half and the Venice scenes look great in this restored version with all the terrific extras standard for the series. But you'll be rolling your eye's for the rest of it. Did people ever think the souped-up gondola and the Close Encounters jokes were funny? Pity, as this was one of the best of the books."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],x={key:0},C={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(f,null,y(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,R)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-8ba80c01"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/18.md","filePath":"guide/18.md"}'),N={name:"guide/18.md"},L=Object.assign(N,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
