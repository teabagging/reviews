The main problem is that every single person in the entire film was horribly ugly. There was not one single good looking girl or anyone else. The story dragged and the actors overacted their parts. Perhaps it is due to the fact that most of the actors were from the Royal Shakespeare Company and were probably more used to stage acting. The film quality was also very poor and looked grainy. We rented this movie because it was so highly recommended but it was not worth even renting. The acting was overacted, the script was awful, and the film was horrible. Truly an awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"omg...................","review":"i love jane austen and i really enjoy period pieces. but the main character was the WORST actress i have ever seen in my life. she was boring, weird, ugly, and never changed her expression. i dont kno how anyone could love her. i could barely understand what they were saying. a terrible film. i hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"irritatingly sucky","review":"Poorly directed and thoroughly uninteresting. I am at a loss to explain why so many people have rated this film so highly: I personally got nothing out of it.The plot is convoluted and has many red herrings; the pace slogs in the middle; the main character is frigid and unreadable, and the climactic moment of passion is confusing and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer!","review":"Wow, I typically love movies based on Jane Austen books, but this was a *snoozer*! It moved so slowly, yet had *so* many characters, it was hard to figure out who was who till the movie was just about over. I asked my mother older mother to watch it with me, and she could barely sit through it. This on top of the fact that it was hard to believe that the great-looking and vivacious male love interest was \\"all time\\" in love with the mousie-looking and very uninteresting and quiet female primary character - I was so unimpressed with the movie that I cannot even remember their characters' names.Luckily I rented it from NetFlix before wasting my money on a DVD. If I hadn't, that DVD would've sat in it's box for the rest of my life. I love all versions of P&P;, and Emma, and S&S;, I even enjoyed the little play-on-P&P; mini-series \\"Lost in Austen\\", but, this movie?... was not good.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the acting, costuming and locations were nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Not overly great, but good.

Typical British casting with good character depictions. Lovely scenery. Very good representations of clothing styles and social class distinctions of the era - upper class snobbery and conniving, a put-upon underdog or rather \\"undergirl\\" has the viewer urging her to stand up for herself. Almost a \\"Cinderella\\" story line, and does have a great ending. Lovely way to spend an enjoyable indoor wintery afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persuasion","review":"Another favorite version of Jane Austen's classics. True to the original novel.

When I finally DID watch it, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it conformed to my ideas from reading the book. The ending is a little different from the end of the novel, but actually incorporates an ending that Austen originally had written to the novel. Overall, an excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie...","review":"This is one of those \\"once in a lifetime films\\" for me. I adored the book and now I own and dearly love the movie. Amanda Root is perfect as Miss Ann Elliot. In fact, I can't think of another actress that could play her. Her longing for Captain Wentworth is almost palpable. She appears to bloom when she gets to Bath and by the end of the film she radiates.Anyone with a real love of Jane Austen will adore this film. It follows the book very well (why do so many screen writers \\"adapt\\" Austen's novels anyway?) I highly recommend this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Great adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel.

De todos modos, por la historia y la excelente represetancion de la epoca, la recomiendo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongly recommended for Jane Austen fans","review":"Among the novels Jane Austen wrote, this is my favorite. Although the heroine is not young nor brilliant like Elizabeth in the Pride and Prejudice, Anne is thoughtful and discrete. Amanda Root played Anne very well. As the story progresses she becomes prettier and prettier. She finally collects all her courage and stands up for her own happiness and get her man. The actor who plays Captain Wentworth is also good, strong built, but sensitive enough to know what kind of a woman Anne is. These British actors can make Jane Austen stories alive even today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comparison to the novel","review":"almost like the novel. ending a little shorter than it but follows the story closley"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kiss In Time?","review":"Despite the much disputed public kiss at the end, I think that this production reflects the attitude and tone of Austen's novel beautifully.

I loved Sense and Sensibility, Emma and Pride and Prejudice, and I think Persuasion is also a wonderful story, possibly not quite as emotionally impactful as S&S (which achieves a fantastic climax) but wonderful. I have to admit, the subtitles were necessary for me to decipher some of the more quietly mumbled lines. I would caution the viewer that this movie moves more slowly than S&S and Emma, but it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"British drama at its best!","review":"The somber tone that Jane Austen intended for this story is superbly played out on the screen. You can actually feel the weight on Anne's heart as she becomes aware of Wentworth's change of circumstance and quietly observes his growing attachment to Louisa.

Some of the most important scenes like the one where thee group is at the theater near the end of the story was grossly over dramatized. If you want adaptations that truely reflect Jane Austen's spirit then watch Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson and Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly Dull","review":"I really wanted to like this movie since I LOVE Jane Austen movies and books so much. Other people tell me those are boring, but if you understand the language and enjoy subtle wit and romance, they are very enjoyable. This movie however, was a complete disappointment. It was profoundly dull and boring in the extreme. There was next to no musical sountrack and the actors were exceptionally unattractive. Not just the main character who is said to have \\"lost her bloom\\". I was quite taken aback by the utter scariness of all of the actors in this film. I was all ready for an enjoyable Jane Austen ride into the past, but was supremely disappointed. The movie never picked up and hardly made sense at all. There was no interesting dialogue and you never really got into the characters or the story enough to feel for them. Very flat. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible adaptation","review":"I read this book recently and found this movie to be a terrible adaptation of the book. As other reviewers said, Anne was too old and tired looking to represent the Anne of the book. While she had \\"lost her bloom\\" she seemed to get it back during the course of the story. She also displayed a subtle strength which I did not see in the character at all. Obviously the movie cannot go into the same depth as the book but I found at times they movie veered from the book too much changing the characters in ways that did not do the story justice. In the opera scene, Anne chases down Fredrich desparately..this did NOT happen in the book -she held her composure at all times. I am pretty forgiving of books to movies but this one was just plain poor. I terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"persuade me not to watch this","review":"I thought this movie sounded really interesting. It was so slow moving and boring that I fell asleep on it several times and really couldn't tell you how it ended.

The woman playing Anne was sightly. Eyebrows like Groucho Marks. Who did the actor's makeup, or was it that the directors and producers had a limited budget? So much for connection and chemistry, the story rambles on, and finally has a tad of merit in the last 5 minutes. Jane Austen would not be happy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK!!","review":"Ok... I am very dissatisfied with this movie. I had just watched Sense and Sensibility in previous days, so I expected it to be that Excellently Done. Boy, was I wrong. This movie (Persuasion) really erased the wonderful scenes and scenarios that I had created in my mind after reading the book.Amanda Root is so very unconvincing and wrongly cast. While I will not criticize her God given physical appearance, I will say this... she made horribly annoying facial expressions. She also looks oh so much older than 27, she looks pretty much close to 20 years older than that and I am not being mean either. There is absolutely nothing wrong with looking one's age, she just was not suited for such a young part and like wise neither was the actor that played her former suitor (Wentworth).In other words, I am not even writing a review, I am VENTING.... AHHHHH, I felt like screaming as I watched this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Persuasion","review":"the only good things about this movie is -best pictures - other wise is the most boring story ,It is very slow , after I finished watching it ,I was wondering what is the story about ??

I am not sure that the same holds for this one, though the price is certainly too good to pass on.If you've owned a Panasonic VCR before then you expect reliability and ease of use. This unit delivers on that...while including 4 heads, commercial skip, a lighted remote (finally!), and the entire bevy of features now standard on every VCR.The real negative is that it is much noiser than the model it replaces; particularly when it is rewinding. We are talking a good bit noise, enough that it makes me want to turn up the TV volume while it is rewinding.I actually went out and purchased a JVC VCR to consider as an alternative, but returned that one and kept the Panasonic becaese the JVC was way too confusing to program.So why did I keep this one? It is very inexpensive, I like the features, and I can live with the added noise.

She brings dancers, hightech stage-tricks, Paco Rabanne-clothes and the latest video-techniques. The whole thing is best captured on the concertvideo which is a big thrill. On this double-cd it's just the music: a lot of great dance-songs and a couple of heartbreaking ballads. Mylene's highpitched, slightly panting voice at times is 'lost' in the big beats and I'm quite positive at times she does a little lipsyncing (on 'Alice'e.g.) One song on the album can not be found on any other Mylene-release: 'La poupee qui fait non', performed with Algerianborn Rai-singer Khaled (of 'Aicha' and 'DiDi'-fame). On the whole a nice album. If you're new to Mylene it's a great way to get to know her best stuff.

Often I found myself wanting to quit and just give up ( which I did for some chapters but not most)Sections on String Theory and Quantum just did not interest me and I had to skip those sections. Maybe my brain did not get it or maybe I just did not want to read it.

I disagree, especially since Greene's idea of updating the examples involves replacing the nameless observers of Einstein's original thought experiments with characters from the Simpsons. I can sit and read Einstein's own examples several decades after he wrote them, and they still make sense. If Greene's book is in print 50 years from now, it will have to be heavily footnoted to explain who Itchy and Scratchy are, and why they are shooting at one another on a moving train.But the digressions are just small irritations in an otherwise well-crafted book.

I read Brian Greene's last book, \\"The Elegant Universe,\\" and this is certainly a good follow-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"When I first got this book I thought it was just going to be more of the same information from his first book, just worded differently. I was completely happy after finding out that it was completely new information. A deep exploration about time and the strangeness of the quantum world. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in physics and the way the universe works."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!! A Great Work...","review":"...that everyone should read. You have heard that reality is stranger than fiction. Read this book to find out why. Many things you thought were obvious and clear, are actually very, very, strange, and very, very unlike what you thought. This should be the bible of the 21st century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great explanations but extremely verbose","review":"Okay so I got this book a couple days ago and after getting through about 30 percent of the book, I can say with confidence that the author is going to extremes at times with the number of examples he gives. It can be very very very very annoying. At times, I am learning about important concepts like entropy and then it just goes into ridiculous examples that waste my time. I don't know if the author is trying to impress the reader with his literary skills or thinks we are 5 year olds.On the plus side, he has a real talent for effective analogies. I hope as I go further into the book, the writing gets a bit more sophisticated. Otherwise, I am stuck with reading unnecessary things just because no one else I know of can explain special relativity and connect different aspects of contemporary physical concepts in the same way Brian Green can."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential reading","review":"I read all the time including popular science and astronomy books.I did not find this book to be the easiest I ever read.But the ideas it expressed turned out to be essential to my life and thought process. The author's explanation that the past, present, and future are all equally valid in spacetime was fundamental for me.I can't think offhand of a more important book for a modern, informed person who has come to appreciate that science is the way we relate to the world and is our way forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring your glasses.","review":"With 5 hundred and thirty some pages of text, Greene certainly has a lot to say. Fortunately, most of it is very good - as others has said! Not as much on the Zero Point Field and applications as I had hoped but stayed relatively pretty free of New Age conversations. My only reason for 4 stars is not content but the size of the print, especially the notes. Use good light or glasses. Thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Analogies for dummies","review":"Sorry i took this expression from another reviewer, but it's just the right description. The book is waaay too long. What a brick. I saw his documentary on the Elegant Cosmos, or something like that, and it was fun, so I decided to read the book. What a failure.It's just a jungle of words and similes that only make it more complicated to figure out what he's talking about instead of stating the real thing, which would have been more helpful. I read most of it, as much as I could. But I quit because I came to a point that I felt: So what about all this? What difference does it make? I can't see the implications. There's no synthezising, no summary. I don't know what to make of it. Why should I care about the fabric of the cosmos anyway? What about the implications?The author just seems to be pouring out his mind, conversing to himself while writing. No plan, no organization.Imagine space/time as a loaf of bread, says he. Come on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing short of amazing!","review":"Having to split my time between college and work doesn't give much opportunity to read for luxury and I'm very glad I purchased this book on CD. Green manages to explain everything in a very redundant, but extremely entertaining manner. He will repeat an explanation of a concept two or three times, each time using a different and unique comparison to common, every day events. This way, even a listener who doesn't have a degree in Physics can still feel like they have a confident grasp on the subjects contained in the book.Most of all, Greene explains concepts, ideas and theories in a way that excites the listener. Probably because when Greene narrates, he is truly excited himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"It' s Worth 6 stars","review":"If I could give this book 6 stars I would. The concepts are heavy but the writing has just the right touch. You can read on many levels (the author tells you when you can skip harder sections, and summarizes so you can get on with the reading), depending on how much detail you'd like to take in. If I read this book as a kid, I think I would have gone into physics. Reading this book is the next best thing to being in on the discoveries. My praise and thanks to Mr. Green."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fabric of the cosmos is polyester","review":"[...][...] I felt that \\"Elegant\\" was a fairly easy, if fascinating, read, whereas I felt like I was hanging on for dear life in \\"Fabric of the Cosmos\\". Looking back on it, I think I may have had trouble for the reasons already mentioned: sloppier writing and irritating pop-culture references in lieu of diagrams. I guess I like my science (and my martinis) dry.Greene did bring up some interesting ideas that had never occurred to me before - is space infinitely divisible, or is it more like graph paper? Why does time flow in one direction and not the other? I liked his alternate theory on The Big Bang, and he describes some recent (and in process) experiments that give weight to different aspects of quantum theory.I'm glad I read it, but I definitely don't remember much from it, and I enjoyed \\"Elegant\\" a lot more.

How \`bout all those Parallel Universes we saw in that ST episode where a hundred different Enterprises were floating around due to a rift in the space-time continuum?All these questions are answered in Brian Greene's The Fabric of the Cosmos. It is a well-structured book, aimed at presenting Quantum Physics to the non-physicist, and masterfully accomplished without a single, boring equation. Unfortunately, it can only be recommended to people whose geek factor matches Sheldon's on the TV Show, The Big Bang Theory. Happily, I'm one of those.4 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABRIC OF THE COSMOS","review":"This is a deep treatise on the topics of space, time and the structure of the universe. In light of some recent discoveries or should I say theories, it is a good primer to get up to speed on the theories and advancements of physics to the modern era. It's either a great book to put you to sleep, or one that allows you to visit and re-visit thoughts and ideas in a thought provoking format. Not for the faint of heart or casual observer.

The sevice in getting my own copy was nothing less than superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I became interested in Mr Green's work after watching NOVA - The Elegant Universe on TV. I found this book interesting that explains many of the current science of cosmology & particle physics. Mr Greene does try to put difficult concepts into simple explanations so one can relate to them through their everyday experiences of life but often these seem quite labored metaphors. Mr Greene's enthusiasm for his subject does shine through his writing and makes you feel like you want to understand but it can get a bit tiring having to reading some paragraphs several time to understand the point, however when you get that eureka moment it feels worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"clear and concise for the layman without dumbing down complicated material","review":"very good technical overview of the recent advances in particle physics and our understanding of the cosmos. i am a software engineer with an deep curiosity and interest in science. and though i didn't follow everything, i did learn a lot from this book. this is the first book by Brian Green that i've read, and i intend to read the elegant universe next. he is a great writer and uses real-world examples (often with references to simpsons characters) to help convey complex scenarios. recommended for anyone interested in science and the universe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"This book is a major bore. There is nothing new in it, just rehashed stuff. Frankly I was surprised, because this guy is supposedly a great scientist.I was really looking forward to something interesting if not totally new. But all he did was to give a boring report on what physics has accomplished over the years, stuff that we already know.I was looking for maybe some new concept such as his idea of why entanglement happens. There was nothing. Nada.All he could say about entanglement for instance was, well, that it shows us that cosmic space is more than what we might think it to be. Duh!I have an advice for the author. Next time, write a book if or when you get a real cool idea about something. I mean, I--a plain layman--could write this book. Everything in it could be found on wikipedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written garbage","review":"Greene is one of the better pop-science writers, but many of the examples he uses are extremely poor and bound to leave the reader even more confused.

They get a pseudo-physicist to rewrite his first book on philosophy, after he starred in a TV production centered about it. Long-winded and boring, the wordiness serves to obfuscate the concepts. Stick to Hawking's Brief History of Time or Einstein's Meaning of Relativity. This books adds nothing new, and has begun subtracting. If you're into entertainment and David Duchovney wanna-bes, watch the X-files."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh quantum physics...","review":"This book its not that it was bad written. I am one of those wholl side with Einstein when it comes to ' is that the way God would do it with Science.' I just didnt feel right going into the Quantum nonsense... If everything was in some sense connected or intervened how could we be individualized? I believe eveything takes a name shape of itself. Quantum physics no matter how hard it strives will nor surpass the entities of God's creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rehash of The Elagant Universe","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I enjoy popular physics writing and feel that Greene is one the best science writers around (as well as being a capable physicist in his own right).Greene's earlier work the Elegant Universe was a classic. This book, as others have noted, offers little new thought and appears to be a rehash of the author's previous work.Although not badly written it will probably only be of interest to readers new to this area. On a side note the audio tape is well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"move along...","review":"I really regret undermining the hard work of others, but it is worth it to spare the frustrations of readers: this book is dead. I expected at least an interesting appraisal of the current view of cosmology, but it was redundant, and grossly over-simplified even for those of us who are not into applicable science or theoretical math. I never thought I would break into skimming, but I did, and it only got worse seeing that even that was not stimulating enough. It feels like a stoner's rant. The book could have been compressed into a small pamphlet, and I still would have felt the same way.1 star- for a pretty cover.On another note...If a person takes the scientific field as a whole then they will chase down countless dead ends. Rather appreciate your time by going to the illuminated minds. If you are hungry for cosmology, look up Walter Russell."},{"rating":"1","title":"very basic and very wordy","review":"Of popular Physics books, this must be one of the most superficial. For anyone who already has an even vague idea that quantum mechanics pertains to the tiny, or that relativity has to do with combining the 3 dimensions of space with the one of time, this book will be way too basic. Even for other readers, I don't see what the long sequences of near repetitions of statements and examples does to elucidate. It is absolutely insulting in its implied estimate of its reader. I quit reading in disgust after 4 chapters, finally giving up hope that anything would be discussed in depth.I honestly believe all ideas in this book could be clearly expressed in a book one tenth its length.I'd recommend reading books by Timothy Ferris instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe It","review":"I am giving a low review not because of the writing, but for the fact there is nothing new here if you have read The Elegant Universe.

The later chapterson string theory are even more breathlessly gee-whiz andcontent-free than the author's TV show, but do go on and on.The author makes no attempt to distinguish between things for which there is scientific evidence and things which he thinks sound cool.

It broadens the mind and makes physics and the mysteries of the universe accessible, even to me, a nonscientist. I'd never heard about quantum entanglement (distant things influencing each other without anything travelling between them) and the discussion was so thrilling that that chapter alone was worth the price of the book. There is so much here, cosmology, M theory, universes on branes but the author pulls it all together in a totally coherent and entertaining way. Physics is developing rapidly and this book provides a foundation for understanding today's breakthroughs. It's a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as Elegant Universe but still excellent","review":"Brian Greene provides an overview of physics - string theory is only part of it. When I read his book, \\"Elegant Universe\\" I had several eureka moments; with this book I didn't. I think that was mostly because the concepts he discusses are very familiar to me (if not totally understandable!)

I have two beefs, both of which are minor and hasn't prevented me from recommending the book to friends. As he gets to the point in the book where it becomes a bit more about child-rearing and less about dealing with a baby in the house, he gets a bit preachy which was a bit of a turn-off for me. Also, he's a bit crass on some things (goes along with the tone of guy talking to another guy). Still funny but not what I would have hoped.

Rose's extensive notes and bibliography give a small idea of how much thinking went into the writing of the book, and indeed it has the feel of something which has been carefully considered.It is worth emphasizing that the subtitle of the book is \\"Josephine Baker in Her Time\\". I stress the point because I think that the reader should expect that this is not so much a biography (although biography is an important element) as it is a contextual portrait. Rose spends a lot of time on Baker not just as a person, but as an icon and the book is often closer to cultural criticism than \\"true\\" biography.This is not a bad thing, necessarily. It is just that I was looking more for biography and probably more for personality and that is not what this book is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am now a quilter!","review":"This book is my new reference manual!

Their clashing personalities collide in a hysterical and sharp-written script that had me crying with laughter. But even amidst their crazy campus fun, they learn important lessons about sexuality and themselves that will stay with them forever. Joshua Charles, Stephen Baldwin, and Laura Flynn Boyle each bring these lovable characters to life. They compliment each other's eccentric personalities, even if they're not exactly thrilled to be stuck with each other at first. Threesome is an uplifting sexual comedy with a smart outlook on the surprising relationships that we may sometimes find ourselves in.

Later that week I went back and watched the last five minutes and I now understand why she insisted on turning it off. The ending is TERRIBLE. It's like the director made a great movie and then in the ending he felt guilty and decided that he had to throw some morals in. It ruined the movie.

Up there with the likes of Jim Gaffigan, Mitch Hedberg and Jerry Seinfeld, in my opinion (and by Seinfeld, I mean Seinfeld the standup comic -- leaving the TV stuff out). As expected this CD-DVD pack was very good. My only criticism (why I give it 4 stars rather than 5 stars) was that it began and ended with some lame tracks that had his mom and grandmother on them. Those didn't work for me. And he left off a bunch of stuff he has that's very good. Guess he'll get that on his second CD. But don't hesitate to buy this product. Martin is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Glitter Is The Herpes Of Craft Supplies.\\"","review":"I first became aware of Demetri Martin when I saw his \\"Person\\" show on Comedy Central. I immediately bought that show, and found it to be even better with repeated viewings. This DVD and CD combination is from 2006, and is perhaps not as polished as \\"Person,\\" but is still undeniably comedic genius.Demetri uses a guitar and little else to tell his off-kilter unique jokes. He is obviously quite bright as much of the humor is quite nuanced and shares peculiar insights, though he never comes across as arrogant or even particularly intellectual; his sense of humor is just plain strange. In the comedian universe he would be diametrically opposed to Larry the Cable Guy.The package includes an audio CD and a DVD, and includes many extras such as early performances, commentaries, and songs. While I still prefer \\"Person\\" (and recommend it highly,) I loved this show, and enthusiastically recommend it to lovers of cerebral, yet offbeat, humor everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really funny, definitely worth the purchase","review":"If you've never heard Demetri Martin or you're familiar with him, you need to pick up this CD/DVD.

I could list a joke-by-joke comparison but I won't. Is this CD funny? For the most part - yes. Would I recommend this CD if I wasn't a huge fan of Hedberg's work? Yeah. I feel guilty laughing at this album because it is such a clone piece.Enjoy Martin's work on the Daily Show. Root for his movie deals and applaud his acting. The comedic value of this album belongs to Mitch Hedberg and its a shame that more people don't see through this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for mini-bikes","review":"I bought this clutch for use on my doodlebug mini-bike with the 6.5hp swap. It works for a little while, but doesn't last long. It quickly becomes really jerky, and smokes. At full rpm it will fully engage, but it's a bumpy ride getting there. I highly recommend instead going with the Hillard clutch if your using it for mini-bikes, or go-karts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be misled","review":"First the good. the intensity is as advertised- it's loud. The installation is relatively straightforward as well, and the compact size makes finding a mounting location simple.Now the bad. While the decibel level is high, the frequency of the horn blast sounds like an amplified honker you'd find on a 10 year old's huffy. There are 2 horns built into the unit- one at 530 Hz and one at 680 Hz. If you're looking for a relatively deep, low-sounding air horn this is not the one you want. I didn't expect a thunderous rumble from a compact unit like this, but the high tone was disappointing. After installation and hearing the sound produced, I wired the factory horn in as well just to offset the high, tinny tone of the air horn.So to summarize, if you're looking for a relatively loud horn with that distinct air horn warble, then the price and ease of installation make this worth while. If you're looking for the \\"Big Rig BLAST,\\" you're never going to get it out of a compact unit like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'M SATISFIED WITH THE 527-02 ERASER REFILLS","review":"THEY WORK FINE .

Better to not waste the time and money on this. Buy the Long Way Home graphic novel series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"I guess I expected better from a Nancy Holder story. The chapters kept repeating the same information over and over with slow to little progression of the main story line. The characters I've grown to love, Buffy, Willow, and Angel, along with the ones I can do without, Riley and Tara, never really connect on an emotional level with each other or to me as the reader. I do like the interaction between Willow and fellow witch, Dona Pilar. I also enjoyed the Cordelia/Wesley story with the girls enamored of vampires and of wanting to become one themselves. I am ready to read book 2 and have high hopes that it will be more to my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a book by its cover","review":"If you are buying this book because you believe it is a Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel crossover, save your money. The two supposed \\"main characters\\" move in separate storylines, as though the two authors took turns writing chapters. While the Angel sections are mildly diverting, and at least somewhat true to character, the book is ultimately little more than a paean to the \\"deep,\\" and according to the show's own eventual revelations, entirely imaginary love of Buffy Summers for Riley Finn.From the time I first read about it, I really looked forward to the issuance of this book. It is now residing in my garbage can, one of only two books I have thrown out in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"a college student and a huge buffy fan","review":"I must admit, the book started off slow, but got extremely good and exciting as you kept on reading. I must warn you though, before you read this book, make sure you have already bought the two sequels that follow this book. Don't be like me, and finish the first book, then had to wait a week to get the other two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and well written, but has some bias","review":"Overall, I think it is a great book. One thing that I noticed is that they mostly mention the NIV in a negative way when comparing translations. There are a number of times when the ESV, NASB, RSV, NRSV, NKJV and KJV are contrasted to the problems in the NCV and Message, yet if the NIV agrees with the former translations, it is not mentioned. I think in fairness, they should have pointed out where the NIV was correct. I still think it is an essential work on the Bible version debate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good argument well made","review":"If you are interested in Bible translation then this book will be of great interest. Yes the writers firmly have the ESV in mind but i do not think that in any way clouds their argument.This puts the case for a literal word for word English Bible translation. They use many examples, argue fairly and make many interesting points. The book reads well for such a technical (at times) discussion. They acknowledge that all English Bibles are in some ways interpretations but their case is; lets try and minimize our input and leave the reader to make their minds up as to meanings and ambiguities.If you are of the opinion that the Bible is the word of God then by the time you have read this book you may have some strong feelings about such translations such as The Message, the NLT and such like. regardless of what \\"camp\\" you may be in this is a challenging read and well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid.","review":"This is worth every word on understanding why literal translations, or even \\"Essentially Literal\\" translations are worth our time. They also help in discerning some common misconceptions about the ESV and NIV that enrich our desire to learn from the Bible. It also addresses some common objections in very helpful ways in regards to Paraphrased translations. I would recommend reading this by anyone, especially those who do not care for the ESV, people who burn every bible but the KJV, and those who do not understand why literal or essentially literal translations are worth the library budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"a remarkable musical event","review":"this is the worst thing i have heard in 58 years.the cd has no redeeming value.i have nailed the cd to my listening room wall.it's quite an achievement to be the worst of anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oustanding Book On Cloth Doll Making-A Must Have!!","review":"This is an excellent book for those who would like to learn more about the craft.

Once they arrived I opened the one for home use and cranked the handle for 2 minutes as stated on the package (on the website it says 1 minute crank for 20 minutes of light), on the package it states that cranking for that long will give you 8-12 minutes of light from the flashlight. It only stayed lit for 1.5 minutes, which is a far cry from what is advertised. The other unit seemed to work properly but I decided that a 50% success ratio was not good enough for me to give one of them as a gift. So they are being returned. Other than the one defective unit the product itself is ok, light was just ok (from the one that worked). The radio worked fine, I could pick up a couple local stations (decent for emergencies). Not sure what the durability of these units would be, they were made of the cheap plastic that most of these type unit are made from.

Hassle.The SteamVac Carpet Cleaner broke after about ten hours of use. More hassle and expense because the thing just went out of Warranty.Want service? Good luck. Take the machine to a service center and leave it with them for two weeks, then pay them for repairing a machine that should never have gotten out of the factory.Where is the convenience of owning your own carpet cleaning machine?

The main culprit is the plastic water tanks. I have owned my machine for 4 years and I replaced it 3 times. The good thing is that its parts are available everywhere.... which I not sure its a good or bad thing.... Maybe the Hoover knows of these flaws and its creating an aftermarket demand on parts... and believe me they are not cheap. Each water tank is $50 to $70 so with what I have already spent. I could of bought a new one. I also had to replace rusted parts inside the machine. In conclusion, its the best cleaner out there but its just cheaply made out of plastic that will crack in time and leak all over the place... which causes parts to rust inside the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Extra Water Tank!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have owned Hoover products since 1970.

Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Nas, The Geto Boys, The Ultramagnetic MC's, Grandmaster Flash, KRS-One, Kool Moe Dee and countless others have used the drum break from the song (The Sugarhill Gang had a minor hit with \\"Apache Rap\\"). The group wasn't really a group at all, but a studio concoction of session players who were quickly assembled in 1972 to round out a soundtrack album (the less than memorable The Thing With Two Heads) with two tracks. Those two tracks, \\"Bongo Rock\\" & \\"Bongolia\\", led to the full-length album Bongo Rock and the follow-up Return Of The Incredible Bongo Band.

The cast's performance is top-notch, and Keira Knightly brings a presence to the screen fitting of a unique woman with an unusual taste for the less desirable things of life. A creative diversion from typical cinema, Domino takes the audience on a journey into a woman's world seldom entered and understood. Directing, writing, acting and editing were excellent.

Here we get a kinetic assault - a virtual gallery of fetishistic cliches pulled from two decades of witless 'style over substance' action clunkers.After Scott is done, there are few survivors left in the water, but Keira Knightley is there to machine gun the stragglers. She's awful. Utterly miscast. Utterly unbelievable.A noxious if not downright toxic stew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of what is a Good Story","review":"+ Keira Knightley is inevitably attractive.+ Supporting actors, specifically \\"Domino's\\" partners, have a few brief shining moments.- Everything else...- Shots do not stay still for more then one to five seconds. I am not joking when I, in a guestimate, say that the longest shot in the film might be maybe eight or nine seconds, tops.- Way too over the top. Instead of banking on realism, they went for what could be deemed as immature: they blew high-rise towers up, cut off arms, and had random lap-dances in the midst of a group of Southern-Cal gang-bangers.- Just overall stupidity of it all. The movie reaches for emotional moments, and then executes them with the sort of banality that leaves your mouth as dry as Arizona in the summer. The action scenes are ill-contrived and, again, once executed, feel pasty, phony, and just, well, fake.Overall: One of the worst movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOMINO IS A FUN RIDE - ENJOY IT, DON'T ANALYSE IT","review":"If you like tough chicks like Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Garner, then Kiera Knightly's character in this film will break your heart. I believe this movie is meant to just be entertainment. Take it with a grain of sand and you will probably enjoy it more. It is in the same vain as a movie like \\"Snatch\\" or \\"Way of the Gun\\". The movie gets comical and absurd as it goes on, but it works. It's absurdity is well thought out and everything that is said and done gets tied back into the plot somehow. And she even tells you as the narrator of this story that she doesn't care how much of it you believe to be fact. I take that as a lot of it could be made up or even symbolic of what might have really happened. This gives the comedy and absurdity of the movie even more leeway - not to take everything at face value but to comprehend what it is supposed to mean at the time. \\"Domino\\" is fun ride - enjoy it, don't analyse it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mess","review":"Gave me a headache and after watching all that I could stand I fast forwarded through the rest.

The story of Bounty Hunter, Domino Harvey, is a very interesting story. Just achingly full of potential for an excellent writer,director, and EDITOR(s) to make a fantastic movie from.Some years ago, HBOFilms did a movie based on the life and times of theUSA's first supermodel,Gia Carangi. Angelina Jolie played the lead role in this movie ( the title was GIA ). What a GREAT movie.

While Keira and a few of her co-stars did some reasonable acting, their 'boss', the bondsman, was horrible. That with the senseless jumping around made me find something more exciting... like watching the grass grow.I would give it zero stars if I could.

It is a story of the young woman lost upon untimely death of her father. Craving love, acceptance and trying to make her own way in the real world, Domino opts to become a bounty hunter - the least likely place for a girl with her background. It is an ultimate rebellion effort towards her mother, people she is surrounded with day in and day out and her attempt for self-acceptance by acting out tough. I did not know that Ms. Domino Harvey has died of an overdose in 2005 until I researched her a bit more, after learning that movie is based on the real person and real events.

Gods (or goddesses)at the DMV! Christopher Walken!And one hell of a final shootout parody at the end where half the world is shooting at each other and Keira Knightley is the \\"last man standing\\"!Yeah... right!THIS IS A COMEDY AND ALL THE CRITICS MISSED IT.

The main problem is that too many genres are involved in this DVD. At times it seems like the producers are trying to mix action, thriller, and gangster movie scenes into this movie, which give the viewer the idea that this movie can't make up its mind about what it really wants to be!

The story, although not an exact account of the life of Model turned Bounty Hunter Domino Harvey, it is very enjoyable to watch.The cast is amazing (Mo'nique is crazy and this movie made me like her, seeing her outside the sitcom scene).The whole Mescaline in the coffee bit and the ensuing chaos afterwards continues to have me reeling every time I watch ths movie, but the whole visual display of the overall movie just adds to it's mania.I love this movie.

Her lap dance scene is breathtaking. She doesn't even remotely resemble the real Domino Harvey though. Mickey Rourke gives a very believable, gritty performance, but Christopher Walken is just plain nuts.Anyone who loves a rocking shoot-em-up action film won't be disappointed, just be warned that it's pretty far out there and you'll need to put reality on hold for the 128 minutes of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Domino","review":"tried to rent this movie from 2 different video stores.

It was also the subject of a bait and switch advertising campaign. This movie was billed as a based on real life adventure movie about a fashion model who bebame a bounty hunter. Domino is anything but that.Domino is an exercise in Hollywood indulgence in death and violence and being as sick and disgusting as possible while avoiding the NC-17 rating. It was utterly vile and features what may well be the single most violent dismemberment scene ever committed to film.Moviegoers should boycott all future flicks made by any of the people involved with this movie. The people who made this wretched excuse for a motion picture are nothing but vile scum who would be involved in any movie project just for the money and for no other consideration but the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Blu-Ray","review":"The director felt that to make a good movie you tint it yellow and green, sometimes make the shots dimly lit with a sort of strob like effect, don't stay on a single shot for more than 3.5 nano-seconds, and use a clever dialog consisting mostly of the same four letter word over and over again. It just did not work for me. I never made it to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DOMINO has FALLEN!","review":"If this film had not claimed it was based \\"on a true story...sort of\\" right at the opening, I would have thought it's faily entertaining.It became a bad joke when one person had his whole right arm shot off by one of Domino fellow bounty hunters. Yet, he's still able to shout loudly to his mother asking her to give the hunters the money! There are quite a few nonsense scenes like that.There is a lot of shooting and action. If you're watching it for facts, you'll be disappointed. If you want entertainment, it will help a little bit. Overall, it's disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent mess ....... take a","review":"british bounty hunter, the former cast of Beverley Hills 90210, Christopher Walken, an incoherent mess of a plot, all filmed in a drug infused style that gives new meaning to the term bad trip.

Asinine."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain annoying!","review":"The photographic technique alone leaves you wincing and disconnected. I call it \\"jerky\\".

It is a serious professional equipment that outperforms most cards in the pro market in terms of audio fidelity, versatility, stability and cost performance ratios. Any studio of any size/settings will find this sound card exceptionally useful and helpful if the user knows what to do with it in multi-tracking, mastering and post productions etc. It is indeed a high quality sound card that delivers amazing sonic performance and standards that meet today recording studios' demands and projects' requirements.

The dog loved it, he played with it non-stop (quack! quack!). When he finally destroyed it though we were shocked. Inside of this toy in addition to the stuffing we found a rubber band and parts of a plastic bag. My friend was fortunate enough to get the toy away from the dog before he could consume these items. We did complain to the manufacturer who said they'd look into it, but I would still be wary of this toy.I think this would be a great toy for a dog that loves it's toys, but doesn't rip them to shreds! There is no guarantee that what you find inside will be safe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but doesn't last long","review":"Our Golden Retriever loves this toy. But it doesn't last long.

She plays with it . . . allows us to throw it for her . . . and even sleeps with it. She often just nuzzles and nibbles at it as she loves the noises it makes. After several months, it has begun to disintegrate as she has continued to play . . . and the stuffing started coming out of its neck. I've taken the duck away from her until I can sew it back together.

I have several of her older albums on CD, but the vocal quality of this disc is far superior. I only wish there were a more comprehensive collection of her more recent work (aside from the 5-disc \\"Eartha-quake\\" box set covering her early work). Many people don't realize that she has continued to record throughout the 90's, but it is very difficult to track down these recordings. She performs several of these newer songs during her current performances; yet, there is nowhere for these recordings to be found. Still, \\"Purrfect Greatest Hits\\" is a great collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection","review":"I love Eartha Kitt, but can't afford to accumulate all her work.

I switched to the factory lens and matched the focal length then did an MTF comparison between the two with a 5.4 degree diagonal 10% - 90% brightness transition. The MTF curves were proof that the lens was truly junk. Often MTF values at F/8 dropped to 30. Wide open the MTF dropped to 18 and was a wavy line. Having evaluated it I returned it and stayed with OLY's lens, which all things considered isn't that bad. Don't bother with this one - you'll wonder why things are not working. Perhaps the more expensive sigmas are worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive is sometimes cheap","review":"I recently bought this lens to get better macro shots wusing my Olympus Evolt 500. It was inexpensive and worth the shot. Well, inexpensive = cheap! Even on a tripod the pictures are often a little blurred and ALWAYS grainy and dark. I bought the same lens but from Olympus and, though I cannot get as close, the pictures are flawless! And the Olympus is also a very powerful wide angle lens. The lesson here, for me, is to save my pennies for a lens build for my camera - especially my Olympus cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I bought this after reading the other reviews on this item. I AM NOT disappointed. It may be a little slow, but for closeup shots of flowers, insects, etc., I was overwhelmed. The detail and color were amazing.

It seems way outdated and not up to todays standards in any department. I would rather have bought something else"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down the best game in the series! Too bad it's the last entry!","review":"After playing Ep. 1, I was hooked. Ep. 2's story was really good, but the game was setup in such a way that if you didn't complete the BORING sidequests, you essentially didn't stand a chance against many of the bosses. Ep. 3 laid all of my fears to rest, as the story started strong and kept me glued to the screen for hours at a time (18 hours in one sitting). To complement this, the battle system was streamlined to a more traditional \\"final fantasy-esque\\" format. The real treat was the complete overhaul of the mech battles. Fans of Xenogears will feel right at home with how Monolith redesigned these battles. Graphically, the game delivers some of the best visuals I've seen on the PS2. The soundtrack, though not as strong as that of Ep. 1, certainly delivers the feel of an epic sci-fi adventure a la Star Wars/Star Trek. If you crave an engrossing story and an exceptional audiovisual experience, you won't go wrong with this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I loved Xenogears and when it was known that they were going to bring out xenosaga I was so looking forward to it. Well 1 didn't disapoint which led to 2.!! Then there was 2, well talk about a letdown. Then the talk of 3 started. At first I was unsure if I wanted to lay down any more money and be disapointed yet again... But WOW am I glad I did. It was a beauty to watch and play. Many of the answers from games 1 and 2 can be found it breath taking cut scenes. Im not going to spoil things for you but just to say WOW isnt enough to discribe the CGI's and twist and turns. I just hope you enjoy this game as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xenosage Episode III","review":"Xenosaga is a great game no matter which episode you play.This one is as good as the first one.

The music in this game is good, and definately got the job done, but the guy who composed the music for xenosaga 1 is waaayyy better. Other than that, solid charaters, good battle system, decent graphics, all makes this a pretty good game to play. The ending was also good, although a bit confusing, and all the characters had a good send off. If you played the first two xenosaga games, you should definately play this one to see how it all ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Satisfying Finale","review":"Pros: Interesting plot, memorable characters, memorable locations, great music, great graphics, good voice acting, fun battle system(s), satisfying sidequests, fast load times, great ending, no loose endsCons: The story is at times \\"told\\" rather than \\"shown\\" (probably because this series was supposed to be 6 games originally.) You will be constantly toyed with by Xenogears allusions, though any connection between the two never consolidates. Status ailments are irritating and ubiquitous.Other thoughts: If only the other two games were as good as this one, perhaps this series could have continued on. Everything wrong in Episode II was rectified and then improved on. Though it's not perfect, it makes up for Episode II's relative failure effectively enough that I can recommend the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Had high hopes for this prop, it could've been better, but when whoever packed it used a box too small and just shoved it in there.

While understandable - it is a shame. For it is Massenet's last masterpiece. How can you take a 900 page novel and compress it into an hour and a half opera? Massenet does. He strips it down to essentials while giving Dulcinea a greater part. The music is suffused with Spanish flavor - a kind of companion piece to Carmen. Fortunately Teatro Verdi, Trieste has given us a consolation in this beautiful production. The singing is at least adequate and often more than. The production is spare but imaginative - yes the windmills are there. Like the original this is an homage to the vanished age of chivalry and Massenet brings the Don to affecting operatic life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read Book For Everyone!","review":"For as old as this book is, it is incredible how the information is pertinent to today's drinking water issues.

The secrets of the Michelli family and the Barrett family are untangled through the series and take twists and turns that kept me turning the pages. Lance and Rose are such an interesting couple whom I really wanted to meet. Rose appears to be an emotional closed off woman who works in construction and seems to be denying her softside, yet she is a caretaker to her best friend and as the books go on, to other characters who come into her life. Lance can come across as the New York wisecracker, but underneath it is a man who longs to be totally used by God.

I read this on my Kindle (it was a free download). It was at about 50% through that 90% of the book became about religion, the bible and converting non-believers. At 80% through, I decided to read the last two chapters - I NEVER do this. I'm so glad I did. I did not need anything in between to get from where I was to the end.

I understand her strength and what she has dealt with it but I don't think there is a woman alive who would take as long as she did to come around. OR, maybe there should have been more stress on the timing of the story, a resistance because they haven't known eachother long, which is also true. But she seems so wishy-washy. It's irritating for someone to be so wishy-washy for TWO AND A HALF BOOKS while the love interest is so completely lovable. Give the man some REASON to like her because she just isn't likable!

Very frustrating, and it really interrupts the rhythm of reading.I loved the premise of this book and I wanted to like it! I think the characters are fun and lovable, in a beautiful setting, and the story grabs you right away. I am so disappointed!

The plot just kept rolling, unveiling one unexpected revelation after another.

Compelling read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read ALL the reviews first!","review":"I enjoyed the characters and the story line themes but about 40% into the book it started going overboard on the religious preaching. References here and there are fine, but I don't like it when a book is used to try and coerce the reader into following along with the religion of the characters just to reach the end of the story - UNLESS of course, the book is specifically described as such. I connected with the characters, and wanted to see them through to the end, but after awhile, I just had to give up and decided I didn't want to observe an old lady or a young male trying to convince a strong adult female that she needed to accept Jesus to feel whole in her life. NOT my cup of tea at all. I just got the feeling it was bait and switch - a new theme of books perhaps? I just hope that isn't true. I'll definitely read all the reviews now, and if one says it's \\"not preachy at all - I'll assume it is preachy!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets indeed","review":"This has a little of everything.

It is first and foremost a celebration of words- the language is poetic and often beautiful. This is not an epic adventure, it is not a new age creed disguised as a novel, it is not breathless and it's not a novel that I was so gripped by that I was unable to put it down.Rather, this is a novel best appreciated quietly and slowly. Savor the words and turn the ideas over in your head, to see whether you personally find them to be valuable. Enjoy the atmosphere and the story. Appreciate the teller of this tale for her strengths and weaknesses. Enjoy this book as you would enjoy poetry, and I do not think you will be disappointed. I enjoyed the book, though it saddens me. I will recommend it to friends, and I will scan it's pages for those turns of phrase that particularly speak to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking story","review":"'Confessions of a Pagan Nun' is a wonderful written book. It tells the life history of Gwynneve a woman born a Pagan and trying very hard to become a Christian later on in life. The story questions the truth behind Christian beliefs. For example she writes \\"But if suffering makes saints, then all the people of this land are saints\\". Writing about Saint Paul and Saint Augustine's connection of self-disgust with righteousness her thoughts are \\"Self-hatred seems to me an evil thing in itself rather than an antidote to evil. If we practice self-hatred, then the sacrifices we make of ourselves and our lives is not sacred, for it is then a gift of something we hate rather than of something that we have nurtured and loved.\\" Readers will find that many of the thoughts and questions Gwynneve has are still accurate today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Pleasure","review":"I began the story of Gwynneve with little expectation of what the story may hold. I honestly picked it up at the book store because I have been to Ireland and the photo of the clochan caught my eye. I was thrilled to find the story quite captivating. Although the first couple of pages didn't thrill me, I am delighted that I pressed on. The author writes in a simple style, however, the simplicity of the language holds the beauty of the story. In her simple, small view of the world around her, Gwynneve recites the story of her simple life...a woman raised pagen...trained as a druid and scribe...\\"converted\\" to a Christianity. She experiences life and death, love and loss, and stuggles as the world around her changes. The end of the story is so moving, I actually read the last paragraph twice. I was outraged and saddened. Then I sat back and contemplated who were the truly God-less ones in her tale...the pagans or the Christians???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum Novel","review":"It would be a pleasure to read a monograph about the early Christian church in Ireland and its relationship to Celtic nature religion and practice. This is the book Kate Horsley should have written, but the novel she wrote is tedious. Although I expected \\"Confessions of a Pagan Nun\\" to be a fictional account of the this period in Ireland, the motivation of the characters is not dramatic, the \\"story\\" is boring and too wordy. I always try to give books \\"the 50 page test\\" but I couldn't read 50 pages of this book. Then I leafed through it searching for historical research, but gave up on that also. Then I gave the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically problematic","review":"Just the number of times y, w, or v show up in proper names is proof that Gaelic language and culture did not have a stong influence on this book. Gwynneve is simply not an Irish name.RE:\\"Gwynneve is born into a world suspended between paganism and Christianity: Ireland circa 500 C.E. While the rest of Europe was well on its way toward Christianity, at this time Ireland remained much closer to its pagan traditions\\"Yes it was a world suspended between paganism and Christianity, but it was Ireland which was well on its way toward Christianity, something large swaths of northern Europe would not be doing for a while yet.Good romantic fantasy? Maybe. Good historical novel? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well done","review":"First, let me say that I am amazed at the people that don't understand that when a book says 'a novel' on the front that means fiction. Gwynneve was/is not real and the translator's intro is fake--merely a literary device. This is an historically weak, vague book and the random Gaelic thrown in for perspicuity instead makes it awkward and disjointed. There is no history or research evident and the story is meandering and a bit boring.

When contacting customer service we were told that there were no replacement parts available for our model and there was nothing we could do and nothing they would do for us.

He'll be missed, but his music will live on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks the immediacy of FOLSOM, but more than satisfies","review":"Like FOLSOM before it, AT SAN QUENTIN captures Cash and his band playing live before about 1,000 rowdy and emotional inmates, feeding off their energy to create another memorable performance. There is a bit of a staged feeling to this one that I didn't find in AT FOLSOM PRISON; the song selection focusing on prison life and gospel music, with a double shot of the song \\"San Quentin\\" that made the prisoners happy but felt a bit forced to me. But there are many highlights here as Cash's energy continues to build from his take on Shel Silerstein's \\"A Boy Named Sue,\\" that became a novelty hit for Cash, to the wild \\"The Old Account was Settled Long Ago\\" where everyone gets into the act and closing with a hard driving medley of hits that ends the concert at full tilt. While it lacks the immediacy of AT FOLSOM PRISON, AT SAN QUENTIN serves as a valuable companion piece and a reminder of the power this man had over an audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic Jewel","review":"I gave this a four star rating only because I think his Live at Folsom Prison is a little better than this recording.It is great to hear his music as well as his banter with the inmates.It is a must buy for any Johnny Cash Fan either long time or new listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This album is not quite as good as at Folsom, however it is still a great live album to have in your collection.

The new songs that were added are also top notch. Not for the kids though some profanity. The gospel songs are terrific. The interviews on the insert give it quite the context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Cash at his best!","review":"Live at San Quentin is one of best live albums that I have heard, perhaps only topped by Live at Folsom Prison. The more polished performances at San Quentin nicely complement the raw energy of Folsom Prison. Fans of Cash's studio releases will likely be surprised by how much cooler these live versions are. Highlights include Big River, I Walk the Line, I Still Miss Someone, Folsom Prison Blues, Ring of Fire, and of course the song that sent this album to the top of the charts, A Boy Named Sue. A great summary of the first half of Johnny Cash's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT FOLLOW-UP TO FOLSOM PRISON!","review":"\\"Johnny Cash at San Quentin,\\" the followup to his brilliant \\"Folsom Prison\\" recording, is another brilliant album from the Man in Black.

If you are looking to buy a Johnny Cash album you SHOULD have this cd. Considering this was recorded in 1969 (in a prison no less) the recording is extraordinary. Many of the classics are on here, Big River, A Boy Named Sue, and Folsom Prison Blues to name a few. Johnny Cash is too sincere not to be appreciated.

Also, this book does not provide detailed coverage of MDX.My only complaint would be that the book is sometimes overwhelming. I believe this is due more to the subject matter than Teo's presentation.However, if you are interested in OLAP/Data Mining as it relates to MSAS there is no better book in my opinion.

The new songs 'My Mistake' and 'Running Away' are really awesome and are now 2 of my many favorites by them. The re-recording of 'Punk Rawk Show' is just stellar. It blows the original away! The remixed versions of 'Tommorows Another Day', and 'Let It Happen' are very awesome. Although it isn't a new song 'Broken Bones' is new to me and let me tell you, it's a very catchy sing along song. The only thing I can say I was disappointed in was the fact that they didn't put in certain songs I was hoping for like 'Under Lock and Key', 'I'm OK You're OK', and 'Party at my house'. Those 3 are favorites and are classics of the 'buffalo' and should have been on this album. That's the only complaint I have. If you like mxpx and want to hear their best stuff including the most recent material go and grab this one folks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First experience in Punk Rock. And its great!","review":"Hi! I just bought MXPX ten years and running, and I love it! Punk Rawk Show is my favorite song, by far, and I know my friends will be borrowing this CD from me often. It is quite a bit harder then I'm used to, but I still like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe Best of the Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is their best CD!!! No arguement! Even their redone songs sound better! The new Punk Rawk Show puts the old to shame. A definate buy! If you are a \\"punk\\" fan, who seems to think that in order to be punk, you have to have songs that all sound the same, and all their cds have to sound like that, this isn't for you. But if you are a real PUNK fan, you'll love it. Oh yeah for the atheist out there ( no offence but your beliefs don't make since) these guys are Christian, which meens they are going to teel you he truth about the world, not some hokey story about how material things make you happy, and how many women you have to sleep with to be \\"cool\\", this is good music. There beliefs make since. I mean come on, how can something as intricate as the eye just sort of evolved? If you ask me evolution, rationalism, and atheism just don't make since, they're about as funny as Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Get this CD if you want truth in your life!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Compilation of an Awesome Band","review":"This is a great CD! It really shows all of MxPx...having some of their newer more \\"poppy\\" sound as well as some of the more hardcore punk from the \\"Pokinatcha\\" days. The only complaint is I would have liked to see some more songs off of \\"Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo\\" on this CD.If you are new to MxPx, you should buy this album to hear what their complete sound is. If you are a huge MxPx fan like me, buy this album to support the band. It also has a 32 page booklet that has lot's of pictures and a middle section with a complete time-line of the bands progress. A great item for the ultimate fan! I have all of their CD's (therefore, all of the songs except the two new ones) but I bought this CD anyway. It definetely wasn't a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD sucks donkey, don't buy it.","review":"I love punk music. This isn't it. I hate this CD so much I had to share it with anyone else that was considering possibly buying it. In retrospect, I don't even know why I bought this christian pop \\"punk\\" CD. It's all crap songs about the same stupid subjects. Check out some better stuff: Suicide Machines, Rancid, Bouncing Souls, Avail, Dropkick Murphy's. Do not support this corruption of Punk music."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Christian\\" ??","review":"If you want to listen to this junk... that's up to you.But do NOT be decieved... this kind of music has NOTHING to do with my King, Jesus Christ, or the concept of being His follower (Christianity).If you think you are a Christian... don't you know that he who is a friend of this world is an enemy of God?We're supposed to be IN the world; NOT OF the world.Amen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of MxPx","review":"This CD is sweet. The 2 new songs, \\"Running Away\\" and \\"My Mistake\\" are excellent. The re-recording of \\"Punk Rawk Show\\" is also pretty good. One of the reviews on here was complaining about how MxPx isn't Christian. Well, if your looking for a Christian punk band, check out Ace Troubleshooter or Relient K. MxPx has said in the past that they are not a Christian band, they are \\"Christians in a band.\\" This is the perfect CD for both a new MxPx listener and a big fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose Lonely Planet","review":"While Fodor's name is a truly reputable one, I would not suggest that this guide book be your only source of information. I went with a friend of the summer and found it to be a wonderful time to go. The book suggests not to go during the so called \\"rainy season,\\" but it was beautiful then. We never missed a day do to rain. The book also tells its reader that the country is easy to travel by bus---rent a car if you have less than 2 weeks. There is too much to see. If you are looking for the most accurate and up to date information on Costa Rica choose Lonely Plant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is Aishwarya Rai on the cover of this classics CD?","review":"I like this CD just fine, but I have a picky issue with the packaging. It confused me to find that the \\"Gold\\" refers to a classic Bollywood era roughly 1960-1980. I was expecting a more contemporary collection because World Music slapped Aishwarya on the cover as an obvious marketing ploy. Why not one of the heartthrobs of the era?The songs all have great character; the info in the booklet about performers and careers is nice; the extra data track interview with DJ Ritu is half good (she is interesting - the interviewer, unfortunately, is a dork who seems prepared only with superficial questions); some of the songs make me want to seek out the movies, and it was nice to hear the live, very rare version of R.D. Burman singing his own Mehbooba Mehbooba (though I think I like the version in Sholay better)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great kit for making your first cloth doll.","review":"I enjoyed making this doll. Alicia Merrett's kit includes good quality materials, plus an instruction book. The book includes the full-sized pattern pieces and many colored illustrations of the doll-making process.I would definitely recommend this kit for first-time cloth doll makers. The only problem I had was with the dress pattern. The bodice pattern pieces were too small, so I had to alter them. I used my own fabrics for the doll clothes because I didn't like the bright red polka dot fabric included in the kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointed","review":"I just attempted to use this product for baking a couple of days ago and was so very dissappointed. I have used a few different brands of Date Sugar and have never had a clumping problem. I believe most of the companies who produce date sugar have to cut some oat flour into it so it doesn't just form one sticky lump. This is how Bob's Red Mill Date Sugar is...one big 24-oz block of sticky lump. I had to pound and pound on the mound of date sugar and attempt to whittle away at it with a knife. I thought I had pulverized it enough to bake with it and boy was I wrong. When I poured the batter into loaf pans, it had big red clumps of date sugar poking out of the batter. I picked out what lumps were visible but when I cut into the finished product, it had patches throughout that were sticky and felt like the bread was not done. I could tell these patches were from the clumps of date sugar. I was so very sad I bought this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Date sugar","review":"I just didn't use up this product. The sugar came as a solid hunk and I had to grate it in order to use it. Made a sticky mess all over my kitchen counter. Came four packs to the package and I still have three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely NOT NTSC format - too bad.","review":"I'm a Trenet fan and thought, \\"Great! A 2-DVD set of him - and in NTSC format!\\" Well, this is the second time I've bought this item and the second time it turned out to be PAL (European) format. So, ignore the AMAZON description - it's wrong. I'm thinking it might be time to buy a Region and Format-free player. Still, darn it! I can't give zero/neutral stars for not being to see it. I'm giving this an optimistic five stars because I THINK it's that good. Sorry, Mssr. Trenet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!!","review":"This is weak. Do we need a bad cover of \\"Get Together\\"? The liner notes state that this is better than Grand Funk. Sorry!There should also be no mention of Uriah Heep concerning this cd. They are nothing like that band. I'm listening to Lucifer right now and I'm ready to go to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bar band, and not a very good one","review":"This Cd is a real disappointment. For starters, with a name like Lucifer, you expect something more dark and atmospheric. This is just some early 70's bar band who manages maybe two good songs out of this entire disc. Most of the time, though, they're rather dull. To make matters worse, this sounds like it came from a vinyl copy in less than perfect condition. During I'm Gonna Make It (probably the best cut on the disc), there's the popping so familiar to those of us that grew up before the CD generation. I love music from this time period, and buy lots of it, but I have to say you should avoid this disc. There's just much better groups to spend your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Disappointing","review":"One type of movie I strongly dislike is one where the characters in the story are missing. All I can see in this type of movie are actors working in front of a camera to a script. I did not buy any of the actors in Polisse as cops. They are merely nice looking people doing an acting gig.I felt no engagement with the cop-characters, and, generally, felt manipulated by the stories, with the exception of the young rape victim giving birth. That was quite moving.I have no idea about the motivation for the action of the final scene. My only thought while watching it was \\"good rittance.\\"A more interesting movie would examine why each of these cops has chosen to work in this particular branch of police work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this movie","review":"Unfortunately this French movie deals mostly with the Child Protection Unit's Officers' personal and family issues, when it should have focused on the abused children and their families."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy","review":"The best buy I have done since long time.. a hands on tool for hospitality and restaurant professionals.. Packed of tips, hints and the Truth.. I have started using some examples while still reading this book. I think a must for every manager and boss in this industry.. I learned a lot and opened my eyes again, remembered things forgotten and implemented tricks from the book.. this book is every cent worth spent.. And fun reading too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restaurant Service \\"Bible\\"","review":"If you own or work in the restaurant business this is a must read. I had this a number of years ago when I worked at the Chart House. Recently a restaurateur asked me to help with the expanding of their business and I ordered several of these books. I knew it was good but had forgotten how great it is. If you are in the business, by following just 1 or 2 of the great insights provided you will pay the cost of the book it one night - after that the rest of the money you make is all gravy. Just follow the instruction and practice what they preach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Service that WORKS","review":"I have been using this book in every business I have run for the last 20 years and it has no equal. I used to keep a box of them in my office and I would hand one to every first time customer service person that came into my business. It is easy to read and simple to understand. The lessons in the book have real world relevance to employees of any age, and the skills that are taught are easily put into immediate use. Service in this country is a declining art and this book helps entry level people begin the journey to reverse that trend. Look for the workbook and video tools as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid","review":"\\"Cute\\" is a generous descriptor for shallow \\"Filthy Rich.\\" I liken it to a a funny Saturday Night Live sketch that's stretched into a painful feature-length film. Instead, pick up Bridget Jones' Diary or Getting Over It by Anna Maxted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filthy Rich","review":"The other reviews on this book were funnier than the book. \\"Cripplingly Funny\\", \\"better than Bridget Jones Diary\\" -- what is happening to people's sharp wit? An \\"easy reader\\" by a woman with no real sense of humor. No imagination was put into this book at all. This book is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This novel didn't meet my expectations. I found it contrived and utterly predictable. The heroine, Marcy, was forgettable, and the plot was formulaic. If you want to read something sharp and witty about a savvy young woman staging a comeback after a public humiliation, try Slave to Fashion by Rebecca Taylor or Shopaholic Takes Manhattan by Sophie Kinsella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Stereotypes","review":"Longing to read about the desperate single woman, the Jewish mother, the self-absorbed dentist boyfriend? It's all here. At least, it was all there in the first 40 pages, which was as far as I got. This all seems dated and silly, and now that the Millionare TV show syndrome isn't what it used to be, basing a whole book on TV shows seems deja vu. Maybe if your entire life revolves around television, finding a husband (even an awful, boring one), and fighting with your mother over being single, you'll get farther in your reading than I did. I felt as ripped off as a contestant given a question about the \\"Faerie Queen\\" instead of one about the Mary Tyler Moore Show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal and boring","review":"If you have ever watched \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\" (and who hasn't?), there is nothing original about this book. The author's characters are predictable and boring. The game show host in this book is a carbon copy of Regis, down to his wardrobe and morning TV show gig. Even the game show setting is exactly the same. Though you like the main character at first, she quickly becomes boring and tiresome, and the new \\"mystery\\" man is far fetched and contrived. It's sad, because the story could have been fun if only it had a little more depth and originality. Unless you're related to the author and are trying to help her income, I wouldn't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Spoof of Today's Pop Culture","review":"What with stars being made out of absolute nobody's from various reality TV shows and the likes of Kato Kaelin and such, this novel really takes the ball and runs with it. Marcy Lee Mallowitz is a literal nobody \\"Personal Life Coach\\" and former closet organizer who gets thrust into the media spotlight for being dumped on national TV. However, since she has such a high Q ratio (likeability factor), the whole world is sending her presents in order to get an interview with her. She is the hottest thing since Darva Conger. You will laugh hysterically and relate to the crazy shennanigans because similar things happen in the newspaper every day. This novel really pokes fun at who becomes a media darling in this country. Let's hope that the author writes quickly. I'm a definite fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read","review":"Hurray for Marcy Lee Mallowitz, the 34-year-old personal life coach who is the appealing heroine of this hilarious page-turner. Marcy becomes a quasi-celeb when dumped on network TV by her doltish orthodontist boyfriend following a disastrous gig as his Lifeline on the game show \\"So You Want to Be Filthy Rich!\\" Her world turns upside down as Oprah, Diane and Rosie come knocking, and a mystery man enters her life. With tongue firmly planted in cheek, the author examines contemporary questions of fame, celebrity and personal fulfillment through the eyes of characters who are as memorable for their humanity as for the predicaments that make this book such a hoot. Dorothy Samuels's book is a must-read. And that's my absolute final answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do it for me","review":"Maybe the story was too contrived, but I found myself skipping big chunks of it and not missing anything.

If you're looking for a fast, funny read, try this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRITE","review":"This book lacks ANY clever jokes or storyline. I agree with the \\"elementary school reading\\" comment. I bought this because of the Bridget Jones reference-well Helen Fiedling should be offended if anyone uses her name in reviewing this book. The jokes are very lame-and immature. I couldn't even finish it.don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":":(:(","review":"I felt like I was reading the same chapter over and over again.

It bought it and I have enjoyed it ever since. It is a masterpiece and I am certain that Jean-Baptiste Lully is one of the greatest composers of opera in history.The cast of Atys is first class and many will recognise names amongst the chorus and orchestra - John Holloway (violin), Christoph Rousset (harpsichord), Stephen Stubbs (lute), Marc Minkowski (bassoon), V��ronique Gens (soprano), Herv�� Niquet (tenor), etc. Yes, even the \\"rank & file\\" members of the cast of Atys are that good!The whole thing is glorious and beautiful from start to finish. Listen \\"La Sommeil\\" from Acte III (track 9, disc 2) and you'll be hooked!A triumph for William Christie and Les Arts Florissants and one of the best recordings they made for Harmonia Mundi France.

I'm talking about the 7th symphony, the 8th is pretty lousy.You get clear playing, fast speeds, even some thrilling timpani here and there but everything is for nothing because this whole cycle suffers from a very low level recording quality, it is far too distant to make much of an impact. If you know the 7th symphony, you know it can make quite an impact. The finale under Abbado is taken extremely fast, even faster than Karajan and Karajan was the fastest around! Because of Abbado's manic speed, the rhythmic articulation suffers and it feels like it's smoothed over and feels like soup, instead of fire and lighting. There needs to be more contrast! You would be better off looking somewhere else for a great 7th, you would be even better off just passing on this Abbado cycle altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best barbeque","review":"We have a Hasty Bake and got this one for our son.

I suggest this book for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Viking metal...from Spain?","review":"You don't typically turn to Spain for Viking-themed death metal, but it's hard to argue with the results of Liar Flags, the debut album from Runic. At heart, Liar Flags is essentially an album modeled after the Swedish melodic death metal style with a Viking theme and a liberal use of keyboards and symphonic elements. Think At the Gates meets Amon Amarth with traces of Children of Bodom and Hollenthon. Of course, Runic isn't quite on the same level as those bands, but this is only their first album, and an impressive one at that. The use of symphonic elements, powerful melodies, and non-traditional instruments definitely help the album stand out from the rest of the death metal pack.Viking metal purists may turn their noses at this album (these guys aren't really Norsemen after all), but I think Liar Flags has enough going for it to make it a worthwhile purchase for extreme metal fans looking for something new and different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runic = best band ever!!!","review":"What can i say about this band, this is just wow!I cerntainly didn't know this band until i stumbled upon looking for some other viking metal band.Runic mixes viking metal with pagan,symphonic, folk and melodic death metal elements which just sounds amazing.My favorit song in the whole album would probably have to be \\"ambush\\" because there is some great guitar parts in this song. The best part of the song is probably the really catchy chorus. There is an amazing guitar solo around 2:39 so mark it. Around the end of the song comes in a very low, almost death metal voice that reminds me kind of like Hypocrisy type vocals, which just sounds so amazing.I really love this band, this band is by far the best viking metal band i have heard, yes even better than ensiferum.So thanks for reading my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic book to begin to really learn astrology","review":"This first book in a series of five is a wonderful way to begin learning astrology.

Raquela's life story follows the turbulent story of the founding of Israel. Although it was a biography, it read like a novel. Sadly I learned that time has not changed very much for Israel.

I was thrilled to see it in Kindle form, and couldn't wait to purchase and reread it. It was even better than I remembered.

I accidentally found it again as a kindle book and purchased it. The story of this woman's life is fascinating and I could hardly put it down. Her life mirrors the fight for an Israeli state and she was involved in many crucial events. The author helps you to see the world through Raquela's eyes. I read this book along with a story of a Palestinian doctor from GazaI Shall Not Hate: A Gaza Doctor's Journey on the Road to Peace and Human Dignity. Together, they provided in interesting look at people on opposing sides of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. I liked and was able to sympathize with both people and both sides. Both memoirs had the same theme - everyday Palestinians and Israeli's want and can live together in peace. Regular people do not dislike each other, but they do have very different life experiences. My college age daughter also read both books and found them also a great pair to read together."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the better books I've read this summer....","review":"I was inspired to read this book when my son went to Israel this summer.It was a wonderful (true) story about a courageous Israeli nurse/midwife.

It was full of historical facts, and was so engrossing, I could not put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman of Israel","review":"I truly enjoyed this book! I love reading about the plight of Jews in the holocaust era. However, I had never read about the tribulation of Israel by the British and the neighboring states. This really enlightened me to the current concerns in Israel today. I live in Texas and I guess we have few Jews in this area, therefore I have little knowledge personnally of their seemingly undeserved persecution over the centuries. That they have endured is remarkable. That they have excelled is unbelievable. I want to thank Ruth Gruber, author, for bringing this particular story to our attention.

It was fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good personal glimpse into Israeli history","review":"Raquela was well written. The story, while a kind of biography, flowed like a novel. It gives a good personal account and perspective of the formative years of the young nation of Israel.

Well, the first version turned out to be really good too. It won a Gramophone Best Early Opera award when it was first released in 1982, and I can see how it deserved such a major award. The female leads are admirable in both recordings, with the scale tipping slightly in Lorraine Hunt's favor. It's Jason that made all the difference between the two recordings. Gilles Ragon was not a bad Jason, but he can't stand any comparison with the truly extraordinary haute-contre Mark Padmore in the 1995 recording. It's the difference between good and exceptional."},{"rating":"1","title":"12v Magnetic Trailer Lite Kit","review":"Product was defective from the factory, functions worked bacwards and others not at all.

I ignored his advice, and bought a product that, as factory wired, will not work on any car or truck known to man. The wiring is just plain idiotic. If you understand trailer wiring, they can be rewired to work correctly in about 5 minutes. If you don't, don't buy this product. It took two of us, neither of whom are great electricians, about 4 hours to figure out the correct wiring and to get them working. Since these inexpensive magnetic lights are sold by dozens of companies, It would be my guess that they all come from the same factory in China and are all wired incorrectly.

Not sure how many decibels (db) it pumps out, but it's pretty close to my vacuum cleaner. In a 200 sq.ft. room, you won't be able to sleep or watch TV or conduct a conversation with this air conditioner on, granted!2) It doesn't cool our room (280 sq.ft) well. They say it's 8,000 BTU. Well, I would subjectively say it's closer to 6,000 than 8,000. The outcoming air is just marginally cooler than the room air. Also, the internal temperature sensor is off by about 5 degrees. Right now it shows 68'F, perhaps to look good and show that the A/C is doing it's job... However my wall room thermometer stands 72'F! Well, here in the U.S, we call this cheating.

He DOES have enviable imagingation. But Strieber has sold his soul to Hollywood. His second book in the series, \\"The Last Vampire\\" was pretty good, and he sold the rights for movie production (see the book's back flap.) Apparently, \\"Lillith\\" is an attempt at a sequel to that. It was filled with enough action-horror-film elements to impress a 14 year old boy. One can see the author's struggle to tell a passionate story colliding with his desire to make a cheap-**s movie script.The first two books in the series describe his vampire (Miriam) as a horrifying thing to be loved and feared, but she had dignity. She had an agenda that never slipped. This Lillith chick is just that--a chick with fangs. She doesn't know whether to enjoy her food or feel sorry for it. She doesn't know whether she is a creator or a monster. By the end of the book, neither do I!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How odd...but still delicious","review":"I love Whitley Strieber's books. I've ready them all, even the hard-to-find ones, and I can safely say this is one surprised me. It's just as good as the book's two predecessors (The Hunger and The Last Vampire), but it blows the whole thing wide open by giving us the vampire's point of view. You can't help but fall in love with Lilith. But amazingly, you love her because she, too, is a living, complicated being.If you're looking for the fantastic action and sexy mystique Whitley's books are famous for, you won't be disappointed. But this particular book goes down paths no other book in the genre has travelled before. It's an odd path, but it works.

This novel may not be terribly original, but it has some of the most vivid writing I have ever read, especially in the descriptions of Lilith's attempts to deal with the modern world; not only that, it doesn;t rely on gore to deliver the thrills, though it does have its horrific moments. On the minus side, it is, like I've said, not terribly original, there is some pointless name-dropping, and there is a glaring mistake in chapter 10 in which a woman throws her empty gun away, but then still has it two pages later. An A for effort, but a B (at best) for results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Tick release!","review":"We live rural and have tick issues.

A complex romantic comedy with strong farcial elements, Smiles of A Summer Night is quite different from most of Bergman's great films, though there are humorous elements in Wild Strawberries. Quite a few have compared Smiles to A Midsummer's Night's Dream, and this is appropriate. The theme of Smiles, the nature of love, is truly Shakespearean, as is the use of the intersecting plot lines and combination of irony and low comedy. As is typical for Bergman, the acting is superb, including a couple of actors seen repeatedly in Bergman films, Gunnar Bjornstrand and Harriet Andersson.

His training as an architect allows him to evaluate a broad array of International issues, and to generate creative and usually unexpected insights into ways of re-imagining solutions.If you despair over America's response to the world since 9/11, this book will serve as a useful antidote, showing what is possible with a healthy imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Nicholson Who Needs Him?","review":"This incredibly interesting man, who owns the single largest collection of bread clips in the world, was my professor. Please I hope you recognized my sarcasm for such outrageous excuse for an educator. I remember Nicholson's lecture on Ash Wednesday of 2003, where he showed an image of a sculptor creating a statue of Jesus and happened to be \\"working on\\" our Lord's genitals. If you want to read a book by this atheistic ignoramus, then be my guest. As for me, I would sleep better if he was fired from his over-paying job at The Illinois Institute of Technology, knowing he no longer has the power to warp the minds of young architects. And Benny, if you hate this country so much, then take your cardigans and stained teeth back to Britain."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRY BUILDING SOMETHING!","review":"Ben Nicholson is a theoretical architect from Britian where I go to school at IIT. He is the worst kind of food for a young persons mind. He is an unsympathetic jerk and it shows in this book. How he sees this as a tribute to all those innocent souls that were forced out of this world world against their will's, I'll never know. When he premiered this book to us as a guest lecturer, he gleemed at the idea of having an oppurtunity to thumb his nose at every American citizen as if to say it was our own fault for being dumb enough to let our government get away with making foriegn policey that brought about 9/11, thus we brought it on ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk through the neighborhood","review":"I read this book on the train coming home from Paris and could picture the building, the neighborhood and really got a feeling for the area. I only wish the book had been longer and had delved into the author's personal life in Paris a bit more. Maybe in Volume Two, one can hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical armchair travel book.","review":"If you have ever tried to research the history of your own home, you will be green with envy over the level of detail Karmel achieved not only about the structure but also about the neighborhood. Of course, Paris itself has a rich history that has been widely recorded. The author has very nicely dovetailed the history of Paris and its environs with the story of his pied-a-terre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got me through Europe","review":"I bought this book because of the reviews I read and it lived up to the hype. It came in handy in both routine and emergency situations - particularly when I had left my passport, money and credit cards on a train in Italy and had to communicate to the stationmaster in Genoa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy & Portable","review":"This books is great. It has many handy phrases that make traveling in Europe easier. Contrary to what most people believe, not everyone in other countries speak English.

Highly recommended for anyone learning one of these languages, especially those traveling to France, Germany or Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language Barriers...aarrgh","review":"Just got this book actually and has never spoken a lick of french. I bought it because I plan on doing an over nighter in Paris and figured it would be great to know at least a few basic words....but guess what I don't think I am getting it...LOL Otherwise it is a great reference guide. Small enough to carry around and not that bulky."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad I bought this book BEFORE going to Europe","review":"This book is full of practical advice and essential information that kept me from making some mistakes on our vacation this summer. Though I probably won't return to Europe for a few years, this book will stay in my bookshelves for future reference. I have always enjoyed Rick Steves' travel shows because of his down-to-earth, straight-forward style. The book follows that pattern perfectly. I highly recommend this book to any European travel novice."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY ENTHRALLING","review":"I already own a copy of Faure's ravishing \\"Requiem\\" (Dutoit conducting Te Kanawa & Milnes with the Montreal Symphony on London) but after listening to Herreweghe's truly superb Bach recordings, I wanted to see what his approach to more \\"modern\\" music would be. I have only had the Herreweghe in my home for two full weeks but have listened to it over one dozen times. It is simply enthralling: everything about it, from the cover art, to the essays, to the choice of a companion piece for the \\"Requiem\\" (Faure & Messager's \\"Mass of the Villerville Fishermen\\")to the superb chorus and soloists (no starry names here) and orchestra. This is a recording to treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary toy","review":"Bought this for a 2 1/2 year old. Did not come with book or video. Scared my grand-daughter, at first.

Needless to say I am a fan of Alma!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable book and song prop.","review":"This is the best book and song prop.

The spells are what really put me off, because even though the author considers herself a learned witch, she lists hexes and potions with titles like \\"for finding your soul mate\\". The simplistic spells aren't thought through and could have disastrous results. Not a good first book for young wiccans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I have to agree with one of the other posters. I cannot understand all of the positive reviews. While the insights into the era were interesting, the story wandered here and there. The references to celebrities seemed like so much name-dropping and did little to forward the plot. Speaking of which - what was the plot? Events occur with little insight into why the characters acted as they did. The ending was very unsatisfying and left many questions unanswered - except by that time I didn't care. Maybe it was the Kindle version, but there were often no separations between different story lines so that it skipped from one event to another without warning the reader of the change in characters and situations, making it difficult to follow at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy work","review":"bedtime for bonzo, starring ronald reagan and a monkey was not released until 1951, but reagan had already been in lots of other movies that could have been used, like \\"knute rockne, all american.\\" also: jen goes to dc on a train, arrives at union station but then they drive in from the airport! if these details are wrong, what else is? p.s. the book does not flow very well, very jumpy and then a sudden dead ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stage Door Canteen","review":"It's all here. From Hollywood and Broadway glitterati to the intrigue of New York during the \\"black-out\\". Stage Door Canteen brings you the flavor of WWII New York and the fighting men and women who lived through an era which decided the fate of the free world. From the British sea captain who could never really go home, to the aspirations of young actresses on Broadway, to the nightmares of a ball turret gunner; a gripping read page after page."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard to describe because it's so good","review":"This books prompts one to trot out superlatives such as marvellous, sweeping, epic, but at the same time, the focus on each character's lives is highly personal. They are so many story lines, each a book until itself, yet Ms. Davis has managed to weave them into a tapestry that is hypnotic.It's a book at is working on so many levels. A great book that deserves recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Tour de Force","review":"Maggie Davis captures the dark romantic world of World War II New York City brilliantly in this tour de force novel. Building her story around the efforts to bring the wholesome and risky musical \\"Oklahoma\\" to the dimmed lights of Broadway creates a metaphor of hope in the face of darkness that we need again today.There is a sense Maggie Davis lived this book, which clearly is not possible. The writing has such attention to detail that the Canteen and the people in it truly come alive. From the stars who graced the USO Stage Door Canteen to the frightened silenced Jewish refugees from (...)Germany, to the young soldiers and sailors who may have had their last dance in the arms of some of the most beautiful women of stage and screen, it's all here and it all rings true.For women waiting for their men to come home from war, for people tormented by an unchallenged evil they cannot stop and most especially for anyone who loves history, this book is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A-Z of Nothing?","review":"This book was written in the U.K. and I found the writing is slanted toward information not pertaining as much to breeds in the U.S. The book was filled with grammatical and typographical errors, and it is out-of-date for anyone ordering in the year 2000 or later. The A-Z descriptions were trite, and I was unable to find many things I was looking for, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease and other current diagnoses. Sadly, this book was of no help to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom of a Girl Finally","review":"I bought this rug to use in my daughters room, but decided I did not really need a rug.

I also checked for the country of manufacture and found it's made in China,like just about everything these days. It's well made,though and I believe you'd have to spend substantially more for something better. All in all,a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"We bought this for our almost 3 year old daughter to go with her Corolle doll for Christmas this year. It was very easy to assemble (only a couple of pieces), and it's very sturdy. The mobile clicks in place, and my daughter carries it around by the mobile (it's light). She puts baby dolls of different sizes into it as well. It's exactly what I was hoping for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good doll bed","review":"My daughter got this doll bed from Santa, and she really likes it, especially because it is similar to her baby sister's pack and play. It seems very durable. I just wish is was a couple inches longer because her baby doll's head and feel touch the ends. However, overall, we are happy with it. It is very cute, and was very easy to put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic doll bed","review":"This was only one of the doll accessory sets my mother gave my 21 month old daughter for Christmas. She loves the Baby Stella doll and is getting the hang of the feeding set, diaper bag and this Corelle baby bed. The bed is tougher than it seems as it takes a 22lb child sitting in numerous times! It is pretty, well made and small enough not to dominate a small bedroom. My daughter loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding and unique volume.","review":"White trash meets film noir meets a rainbow of multiculturalism in this volume's stories. Mukherjee has a keen eye for the intersections of sex and race, and tells it with a tone that (at her best) has echoes of Raymond Chandler. I walked away from it muttering, \\"Yeah, it's all just weird enough to be real.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and hilarious","review":"Mukherjee's collection of short stories-MIDDLEMEN AND OTHER STORIES is a book to give to your best friend. It is a terrific introduction to the lives of minorities who moved into the USA and gives a good account of the Indian way of life in a changing time under the constraints of adjustment to a new era, environment and way of life. Like Shades of Fire, Holidays on Ice, the writing is evocative and smooth-flowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebuttal","review":"Any reviewer who finds this book boring probably has never read Don Quixote (the world's first novel) let alone much else, and is therefore hardly qualified to comment on the basis of such limited experience. In any case neuro-science tells us that brain-sculpting theta waves predominate during boredom, indicating that learning (whatever one's subjective feeling of lassitude) is in fact taking place.While this is sometimes a shocking book, only the severely culture-bound and those with no sense of humour will find it boring. I would rate it as an update on Kafka's 'Amerika' - a modern vision of the USA by the latest underclass of arrivals, struggling to carve out their identity in the land of [for them] little peace and [frequently] not much glory. It'll make you laugh and cry - but you'll never see yourself as others see you unless you try ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter's review","review":"I recently had to read this book for college. It is probably the worst book that I have ever read. It is so boring all of the stories usually feature a character sitting around not doing anything. There are hardly any events, this book is so slow and boring. I started reading it in June and finished in September and the book is only 197 pages. This was a great waste of my summer. I hate this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, highly readable sociological blues review","review":"Grazian presents the world of Chicago's blues scene with the loving touch of a real fan, and the critical eye of a deep-thinking sociologist. His exploration of notions of \\"authenticity\\" in blues is penetrating and insightful, as he examines what it is in the blues experience that makes us think of it as \\"authentic\\" -- is it the color of the musician? The world-weariness in his voice? The ambience or clientele of the club? Or is it simply a construct of audience expectations, differing from person to person? Grazian, a blues player himself, skillfully points out how and why the authenticity we seek in our music is a reflection of our search for authenticity, the desire to \\"keep it real,\\" in culture itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap!

I bought this Joyce Chen bamboo spoon to replace my 20+ yr old bamboo spoon, which I use always. This Joyce Chen spoon is the right size, but the handle is a bit too wide for me to say it's perfect. But, I'm sure I'll get use to it. It does seem to be of good quality though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China garbage with nasty, dripping lacquer","review":"Do NOT waste your money on this ridiculous bamboo spoon. The fact that it is made in China isn't necessary suspect, but the hardened lacquer (that literally has drip marks/hardened droplets on it) could be poisonous.

It is clear, concise, interesting and has great charts and tables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard Textbook","review":"This book is pretty thorough in the content it covers. However, I always say that the true measure of a book, especially a textbook, is how well the information is formatted and presented so that the reader finishes with a better understanding than before they read the book. This book is such a dry read that it's difficult, at times, to retain information after so many pages of just plain information.

I saw the \\"From the Inside \\" tour and I have to say it was absolutely the BEST production I have ever seen. The opening of the show started with a movie projected on a 40ft screen of a liquor bottle assembly line. It followed the bottles as they moved down the line and then they turned towards the camera. As the bottle reached the end of the belt, it tipped forward and out popped Alice live from the screen! I will never forget that show! I think that Go To Hell and Inside are two of his best works, but sadly, they never get mentioned or remembered. I just saw his bio on VH-1 (a must see for Alice fans) and of all the albums they documented, these two were not mentioned. It was getting to the point where I was afraid that I just imagined having those two albums and it was just a dream!

For record collectors, there was another song recorded during this session that never made it onto the album. The song is called \\"No Tricks\\" and is just as good as all the other songs from this album. It\`s a song about a character (or it could even be about Alice) going through cold turkey in the asylum. It also has a guest female vocalist on it (like millie and billie) called Betty Wright who i\`m not familiar with. This rare song did get released but it\`s near impossible to get hold of.

No Tricks was on the b side of this single."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALICE FALLS DOWN ON THE FLOOR- AGAIN AND AGAIN AND....","review":"Yep. You can really feel the emotions this man was going through! It is sad that some folks have to practically destroy themselves in order to bring out the best in their creativity (a la Syd Barrett). This album has the absolute best soft Cooper there is. Because it it real. A man whose persona was a fake, a fabrication of the imagination, a rock'n'roll spectacle, Vince Fournier bares his soul from the inside. The only thiing preventing the big 5 star rating is some of the rocker songs, like Beverly Hills, which are crummy. This album would have hit me like 2 tons of bricks instead of 1 if ALL the songs were sad and sincere enough to make me feel like I was crazy. I just skip the filler parts. FROM THE INSIDE IS BIG TIME UNDERRATED. This makes GOES TO HELL sound like total garbage. Highly recommended. I found an original promo sealed LP a few months back for 2 bucks at a flea market in Jefferson Parish, LA. Don't give up looking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the REAL Alice","review":"From the Inside is the true alice cooper and how many of us can relate to most of these songs I wish I was born in Beverly Hills is one of the best songs on the album since it is what most of us would consider the good life until it all comes crashing down on our heads.

Every song on the album rocks!! From the \\"Quiet Room\\" to the tantalizing \\"Nurse Rozzeta\\" I have never heard an album that has really touched my soul until this one. This was my first Alice Cooper album and the only one that I would never get rid of, if you don't have the money to get this album, steal it, find it, work for it but for Gods sake get it. You will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Inside lives on!! An unknown CLASSIC!!","review":"Of all of my vinyl I have stashed away, I feel that \\"From the Inside\\" is a masterpiece, one of my favorites. I will always remember my first look at the album cover, already huge fan of the hit \\"How You Gonna See Me Now\\", wondering what to expect. \\"Serious\\" took me for a loop, and still gives me chills when I here that open lick! This compolation of Alice Cooper and Bernie Taupin's combined effort seems flawless. There is virtually every type of music and emotion you might possibly feel being an inmate of an asylm or your own mind. If only music today could make one feel so much a part of the ideas the artist was portraying.

Sounds great. Too bad the author isn't James White or Larry Niven or some other person who knows how to write.The story is slow. There are many reasons for this. Too many twists and turns, the main character is an East Ender and sometimes I don't understand the meaning of her words, the science is out of fantasy or Doctor Who, and for a person who is a astrologer she never really seems to know what's going on. We're thrown right into a gritty, dirty, shiny, high-tech thriller, with fast food, spaceships, mud huts and slow light technology. You REALLY have to be a super-skilled writer to pull it all together and NOT make a mess of it.This is a mess. I would come to a complete screaming stop every time I ran into something that just didn't make sense. Check it out of the library if you REALLY have to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are we reading the same book?","review":"I read Heart of Stone after having read negative reviews here, and I found myself puzzled by them. The characters seem credible and the plot well developed. While I would like to have understood the astrological references better, my lack of knowledge in that area did not significantly distract.Told in first person, DeMartino's work remains true to what the point of view character knows, and information about other individuals comes naturally and gradually. If the end has a deus ex machina flavor, it's wholly consistent with the revelations about the devise involved as discovered gradually throughout the book. The resolution felt valid and right to me.In my opinion this differs from work previously done by the author in that she's risen to a new plane of clarity and power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written in the dark?","review":"Denise Vitola's novels are usually pretty good adventure. And I liked the astrologer idea. But the writing is unusually poor in this book, which may be why the authoress underwent a change of name for the occasion.

A chaotic rollercoaster ride through keyboards, tight rhythm, and distorted bass. This is before steve bays, keyboardist took over singing duties, and thus, the singing style is quite different, yet still fitting. Vocals are a combination of the confident whine hot hot heat fans are used to, and an abraisive scream, certainly a sign of their earlier hardcore influences.if you dont like hot hot heats recent works, i would suggest checking this out anyway. fans of the locust, and the vss should definitely check out this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely wonderful!","review":"Truthfully, when I first listened to Scenes, I was, well, shocked. Could this possibly be the catchy, poppish, wonderful Hot Hot Heat I had become smitten with over the last few months? But after a listen or two, this album truly grew on me. The songs are amazing! Matt Marnik's voice is quite unique, and the synth being the main melody is a terrific change of pace from regular guitar driven rock. The best song is Fashion Fight Pause, but all songs are terrific. You should definently buy this album, but don't expect it to be like Hot Hot Heat's more recent albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Showed vast promise","review":"2 1/2 starsDespite this album's horrible vocals and carnie-on-acid vibe, there are actually many times throughout the disc that you hear an amazing young band with some real fire in their approach. This album does work better as a sheer party favor for your head then an actual musical exploration, be sure that you want to embrace your inner 15 year old partying teen mode complete with crappy garage band rehearsal vibe, and you will appreciate this alot more ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not hot hot heat","review":"just wanted to tell you people that this is a horrible cd and it is stupid to buy this. Babies crying sound more melodic than this scratchy, loud, irritatting summation of ugly sounds. Also an important note, HOT HOT HEAT is the best band ever so do not make any assumtions on the band based on this cd. The band on this cd is lacking the guitars and the vocalist that is part of present day hot hot heat. I strongly suggest either Knock, Knock, Knock or Make up the breakdown both by HOT HOT HEAT however stay far away from and be very afraid of this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is music?","review":"If this is considered good music then hell, everyone should get some friends with instruments, think of some lyrics, and just start playing and yelling in the microphone... because that's exactly what Hot Hot Heat did. Don't get me wrong, I think they are an awesome band, but this album just sucks.. no its worse, I would rather listen to 98 degrees then this. Hopefully there new CD won't be anything like this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I've never quite been able to figure out what type of musical genre this album could bill itself as, except perhaps dischordant screaming and banging on instruments. Don't get me wrong, I do have an appreciation for many genres of music circulating on the indie scene, like grind, hardcore, screamo, etc., but honestly, the only type of people who will enjoy this are super-elitist scenesters trying to bill themselves as \\"cool\\" by claiming ownership of \\"the old Hot Hot Heat album, before they got poppy.\\" I urge you, stay away from this album. If you are a suburban teenage white girl who has \\"Make Up The Breakdown\\" right next to \\"Justified\\" in your CD Changer, you will hate this album. If you are a indie-rocker who is looking to get into \\"experimental post-hardcore,\\" you will hate this album. Unless you are looking to gain some scene points with your discography, the only possible positive use this CD could ever serve is as a ten dollar coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of Heaven please spare us....","review":"Is this even in the category 'music'? To me, it falls short of any expectations revolving around sound that can be percieved as music. Ok, if you like listening to dying weasels shriek to senseless and pathetically messed up music, this disc is for you. Don't get me wrong, we need horrible artists like this to set the standard. It has become a curse at Battle of the Bands for audience members to scream \\"You sound like Hot Hot Heat!\\". Despite our need for horrible music to show how good some music is, I think Hot Hot Heat smashes the previous standard of 'Horrible' and defacates on it while giving it a nice toast with a flamethrower.Thus, today we learned a valuble lesson. Don't buy this crap. Pick up some real music like Taking Back Sunday, Brand New, or Yellowcard. Don't waste your hard-earned cash on stuff that is only worth burning (Not copying the CD, blowing it up, which can be fun)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction At Its Best","review":"I picked up this book by John Ensor Harr only mildly interested in Benedict Armold and then found myself drawn in to an absorbing, stimulating novel, which I knew was based on solid fact. {I knew that Harr had written scholarly biographies of the Rockefellers.) I came to a new understanding - if not approval - of Benedict Arnold, but I found out a great deal more about the revolution, Washington's role, and many others. I recommend it wholeheartedly for any one wanting to read a good novel but also learn a great deal about the troubled soul of man and the prcarious thread on which victory hung in the revolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try","review":"Mr. Harr's ambitious novel of the Benedict Arnold story is a good attempt at best. Readers of historical fiction will not particularly enjoy this book as it's narrative is rather clumsy and the voices of it's characters are niether believable or consistant. The characters are in fact two dimensional and never really come alive. A dry recounting of events with made up dialogue and meetings to string things together, this book in no way remotely approaches the grace and scholarship of a Kenneth Roberts or O'Brian as historical fiction. The research is also somewhat suspect in a few areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"History brought alive","review":"Dark Eagle reminds me of all the historical novels written by David Nevin (if you like Dark Eagle, you'll like all of Nevin's books). Harr brings history alive by adding discourse between the characters while remaining historically honest to the events of the time and making sure the language is not 21st century. Great reading and the type of book you just do not want to put down. A fun way to learn a little more history about this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This DVD contains some very sketchy talk by Wolinsky mixed with some extremely low-quality, incomprehensible video footage.

Stephen Wolinsky is marketing his own unenlightened thoughts. This is not the real thing!

In this film George falls in love with a beautiful women named Ursala. However her nasty mother and her mean boyfriend won't allow it. From then on it's madness and comedy that will keep you laughing. John Cleese does an excellent job as an ape named Ape and Bredon Frasier is good as the bumbling George.

Does he have the body for it???? Has he done comicbook characters before??? The answer to all 3 is NO. But who has done all of these? Who would be a natural? Who can play strong leader (The Mummy) or meek Casper Milktoast (an acting term, look it up PEO-PLE!)lik he did in Blast from the past)???? See what I'm getting at here? Brendan Frazer can do both Super man AND clark Kent! He even resembles Clark in the face! Also rent this movie and you can see he is Built for the part of Superman!

This movie was really dumb. When I saw this movie in the theaters I almost walked out. It's one of the worst Disney movies I have ever seen. I think Brendan Fraser is one of the worst actors and the cast in this movie is way far off. I think this is a kind of movie that little kids might enjoy, big kids might not like this movie. It's so cheesy and the jokes are pretty lame. So whatever you do not RENT this video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to report, Disney really misses on this one!","review":"I shudder to report just how corny this film is! What was formerly a cute TV series becomes, in this live-action version, an excuse for mugging and triteness. Though the supporting characters are worthily acted, George himself just does not come across. The main humor comes about with his repeated bashing into trees, and this is not quite enough to create a truly funny film.The color and effects are dazzling and sharp, and the DVD is a good production. The dog-like elephant is well depicted, and pretty funny. Just afraid the film is too slight to be worth a viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Pathetic Film!","review":"This film was a total waste of time. I almost walked out of the movie theater since the film seemed to go on forever. The humor, if you can call it that, was hard to endure. Brendan Fraser was ridiculous, he has NO acting ability.

Fortunately for my family, this movie is silly in a good way, gleefully silly, with lots of physical comedy, puns, in-jokes, and high ridiculousness. This movie has good-natured fun. The casting of Fraser and Mann as George and Ursula is inspired, and Cleese as the voice of Ape works wonders. Movies that elicit joyful instead of derisive laughter deserve our attention, so unless you're sensitive about the requisite animal excrement jokes (the easiest way to avoid a \\"G\\" rating), watch this movie with your kids. Then watch it with your buddies. It might even be a good date movie.The DVD package, however, offers another example of Disney's charging premium prices for few extras. Unfortunately, the disc is also pan-and-scan instead of widescreen. If you already own the videotape, you might as well wait and hope that Disney upgrades the DVD package."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is so stupid....IT'S FUNNY","review":"How can someone possibly criticize the funniest movie in history? OK... I admit it sure is corny and definitly not for the intellectual group, but hey everyone needs a good laugh...and George sure makes you smile! This movie is unique, how often do you hear an actor arguing with the narrator or see a man fall 10,000 feet into a river and only get a \\"really big Booboo?\\" (my favorite line.) This movie, I admit, does not stimulate thought but certainly provides a component we all lack, a sense of humor and a good laugh.

The twists and turns that occur are outrageous---and the ending is so weak, it makes the viewer feel conned. Then again, perhaps that is what the director intended. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Argentinian Gem","review":"If you ever need a reminder that you can make a class A film on ashoe-string budget, rent Nueve Reinas (Nine Queens), a marvelous,gripping, and often very funny drama about the culture of con-men andthose whom they con. I'm not sure what the budget of this film was, andI'm sure the very professional and excellent actors and crew werewell-paid, but my point is that the story-line and direction are whatmake this film, and the actors are so well-cast that it all comes offwithout a hitch. Unlike some con-movies, the whole thing is believableand I had a hard time finding holes in the plausibility post-facto.Leticia Bredice, who played a vulnerable, sexpot-victim in _Cenizas delParaiso_, plays *quite* an impressively different character here.Ricardo Darin and Gaston Pauls are fascinating and marvelous. I'll letyou decide for yourselves whether there's any transcendent message inthis film, but even without, it's some serious fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't watch Matchstick Men (ripoff). Watch this movie.","review":"This is a brilliant film. It is about an ultimate con, one that comes along once in a lifetime, to paraphrase one of the characters. It is so fast paced that even though you try to keep each detail in mind, you run out of room. The ending (even if you get a part of it earlier on) will still make you want to see the movie again and again, just to see where the clues were. After I saw Nine Queens it's been remade in the US twice under different titles. Watch the original. It is so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For Cats, Too!","review":"My cat loves to ride in the car and hates being in the carrier. She likes to look around. With this car seat, she can stay in my sight, still be able to look around at all the cars outside, and be close to her Mommy (which is better than her trying to sit on my lap) The only problem is that it fits a little bit weird over racerback seats. Bucket seats would probably be better. Overall, though, I'm glad I bought this product, despite the hilarious comments from my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not making any sense","review":"This is not a Christian teaching book, if it was written by some atheist I will give the book five stars, but to be written by some one proclaiming himself a priest and Christian I should give it zero star if I have this choice.The identity of the author is not clear, his ideas does not make any sense with the reality, There is a big difference between Love and sex but the author ignored this fact to deceive people with no religion or to the people who don't have a real background about Christianity, the Christianity never been anti women actually there are too many Christians praise Virgin Mary more than any body else, this is false teaching. The Christianity is against any kind of sex outside marriage including homosexuality so what is his point?, this is false teaching, and not representing Christianity at any level, again his identity is not clear the same as the serpent who deceived Eve with the familiar story we all know, if I compare I don't see much difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-biblical","review":"Writers of \\"Christian\\" tomes of all stripes have found ways to justify a non-biblical perspective by quoting Scripture, and Spong has done just that here. Spong begins this book, as with so many of his previous writings, with his own prejudice clearly in view. The alternative to this would be to hermeneutically explore the Scriptural texts for their own sake prior to drawing any conclusions about its \\"relevance\\" to contemporary Christian living. While provocative, this book is decidedly NOT Christian in its teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for every christian!","review":"Living in Sin is a great book. It is well written,intelligent,thought provoking and easy to read. The author does an excellent job of presenting his case without anger or judgement. Cleary, he apprecites his christian faith and the bible. Whether one is a devout or nominal christian, this book will open your eyes and encourage you to think about what you believe and why. Hopefully, it will challenge the reader to do their own due diligence on issues instead of taking what someone says without question. Tradition is fine, but tradition is not truth. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Living in Sin?: A Bishop Rethinks Human Sexuality","review":"Very insightful. The author has a great way of connecting common sense to life.

The book is not for fundamentalist, because the research is there to support the findings of Bishop Spong. It is not dependent on Bible proof texting that most fundamentalist are fond of to prove their questionable arguements which not only limits them, but the Bible also. In an age where Christianity is linked with hate, and radical racism Spong shows us that the stone(s) rejected by the builder's have become the cornerstone(s) of faith and reason. Fundamentalist, and Conservative Christians will not like the book as it exposes their flawed belief system. Thank you Bishop Spong for making us free. Truly a pearl not to be cast before swine."},{"rating":"2","title":"celebration of common sense","review":"Bishop Spong writes with clarity and common sense-without the hindrance of the chains of prejudice and narrow mind.

There are better books on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"An atheistic view of sexuality","review":"Spong may indeed be a member of the cloth, but if you want to know how an atheist views sexuality, read this book.

There are certainly far better books about human sexuality to be found on the market. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breathtaking ignorance","review":"Indeed the ridiculous Bishop Spong has done it again!

Later, when I wanted to buy more, the local store was gone (a victim of the big store I'll leave out of this). I found that particular hose was still available online, and bought a few more. (I have a large lot, and need 175' of hose in front and in back.) This last hose, however, was terrible. If you're dragging a hose and it gets a loop, pulling from a distance just results in it folding and kinking. I don't know if these hoses are out of production and have been sitting on the shelf too long, or they're no longer being made with the quality of materials they were years ago. This will be the first time I've ever scrapped a nearly new hose, but it's just too terrible to bother fighting with. I'm trying another brand that has good reviews here on Amazon, and won't be buying Swan again, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible entry into the Tomie franchise","review":"I am one of those few who genuinely like the Tomie franchise, and I was sorely disappointed by this film. The lead actress, Hisako Shirata, is quite good... but the script and HD video look kill the film. They try so hard to explain what Tomie is, that the dread, fear and suspense is gone. The gore is there, sure... but without a good story, who cares? Also, the CGI effects are, as usual, bad.I suppose the people who found the first Tomie slow, confusing and boring might enjoy this, but everyone else, beware. Get the Tomie box-set (with the best 3 films in it) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropping Off (a Cliff)","review":"I liked the Tomie additions that I had seen - until i ran into this one. I do not want to waste a lot of time on it because i don't think you should say too much on the negative side. Instead, it should be noted that the problems are visual, that the sound is bad, that the story is not really there, and that this does not fit into the Tomie additions. I thought the acting was good enough - hence the addition of a star - BUT that I would not have bothered getting this had I known what I was walking into.It is sad to see Ito's creation here but do not take it out on all the Tomie movies. Some of them are rather good and this is more like an exception than the thing you expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad addition to the Tomie movies.","review":"Yes, as the other reviews state.. this movie was sad.I'm a HUGE Tomie fan, but this movie just made no sence! First of all, the one that I had contained some of the worst subtitles I have ever seen. It's hard enough to follow an extremely slow movie and on top of that have subtitles that don't even translate well. The plot.. well, the seriously wasn't even a plot! This one fails compaired to the other Tomies.It's perfectly okay to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst Tomie Film yet!","review":"This film is one of two Tomie movies that came out following the first five movies. It was done all wrong and the back of the box pretty much sums the entire movie. It starts out good but then you can lose interest really quick. Also the actress that plays Tomie wasn't all that pretty either and supposedly all men fall for her because shes drop dead beautiful. The conclusion was really predictable and this film is too short. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. Get Tomie The Beginning which as a lot better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this pool!","review":"This is the most frustrating piece of equipment I own!

If you don't guide the filling every step of the way it will go up slanted, /__/ ,and not straight up.

As other reviewers stated unless your lawn is completely level you will have problems. Our lawn was about 8\\" off. We filled in with sand,surrounded by boards, raked, used a level, used string, did everything we were supposed to. When we filled we could tell it was a little off. My daughter got in, water started going over the off side and then it was like a tidal wave and washed sand away.

If the ground is not 100% level, don't waste your time. It looked fun and easy. It was neither. Other people say it was fine, but they also said they were level. My backyard was off by about 6 inches left to right and that was enough to only let the pool fill about 20 inches. When you first fill it if one inch of water is not even you will probably have a problem. Good luck getting it back in the box. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid It.","review":"There have been a several great Italian directors. Pasolini is not among them. There have been many great Italian films. This is not one of them. As is typical of Pasolini, he borrows very loosely from a famous literary source to create a mishmash of bad acting, bad direction, bad scenic design, and bad direction. There ARE bad films which can be extremely entertaining. This is not one of them, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"I read the stories of the Canterbury Tales and was blown away. I saw the movie and was disgusted. The acting is horrible and some of the people are just UGLY. The plot does stick to the tales but if you've read them, you don't really want to see them enacted. It reminds me of an old cheesy HBO porn, but that is even giving it too much credit. Do yourself a favor and stick to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst Italian film ever","review":"In the Middle Ages, people generally did not stroll about in brightly colored, shintzy clothes. Especially not when they went on a pilgrimage, \\"to seek the holy blissful martyr\\". Roads and streets were not paved. People stank. One cannot convey that in a film, but please pay more attention to set decoration? The standard you would like to attain in that respect was set by Terry Gilliam in \\"Jabberwocky\\": shabby poor people, dirty faces, muddy streets. Or \\"The Name of the Rose\\".Besides, you can only follow this movie if you have read the Canterbury Tales first. Otherwise, it's incomprehensible. By the way, almost all Italian movies I re-view of late seem incomprehensible. I used to like Italian cinema, but its products do not seem to age well. The dialogues usually seem hollow and pretentious. One notable exception: \\"Kaos\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LOAD OF RUBBISH!!!!","review":"I really wasted my money on this one! I was totally disgusted with this movie, it demeaned women in the most part and looked much like cheesey low budget porn film. There was really only one scene in the whole movie that I would have called humourous.

The air holes are large enough for their paws giving them hope of escape. So they chew, and tear at them untill their head fits through & once that happens its only minutes untill the rest of their body is out. The one that made it to the vet in this carrier escaped on the way home by getting her claws in the top & pulling down untill the sides released and voila she was out without damaging the box or consuming cardboard. I ended up purchasing plastic carriers & wish I would have saved the cost & shipping of these useless things.

This album opens fabulously and then gets real quiet.I can't wait to play Hallelujah on a system that has a sub-woofer. I also like Fum, Fum, Fum; as one of the other reviews said, this reminds me of old Fresh Aire stuff. Most of the rest, however, is very Still (as in Still Nacht). Good background music, but it doesn't move me as much.Listened to the album all the way through twice now.

So, I pop the ole 'brown' CD in, that has so many well-orchestrated numbers, and xmas is back...SO, tell me Chip, was this less-than-extraordinaire effort worth it????

With few exceptions, the tracks remind one of the background music played as televised golf tournaments go to commercial breaks. Two notables though are Hallelujah and Fum, Fum, Fum. Hallelujah is reminiscent of Deck The Halls on Steamroller's first Christmas album, while Fum, Fum, Fum has the eclectic blend of baroque and sysntesizer that made Fresh Aire 1-4 so delightful. For those new to Chip Davis' work, there are many far-better albums to choose from. For fans of Christmas music, the few gems here might make the purchase worthwhile, although the 1984 and 1988 Christmas albums offer much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I own all of the previous Mannheim Steamroller Christmas albums, and I have greatly enjoyed them. However, this one just doesn't cut it. Each of the previous albums has had at least one standout song, and apparently the \\"Hallelujah Chorus\\" was supposed to fit that bill on this album. But that's one of the most exciting pieces ever written, and the blah new-age arrangement here just ruins it. The piece from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker is similarly much better in its original form. Chip Davis has succeeded in the past by taking familiar Christmas tunes and rearranging them in new and exciting ways, but there aren't any tracks on this album that fit that category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Extraordinaire ~ Mannheim Steamroller","review":"Christmas Extraordinaire is an insipidly arranged and performed package of Christmas standards.

If you like the other Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CDs, you probably won't like this one.

It just does not do ancient Christmas songs proper justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This album is no breath of fresh aire (pardon the pun). Unlike their previous Christmas albums (especially the first two), there is little here to recommend this album unless you are a diehard MS fan. I own all the Fresh Aire albums, all of the Christmas albums, and several of their other works, yet I was unimpressed by this one. \\"Fum, Fum, Fum\\" is far and away the best track here, with the special blend that made their other Christmas albums so good. \\"Fairies\\" is also interesting (for those who like the electronic side of MS).

If this had been a reissue of a phonograph LP, I might have accepted this, but CDs can hold a lot more music than this.Second, what was there was very thin and bland. Where the previous CDs had been imaginative this one was just...there.

Call me crazy, but I think this is their best Christmas album to date. I love the tracks that are \\"fast,\\" but the ones that are slow really dig deep into ones heart. This is not an album to put on at a rip roaring Christmas party. It's an album to play at a family get together, or when you're with your sweetheart, sipping hot cider in front of the tree.

During the holiday season, I listen to the CDs constantly, and even perform some of their duets and solos. So, when I saw this CD, I had to get it. Sadly to say, I was slightly disappointed.When I first put the CD in the player, I loved \\"Hallelujah!\\" It sounded like the good ol' stuff. However, the CD sounds more like one of the Fresh Aire CDs. I think this is due to the men and women's choirs. I don't really like the sound of that--I'm not really sure why. Then, why in God's name did they put Johnny Mathis on the CD--I mean, he has a nice voice, but with the men and women's choirs, and the Mannheim band, it sounds too \\"crowded,\\" and I, personally, didn't like it.I would say to anyone who's a Mannheim Steamroller fan, get this.

So, I kind of got carried away and bought this one without listening to it ahead of time. That was a mistake. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews, as it's remarkably boring. The tunes all sound sort of similar as most feature either bells or a generic synthesizer. The layered complexity that made their other albums gems is missing. The melodies are so broken apart as to be almost unrecognizable, which for a Christmas album is not a good thing. I recommend skipping this one altogether and getting one of their better albums (e.g. Christmas in the Aire)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great christmas album.","review":"I never realized how many Christmas CDs Manheim Steamroller has released (9).

I'm sorry, I hated it, my wife hated it and all my friends who heard it hated it. From the openning, it didn't sound traditionally \\"Christmassy\\" at all. Sounded more like some cheesy 80's rendition of classic songs on a Moog. Whilst there is no denying that those who perform on the DVD are very accomplished musicians, I didn't care for it at all. In fact none of us can even sit through track one, and we have \\"skipped\\" through all of 'em and quite honestly, the cries of \\"for Pete sake turn that rubbish off\\" were deafenning.

The bugs, as was mentioned in a top review, have to fly THROUGH the racket and touch the inner electrified mesh and the exposed ground mesh in order to spark. The mesh is very flimsy and just the slightest pressure on it causes it to bend and bridge the connection between the mesh. In other words, it short-circuits the racket and ruins it, not to mention its extremely dangerous as this can cause the batteries to explode.Do NOT buy this.

We watch a lot of faith-based films, many of which are distributed by PureFlix, and we've liked most of them. However, we stopped this movie after only 20 minutes due to extreme boredom. The dialogue is very slow and seems forced. The acting is rigid and many of the actors, even adults, look like they're performing in a high school play. The background noise is distracting--it sounds like it's being filmed on the shore of an ocean with waves crashing in and seagulls playing. It seriously detracts from the quiet country setting of the movie. The soundtrack is nothing but annoying piano music, if I recall correctly.

I too felt the aunt seemed depressed and gee, who would want to be like her? The horse seemed more like a prop to insert when needed.

It is soooooooooooooo sloooooooooooooow. By the time we gave up on this movie from utter boredom, the main character of the horse hadn't even shown up yet. The music is indeed annoying, as is the inordinate number of camera shots of fences. Yes, fences. Over and over, the shots focus on fences. What is with that? Given that the action in this movie is about as exciting as watching a fence, maybe it's a subliminal statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This movie had the potential to be good, but unfortunately it seemed like they had Christians playing actors.

The flaw in both of these books is tone - As you move into the psychological side of the sciences, theories become much more subjective: postulating your theory of mind while giving short shrift to the concurrent leading psychological theories through literary devices like straw-men arguments makes the book ring hollow. In fact, Buss makes some great points using evolutionary psychology and the interspersed case files are an excellent addendum to keep one interested in the book.I would say, if you subscribe to evolutionary psychology on some small level, and you have a crim justice major friend who just doesn't get it, this is the book you buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Interesting, Not Well-Written","review":"The author seems to assume that because of his own murderous ideas, that everyone else is the same as himself.He starts off with a terrible assumption, and expands upon it endlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Japanese edition artwork just like LP","review":"I believe the previous review is referring to a different edition of Benefit.

Based on this excellent series, Gingrich selected William Forstchen for a very good reason, the man can write Civil War fiction. This author combines an understanding of the military with the ability to make convincing characters. The result is a fun to read hybrid story that combines time travel, space travel, exploration and deadly battles with a Civil War regiment's actions.This is the first book in the Lost Regiment series where the 35th Maine infantry and the 44th New York Light Artillery are hurled into a different world.

The action is exciting and very intense, especially the end battles at the Ford and Suzdal, and you sort of do really feel the humans' desparation as they attempt to build a modern army from medievel Russian peasents in only a short amount of time. The transformation of the characters of Hawthorne and Kalencka are interesting, too. A young private to a colonel, a peasent to a leader of a rebellion. It was also cool to see a Ferguson in a book (my last name, if anyone cares). My only real complaint, however, was the horrible editing, but it was not enough for me to knock a star off there.

Feet, legs, arms - everywhere you'd put your lotion or body butter is where you can put this, as well. The fact that it is so greasy (not in a bad way) helps the super dry parts of my body just drink this stuff up. However, using this on my face, I just use a finger tip's dab.

His writing skills are virtually flawless; he reminds me of John D MacDonald, whose Travis McGee series I read with tremendous enjoyment years ago. The plot moves along at a satisfying pace, swiftly but not so fast that it can't be followed. His characters are beautifully developed. The only quibble that I could possibly have is that the book badly needs an editor, which would take care of the homonym confusion (discrete - discreet, taught - taut, etc), misspellings (ordinance - ordnance), and occasional word misuse (statue instead of stature - but he did get this right once near the end!). The book is so enthralling, however, that I will happily give the author a pass on those relatively minor matters!

I highly recommend this book for mystery and thriller lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I enjoyed this book, but I did not like it as well as book one. (Blood on the Vine) I'm not quite sure why, maybe because the crime that Jay Leicester was initially hired to investigate was so horrific, (I found it almost unbelievable), and the motive for the crime did not seem adequate to explain all the subsequent happenings. There are several murders in this book, and they are described with more detail than I like.However, the author writes very well, and mostly keeps the story moving, although there were a few times that it seemed bogged down with details, but I still managed to finish it in a day and a half.

I got to the end and I felt like I had just read a bunch of words, with no real meaning behind it. Having enjoyed works by Feist, Tolkien, Pratchett, Goodkind, Jordan and others, this was far below their best or even worst efforts.

Liane seems to have absolutely no purpose but to meander about. The main point I have to make is that no one is the slightest bit curious. Garric takes anything and everything Tenoctris says as the simple fact and never questions. Magic seems to be convenient to plot. There are no rules and no consistancy. One moment Tenoctris can't do a thing without some type of twig, next thing we know she is taking Garric to another dimension without having to chant as previously required. These could all be accepted if someone would simply question. Does Garric, some sort of scholar as a child, hold absolutely no curiosity? Furthermore, it seems that Mr Drake wrote the last twenty pages, and then wrote backwards to get his charcter there. I understand Mr Drake is an excellent Sci-Fi author, but I believe his concepts of fantasy do need sharpening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original story with HEROES, not wimps....","review":"I am sick and tired of the pages and pages of boring garbage some fantasy writers fill their books with. The \\"Hero\\" of the story sit and whines and complains about the task given to him/her by fate and refuses to use the \\"gift\\" given to them. The heroes in \\"The Lord Of The Isles\\" are good old fashioned hack and slash type who spend more time doing heroic deeds than thinking about them. They accept who they are and what they are without pages of pseudo psycho claptrap. The people who claim this makes them one dimensional are too rigid in their thinking. The plot is rich with sub stories that will make you want to read the second installment as quick as possible. Action all the way through.

I found there were too many characters introduced too quickly. I trudged my way to page 200 because by then I thought my interest would be peaked, but to no avail.

He's built a consistent and intriguing world, peopled it with engaging characters, and given them interesting things to do. I think I still like his Belisarius series better, but that may just be because I've always been a Belisarius fan. Those who like Drake will like this book; those who usually don't -- or who just generally like fantasy -- will probably like it too. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book","review":"Not really much to say in favor of the book. The book skips around too much for my likng with the 2-4 page chapters. Contrary to the quotes on the cover, their is very little character devolepment and the magic system is like what you would find in a pre-teen book. In 625 pages, the book goes half the length of better, smaller books I have read. Not much of a vocabulary. Also the battles usually take only a page to describe and go through, if even that much. There is a very detached point of view throughout the entire book. Unless you are desperate, don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Isles","review":"Where to begin, this was one of the worst books I have ever read. The 3 story lines bounced around and the story seemed to drag and drag. I got about 3/4 of the way through and had to put book away(almost the garbage). Just to get back to reality I re-read an R.A. Salvatore book, Drake surely needs some pointers from a real writer. Anyone thinking of buying Lord of the Isles, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Want Big, Fat Fantasy, Spend Your $ on Robert Jordan","review":"Lord of the Isles and subsequent volumes (which I'm still not sure why I bought) read like those old D&D \\"pick an adventure\\" stories, where if you want the hero to rescue the maiden, turn to page 24.Trees died to make the paper for this book and its sequels. Their sacrifice was in vain.If you like big, fat, sprawling fantasies, spend your money on Robert Jordan instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good; Sluggish","review":"I found this one quite sluggish. The first quarter of the book moved along sort of so-so, but the middle is a stall and now that I am in the last 60 pages, I find myself forcably trying to stay focused. It seems to run on and I'm looking for the direction the author is going in. Not a very good read folks. Stick with the greats; Eddings, Brooks, Goodkind, Harrison, Jordon, Elliott, Martin...--these authors have outstanding worlds soooo worth the explore!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"*shudder*","review":"Wow. This is the book I would have written back in high school. Hyperbolic, shallow, all the characters painfully one-dimensional. I kept hoping Drake would settle into something better, and stop using the inane analogies over and over. I mean, if I had a dime for every time he compared something to \\"back in Barca's Hamlet\\", I'd have enough to go buy a better written novel. For kicks I actually read the sequel to see if it was an improvement. Nope. In fact, I think once he'd run out of introducing us to and attempting to develop the characters, all that was left was to have them deal with one predictable and clich��ed scenario after another. It wasn't until I finished both and moved onto Robin Hobb's excellent \\"Assassin\\" series that I realized how painful these two Drake books were.Maybe he's an acquired taste, but I gave him two books to try and win me over and all I got was a sigh of relief once I'd finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat characters","review":"I picked up this book, a hardcover, in the bargain bin for four bucks or so. The map inside the cover was interesting. An archipelago world, hmmm, possibility of lots of naval action here, I thought. I have to say that I have not finished the book. I can state that the storyline and historical background had fantastic possibilities in my mind. But the flat characters just aren't able to pull it off. They seem dull, lacking emotion, and just don't seem to be developed in a way that they could have been. I found that I had no sense of identifying with them. It seemed like I could care less what happened to them. Whether that changes in the later stages of the book, I don't know, but it was such drudgery getting there that I had to stop. I don't like posting a bad review, but this is my opinion and can be taken or left."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great fantasy novel with military undertones.","review":"Drake returns to fantasy and offers a wonderful new and dare I say epic novel. This book opens with a few bangs and keeps on going. This is a wonderful book, I imagine high school students might read it one day as a classic of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So book, but if you miss it, don't lose any sleep.","review":"I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed with Lord Of The Isles. It took a long time to get anywhere and it seemed very light on the details. It felt like reading a summary of another book with most of the details left out. The author seems to jump around alot and never really fleshed out the current scene before leaving it. I would recommend skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so interesting","review":"The characters are not well developed, and the writing style is often unclear, making me re-read to understand what he was trying to say. The whole story is loosely knitted together, so it reads more like a series of short stories based on the few characters. On the whole, I was very disappointed, especially after so many praises heaped on this book on the cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless \\"entertainment\\" if you've nothing else to do.","review":"I picked up a hardcover copy off of a bargain table, so the story was worth the $ it cost. If you're looking for something to read other than the back of a cereal box, this book fits the bill. Besides the characters being incredibly underdeveloped, the storyline did little to pique my interest and the question of magic (origin, rules for use, etc.) was never fully addressed. If your looking for a writer like Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is disjointed and ultimately annoying.","review":"Many subjects were just brushed over. For example, the sister is plucked out of the home and life she's known for 18 or so years, and nobody bats an eye! Her brother never even sits on a log and thinks \\"Wow! this is weird\\", and she never even flinches when everything she has believed about her life is turned upside down. Also, the overall story always felt sketched, but never filled out - I don't mean it needed more words, just some better focus. It was a letdown after all of the praise printed on the cover. Even the action was boring because most of the time it came from nowhere, with no build up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes but they failed to materialize.","review":"While I thought that the book had great potential I felt that it did not materialize. While the beginning started off quite good, the book went down from there, it seemed to be a lot of pages with no action, too much skipping around and didn't seem to be going anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"When your brain says \\"That's it, I'm outta here.\\".....","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I REALLY don't like fantasy stories where thousands of years pass, and the land stays basically the same (i.e. the horrible Redemption of Althalus). So what do I find in the first few chapters of this book? We find the wizardress Tenoctris awakened after hundreds of years in some sort of magic-hibernation adrift at sea. Is she upset when she awakens? NO! Is she angered? NO! Does she feel anything at all? NO! Does it take her a long time to acclimate herself to her new time? NO! After shouting \\"FEEL SOMETHING....ANYTHING...\\" out loud, and throwing the book across the room, I decided I wasn't going to be reading the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mag-niffy-cent!","review":"A feline lover's dream! Of course no one noticed the cat, unless Niffy wished to be noticed! Ah the hero here is a daring one, and quite brave for any creature, on four paws or two feet. Yes the fluffy one is the centerpiece and weaves her way through the book showing up at crucial moments to steal the show. McCaffery injects her story with all the essence of the feline, who acts and feels like a real, live breathing cat, a special one of course, but many authors attempt to bring character to an animal but somehow it becomes just a shadow of what one really is, a lack of understanding perhaps, but McCaffery understands the nuances and quirks of feline culture and therefore makes this a delightful read for those that love fantasy and cats. The ending is also perfect justice and while this is just a short little book, that should have been more, it was great while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, good read","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, which I got from the library. It didn't take me long to finish it which is a plus in my book. It seemed aimed for the teen audience but even as an adult I thought it had a good story and engaging characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice hour's worth of reading.","review":"Although a quick little read, I enjoyed Ms McCaffrey's usual quirky writing style. This is a good little book to introduce the younger generation to her work. It reminded me of \\"An Exchange of Gifts\\" and I will be adding this little gem to my collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute novella","review":"It was a cute story, but a short story, not the full length novel I had anticipated. The author demonstrates that she is equally adept at both short stories and novels. Unfortunately there was nothing in the listing to indicate that this was not a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help is on the way!","review":"The book is well written, with the novice in mind. I've been a linux user for a few years now, and was able to learn a few bits as well.Would highly recommend to those wishing to try linux, but unsure where to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Screen of Death??? Is this guy from Stone Age?","review":"Extremely disingenuous title!Yes, Windows 3.1 was a piece of junk. Windows 95 was a junk with pretty good facelift, but... that was in the Ice Age. Did the author hear about OS called Windows 2000? Both at home and at work my main PCs are W2000. I supported bunch of heavy duty Windows 2000 servers and I have yet to see infamous \\"Blue Screen of Death\\". No luck so far.Maybe the book was written 5-6 years ago and the author just now had time to publish?I am not biased either way and in fact I am hardcore Unix fan, but I don't like gratuitous attacks especially when they are anachronisms.As to the content of the book it is very superficial even for the beginner and intermediate user. For that audience Peter van der Linden's Guide to Linux is much more superior!Gagn��, you didn't gain much after year 2000, pardon the pun."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIES TOUCHES THE HEART","review":"THIS MOVIE REALLY SHOWS HER TALENT. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT AGAIN. HOW ABOUT PUTTING IT ON VIDEO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morbid and depressing","review":"This book is far from the heartwarming review it got from its co-writer, LeAnn. It revolves around bad times and death. Not to mention that the story idea is completely unoriginal. It stems from LeAnn's own life (even the title character, Anna Lee, shows Miss Rimes's lack of imagination) - from the death of her Godfather to singing at the Grand Old Opry. It can hardly be called fiction. It is a very depressing, morbid, unoriginal book, and like the movie, I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday in your Heart By LeAnn Rimes and Tom Carter.","review":"Holiday in you Heart is a great book. I only wish that I could have saw the movie. I read the book every year around the Christmas Season. It is a great book. I think all LeAnn Rimes fans should get the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capo","review":"my 12yo is able to attach this capo alone. Her other capo which claps on would take both of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"The actors had no prior acting experience:Realism 100%","review":"A very best film by Giannaris that explores an ethic Greex-x(can) minority in Athens. The film win many awards and it is perceived one of the best experimentak films of 1999. A powerful, raw film about a group of outcast teenagers living in Menidi, a predominately Greek-Russian suburb near Athens, Greece. I saw that film in LA and I was suprised. This is want I really like. It has the elements of action, love, crime and mixed traditions. 100% u have to watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I loathed this film.","review":"This film is an utter waste of time and effort. The subject matter was handled much better in 'My Own Private Idaho', 'Trainspotting' and 'Midnight Cowboy'. There is nothing remotely likeable about any of the characters, so one has no reason to care about them.I myself am Greek and I assure you Athens is nothing like this, it is a modern, welcoming, pleasant city and this film does our country a grave diservice.Please do not see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"I found this book - a few interesting bits heavily padded with material intended to provide color but which failed to engage my interest - to be the literary equivalent of a hamburger sandwich that is long of bun and short of beef."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure the author could have done better","review":"While I don't doubt the author's credentials as a special forces operator and small arms expert, it seems to me that he has taken too many fictional liberties in an attempt to make the book more readable. In the book he tells one (not quite believeable) story of how he killed the nazi war criminal Ortgies, while on the tv documentary about his exploits a completely different version is told. This could have been a major expos�� in the tradition of \\"Spycatcher\\" and \\"By Way of Deception\\", but unfortunately the book is written like a cheap spy novel. However, if the author had found a good ghost writer, I'm sure the book would have been an international bestseller like the two above mentioned books."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Krona Pots","review":"I have seven Krona pots. I love them all. This size is perfect because our kids are now gone. So we use it everyday. I am going to buy another because we both want to use it at the same time. This is the best set of pots I have had in forty-two years of marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very good Jerky","review":"I was not pleased with the taste of this jerky. It was nothing more than another cheap, dry, ultra tough, and poor tasting jerky that isn't even very spicy. It's also loaded with MSG if that's a concern for you. I bought a whole box and wound up throwing away the last two packages since they sat around opened for so long as we just couldn't force ourselves to eat anymore of it. This just isn't good jerky."},{"rating":"2","title":".hack//AI buster","review":"I thought this was a pretty good book. Anyone who enjoys anime would probably want to pick up a copy of this wherever they can find it.As this was my first manga novel, I found it pretty confusing at first. One of the reasons was that when two characters were talking, I would get lost as to who was saying what.I really did like this book and I wish that it was longer, but I've heard rumors that there's going to be a sequel.

We weren't able to put the handle down easily, but we decided to overlook that as my son liked the backpack and school was already underway.Then, last week, I noticed that the backpack would no longer stand up.

I started juicing my veggies instead of eating them whole. It reduced the amount of gas I had to almost zero. As the author suggested the size of my stools became much smaller. After 6 months of these skinny stools I developed hemorrhoids for the first time in my 40 years. I have since added fiber back into my diet and the hemorrhoids have been shrinking. Our paleolithic ancestors ate 100+grams of fiber per day. That is the natural way for us to eat. Better dietary health books would be the TNT diet, the Anti-inflammatory diet.

I have resolved much of the suffering I encountered and have improved by about 90%. I continue to use the recommended recovery supplements, eat a healthy tasty diet, and am free of all fiber supplements which I had used for many years.The author's writing is clear, easy to read, thorough, and even fun for the delicate topic of digestion and elimination.

That should always put you on guard. It contains some very opinionated viewpoints. I had the opposite experience from this book. I suffered from Diverticulitis (with infections) for seven years. I continued to experience problems until I added more fiber to my diet, specifically 1 tsp. powdered psyllium once per day. Once I added fiber, my diverticulitis flare-ups stopped. So I caution readers to please discuss the findings of this book with their doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and contraditory","review":"I purchased the kindle addition of this book based on the tumbs up review posted on the WAPF website and curiosity.I have to say that it was a highly disapointing purchase. I'm not all of the way through it yet but I've read enough to write this review. His (Atkins Goes to South Beach) chapter is terrible. My own research plus personal experience has taught me enough to know that his calculations (what it takes to lose fat) are completely (oviously) inaccurate. You don't need a \\"no carb\\", low protein, low fat diet to lose fat.That isn't the only strike against this book.His comment that bacteria cannot survive the acidity of the human stomach would render probiotic therapy useless, which it is not.This is just the tip of the misinfomation iceberg, in this book. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing mess of information","review":"I was okay with the theory in this book for the first few chapters but as this book went along I began to wonder what the author thought any of us should eat. Fiber and carbs were obviously bad but then the author went on to criticize every other diet out there with no clear explanation as to what was wrong with them. I suppose we can eat air. I have no idea if this book gets on a coherent thought. I stopped reading after the first few chapters.This book also continues the myth that Dr. Atkins of the \\"Atkins Diet Plan\\" died of a heartattack. He did not. He slipped on ice and the resulting head injury was fatal. His alleged weight gain was due to the steriods he was given to reduce brain swelling. Don't believe me but do look up the facts. No diet should be denigrated because the author of it happens to die. No matter what any of us eat or in what ratio, we will all die eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MILLION THANK-YOUS","review":"Dear Doctor!I just want to take the time to thank you for your wonderful website and advice.I was born constipated!

It opens a lot of opportunities for people who wants to try non-traditional way of treating medical problems associated with digestive disorders and eating habits. Thank you for much for such interesting book from the bottom of my heart. What makes this book so interesting is there are lot facts, and they are presented in such way and with author's comments that makes the reader flip page after page until you get to Chapter 11 and to the end of the book. I have been following author's advise for the last year switching from Atkins diet. Specificaly, reduction of fiber and water consumption in daily meals leads to great emotional feelings and better physical condition. Each family should read this book regardless of medical problems. If there are any this book can treat them, if there are no problems this book will prevent them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but selective with information","review":"I found the view put forward by this author, interesting, biased and ill inclusive of all the information available about this subject matter. I thought it interesting that he seems to have a reliance on a product called Hydro-C which essentially operates as an osmotic laxative by providing a high dose of vitamin C. All in all, I would read his website to get a taste of what he's about but don't bother spending any cash on this book -- if you do purchase the book be sure to research his claims and his references to see if they're well founded or skewed - I found them skewed. An interesting thing I've personally discovered recently, and will cost you nothing to try...and I've tried everything...is taking the time to taste and throughly chew each mouthful of food at each meal, I've been surprised how much this helps - give it a week or more to fully take affect but I reckon you'll start notice differences within a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little over the top","review":"This author presents an extreme opinion that is, at the least, without balance in his presentation.

I didn't know if the poor quality was the Sony or all FRS 2-way radios. The Sony transmission was broken-up even at close range. The Motorola was nice and clear. I need a radio that I can use while paddling in my kayak, so hands free is important. I visited the Sony web site and called their customer service to try to obtain information on any hands free accessory. Sony has a separate mic and ear plug, but it is not voice activated.

It's an interesting collection of the mostly-unpublished-at-the-time-of-his-death Franz Kafka. The first page informs the reader that Kafka wished for all his unpublished writings to be destroyed upon his death. I think this is a good idea to begin with when reading stories from this book. I'd never read Kafka before, but I really liked \\"The Metamorphosis\\" and \\"Letter to His Father,\\" as well as \\"The Coming of the Messiah,\\" \\"The Emperor,\\" and \\"The Tiger.\\" I wish I could say exactly why I like these stories. Maybe it's because they make for interesting discussions. In \\"The Metamorphosis,\\" for example, I felt like Gregor's metamorphosis into an insect was an unconscious breakdown caused by the strain of his role in his family. Am I correct? No way to know... it's open for discussion. I'm glad, though, that all these thoughts and stories were saved."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOP RACK SLIDES DOWN EASY!!!","review":"I am not sure exactly how much my mountain bike weighs, but it is reasonably light.

The hangers \\"fasten\\" to the center pole using an adjustable clamp made of plastic. Your bike is being kept in the air by the friction between the plastic clamp tightening around the slippery metal pole. If you own a heavier bike, such as most mountain bikes, you will find your bike sliding/twisting down the column no matter how tight you make the clamp, since there is nothing locking the clamp to the pole.Also, the product description fails to mention the maximum weight limit for the rack, which is 30lbs for the upper hanger and 45lbs for the lower hanger. Personally, I would rate the weights at about 20lbs/35lbs. Beware of this product if your bike has any weight to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bike Rack","review":"I bought this bike rack a couple weeks ago. It came fast and appeared easy to install.

Now the stand is up (very easy to install) and holding two bikes.

I may have popped open a perfa-taped corner between the wall and ceiling in my garage...ooops. It's also pretty easy to overtighten, so just be careful.

Also, the tune is a bit too short. What would also be great for his age is if the rocker could rock on its own without any effort from baby, since my son is so small i have to sit with him and rock him for comfort.

Now if you have never used this you should be plenty happy with it as you don't have anything to go by.

I love it for the fragrance .... but the push spray can get stuck that's an engineering/ design flaw and, it, like many other pefumes is not offered in splash/ non-spray. So there's no getting around it.It is a heavy sweet perfume say like shalimar or opium with out the oriental tones. So it's not for hot weather or humid days and not really for old or very young.

The picture is excellent considering this is a standard definition DVD. It's probably the best standard definition DVD I have ever seen. The content is very good too.The reason I give this only four stars is some of the programs have very annoying parts which detract from the enjoyment. For instance, the \\"Vermont Balloons\\" episode is a beautiful looking and sounding episode, until you are close-up and hear the blast of the heated air going into the balloon. Also there are two other episode with scenic water views and nature sounds, until a boat rolls by. I think they should have edited out those parts and kept it to just nature.Nevertheless, I still recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hearts for the stout-hearted","review":"This book looked like a collection of cutesy, simple folds, but the ones I tried (heart w/pair of doves, heart w/flying dove) were anything but simple. I have quite a bit of folding experience (I've made many of Montroll's dinosaurs: whew!), but Francis Ow's folds were quite innovative and unique to me. As the review by ZoomCity states: \\"a stubborn determination to be successful\\" would be a useful ingredient. The diagrams were sometimes over-simplified, and it would take me a while to figure them out, but the results were very rewarding. This is not a beginner's book, for many of the more intriguing folds, but I certainly would want to have it in my Origami collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Origami Hearts","review":"In the interest of including numerous projects the author seems to have chosen to take shortcuts in the direction department. The photos are beautiful but the diagrams are terribly confusing to a novice. It would make a great coffetable book as long as no one asks if you have completed any of the projects unless you are already an expert folder. Better detailed diagrams with written instructions would make this a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krona 3 Qt Pot","review":"One thing that isn't noted in the product information is that the pot is MADE IN CHINA.

The heroine and hero actually get dirty in this one! A spunky heroine and a tough as nails hero. . .you know the formula. You either like 'em or you don't. I do.

The characters of Jack Sloan and Suzanne Beannet were enjoyable. thier dialogue lively but the story itself was not. I kept reading, hoping it would get better, but it never did. Couldn't wait for it to end. Fortunately it did.I especially disliked the Ling Yi character and saw no purpose in that whole ling yi-matt relationship.

It was released in the UK under the title \\"A Matter of Life and Death,\\" so viewers hungry to see it may look for this title in their TV listings. Look for a VERY young Richard Attenborough in the early heaven scene (\\"It's heaven, isn't it?\\") and a very young and intense Raymond Massey as heaven's advocate in the court scene. But previous reviewers are correct; Marius Goring steals the entire movie out from under these veteran stars with his whimsical portrayal of the romantic, French Revolution-era \\"conductor\\" who loses David Niven in the English fog just long enough for Niven to fall in love. Or was it just meant to be? Maybe heaven doesn't make mistakes at all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful, Inspiring Fantasy.","review":"First seen late one night thirty years ago, I've searched for a copy ever since. A timely wartime romance, this well-written story of a downed British aviator's second chance at life is a little-known cult classic. Falling from his stricken plane sans parachute, David Niven survives through a fluke- and asks for a second chance at life after falling for a WAF radar controller who finds him unharmed on the beach. The Trial in Heaven where Niven pleads for a continuance of his life is the finest moment of this little gem of a movie. I encourage Amazon to hurry the re-release of Stairway to Heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 52 years, it is still unforgettable.","review":"After seeing \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" in 1947, I remember walking out of the theater and thinking, Why can't American studios make movies this good? Oddly, I have seen parts of the movie on AMC, but never was able to catch the whole showing. It amazes me that a classic fantasy like this should not be readily available; it has got to be among the best five of this genre.

I really liked this album. I thought was really fun to listen to, and remember watching bits and pieces of the movie when i was kid. I'm not really a Queen fan, but they did an excellent job and are very creative and talented. Obviously, that's why there's always being taughted as one of the best rock bands in American history. If anybody's into movie sound tracks, Pink Floyd, or is a queen fan this is def. a must have! It's Really good. My favorite tracks were vultans theme, football fight, and the flash theme(they sound really funny when you listen to them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like or don't like the movie; You will like the music","review":"My name is Jason. I was three years old when I saw this movie advertised as comming on on HBO. When I saw that; I had to see it. I was already an avid sci-fi fan then. When I heard that music though, Yeow! I was three then. Now I am almost twenty-two. Right to this day I still get a kick out of the music and the movie. I am not as up on the movie today as I was then but I still can't get enough of the music. The one piece I like the most is the music played when Flash and the Hawkmen are blowing the (bleep) out of the War Rocket Ajax. For me that was the high point then and still is to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Queen you will like this","review":"First of all, the movie is good. Yea, I know it may seem cheesy to some, but it is faithful in following the storyline of the original Flash Gordon. This soundtrack contains all the songs of the movie and it is Queen at its best. The whole cd is set up in the same sequence as the movie. Buy this one before the publisher decides to stop selling it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really essential to a collection","review":"I love Queen, but I could have done without this album. It's just a collection of recordings for the \\"Flash Gordon\\" movie (which is great,by the way, if you like cheesy over the top early 80's sci-fi). I love the theme song, but a lot of this is very synth-based and filler, and could have been done a lot better. I think that Queen should have stayed away from this one. Still though, the larger-than-life musical style of Queen fits if you actually watch the movie. Otherwise, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"on a loop","review":"Warning! This CD is for die-hard Queen fans only. I bought this cd for my uncle's birthday, he is the aforementioned die-hard fan, and he loves the cd. But as I listened to it I couldn't help thinking that the CD player was on the 'repeat track' setting. Almost every song has is either the main theme remixed or the main theme hidden among dialogue. Why not a one star rating? Well, I just couldn't do that to Queen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Since \\"Flash's Theme\\" can be found on other Queen CDs, and most of the other \\"songs\\" aren't worth a second listen, you're better off passing on this CD. The band went a bit over the top with synths, which they had only recently incorporated into their music. The sounds created by the synths are as embarrassingly dated as this movie is ridiculously boring.Only Brian May's contributions are worth checking out: \\"Flash's Theme,\\" \\"The Wedding March,\\" and \\"The Hero,\\" a bone-crunching power-chord bonanza that rocks just as well as anything Queen ever did before or after this forgettable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Even though I am a big Queen fan, I must say that this is album is total waste of money unless you want to collect everything queen ever made. With the exception of the opening song, 'Flashes Theme', the CD sucks. I am not disappointed in Queen, I understand that every musical group has their share of ups and downs; this album is a small blemish on the otherwise brillant and incredible history of an awesome band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen? Are we sure?","review":"Now Queen has a good sound, but this soundtrack doesn't show that at all. In fact there is only one song on this album, the theme to Flash Gordon, which is played 18 times on this album and the song isn't that complex, so it grows old real fast. The only difference between songs is that there is movie clips laid down over the music. It is almost like the movie has been put on cd. And the music doesn't sound like Queen, it has this wacky electronic sound to it. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the Flash Gordon remix (the Final track) isn't that bad, in fact it is sort of funny. Whoever mix it seemed like they had fun doing it. Besides that I would suggest staying away from this soundtrack, if you want a good Queen soundtrack, pick up the Highlander soundtrack!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Find it all pretty satisfactory...","review":"This is probably a mistake reviewing this record, but I am something of a completist so here it goes. \`Flash Gordon' is a movie soundtrack, nothing more and nothing less and not particularly memorable. \\"Flash's Theme\\" is great for this record and \\"The Hero\\" is the best song and surprisingly heavy as compared with the rest of the album which is heavily syth laden. The movie can be enjoyable is watched in the right frame of mind, which is to enjoy it as a live action comic book with all the cheesiness that this implies. Only for fans of the film or for Queen fans who have to have it all (like me) but others stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Variety - One or Two Good Songs","review":"I'm not really into the dialogue mixed in with the music and the album starts to sound all the same very quickly.I do enjoy the title track as well as Vultan's Theme (which was used in the awesome arcade game Vanguard)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Wanted Dialogue Over The Music, I'd Watch The Movie","review":"Don't get me wrong, I like when soundtracks/scores include memorable dialogue on them, but it should be separated from the music. I bought this expecting to hear the music from the film, but the dialogue is actually played OVER the music!!!! It is like watching the movie with a blindfold on!!!!Maybe one day, Queen will release a music-only soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"blinking annoying","review":"this is a good soundtrack by an excellent band, however, i think that appreciation is limited by those for whom this is nostalgia, cheesy Sf fans, and queen fans.

It has every input method you need: A/V, S-video, RF, and of course PC. The only complaint I have is when set to lower resolutions like 1024x768, the text looks blurred. As soon as I changed the resolution to the highest one - 1280x1024 - it became crystal clear. However the fonts are a little too fine at this resolution. Is this a problem with all LCD monitors?

It began a little like Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" and I found myself engrossed and enjoying it.About 200 pages into the book, I realized it had nothing more up its sleeve than how sterotypical Native Canadians live and the problems they go through. It seemed like the author wanted to show the plight of Native Canadians but the drinking problems and incest issues were harped on throughout the whole book as if to titilate not disparage. Stephen King would never have to make insinuations about child rape at least 4 times in a book. As the author puts it \\"All Indians beat their wives and f--- their children.\\" The author's characters did nothing to prove this comment wrong. It was like each chapter was trying to \\"out-vulgar\\" the last.Needless to say, I got about 25 pages from the end of the book and said \\"forget it\\" realizing I couldn't care less what happened to the hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad.","review":"The fact that this book is a fast read is about the best thing I can say about it. But just because it's fast, don't think for a minute you're going to get anywhere by the end! Especially not with the mediocre characterization and a muddled plot full holes as big as the train tunnel that's one of the book's settings. Plus, it's needlessly brutal, even for the horror genre (there's a reacurring motif of bodies and heads cleaved in half. I'm not sure if it was intentional or not) If you're looking for a good Native American horror novel, pick up \\"Crota\\" by Owl Goingback instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror in the Canadian Rockies","review":"I don't often read horror novels, but I was attracted to this by the fact it's written by Muriel Gray, a well-known Scottish TV presenter. I was surprised at first, because to my mind it read very much like a Stephen King novel (but clearly not all the reviewers here agree with that - judge for yourself). After getting over that I found it a very enjoyable read, at times terrifying! I've visited the area the novel is set and it was quite evocative of place and atmosphere. I thought her characterisation of Sam Hunt was quite believable, although I'd like to know what aboriginal Canadians would think of it. As others have noted, the book has some of the errors of a first time novelist, but this only increases my anticipation of her next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly plotted mishmash of Indian lore and gross thrills","review":"Reviews that compared this horrible mess to Stephen King induced me to continue reading long after I wanted to put it aside. I kept hoping it would all come together for me. It never did. The only similarity to King is the graphic violence. But unlike King, it's not redeemed by fitting into a compelling story with characters you care about. Characters were built up for chapters and then discarded with one or two sentences.The ending never reconciles \\"reality\\" with the supernatural, so major plot points are left hanging.

These are NOT retail glasses. These are bulk-packed in a box and LABELED for individual resale. What that means is that they come with stickers/UPC labels on each individual glass. The stickers are impossible to remove. I have returned other kitchen products because of this. I have only used 5 so far because it takes 5-7 minutes with a razor blade, tape, and acetone to clean off the stickers (which are cheap paper and use a permanent adhesive). Otherwise, these are unimpressive, basic glasses that all have a weird glass drip at the lip from manufacturing. If these were retail packaging and didn't have the stickers, I would have given them 4 stars for just basic, cheap glassware. Unless your time is worth nothing or you like stickers on your glasses, these are just not worth the effort. I'm sure some guy at Anchor Hocking got a bonus for saving 1 cent per glass by using such evil stickers. I won't be completing this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice enough for guests","review":"Over the years I have discovered that drinking glasses are actually disposable items. I like a thin drinking glass and have learned to live with the fact that there will be breakage! In fact, one glass arrived in pieces. But that left 11 pretty good looking glasses so I decided not to return them.These glasses will work just fine. They are thin and tall and have a heavy bottom which seems to help stability. If anything, they might be just a bit narrow for my taste but all in all they are more than adequate for my needs. I feel they will serve me well and in a few years when most of them have broken, I will just buy another set.Update: January 16, 2013These glasses lasted about 2 years and it is time to buy new ones. I have decided to go with a thicker glass this time because I feel they will last a lot longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great glasses, lousy packing","review":"My first set arrived broken, which was no surprise considering there was no padding on the bottom of the box. Who is teaching packing 101 at the warehouse? Amazon replaced them promptly, but why don't they just get it right the first time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy to find replacements","review":"My husband loves his highball glasses but over the last 20 years he has slowly broken most of them. I had a very hard time finding them. When I recieved them they were just what he like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break very easily","review":"I agree with all the other reviewers who note how fragile these glasses are.We received these as a wedding present less than a year and a half ago. We really liked the size and feel of the glasses, but over that short period of time all but two of the glasses have broken. Only one broke in a fall--all the rest have shattered with minor bumps or have simply come out of the dishwasher with cracks in them!As much as I like everything else we own by Anchor Hocking, I cannot recommend these glasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of money","review":"this is the worst purchase experience i've ever had with amazon. the glasses were misshapen, lumpy and un-cylindrical. i have never seen such poor quality in a product. i cannot imagine how a drinking glass could have been produced in such a shoddy manner and then been allowed to be sold. two glasses have already broken by fairly routine household usage. an inferior product and clearly no quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"These were very nice looking, but also disappointingly fragile. I've had wineglasses that were much more durable than these. We've had them for just under a year, and only half are left. We don't use a dishwasher, but one broke just by getting shifted on our bamboo dish drainer. Really frustrating and worrisome having broken glass routinely in the kitchen - I'm not clumsy, nothing else in the kitchen has broken in the year that 6 of these glasses have - I think that is a terrible indictment of this product and would have a difficult time recommending them to anyone for any purpose other than target practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap glasses","review":"These glasses are cheaply made and as a result some of them were broken in shipping. I don't blame Amazon for not shipping them properly, they are just so poorly made that they break easily. When I saw them I was incredibly disappointed and returned them."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 arrived cracked","review":"This jibes with what others have said about these glasses being so fragile. They're in the washer now so I'll see how they fare. On the other hand, they really are cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are mostly round. Cylindrical, even.","review":"What's to say? They're water glasses. They hold water. And they do so consistently.We did (unintentionally) experiment with their interactions with ceramic tile. So far, the tile more often wins, than not, but they are remarkably resilient to knock-overs, despite being, well ... glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent","review":"This was a decent product for the price. Not to flashy, trash, it's right in the middle. And they are easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I sent these back because they were so poor quality. They looked as if approximately 1/3 of them were seconds. Many of the rims had noticeable imperfections, I guess where they poured the glass. One of the glasses was also cracked. Fortunately Amazon was good as always and took them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Fragile","review":"We bought these glasses to replace some glasses that lasted for more than 12 years. In less than three months seven of them have broken. They are very fragile. Several have broken in the dish washer, just from standard washing cycles. Others have broken by being bumped up against other glasses in the cupboard. It isn't that we are rough on them, because we treat them the same we we treated our other glasses which lasted for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great glasses!","review":"These are great! They ended up being a little bigger than I expected (I suppose I have no concept of size with glasses online) but they are perfect for everyday drinking needs. Sturdy. The quality is not impeccable, but for the price they are fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"breaks easily","review":"I purchased this set and have been using it for less than a month. Out of 12 tumblers 6 have broken. These were not dropped..they break during normal washing (hand washing - no dishwasher). Unless you are particularly fond of picking up broken glass or really really enjoy getting deep cuts on your hand(s) stitched, I wouldn't buy these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily Broken","review":"We purchased 24 of these glasses about 6 months ago and are now down to 5. They broke under normal use....in the dishwasher, in the kitchen sink (stainless steel) and a couple even broke while dispensing ice from the ice maker. These are the least durable glasses we have ever purchased. Oddly, we also have the 9 oz rocks size and haven't broken any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks very easily","review":"Bought these on amazon last april and were down to about 5 glasses after 4 months. Every other washing in the dishwasher one of these glasses will break. We even thought that there might have been a fluke with the batch so we bought another set and these too are on their way out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin glass","review":"OK, it is a great price, but within 1 week of using them, we had 3 broken glasses. 1 year later we have 3 left! They are made super thin and they break at the slightest thing! Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Lots","review":"I got these, pulled them out of the box, and put them in the dishwasher. I figured they looked fine at first glance, so why beak out the inspection mirror. As I removed the first one from the dishwasher, I noticed on the lip was an area much thicker than the rest of the rim, as I pulled out the rest 9 out of 12 had this same flaw. Now I realize they were not expensive, but this was not some flaw missed by an inspector, these were rejects and I don't remember seeing that in the description. By the way, I also bought some smaller ones in the same order from Amazon and they had the same flaw. Very disappointed my Amazon friends, it makes me wonder about ordering more expensive items."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice glasses","review":"I did a lot of searching for glasses and this one is the best by far! nice weight to it, not too heavy and not too light. And was a great price. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the highest quality","review":"nice glasses, and I was impressed that they were made in the USA, however two of the twelve glasses had bad rims and were not usable. I would have expected defective glasses like these to be removed in production. Well packaged, with individual bubble wrap. Too bad the quality is not higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"The glasses arrived well packed, none of them broken. I read previous reviews about some quality issues, and indeed, one of the glasses has a strange \\"fold\\" around the side that looked like a crack but wasn't. The other eleven glasses were near perfect, though, and for the money, it was definitely worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Break Easily","review":"I love the look and feel of these glasses, but they break WAY too easily in the dishwasher, even getting ice from the dispenser on the refridgerator door. I'm on my third set and am facing the fact that these glasses are so fragile that they are a danger to fingers unloading the dishwasher. I am looking, reluctantly, for a heavier duty replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible guitar","review":"This is mood making, sexy, great music. Neal adds a slight rock edge to some beautiful and familiar melodies. This album is great for background music (we play it in our store), party music or just for listing. One of the best guitar players of all time 'sings' with his instrument. BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheezy collection of covers","review":"Schon's last two solo projects (Beyond the Thunder and Electric World) were recordings worthy of his reputation as the guitarist for Santana and Journey. Those albums had some spark of originality in both the compostions and the playing. Voices, unfortunately, is a by-the-book collection of covers of pop-radio cheeze-whiz. Only someone with an eye on the bottom line would cover - on the same album - Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On and Bryan Adams' Everything I Do, I Do For You. Skip this and go buy Beyond the Thunder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neal Schon Sings","review":"This is Neal Schon,of Santana and Journey fame,using his acoustic guitar talents to simulate vocals, and he does a masterful job. He is accompanied by Gary Cirimelli on keyboards,drum and acoustic rhythm guitar and Scott Fuller on keyboards.He plays Mariah Carey's \\"Hero\\",Anne Lennox's \\"Why\\", along with \\"Killing Me Softly\\" and several other favorite hits. His guitar substitutes for the vocals and you can almost hear it singing. His rendition of \\"Caruso\\" is mournfully mellow and \\"Con Te Partino\\" of Andrea Bocelli fame is awesome. He does with his guitar what Bocelli does with his voice. \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" is a softly toned-down rendition of this favorite. This is an excellent album to really appreciate Neal Schon's versatility and his ability to adapt his playing to diverse forms of music It presents a different version of songs that are favorites"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neal shows his versatility, yet again!","review":"I was a little skeptical about this CD from the choice of songs on it. After giving it a listen, I am blown away. Neal Schon can even make Mariah Carey sound good. In Killin Me Softly, Neal makes his guitar sing like a human voice--amazing. My Heart Will Go On (from Titanic) actually brought tears to my eyes (and I don't cry easily)! This CD is definately worth a listen. Neal Schon has a direct line to the music gods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Neal Ever!","review":"I have always loved Neal's playing and I have been a guitarist for many years now. This is flat out some of the most soulful, best guitar playing I have ever heard. PERIOD!

Otherwise, I am gonna tie you to the mast, and make you play it. hahaHow about more blues?! Do some Bloomfield tunes, not Annie Lennox.

Come on. He used to make his guitar sing and wail. Now it's me who's crying. I wouldn't put this cd with my jazz collection, and I wouldn't listen to it in an elevator. I can't think of anywhere.. well, there was that castaway story.Neal is great. Neal can be very original. So what's this thing?I gave it a two, only because Neal gets a 10 from me for being Neal.

It introduces business concepts and analysis techniques by real-life example. Many of these examples were directly applicable to my business.

However, I entered all the data myself. I wanted to learn the material by plugging in my own data to figure out how stuff works. I can see how this book would be frustrating to someone who would rather not have to enter the formulas and dummy data."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"The book is clear, concise, and to the point. I used it as my standard reference in my training and for all my training delegates. This book gives you fantastic and powerful tools that you need to develop a business model.

I bought 1 pair in black & 1 pair in taupe to match all of my wardrobe, but I also think they look smart with nice jeans. The Me Too brand seems to try & add some appeal, to what we all imagine when we think of old lady comfort shoes. For the low price I highly recomend these shoes, I wear a size 8 1/2 & they were pretty accurate, they also make your feet appear very small? my 13yr old daughter wants to borrow them so that is a good sign I suppose.

The copper and brass together make this an interesting paper towel holder for any kitchen.

Night is his best yet and looks terriffic in its new packaging. For years, I have searched out this film and finally found it under Rhino video's Midnight Madness label hosted by Elvira. This video by Englewood looks better and also Englewood has put out videos of other Wood films. It is a film you's expect from MST3K. However,I can not get enough of these films and Night of the Ghouls certainly does not dissapoint in the schlock horror department. Lugosi is missing sadly, but there is Tor Johnson on hand once again as Lobo the mindless brute from Bride of the Monster, now one of the ghouls.

The book's actually more interesting then it sounds, but it's still dead boring. The writing is pretty good, but really, the plot is a killer.

Dies irae and Miserere are both texts which are serious and solemn, and the music provided by Delalande is very apt. The Dies irae in particular is quite sombre, but still very gentle. The last chorus in particular is one of the most beautiful and affecting pieces of music I know. The Miserere reworks some material from an earlier setting for soprano and continuo, but introduces a lot of newer music too. Of that, the arias for haute-contre (sung as if it was effortless by Howard Crook) are especially worth noting.Herreweghe is often noted for a somewhat subdued manner in his performances, and I think that is right on the mark for these works. He manages to bring a deepness to the music that is very appropriate. The solo voices are all excellent, and I cannot find fault with either the orchestra or choir.

I have used this card at least two or three times in an actual game and it is great. Now this card seems to be available in some Wal-Mart stores and online so it's much easier to get than it was a long time ago back in 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grocery bag","review":"This is a great bag.

I have read everything McDevitt has written thus far and I must say this is by far the weakest book. To me, it is nothing more than a printed disaster movie. It takes an exceptionally unlikely event and spins it into a story filled with a decent amount of action, but populated by a host of forgettable characters. While reading it I realized that I really did not care much whether any of the too many poorly sketched people in the book lived or died.

However, instead of an update of the old novels, Mc Devitt, comes up with an original plot, which is clever, and technically feasible now. From the comet features (nature, size, speed) to the billiard events, the plot is one of a kind. Even the political escenario fits very well. Much more interesting and fun that the two movies.

I read from cover to cover and when I was done, I gave it away... with a warning, this book misses the mark by a long chalk. Slow to build, quick to end, this book seems to have been written at the pace of a last second Hail Mary term paper. There's a great idea here toally killed by the conference type writing by McDevitt. Everyone in this book seems to be stuck in committee... talking just to pass the time until the disaster actually passes them by. And boy, does this disaster pass them by. McDevitt wastes no time by the last quarter of this book to totally gloss over any actual destruction on Earth, by the last page a year has passed since the Moonfall, and everything... and I mean everything, is just peachy! Bypass this book if you can, it literally reads like it was meant to be produced for television."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real surprises","review":"A few years ago I read a book called A TALENT FOR WAR by this guy called Jack McDevitt. I read the whole thing in a day and it has been one of my favorites ever since. After that I read every McDevitt book I could get hold of.Unfortunatly the rest of his books have not grabed me the way A TALENT FOR WAR did and MOONFALL is no exception. I found most of the characters very calm and almost bored with the fact that a giant comet is going to destroy the moon and possibly lead to earth's destruction. In fact they are far more interested in insurance, money and in the case of the vice president getting re-elected.There is very little sence of urgency in this book, it reads more like a report on a casual fishing trip. Also you know right from the start what the whole story was going to be about there were no surprises, no unexpected twists everything that you expected to happen happened.Oh well I can always read A TALENT FOR WAR again. Now there is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"I liked the premise - tidal waves caused by a comet exploding the moon. What I did not understand is why the author continued to introduce new (and minor) characters up until the last few pages of the book!

I found it particularly valuable that he combines his conceptual framework with actual interviews of top traders that are applying it daily.

The book is flooded of interviews with hedge fund managers anonymous leading you to nowhere but setting goals, visualizing success, overcoming fears and all the stuff you find in any trading psychology book, only that the writing skill of the author is sub-standard. The author had repeated the term \\"Hedge Fund\\" highly frequently. However, the content is not related particularly to any hedge fund or hedge fund manager at all. Also, the author had elaborated the term \\"mastery\\" throughout the book.

That burner cover is 4 inches in diameter, and the flame diameter is roughly five inches. As a result, the flame goes up the sides of the pot - bad for the pot and a waste of gas.

No where in the book does it ever give ANY definitions for the vocabulary words, most of which are unique to politics; one cannot even glean a hint of a definition from context. The book was written by different authors, some of whom were worth reading, but mostly not. The chapter on England had such horrendous grammatical and spelling errors, I couldn't keep reading it (I have no idea how it is in its eighth edition). Most of the book used casual phrases for the lay person but never gets into the specifics of what I need to learn about the functioning of international politics. The book was awful.

Worked great initially, but I was pretty disgusted when I came home from work on 26 March to find the lamp burned out. A week and a half? I thought perhaps the bulb overheated or something, although you'd figure a *heat lamp* would be designed to tolerate high heat. Anyway, I tilted the bowl fixture from almost straight down to about 35 degrees off of vertical to allow more heat to escape, and aimed a pretty small fan at the top of the fixture to cool it. The second bulb blew out on 8 April, giving me an average bulb life of about 12 days--but considering the bulbs were on a 10 hour timer, they lasted for about 120 hours each. Totally unacceptable!

The bat does not fully swing, because one of the guides block it. you can't control the so called pitching, the ball is a magnet that sticks to the playing field. pitch it to the bat and it may not roll to the bat, hit it and it may not make it out of the out field. Score board dials won't stay attached to the paper score board. It takes two people to operate. it's the day after Christmas and this one is going to the trash.

I hadn't heard much of his guitar work before this other than Mogg/Way's \\"Chocolate Box\\" and he really excels on this one.\\"Overload\\" and \\"Driven\\" are the first two tracks and are more typical UFO style rockers than the rest. \\"Clap Hands\\" is superb and I think \\"Beautiful Friend\\" is the finest ballad Phil Mogg has ever written.

Finally, after years of use and abuse, it broke and I was very pleased to find it's replacement online. However, it turned out to be the evil twin. My main complaint is that it does not remain stationary with your ironing board. There is a large plastic screw which threads through the metal base and should clamp tightly against the underside of your ironing board. However, the plastic screw constantly comes out of the metal base and so the whole holder wobbles while in use. Also keep in mind that it folds from right to left for storage and so needs to be mounted on the left side of the ironing board. This is a little awkward for righties as we would stand on the left side of ironing board while ironing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find it elsewhere !!","review":"I ordered the item and I guess it was on back order, but no one let me know.

The special effects are good and the movie will keep you interested throughout because you wonder how Stallone is going to rescue everybody from the tunnel when it seems impossible to get out.If you want an action packed movie don't get this one, but if you like entertaining action movies that have some mystery to them, then this would be a great movie to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE WORST","review":"I HAVE A 155CM TV SET AND WITH THE MOVIE BEING IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT THE BLACK BARS ON TOP AND BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN MADE SAME DULL & BORNING LIKE BEING IN THE BACK ROW AT MUSIC CONCERT.

However, it certainly does feel like the worst Stallone movie ever made. At least, Stallone's other movies were so bad that you could laugh at them. No such luck with \\"Daylight\\".

I've tried many products for curly hair and often find that they either leave my hair too crunchy or they are just too heavy for fine hair. I wanted to like Bb Curl Conscious, but it really didn't do anything but make my curls heavy and too soft to hold a style, and did nothing to smooth out the frizz. So I'm going to pass on this one. BUT...My hairdresser recommended Moroccan Oil Curling Creme and that is what I use now.

Nothing was mentioned of what his family were enduring, or of the efforts to secure his release and any negotiations going on behind the scenes. Whilst the approach taken accurately describes and conveys what Mr Hargrove was going through and how he got through each day, it made the book feel like it was lacking the balance of what was going on with his family.

NO one else see's this or hears it, afterwards he becomes very intelligent and has the NSA on him and Berkely University is very interested in his theories. But as time passes in his little town people start to fear him and his abilities. Only a hand full of people who r still the same around him, that aren't afraid of him.

However, in the last 40 pages or so, the better parts of the movie are cut short. It's just so rushed in the end, with details left out that I enjoyed from the movie.

The women of Cheeky were generally more attractive to me. They were trimmer and slimmer as opposed to full figured and there were more of them. Underarm hair was shaved and the ladies pubis was trimmed in the latter movie.The stories were about equally dumb and the acting in both cases was average. Still Cheeky caught my attention while Miranda lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential but Christian content stymies its usefulness.","review":"I was enjoying this book. I liked its unique focus - that of the resentments that all members of a stepfamily have and how they undermine the successful functioning of the new family unit. However, when the authors were discussing the essential components of a good marriage and wrote that the woman has to be ready to \\"submit (or adapt herself)\\" to her husband, I got a really sour taste in my mouth. After that, knowing that the book was based on this traditional, conservative interpretation of Christian beliefs vastly reduced my confidence that this book was going to have anything useful for me and my new family. I think the use of Christian values is fine - traditional or contemporary, if that's what you're looking for. However, this perspective should be prominently listed on the book as it is a major assumption and is a value that a large number of people today do not necessarily share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't take a Chance on this book","review":"I'm very disappointed in this book. The author is wrong about basic facts on which she bases her theories. To wit:Frodo does not, as the author claims, use the Ring \\"to test resistance to institutionalized power and the power of others within the community.\\" He doesn't \\"use\\" the Ring at all; if anything, it uses him. Gandalf's Elven ring does not save Frodo from the Nazgul at the Ford on the way to Rivendell; at that point in the story, we don't know that Gandalf has one of the Elven rings. \\"Mordor\\" may mean\\"murder\\" in Anglo-Saxon, and that may have been in the back of Tolkien's mind; but \\"Mordor\\" mean \\"black-land\\" in Sindarin, and that's the meaning Tolkien wanted for the land. Durin's Bane is not mithril or greed (though that is an issue), but the Balrog.Dr. Chance does makes several interesting points, and for that reason I might, albeit with much hesitation, recommend this book to those who are familiar enough with LotR to avoid the pitfalls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insight into Lotr","review":"Overall coverage of the entire trilogy is excellent and she provides logic as to where Tolken was going with his writing. She also includes info from Joseph Campbell about mythology and the role of hero. Overall a very interesting, useful and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!","review":"This book has these people complaining about LOTR, thinking that its content is coming from Hitler, just because the trilogy was released during the time that Hitler was going Gung-Ho on Jews and Blacks. Oh, please! LOTR has nothing to do with Hitler nor the NAZIs. They keep on saying that Frodo was using the ring to control people, just like Hitler was trying to control the Jews and Blacks. WTF?? If LOTR is NAZI worship, then \\"The Life Aquatic\\" is the best movie ever. PURE FICTION. Whoop-de-do, then!As a LOTR fan, LOTR has a good message, if you think about it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album since I was 15,teen.","review":"I suggest to anyone who love jazz and especially the trumpet, to listen to sky dive.

They had a blast jumping around and bouncing on the soft, springy bed. When it popped on day 4, they weren't as excited. Like most of the other reviewers here, it continued to develop holes along seam lines at a rate too fast to keep up with patching. Then the main floor developed a hernia, the bottom section developed a rip along the seam and Intex does not cover any of this by warranty. If you do buy, expect a week of fun and then disappointment as it gradually deflates from apparent manufacturing defects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea if it worked","review":"This is a great idea for burning off energy when the weather is bad. Ours lasted three days before a seam split while our 4 yr old was jumping in it. This happened within the 30 day replacement period, but I don't know yet if CMS Worldwide Sales will live up to their guarentee - or if the next one will last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and safe for kids!","review":"This is a fun toy for kids!

My daughter has only had this thing since Christmas morning. The two rings under the top are already deflated and they are not easy to repair! The jumping area is completed busted out! We have this product on our carpet in the living room, a very cushioned surface. My daughter is not a rough child and weighs only 47 pounds. I don't know if this particular jump-o-lene is just a lemon or if others are having the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter to emergency room after this toy","review":"We bought this jumpolene for our toddler and he liked it okay, but then my 5 year old daughter started bouncing in it. She landing wrong on her neck/head and was screaming and said she couldn't move her arms. (sounded like spinal injury to me)We rushed to the emergency room. 8 hours, 50 tests including cat scans and MRI's later, we left with a brace around her neck for the next week. Thank god for insurance because the bill was over $8000.She's fine now, but the jumpolene went into the trash the next day.Now, of course this type of accident can happen anywhere your children are bouncing (beds, trampolines, etc) and sitting there watching them jump is no protection... you can't prevent an accident when you don't know it's about to happen.I just wanted to warn parents about this type of toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment and no customer support!","review":"My 4 year old son wanted to love this toy. jumped on it and set up obstacles first days. then it broke on a seam.

We received ours as a gift from Grandma, to keep our two bouncing boys active in the winter. We didn't have a pump, so we had to blow it up on our own. It. Took. Forever. It doesn't look too big online, but when you come face to face with this thing with only your own lungs to fill it, it's huge.We had it up for a few weeks, indoors, with carpets, but it still got leaks. Every chamber except one got a slow to medium-speed leak, which we couldn't find. In the end, we set it up one last time (using an air mattress pump), had a few bounces before it deflated later in the day, and put it on Craigslist.For free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while it lasted.","review":"The size is just right for kids 5 and under... room to jump, romp and get creative. It takes forever to get the thing inflated, but child anticipation is priceless. We were able to set up a couple diff locations pending some arranging in rooms, so that was great. The down fall was the amount of use we got out of it before an air leak. We used the patch, but due to the leak being at a seam in the top bumper, we only slowed it down. Then we got another leak on the base, again at the seam. Impossible to seal with just a patch. Slowed it down once again, before we got a puncture somehow in the base again.. This all in about a 2 months time... I didn't expect it leak proof, but if a seam is going to give out, which is where I would think most leaks would happen, I wish they'd provided a glue to, to seal it properly with the patch."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"I am now shopping for a third Jumpolene. The first one was purchased 5 years ago ... and lasted about 2 years, slowing dying the entire time. The second one was bought 6 months later ...and lasted 1 year before the chambers began deflating, 1 at a time, over the course of 6 months. The \\"repair\\" patches are a joke, and no other repair kits would work, either. The ONLY reason that I search for one now is because my children LOVED it, and beg for another. I will get another if the price is right, but Intex needs to work on the craftmanship of its products if they wish to charge this much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product","review":"This was a Christmas gift for two young girls. After two weeks the center chamber (floor) of Jump o Lene deflated. We contacted CMS worldwide and reported the problem. They made suggestions as how to fix the problem. Nothing worked. We called and emailed the company. They emailed and stated they would send a patch kit. That was the middle of January. It is now the end of March and we haven't received the kit or has the company returned any further calls or emails. We will not be purchasing another Jump o Lene nor will we be purchasing another product from CMS worldwide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy Grandma","review":"I purchased this item for my 4 year old granddaughter. She loved the toy, however, it was short-lived because it punctured (after 1 week) and because of Amazon's rules I cannot return the item. Now I'm faced with finding a replacement gift for her. I will certainly not be buying another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last long","review":"I have the \\"castle\\" version of the Jumpolene. It too popped the bottom chamber after about 6 months. I have to blow it up again every day. But, it lasts about 5-6 hours and only takes 30 seconds or so to inflate with an electric pump...so not the end of the world.The chamber you bounce on popped the other day. I can inflate it again, but it only lasts about 30 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Top seam of Jump-o-lene was not sealed correctly and broke within 1st month of use.

My 2-year-old and her 3-year-old cousin had a blast playing with it over Dec. 24 and 25 at a relative's house. We packed it up and brought it home a few days later only to find that it deflated within a few hours. This is a fantastic idea but its really poorly made. We've tried to find the hole(s) to patch them with little success so we just re-inflate it if we leave it up in the carpeted basement. I would strongly *not* recommend this product, which is a shame since it's so much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumpolene -Not worth the money","review":"Fun but doesn't hold up for more than a couple of months. Seams separate and patching doesn't hold. I wrote to Intex; but no support from there either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea cheaply made","review":"This seemed like the perfect answer for our daughter's ball pit: soft, high-sided, and bouncy on the bottom. We purchased it for her for Christmas and set it up Christmas eve. She absolutely loved it for a little while, and probably still would if it hadn't sprung leaks EVERYWHERE. It is now January 9th, and in spite of taking care not to exceed the weight limit and to avoid having shoes and sharp items near the jump-o-lene, etc, normal use by our 35lbs 3-year old has resulted in a flattened bottom (both chambers) and a flat top ring. Sadly, I can't recommend this product because of the cheap material and/or production that results in it breaking in record time. I am frustrated to find myself in the market for a replacement so soon after setting it up! Keep in mind that, due to the fact that there were ballpit balls inside, very little actual JUMPING took place! Mostly playing and flopping over, and aparently even that was too much! What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk-o-lene","review":"My 6, 5, and 4 year old loved the jumpolene for about 2 hours before it popped. We were careful not exceed the weight limit by only letting 2 kids go at a time. We supervised them carefully and they weren't crazy in it. Fun while it lasted, but c'mon, 2 hours? Ridiculous. We used our inflatable swimming pool as a ball pit prior to this and it lasted 2 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm on #4 due to holes!!!!","review":"I am on my fourth jump-o-lene in 2 months.

Our children are very mello (compared to others their age) and the product popped at the seam. We haven't had it up for 2 months, we would probably use it once every two weeks to play. Very disappointed. We had a smaller cheaper one from Target that lasted longer than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"seam ripped after only a few days & couldn't be fixed","review":"My kids were so excited to get this last Christmas. I read the reviews,but purchased anyway hoping that if we were really careful, things would be different for us. My kids are small (20, 30 and 35 pounds, when we purchased this) and they were super careful in the ballpit. (All shoes, hair clips, and accessories came off before going in) They treated it as gently as they possibly could. Unfortunately, it ripped along a seam within the first month. We made several attempts to fix it, but it continued to get small rips in different places along the seam and never held air again. So disappointing. It's seriously just a poorly made product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"Interms of fun my 2yr old and 3yr old had lots of fun jumping and bouncing around. It started leaking air frm the seam and I can't find it. This is the second jumpolene I've purchased this year because my kids do enjoy it. The price should be cheaper because you can't keep it a long time. Make some improvements and you can have all of my business!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noxious Chemical Smell!","review":"Wow, I purchased this item from Meijer near my home. Once home, we were ready to get it blown up..NOT! The smell of this product was so very strong. It was evident that some strong chemicals were used in manufacturing this product. It did not even smell like a new shower curtain type of smell as I'd expect. Needless to say, it gave me a headache within five minutes of it being opened and we returned it pronto! My son even started to sneeze when we took it out of the box. I would never consider putting any baby/child in an item that smells that noxious and strong of chemicals of some sort. We even had to open the windows of our home to air out the smell of it after boxing it back up for return..then placing it in the trunk. I'll keep looking for a better inflatable bouncer or a trampoline."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 leaks!","review":"Received this as a gift for my sons 2nd birthday. We blew it up with the air mattress pump and later in the day found 2 leaks in the seams that are impossible to repair. Wish it was manufactured better.

The first day we bought it, we inflated it and she jumped around in it for hours. The following day, the center deflated. And it's been like that daily ever since.This has not even seen outdoor use; it's been in our playroom for the entire time we've owned it and the only thing that goes inside is my daughter. There is no reason for this thing to leak - I could understand if it had contact with sharp objects of any kind, but it hasn't. It deflates every single day, and we have to find and patch holes, then re-inflate it. It's a pain in the butt.I give it 2 stars because my daughter loves it when it's working, but I'm sorry we bought it for her. The toy should be more durable than this. Save your money and find something that doesn't leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero for Two","review":"I ordered one last year and zone 4 and 6 didn't hold air.

I definitely am not getting my moneys worth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tad Disappointing","review":"Although my girls are enjoying the Jump-O-Lene they got for Christmas, I don't find it as bouncy as I would have hoped. I guess I was expecting something more rubbery to give it good bounce. It would be a good start for those who are overly concerned with how high your child can bounce. I shall be purchasing a real trampolene next because this isn't going to hold my girls' enthusiasm. Price is a bit high given that it is basically a blow up pool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great while it lasted, WATER problems if outside","review":"We bought this for our 2 sons, ages 2 and 4, and it was a huge hit with all of us at first! It's pretty durable and keeps the kids safe, supervised, of course! But it's not easy to inflate or deflate, so we left it outside for a while, and after it rained a couple of times the bottom filled with water, and there is absolutely NO way to get it out! We thought there should be a plug for this reason, and with the water in there the unit expanded, pushing the floor up far enough that we couldn't let the kids use it safely. We used it until we had to get rid of it by cutting it up. I guess if you're going to use it indoors, or take it down EVERY time you use it outdoors, it's a great investment, the price is great for what you get! But if you leave it outside don't plan on using it for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugs enjoyed it more than kids","review":"I bought this thinking it was a great alternative to a regular trampoline. I kept it outside, covered, but that didn't stop bugs from making homes in it everyday. They would go in the crevice between the floor and sides. It didn't matter much because my daughter didn't enjoy it at all, there was hardly any bounce to it no matter how much or how little air I put in it. It went in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pump makes this product useless","review":"No pump makes this product useless. My 3 year old jumped in it for 10 minutes and it needed more air.

Good idea, but bad design.The sad part is that when we first got it, my son LOVED jumping around in it,especially when I put his ball pit balls in it.If only it would have been a more thought out product.Now when he asks for it I have to tell him no.We're going to have to upgrade.What a waste & dissapointment.Would NOT recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"We tried this product twice and both times they got holes in them.

As soon as the other toys were opened he went right back to the jumpolean & spent a majority of the day in it. He has played in it everyday & it gives me plenty of morning time for 2 cups of coffee & the morning news! The top rim leaks air and I can't find the hole to save my life but I have a auto air pump to blow it up once a day.

Two was a little too young, but now that he's closer to three he loves it, and wants to use it several times whenever he's here. It's bigger than I thought, and takes up a lot of space in our downstairs family room. We have to stand it up on one end or roll it into another room when it's not in use because we don't have enough room to leave it, and I don't want to deflate and inflate it all the time. We haven't had any trouble with punctures, but we don't allow toys or hard objects to be used in it. I would love to be able to have it outside in the summer, but again, it's a storage problem if left inflated. Overall though, I would recommend it. Great physical exercise; great fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable!","review":"The toy has a great fun factor, the kids loved to play in it every day - for about 4-5 weeks then it broke! The outer ring chambers are still fine but chambers in the bouncing middlepart broke and now there is one big hump and toy is very unsafe to use!Although the cost of the toy is very low,I am disappointed about the very short durability of the toy.If you want to buy it, be aware that you can only use it for a few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"son loves it","review":"2 year old loves it think it got a small leak from an older child who wasn't supposed to be in it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Fun but No Warranty","review":"I purchased this for Christmas for my 3 year old Niece and 2 year old Nephew along with $100 worth of balls.

How many balls would it take to make this an adequate ball pit for a 2 and 4 year old? Not sure but it is a lot more than the 300 + we already have. I'm guessing 2000 or more might make it OKAY. The quality of this product is not worth the money. It is not at all trampoline like as advertised - so, it's only good as a ball pit. It is not sturdy enough to stand up to the basic jumping of toddlers, let alone a child of even 1/2 the weight limit. Not that it would matter - only toddlers would be happy with the total lack of bounce of the thing. The Jump-o-Lene is a great idea that has fallen really short."},{"rating":"2","title":"grandson loves it","review":"Got this for my grandson's 3rd birthday.

I fill it about 1/3 full with 4\\" plastic balls. They jump inside, on the edge, and love to get dumped out with the balls. Then we crawl around underneath it, looks like a spaceship floating around. This is the 7th ball pit I've purchased in 6 years. I purchased two this time, so I have an extra. The top rim seems to get a leak, probably somewhere in the seam, but I can never find it to patch it.

And, truthfully, I thought it would last a little longer then two days in a carpeted home. Unfortunately, the first chamber has a hole on the seam (more like a tear)and it doesn't hold air. My 2 1/2 yo son announced loudly that it was broken! That about sums it up. Still, it is FUN. Hopefully Intex will be upstanding when I call have the New Year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandkids Give It A Two Thumbs Down","review":"I have two Grandaughters ages 4 and almost 2, who love to jump and play. I thought sure this would be a great present for them. They could use it inside the house to jump and have fun. They would only jump for a minute or two and then they wanted out of the thing. It takes up too much room to keep it out when they don't want to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We purchased this for our daughter who has sensory intergration. Her therapy teacher mention this would be nice for her to have at home. Purchased one from Amazon and only filled it up with air once. The Jump-o-lene does not keep air in it at all. We have to blow it up each time she wants to use it. Very disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun toy, will not last","review":"This was a great toy for my son but only lasted a few months - the seams split on the top rings in order and finally on the base. Not patchable with normal patches since the tears are on the seams. I got a different model also made by Intex and this one lasted even less. Great fun if you don't mind spending the money for a month or two's worth of playtime, but I would not recommend it for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Sucks","review":"We had one of these years ago when my twin daughters were 2 and they are now 15. This one we just ordered for my 2 year old son keeps getting pinholes in the seams that seem to be ripping or not sealed correctly. We need to keep patching with a pool repair kit. We are trying to get the company to refund us or give us a new one. My son loves it but it has at least 10-12 holes that are patched and barely holding up. It is great fun to have and hoping this problem get resolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already Deflating!","review":"This is our second blow up item from Intex, and this one popped in even LESS time! We have only had the Jump-o-lene for one month and already the top tier is completely deflated, no matter how often we blow it up (with an electric pump, thank goodness) it deflates almost immediately. This reduces the height of the sides, thereby giving my son less of a \\"barrier\\" to prevent him from tumbling out, which thankfully hasn't happened. He does have fun in it, but needless to say I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Toy, a Really Value for the Money","review":"I was very pleased with the construction and durability of this toy. I purchased it for my godson's first birthday knowing that my 4 year old god daughter would be in there right beside him. They have plenty of room to play/bounce around without bouncing into each other. Note: it does take between 8-10 bags of 100 balls to fill the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - bad quality","review":"We got this as a gift for my two boys, 1.5yrs and 2.5yrs. They absolutely love it and so do all their friends. This is a great toy for any child, BUT, as many others have complained, it will not last. Intex quality is not good. After only a few months of using it, we had holes everywhere. Mainly along the seems. This was used only inside and they were never allowed to put toys in it. So we did take care of it. I phoned the company and asked them to replace it but they were not interested in helping. Great toy but it will not last. So if you dont mind paying the money - then its worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jump-o-lene","review":"This product was a disappointment! My little nephew fell in love with it but the sides will not stay blown up and constantly leak air creating a safety issue. A young child such as him (2 years old) continually falls out the sides as they are inadequate to hold even a small child inside the jumping area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fun but a piece of junk","review":"My twin four-year-olds love this thing when it's working. Usually it's not.Usually one of its chambers has sprung a leak. At this writing, three of the five chambers don't hold air. The only reason I'm able to MAYBE fix it this time around is that the family's out of town and I have all day to find and try to repair the leaks.None of these leaks are punctures. All of them are the result of seams coming apart. The seams on the jumping surface itself have also failed; you can't see it in the photo on the Amazon page, but there are parallel inflated ribs where the kids jump. One of the seams between two ribs has failed, creating one big mega-rib. Another such seam has also started to fail.This isn't a one-star review because when it's working, it's great. But I'd recommend you look for something else. It was a terrific thing to have around for the first few days, but has been unusable most of the time since then."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother. it busted the first day.","review":"I purchased the jumpolene for a preschool. The first time we inflated it, the seams busted. I tried to repair the leaks. By the end of the week, the entire thing had been destroyed. Not worth the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted......29 days!!!","review":"Got this jump o lene to replace another castle jump o lene from last Christmas that lasted 5 months. We found the 2 holes in the castle and kept patching it for 4 months before finally giving up. Bought another one, just not the castle one because my kids still love to play with the 400 balls we have in it. Bought in early November and 29 days later it was leaking in the bottom compartment. I have to blow it up 2-3 times a day now. Amazon rep would only give partial refund and we have to pay return shipping. Pretty sad when a product that's meant for jumping and was never used for jumping springs a leak that's impossible to find. And pretty sad that Amazon won't take it back for full refund. Some customer service. Target or Walmart would have taken it back for a full refund........NO QUESTIONS ASKED!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We are sad....","review":"Wonderful concept, but in two weeks it got a hole. I had to pump it up every day. Now, at 8 months, it has several holes (which are taped up) and a broken inflator nozzle. The chambers won't even hold air long enough for the kids to jump in it. I guess I'll look at buying a bouncer with a blower, and maybe that will stay inflated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fun, before it deflated.","review":"We got this for our 5 year old daughter and 20 month old twin boys. The base and the bottom ring are very thick and seem like they'd hold up over time. The upper rings, however, are not as durable.The kids all loved it -- jumping, sitting, running and otherwise burning off energy in it. We only kept it inside, and the top ring deflated after about a week. Try as we did, we could NOT find the leak and ended up sending it back.After the aggravation of having this and other blow up toys that have deflated on us, we opted not to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as durable as I had hoped","review":"a birthday present for my two-year old - he got two weeks out of it before puncturing the top inflatable ring. it's still usable, just not so attractive with the limp edge. probably would have kept shopping had I thought the window of use in intact condition would be so short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I filled this up in the order it says to fill the chambers. It still is not bouncy. My two year old son goes in it but not to bounce. We put colorful balls in there which will entertain him for about 5 minutes. Maybe I'm not putting enough air in the jump o lene but it feels like if I add anymore it will burst. It says in the bottom chamber to fill only 2/3's of the way. I have no idea when it is only 2/3's full. I am dissappointed with this purchase and would not recommend purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the safest toy","review":"I bought this for my 18 month old grandson and it's a lot of fun if you can have two adults \\"spotting\\", but if not, I think it's a very dangerous toy. He's now 24 months and I no longer allow him to play in it as a trampoline because of the fear of neck/head injury. The walls are not very sturdy and he tumbled out of it more than he landed in it. We also had problems with it staying inflated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe; walls too low","review":"My 2-year-old flipped out of this right away. We took it down after 1 hour. Our 1-year-old almost flipped out too and probably would have, if I kept it up. The walls are simply too low for this to be safe. Flipping out of it, my son snapped his neck. He was fine, but I was worried about what could have happened. Also, the two children crashed into one another all the time, hurting one another. Mainly due to wall height, this is an unsafe product. Sure, it was plenty fun for them. It's too bad it did not work out.Another thing to note is that there is a strong vinyl smell (which is supposed to be toxic, right)? In addition, the product is very large and didn't really fit anywhere without taking up a whole room. It takes a long time to inflate with an electric pump, so once it's up, it's up. Do not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids enjoy it, what more can you ask?","review":"Yes - I have had this up for 2 whole days and the top rings already have holes in them...somewhere. But you know what? My 3 y.o. daughter doesn't care. She uses it for playing in with her dolls, for reading books, for running around...I just pump it back up each time she wants to play (a total of maybe a minute for all 3 rings). Not sure how it got holes in it, but we do have a cat so who knows if she decided to climb in it...that is certainly not the products fault. If you want to buy balls for it, we bought 200 (at the store so they wouldn't come crushed already) and it doesn't even completely cover the bottom, so buy more! It is what you pay for, though make sure you are aware of the shipping charges...it pretty much doubles the cost you pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really fun for 5 minutes until it breaks","review":"This jumpolene was a lot of fun for the kids, but didn't last at all. We've had it for 2 months and the middle jumping pillow split open, the outside base ring split open, and two of the three top rings deflated. It's now completely useless. This is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, while it lasts","review":"I love this toy. It is the perfect answer to energetic kids stuck inside. However, it just doesn't stand up to frequent use. I have pretty strict rules about it, having bought one for Christmas two years ago which was popped by the next day. So, no toys besides the balls you can buy for it are allowed inside. No diving in and out. Still, I keep having to repair holes in it along the seams. When the hole is on the floor, it isn't too hard to repair. Once a side seam rips, there isn't much you can do. We just keep pumping it back up, but it will sit for days deflated. I will be looking for a more durable indoor trampoline this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"lot's of fun, not durable","review":"I bought this toy for my 2 boys, 4 and 2, and they loved it. I even bought balls to make a ball pit. The toy is huge which I know everyone said, but you can't really get an idea of it's size until you see it. One bag of balls was definitely not close to being enough, however, before I could even buy more, it got a hole in the middle of the bottom. That was only about two days after putting it up. After that every couple of days a ring would get a hole in it. By the end of about two weeks only one ring was still inflated. I thought about going to get a pool patch kit, but I realized that if I patched one hole another would come somewhere else.Bottom line, if you have the time and patience to look for and patch holes or if you go into it not expecting to have it for long go for it. The kids love it. Maybe your kids won't be as hard on it. My girls had one when they were little and it was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes an AWESOME ball pit","review":"I bought this Jump-o-Lene as a replacement for my niece. My niece has sensory issues so my sister has filled one of these with over 200 balls and it is WONDERFUL for my niece. But you do need to be nice to it. NO shoes and don't be too rough or you can pop the upper rings. Thankfully it still worked as a ball pit until the 3rd and final upper ring popped (which took over a year of CONSTANT use). But really, for the price, this thing rocks and considering it gets used ALL THE TIME I think its pretty dang sturdy! My son and my other niece love it too! GREAT toy! The kids can dive in there head first and you don't have to worry about them hitting their heads on the bottom of the ball pit b/c it has these wonderful bouncy sides and bottom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed product","review":"This was a gift for my kids, and after 2 uses outdoors, it rained, and the jumpolene took on water, filling it in between the air chambers, undrainable. We did as much as we could to try and figure out how to get the water out, but it was unusable after this. I called the manufacturer, and they told me that the trampoline did not come with any warranty and that they could do nothing to help me with the situation. My husband tried to make a slit in between the air chambers, to let the water out, and once we were able to drain the water, the jumpolene would no longer hold air. It's cute in theory, and maybe good for gentle indoor use, but DO NOT LET WATER GET INSIDE OF IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of fun, but not great quality","review":"My four year old son, who never stops moving, recieved this as a birthday gift. Two days after receiving it, the second chamber deflated, and we were unable to find a hole at all. He continued to use it despite the ring being deflated. A second hole appeared in the large base, but it was easily patched with the repair kit. After about a month of using it with a deflated chamber, I returned it to the manufacturer for a replacement. The company was great to deal with, and we recieved our replacement, at no cost to us, within a few weeks. We are going to set it up indoors this time and see if that helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as much fun as it looks...","review":"This product seems like it's hit or miss. Miss if you receive a defective product like I did. The top chamber would not inflate for us on Christmas Eve. Our children were not able to \\"bounce\\" or \\"jump\\". Dissapointing to say the least for what we thought would be the most exciting gift of the day.We had quite a bit of trouble getting a refund as we ordered this the day after Thanksgiving to ensure a Pre Christmas delivery, only to find out the manufacturer of this product will only warranty this item for 15 days from the recvd. ship date. 15 days...sounds like this Jump 0 lene has a short expiration date. Take a hint, not built to be used for intended purpose. I can quote Willy Goat,the company that shipped this product, \\"We get calls all the time for this item breaking, but if it's past the 15 day warranty you have no right to a refund or replacement...even if you never used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seam split within a few months under non-excessive indoor use","review":"My sister bought this for my 3 and 4 year old boys for Christmas. I figured it'd get a hole in it eventually that I'd have to patch but unfortunately the seam of the top two rings split and we need to pitch this because it can't be repaired. I attemped to email Intex in case they might stand by their product, but the \\"finish/send\\" email button doesn't work on their site! What a dissapointment! The kids did have some fun with it while it was in tact but it's too cheap quality of a toy -- my advice don't purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but poorly made","review":"After reading all the reviews we decided to take a chance and buy one. Seems we got one of the lemons. Son (age 4) loved it and was super careful not to take any toys in with him (not even a ping pong ball) after being told it could pop. Didn't matter. Seams began to split one after another within two weeks even though only one 40 lb. child was in it. All rules followed. We are down to one air side wall that will still hold air now. Destined for the trash! DISAPPOINTING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"jumpolene","review":"My grandchildren are enjoying this \\"bouncy box\\", laughing spontaneously and getting exercise. ages 2-6yrs.

Be aware of what metals are in or around your body to eliminate any possible allergic reaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"I finished this book with a smile on my face - Anne Tyler never ceases to entertain. What I love about her books is the fluid drawing out of interesting people, her characters are fleshed out into genuine characters - it's like walking into a scene peopled with friends and family of your own.I did have one beef (or two) with the novel. I was hoping that Anne would focus more on the relationship between Opal and Barnaby, for there seemed to be no satisfactory closure there, or no real hint of what was to come of their relation to one another. Opal was a fascinating character! As was Barnaby, of course - focussing on these two would have been the real clincher in this book. Perhaps a sequel?Also, the ending left me confused . . . was he finally turning to Martine? Was his last line a realization of some sort, a discardment of Sophia? (Good choice: Sophia was a dullard)Read this book! I also recommend \\"Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant.\\" :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be an acquired taste","review":"I have friends who LOVE Anne Tyler, and keep prevailing upon me to try (and re-try) her books. So I have, with this one... But this kind of writing must be an acquired taste. I'm almost halfway into \\"A Patchwork Planet\\" -- and really, nothing has happened yet. Once again, we have this charmingly, almost poignantly purposeless character, incredibly passive, waiting for something to HAPPEN to him. Just as the reader waits for something (anything!) to happen to him. I want him to get up off his leisurely arse, take charge, and DO something! -- but he doesn't seem the type, so I doubt I'll bother finishing the book. This is probably due to a shortcoming on my part: I'm far too impatient to be deliberately set adrift in this casual, aimless sort of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I am always excited when a new Anne Tyler comes out but this is the first one that disappointed me. The story lags and the ending doesn't tie anything up...it just ends. I loved Ladder of Years and Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant and many others. I'm glad this wasn't my first Tyler book, I might not have read the rest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, quick read","review":"This is my fifth Anne Tyler book. While \\"Saint Maybe\\" remains my favorite, this one beats out \\"Celestial Navigation\\" which was my number two favorite. Barnaby is an interesting character because you read the story through his eyes yet you disagree with the way he views himself. He believes himself to be a bad person when he is anything but. He has made mistakes but is now doing the best he can to overcome them and be a positive influence on others lives. It is a frustrating book to read at times because we (the audience), Sophia, Mrs. Dibble, and all the clients of Rent-A-Back see Barnaby as a decent human but he refuses to see this side of himself until the end. When I finished this novel, I was happy to see that Barnaby had started to realize what a good person he really is. The only disappointment is the end. Do Sophia and Barnaby stay together? While it is a trite concern in the overall theme of the book, it is still an important issue...at least to me! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real lives of real people","review":"Barnaby is just a guy. We see his life as if it were a piece of reality cut from the fabric of the lives we lead. The story of one person and his attempts to cope with the world as it is with the tools he was given by the fates. For readers of good fiction who know superb character development when they see it, Anne Tyler is always a pleasure. Here again, a life is lived rather than one more tedious predictably plotted mediocre novel tied up neatly for those who would rather not think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - but start with something else","review":"If you read (and liked) \\"I know this much is true\\" by Wally Lamb, then do yourself a favor and read anything by Anne Tyler.But don't expect a 900 page story with a 3 page happy ending tacked on. Anne Tyler is much more authentic.That being said, if you're just getting started with Anne Tyler I suggest \\"Ladder of Years\\" or \\"Saint Maybe\\" before \\"Patchwork Planet\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to put down, hard to pick back up","review":"I was really disappointed by this one. I couldn't connect with any of the characters. In fact, I couldn't wait for 'em to go away. I've liked other Anne Tyler books. But here, the quirkiness is missing. All that's left is the pathetic. One reader commented that the author failed in her attempt to project a viable male persona as the voice of the piece. I felt this jarringly apparent. I kept thinking \\"A guy wouldn't notice this, or be concerned about that.\\" But most of all, I was aware that I didn't like any of these people, didn't care what happened to them, and saw no chemistry anywhere. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've read in a long time!","review":"I read this book because of the acclaim and praise Anne Tyler has received from her past books, and was very surprised to find such a shallow, simple-minded story. Tyler did not think this story through. It seems to have been hastily written, perhaps for an impatient publisher. I found the main character anything but \\"lovable,\\" but rather, a true loser with very little redeeming qualities. Why would I want to spend my time reading about such a person?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book!","review":"I loved the protagonist, Barnaby Gaitlin. He's so quirky yet endearing, so human, so real. Tyler's books are the only ones that actually make me laugh out loud (especially the part where Barnaby states he always wanted a military wife, to which Sophia responds, \\"does this mean you plan to enlist?\\"). The stories of his elderly clients I found touching. The only problem I found with this book was that I found the plot to be slightly predictable. (DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS): You just know not too far into the book that he is going to start dating Sophia, but that the relationship is just his subconscious effort to \\"better\\" himself morally, and that Martine is really the girl for him in the end. But aside from that, I thought it was excellent, a truly enjoyable, funny, engrossing and thought provoking story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Anne Tyler","review":"Barnaby Gaitlin is the misfit in his family. Money is not important to him, fancy job titles, high society life styles..none of these interests him. Barnaby prefers to work for minimal wage helping folks that really are in need, living on the edge of poverty, never taking full responsiblity for others in his life.Everyone in the Gaitlin family has had an Angel, except Barnaby of course. When Sophia happens into his life, Barnaby is convinced she is that angel and sets out to change his life.Patchwork is written with humour and sensitivity. I look forward to reading many more of Anne Tyler's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, just beautiful.","review":"I have read almost all of Anne Tyler's books but this, by far, is the best.Beautifully written, engaging characters, and what an incredible main character in Barnaby Gaitlin.I was open-mouthed the whole way through thinking about how Tyler's mind works and where these beautiful words came from.I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat. I defy you not to love Barnaby, want to slap Sophia silly, and even feel sorry for his mother who, because of her own deep insecurities about being born into a 'low-station' in life, treats her son lesser than she should.I loved that the opening line was a question, and the final line was Barnaby's realization that, yes indeed, what others thought about him WAS true.Beautiful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely pointless","review":"The book is well written, and some of it is amusing, but in the end, well, what was the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyler Displays Consistent Excellence","review":"Here is a beautiful story that gets better and better as it unfolds. The main character DOES end up having redeeming qualities; our faith in him is justified. Anne Tyler is one of the best writers of our generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ordinary become extraordinary","review":"Once again, Anne Tyler has taken us into the hearts and homes of the most ordinary people and makes them extraordinary and heroic in their simple daily existence. Through her characters, she walks us through the lives of people we see on the streets and in grocery stores every day. Ms. Tyler takes us on a quiet, respectful tour of their angst, their loneliness and their private, quiet heartaches. In the end, each character is given their own state of grace,though it may be shakey and unpredictable, each of her remarkably flawed humans are left to us as angels on earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"As a Baltimore \\"neighbor\\" of Tylers, I feel compelled to read her books. I keep hoping that the familiarity of Roland Park and other locales will endear me more to her and her characters. It doesn't. I find many of her books to be repetitive and boring. Her story lines are shallow and I am led to believe that those who adore her are not in search of compelling stories but safe tales of average people who just get by. I'll keep trying, but not buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple yet satisfying","review":"Normal -- yes, normal for Tyler. Usually her novels include something bizarre happening. This one does not. She makes a good stab at writing a male protagonist -- almost as good as Carol Shields' \\"Larry's Party.\\" I also like Tyler's simple writing style, which I think she is getting better at. Far fewer writing \\"techniques\\" than, say McCarthy or Shields, but nonetheless engaging. It's a good, simple story told well."},{"rating":"2","title":"veryyy nice!","review":"this is the second book i read by anne tyler, and i'm soooo satisfied. the first was the ladder of years, which was only ok, i mean, i recommend it, but it's only ok.. but this one is much better. barnaby is such a likeable character, and it's very realistic. her writing is very smooth, you can read pages and pages and don't realize. maybe i should have given 4 stars, considering there are limited things to discuss, unlike some other books, but i couldn't help myself:) it's a great holiday read. highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and personal.","review":"I love Anne Tyler. Her characteristics are realistic in their quirkiness and we get to peak in on them. Poor Barnaby. No one is satisfied with him except himself! The ending scene where he is at the dining room table and looks down and sees the dog's \\"accident\\" is just too funny and a fitting metaphor for the book and maybe life in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Memorable Characters","review":"I have been an Anne Tyler fan since a friend introduced me to \\"Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant\\" years ago. I savor every minute I am reading one of her books. This novel came to my attention when it was advertised in a popular book club flier. I didn't even know she had published a new book (too busy to pay attention these days). Barnaby was not as \\"real\\" to me as were some other of her characters, but the descriptions of the elderly clients of Rent-A-Back were right on target. As usual, Tyler makes you feel grateful for the calm and sanity of your own life. In my case, a life free of food-related disasters like the Thanksgiving dinner of only sweet foods. It's a lovely day-long read at the lake or beach house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Tyler understands men and the elderly.","review":"I liked this book, over all. It is hard to find great fiction. I thought there were just a couple things wrong with the book. 1. It took me most of the book to realize Sophie was not an elderly lady Barnaby was watching on the train. I thought she was old and she ended up being 36. 2. Barnaby thought more eloquently than he spoke. I don't know if that was intentional or not. Maybe all men have the potentional to be detailed thinkers and don't know how to express themselves. I might be married to one. I thought it was very interesting how important an old car in the family can start friction. That is so true in today's society and families. As far as the ending goes, there was so much potential for disaster, and the reader is right there amoungst all the action, and it suddenly ends with a \\"ahhhh\\", but you have no clue as to which woman he will choose in the long run. Interesting characters, wonderful insight into the lives of the elderly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story and characters","review":"This is one of Tyler's best in my opinion. It was more realistic than some of her other stories. The characters were strong and interesting. Barnaby was an excellent lead. His foibles made him someone I could really relate to. I hope her future novels are more like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpleasantly real","review":"Except for the part about angels, A Patchwork Planet is a realistic story about regular people struggling their way through life -- job, partner, family. They manage to take opportunities of riches and love and turn them into tedious choices that turn out, for the most part, poorly. All the scenes, on the backdrop of the workers and customers of Rent-a-Back service -- do-all handymen (and women) -- are recognizable to the smallest details. The nicknames for grandparents, the high-school acquaintances \\"adopted\\" by parents as if they had been our best friends, lonely singles, nervous co-worker dates. It's just so unpleasantly real."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was good company.","review":"I love the way Ms. Tyler writes. I enjoyed coming home to this book at the end of the day and having the characters be the last thing I thought about before I went to sleep. Books can dazzle you with great technical feats of word play and original ideas deftly laid out like literary banquets but in the end they MUST be good company and this book succeeded handily."},{"rating":"2","title":"healing is a worthwhile but painful experience","review":"I have about 60 pages left of the book, but I can truly say that it is a refreshing change of pace from what I see on the typical best seller list (mostly crime/mystery). I enjoy my mysteries, but a look inside the heart of a fellow black sheep does me good/well. The characters are vivid and lovable. I feel better for having spent my time with these folks--much as in the Accidental Tourist group. Barnaby works through his past without even realizing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet read","review":"This is my favorite Anne Tyler book. At least it made me smile a lot more than the others. You can't help but like Barnaby and all of the other characters. There are some touching vignettes which show us that we need to take a second look at people who we might normally even want to take a first look at. Of course, that all sounds just wonderful. If one looks closely at Barnaby one sees someone with some very deep psychological problems that are never really addressed. But - who wants to deal with reality?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"I really enjoyed Breathing Lessons and The Accidental Tourist so I thought by reading some of the posted reviews that I would enjoy this one as well.I found this book pointless. I kept waiting for it to go somewhere, make someone endearing, but instead it fell flat and left a rather unpleasant feeling of wasting my time.What really gets me is at the end of this book Barnaby states in a letter to Sophia that he was a man you can trust. A man she could trust? He lied to her every time he looked into her eyes after sleeping with Martine and never telling her about it. He treated every woman that was closed to him (his daughter, mother, Martine, Sophia, and Wicky if you think about it with that crude grapefruit remark) with a blatant disregard that was very disconcerting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn yawn yawn, not well written","review":"This book is poorly written. It's too boring to even put me to sleep. The main character is not likable, not someone I\\"d want to know, not someone I care about. I just started reading this and am trying with all my might to keep reading, but it drags on. The main character is missing something, I want to feel like I like him, but I can't! he is a rebel but not well crafted enough so far to be heroic in an every day way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Whole Lot of Nothing","review":"This is my first Anne Tyler book. I have to say that by the time I finished it I was so mad I had spent the time to read it. She developed the characters well and there were several funny, cynical parts, but nothing HAPPENS. I like for the character to accomplish something, or to resolve a problem, or to learn something. The story is more like \\"a year in the life\\" of Barnaby, and then just ends. I turned the last couple pages thinking \\"Where is the rest of it?\\" The only parts I liked were about the elderly who hired Rent-A-Back even though that was a little depressing.

Barnaby Gaitlin's language is just not believable. The character of Sophia--please, what a cliche. Though she's a banker (why is she so broke?) her character is a stereotypical \\"librarian\\" or \\"schoolmarm.\\" Though the story is set in two very colorful cities, Philadelphia and Baltimore, there is little atmosphere described.

Then comes along a book like A Patchwork Planet, reviving my delight in reading. Original characters, situations, problems - yet so relatable. Barnaby touched me with his impetuous kindnesses, his slides into self-pity, and his reluctant wish to believe that his life is worth having an angel enter it.And, oh, the other characters! I wanted to slap his mother and yell at Sophia. My lord, how could they do him like that?

This book, and the knowledge it has helped me to attain, has left me interested in learning more about XHTML, CSS, and possibly some programming.This book is definitely for beginners, I don't know how useful it would be for someone with a knowledge of XHTML, and I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't be useful to someone who already knows some CSS, since it really just touches on style sheets.

When you finally find out what this great tragedy was and look at the situation, it falls flatter that a wet bowl of oatmeal for justification of why the character feels so guilty or responsible.Close to the last part of the book after serial lock stepped sacrifices of the main and supporting characters, only four characters remain. Also the characters love interest that has been built up throughout the book is eliminated in less than three descriptive sentences and the main character barely even registers a care in the world.Stay with Paul Kidd and R A Salvatore if you want books of quality high adventure story telling.Keith Francis Strohm should try to keep his day job with pushing pokemon cards and not use his influence at Wizards just to simply get his book published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story... but needs more to fill me up.","review":"I'd actually give it about 4 1/2 stars, but that's not an option.

Surrealism abounds in this film, from the fish flopping about in the bone dry bird bath on Byron's lawn, to each character's own unique hallucinations while reading the ghost story.That is really what Gothic is about, it is a great, albeit intellectual, ghost story. It may not be easy for the average Joe to follow, and that's okay, but many artisitic types may find that they might enjoy a haunted weekend at Lord Byron's little Den of Iniquities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange, Hallucinogenic & Interesting","review":"The movie \\"Gothic\\" is not nearly as awful as some reviewers here have represented. Russel more or less puts the viewer in the minds of the characters as they experience drug induced hallucinations and whip themselves into a climactic frenzy. If you can accept this frame of reference, you can enjoy the disjointedness and wierdness of this film. Both Byrne and Sands are excellent as the two poets, although Richardson is fairly wooden in her role. There is some poor editing, particularly towards the end, and some unexplained shots that require knowledge about the actual characters (especially Lord Byron). However, the film does a good job of conveying the goings-on of a crazy night at Byron's swiss chalet. In short, Gothic is a fairly wild (and short) ride that has to be approached with an open mind in order to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way off the wall and WOW!","review":"God, this movie is weird. (But I love it) Every time I watch it I understand something new about the symbolism that is everywhere in it. If you're looking for a reasonable attempt at unravelling unknown segments of history, look somewhere else.

The script is negligible at best. No clear delineation is made whether this is a dreamscape or reality.

It attempts to recreate the night in which Mary Shelly got the idea for her novel \\"Frankenstein.\\" The entire movie plays like a dream or hallucination sequence, with unintentionally funny dialogue and marginal acting by a cast that would be impressive in any other movie.

The elf has nothing to do with the film whatsoever and only appears for like three seconds. All in all, Gothic is straight F turkey.

Though I'm genuinely interested in the film's subject matter, I had to constantly suppress the urge to fast-forward. To borrow the line once used about Poulenc, Ken Russell had absolutely nothing to say about this subject...and he said it.

Shortly after beginning to use the router, I noticed some hangup/lockup situations would occur. I wasn't sure if I was having issues with my ISP or the router or what. After a time braving the lockup issues, I searched the internet for lockup problems with the D Link router and found many people were having the same problem. I decided to replace the D Link router with a Linksys E1200 and the lockup problems vanished! I would not recommend the D Link router and, if it was not so much of a hassle, I would seek to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Filter by IP","review":"I wish I would have had read the reviews better, but you can't filter by IP address.

The web-based UI was pretty clean and easy to understand. I had mine configured and running in minutes. But an old telephone switchboard operator moving cables around could outperform this brick. Web sites wouldn't load. The network would flap. And the router had to be constantly reset. Changing settings (like auto port speed detection and QoS) made no difference. Upon further investigation, it seems it's a design issue and not one of quality control. It's just not a capable piece of hardware.

Recently I became suspicious that the modem might be responsible, and found a number of reviews from people who had traced similar issues to the router. I took my router out of the way, used an Apple Airport instead, and the unreliable connectivity went away immediately.Some people in this product page seem to have had no issues, but look around here, and in search engines, and you will see a sizable number of people with flaky connections because of the router.

After an hour on the phone and no solution D-Link insisted that the driver on the mac computers must need to be updated.

Even a novice can follow the simple instructions. The router comes with a cable (not needed since I already have one installed, a power supply and the instruction disk with everything you need to know on the disk. Extra network software (Network Magic) is included. It, too, installed easily, however, it should be noted that this version is not compatible with Windows 7. Not a problem for my XP machine.In less than 20 minutes my network was functioning.

We ordered a Cisco Linksys replacement and installed it.

I never did get around to uninstalling the new router so I could reinstall the non-functioning D-Link and call the D-Link tech support to get the required Case ID number. I'm not a computer novice so I'm sure the problem was with the D-Link router malfunctioning, particularly since nothing in the environment had changed and the new Linksys router resolved the problem. Plus, I would have had to pay for shipping the D-Link back to the manufacturer. Just wasn't worth the time, cost and hassle. The D-Link EBR 2310 was a disappointment.

The DVD quality was extremely poor, with garbled sound and a less than crisp picture. It had the look and feel of a DVD that someone illegally copied and tried to sell on the street. Shame on Amazon for even advertising this DVD on its website and shame on Globe Trekker for putting out such a poor product. The host was fine and the stories were interesting, but the entire experience was ruined by the low quality of the DVD itself. Also, this is not one of Globe Trekker's more recent episodes.

I was born and raised in Southern California; this book speaks to my best and worst inclinations. The author puts you 'there', in body and spirit. The ambiguity of the Southern California experience remains intact throughout the read, the struggles that make us human continue to haunt me, refreshed in my consciousness. I'm grateful whenever a book comes along that causes me to chew on those ambiguities for a good long while. Tortilla Curtain does that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful - Page Turner","review":"Delaney Mossbacher is a wealthy yuppie-liberal who lives in the suburbs of Los Angeles. One day on his way to the recycling center, he hits a pedestrian with his car. The man hit is Candido Rincon, a poor, illegal immigrant from Mexico. Feeling guilty, Delaney gives Candido twenty dollars to compensate for his injuries, and the two men go their separate ways. Yet with the accident, Delaney and Candido's lives become woven together for the rest of the book.This story is so relevant to anyone who lives near the Mexican/US border. It is written from two different points of view; an illegal immigrant and his pregnant wife, who are struggling to better their life, and that of and a wealthy couple living in a gated community.This book hooked me from the very first page, and I NEVER lost interest for a minute. EXCELLENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all impressed","review":"I recently read this book for a book club. I found it trite and terribly predictable - and, ready made for a TV movie or series. So, a couple from Mexico cross the border illegally, she becomes pregnant, he is beaten up, they live in the canyons, they get robbed, she gets raped, they get robbed again, she has a baby, the baby is blind, they set fire to the canyon, they find a safe haven, then the mud slides hit....what was left out?Why do people read this and think it is good?

Total rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"the downtrodden vs the unhappy whining haves","review":"Everything negative that could befall an illegal mexican immigrant happens to this couple. It's one after another knock down. After a few of these, I wondered why I was reading this depressing mess. The woman gets raped and gives birth to a blind child. The man saves up money for an apartment only to have it lost to him time after time. The rich white folks are the worst kind of self absorbed, whining americans. People I don't want to spend time with- including the hours reading a book about them. I can read about these issues in factual stories. I don't need to pollute my fiction reading time with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotype upon stereotype","review":"We are reading this book for our book group. I'm not sure if it made me uncomfortable because the perspective was so accurate or if it was because it never went beyond the stereotypes that I already have.I didn't like one character in the book. Even the dogs and the kid were annoying. While that may have been the result of good writing, the end product was that I was left feeling nothing but \\"ick.\\" The characters seemed one dimensional even though a large amount of time was spent detailing their thoughts and opinions. I never understood the \\"why's\\" behind any of their actions, just their histories. Perhaps I was too slow to draw the conclusion.I felt like a big, over consumerized, ungrateful loser.If that's your thing, you may love the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a pretty read at all","review":"The Tortilla Curtain was unpleasant, not at all a fun read, but well worth the effort anyway. By the first quarter of the book I seriously considered not finishing it: I read for fun, and this wasn't fun. I found myself loathing the smug self-satisfied, self-congratulatory, insular upper-class white Americans who soothe their liberal consciences by recycling, and telling themselves that in so doing they have made their contribution to humanity. They were so alien to me, so cold-blooded and translucent that I did not and still do not give a damn what happened to them.The Mexican couple were however so painfully written that I identified with every agony they endured. I persevered with the book because I cared about them. They are the ones that made me glad I finished it. I can't say I put it down with a satisfied sigh, but I can say that it was brilliantly paced and executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"monica 's review of tortilla curtain","review":"the book tortilla curtain by t. c. boyle. is an exageration of two cultures, Mexicans and Americans.

Everything was taken to the extreme. this book lacked a lot of real life point of view. Also a lot of racism that doesn't exsist as much now in real life. my parents are immigrants, and they came searching for the american dream as well, however their experiance was nothing like Candido's and America's. im not saying that every immigrant's life is like my parents, but it is certenly not the way that it was described in the book. if you want to read a joke, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tortilla Curtain","review":"The Tortilla Curtain is quite a good book written with a lot of irony, which i like.The reader gets an impression of the American dream and everyday llife in the USA.

Don't waste your time or money. If you want a biased, slanted, bleeding heart view of illegal alien squatters who are invading our country, just pick up the LA Times editorial section. I've heard this author is not willing to debate this book with those who are fighting to save our country against this invasion. Is he afraid of being exposed? It seems T.C.

It's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my, how awful....","review":"What an awful cast of shallow, unsympathetic and stereotyped characters (and caricatures). It's lucky that they're such awful people, however, because if you cared about them, you'd be overcome by the torrent of serial misfortune that befalls them (spoiler alert): Let see: Three brutal rapes, including the brutal rape/murder of a teenage girl, man hit by car, two beloved dogs eaten by coyotes, multiple cats eaten by humans, forest fire, floods, brutal mugging, child molestation, baby born blind (due to STD transmitted in previous brutal rape...), baby dies...I'm sure I've missed something...and this is all in the course of a few months....All culminating in an ending that leaves you shaking your head....Perhaps the author ran out of calamities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"Summarizing this book is nearly impossible, but reading it was extraordinarily enjoyable. The conflicting, but opposing stories of illegal immigrants, Candido and his wife America to those of white, suburban Delaney and his wife Kyra grabbed my attention from the start. Boyle deftly contrasts not just the Mexicans and Americans, but man vs. nature, upper and lower class, gates and open doors. The storyline is so tense and tightly drawn that I wanted to read on to know what would happen next, but at the same time I feared what further problems would unravel for the characters. Even a week after finishing the book, I am still thinking of scenes that shocked me, the emotions that gripped me, and questions that still stump me. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacked depth, has been done before better","review":"I consider myself a T.C. Boyle fan, and T.C. Boyle to be one of our best living writers. But this book struck me as so heavy-handed and even poorly written that I could not get through it. John Nichols covered much the same territory in \\"The Milagro Beanfield War\\" and the rest of the \\"Magic Journey\\" trilogy, but with more compassion for his characters, more depth and more control of his craft.Is this really the same author who wrote \\"World's End\\" and \\"Water Music\\"?

I can hardly believe it could be \\"abridged\\"; Boyle said everything he had to say at least three times anyway. And then, it just stopped. Very poor ending.Started out interesting, but just went on and on and on with nothing happening with the exception of the occasional natural disaster. We got the point real early. Illegal immigrants are good, just want work and are treated like dirt. Yuppies are self-serving, materialistic, greedy, etc. And furthermore, their efforts to \\"protect\\" themselves are pointless anyway. Look what happened to the wall and the gate...It got really boring..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer the phonebook","review":"When I read this book I thought about the different meanings it might contain. First of all , this is a powerful story about racism, in which the reader gets to know about both sides of the story, both points of view and yes, it might help us to learn more about everyday-aspects of prejudices. But considering the fact that Boyle's characters are as superficial as a TV-Spot for roastbeef with almost no connection to reality and that this story apparently takes place in a different universe, where nearly everything (like sudden bushfires or flood catastrophes) is possible, I decided to leave the curtain closed and rather have a few tortillas."},{"rating":"1","title":"just depressing...","review":"There are certain books that are depressing in a powerful way, in a way that's thought-provoking and interesting. I found this to be just a collection of every depressing thing that could happen to both illegal immigrants and middle-class residents of Southern California as a result of illegal immigration. I felt no sympathy for either couple after reading this book, and it seemed like the author was trying to hard to make it sound well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self indulgent trash","review":"The book was so poorly done, with so very many flaws it will agravate any reader. I thought Steinbeck could be depressing, this guy had Steinbeck beat, with needless human suffering heaped upon tired metaphors and yet another helping of human suffering. And then, in a blinding flash of inspiration, the author just ends the book when each of the antagonists could make the story meaningfull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Social Liberalism Unchecked","review":"This book is a sincere effort at trying to make all of the sane, law abiding people who live in the United States of America feel like we have done something wrong just by the fact that we were born in this country and continue to breath. It's a blatant promotion of illegal activity in the form of illegal migration into the USA. It's most offensive to the people who have legally immigrated into the United States, meaning most of us but especially the Latino (Mexican) people. It's irritating that it's being crammed down the throats of students in Southern California to try and convince them that the laws and traditions of our nation are foolish and worthy of disregard.This book is a must for the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhh","review":"Predictable storyline and nothing new. I read it for a college English class and I just it was boring.

It paints the issue in different lights and tells the story from the views of various characters involved. It really does show you that there are more than 2 sides to every story. Most importantly I believe it teaches or at least reminds us to be empathetic to others who may not be as fortunate as we are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless and lost","review":"One criterion that I have for what is a good read is whether I like or empathize with any of the characters. This story falls down in that area. Each character is almost unrelentingly selfish, desperate, unhappy and without hope or prospect of future happiness--with the possible exception of America--and it is somewhat unrealistic that she stayed with Candido after even the first of their series of misfortunes.The story gets lost and does not quite know how to end--without revealing the ending, I might say that it is unbelievable, unsatisfactory (and feels unfinished).Despite good descriptive passages, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter crap!!","review":"I had to read this book for a class dealing with other cultures and I hated reading every single page. I don't see how this book relates in any realistic way to the class I took. Every stereotype you can think of was played out to the extreme and it made the story unbelieveable. The writing is just horrible. The author takes entirely too long to get to the point. You could take out all the unneccessary crap and it might make a decent short story. Don't waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This story while somewhat interesting was a bit contrived. I would not really recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used Book","review":"I ordered the used book, \\"The Tortilla Curtain\\", from Amazon.com. It came in excellent condition, and the price was unbeatable! 1 cent + $3.99 for shipping!!! I would do this again in a heartbeat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought provokingly depressing","review":"I hated reading this book. The suffering that America and Candido endured and the lengths they went to in order to survive were just too much. There are truths in every part of it but the fact that everything bad that could could possibly go wrong did, after awhile served to almost desensitize me to their plight. And, of course,the yuppie couple with their materialistic problems were so despicably insensitive they were just as hard to take. I am sure the author went to such extremes to make an important point. There has been some change in the treatment of immigrants by the state of CA since this book was written and it would be nice to think that this book was a catalyst for change. If you feel you need a reminder on what constitutes moral behavior and what does not, then read this book. That to me is the only reason to read it...it is just too painful from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't enjoy reading the book","review":"It is a sad commentary on our current situation with the illegals and homeless. It was our Book Club selection, or I would not have chosen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not care for this at all","review":"I had a tug of war with this book. At times I liked it and then really disliked it in the next few pages. the characters were way over the top stereotypical and unbelievable. I live/work in California and am in the thick of this issue. I won't spoil it but the ending was awful. I'm glad it was a library book and I didn't pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Author I've Come Accross","review":"This was part of my literature class' work so I was forced to read it even after being disillusioned after the first paragraph. Boyle is a decent writer; his way of presenting imagery isn't bad at all - it is above average. It is what he has to say about characters that is just so cheap. He is too vulgar in a story that is a touchy subject. He over-describes much of everything, with too much symbolism, too much meaningless background history on the characters, and so on, that really, if all this superfluousness of writing was left out, the book would be half the length and would definitely get the point across in a much smoother, intelligent, meaningful way."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"I consider myself a fairly well-read individual and as a 1st generation Mexican American, I thought this would be an interesting book to read read. Early on, it became abundantly clear what this book was about.It was garbage. The moral of the story is that if you want a better life, your S- outta luck. Settle for what you have and don't ask for more!\\"Materialism is bad\\". Isn't materialism and the right to complain what this country was built on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Penguin over priced","review":"Penguin sets the price for e-book editions higher than paperback editions. Not buying it. There is ample content at reasonable prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read","review":"Not only was the writing style reminiscent of high school creative writing class (fill it up with adjectives and adverbs, who needs character motivation or development?) but the story was exaggerated, overblown and entirely unrealistic; for this kind of story, I had more fun wathcing \\"Volcano.\\" I thought it was not a responsible narrative of the immigration situation here in Los Angeles. There was no tranformation or evolution of character except from bad to worse,and if I was supposed to like or identify with anybody, or gain insight, it totally failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but lack of plot","review":"This book was good about teaching to ignore racial differences and such, but that was about it. I never really got the plot until I was through 75% of the book.

It's on my ipad, so I can't share it, but I'm going to find the paper book somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book gives a great description of modern life in Southern California. From the perspective of both a middle class family and a family of illegal immigrants.Boyle is very successful in illustrating just how ridiculous and out of touch with reality most of us really are. My only real complaint is the lack of a plot, instead Boyle concentrates on describing and developing his characters (which really isn't such a bad thing). It's much like real life, not much ever really happens. But don't let that stop you from reading this, it is really worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving..","review":"I could not put this book down from the moment I started reading it. I was asked to read this book as part of my book group and had no idea what I was getting in to, but I was captivated from the first page. I was especially taken with America and Candido, the two illegal immigrants who are trying desperately to make a living in the United States and was horrified by their counterparts, the \\"gringo\\" couple, who lives so extravagently on the \\"other side\\" of the tracks and take absolutely everything for granted. This book is insightful on so many levels and I was deeply moved by the hardships the Mexicans endure just to get by each and every day. I could not put this book down and think you, too, will be as taken with it as I was. I recommend it highly and it was the first time I had ever read anything by T.C. Boyle and now want to read other books by him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive repetitive.","review":"The Tortilla Curtain, although describes in uncanny detail the horrifying yet practical racism Mexicans and foreigners experience in the United States of America, is still not very good. It continues to portray the same message over and over in a thousand different ways at least 50 different times.It's dry because there is only so much that can happen to illegal immigrants in the USA. Despite the repetitiveness of the book it still contains a great message that really opens up the eyes of an everyday American like myself. The book shows how brutal people can be to other humans because they talk a different language and have slightly darker skin . This would, could, should be a great novel but it is just spread out 200 pages too long.Unfortunately the message the story extrudes from the writing is not enough to weigh out the fact that it's dry and repetitive, repetitive, repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A closer view on immigration problems","review":"The author displays a very interesting contrast between americans and illegal immigrants. Touching, yet filled with humour, constant tension and amusing caracters, this is a book that you surely won't regret reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opportunistic","review":"The potential to execute a work of high intellegence with this subject matter in this day and age is limitless. However, dispite the fact that these ethnically-oriented 'tragic' realism plot lines are in ample supply, TC fails at offering us with any new direction. His unwillingness to assert ANY position on this theme speaks to his inability to create any new or original perspective on this bordering-on-tiring literary genre. He merely capitalizes on the popularity of such works and gets away with cranking out the same old Same Old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep It Simple, Stupid","review":"Mr. Boyle preserves the classical unities in appearance, but underneath, it's an MTV video, bopping here, bopping there. He gives us flashes of insight into a character, then long reams of cardboard. **** Like GOW, this book strives to portray the tragic immigration situation. But Boyle is cleverer than that. This cleverness works in bits and spurts, so TC is not as preachy as GOW. But it distracts the reader and detracts from the story. When I finished this, I felt a moral emptiness, not in the LA Mr. Boyle describes, but in the story itself. *** This would have been much better as a shorter, leaner book. Even so, it's not awful - the prose is, at times, beautiful - and the characters are interesting. Plus, the hardback version I bought (for $6 at a used book store, so don't feel too sorry for me) has a lovely cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not easy to read","review":"This was a well written book on an important topic in present-day United States. It was hard to read because it was painful to experience the comparisons between the lives of the two families. Sometimes, I just had to put it down. Also as with other books that are superior in a literary sense, there wasn't any good way to skim parts of it so it went slowly. I wish the ending had been a bit different myself. Seemed a bit unlikely."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tortilla Curtain","review":"The Tortilla Curtain was my introduction to T.C. Boyle and I liked his writing so much, I have ordered two more of his books. The story part will keep your attention but the deeper meaning of discrimination and bias will stay with you for a long time and make you more sensitive to the people we encounter who are misunderstood and judged wrongly."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Jack Steinbeck... But damn Boyle is good. One of the best around today.","review":"This book of the Mexican experience of trying to get into the US for a stab at the American Dream is a gut wrenching, miner in the hole, canary dead, run for the light story. His confidence in telling the story is what hooks you here. His characters -- the ones you will look for next time you are in southern California and they whiz by in their Lexus with the air on high going from point A to B passed those who are taking the heat for the rest of us. No, it's not a bleeding heart yarn here, but rather something that leaves the reader to decide what exactly is wrong with this picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read-great descriptions","review":"I enjoyed this book but did not like the ending. Good character development and descriptions of the environment. Good contrast between the two social classes. I thought some of the living conditions of the Mexicans seemed overdone but my California book club members say \\"Not so\\". They could see it happening as described. Interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tortilla Curtain Disappoints","review":"While he is generally an author of high skill and nuance, T.C. Boyle's Tortilla Curtain reads like a introductory creative writing assignment. All the characters, from the saintly immigrant bride to the sophomoric and pathetic \\"environmentalist\\" are penned in such two-dimensional terms that they are caricatures. They are very difficult to connect to on an emotional level. Any subtext about racism, environmentalism, and immigration is lost in a morass of obviousness. Boyle clearly set out to impart a message here. Sadly, his storytelling and characters are so clunky that the only real message received is the danger of reading poor writing - and this one comes through, loud and clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book with great anticipation because it was recommended by a friend. I am not sure what time period the author was writing about, however it wasn't written in 2009. I believe the facts were blown out of proportion on both sides and played into stereotypes that most Latinos are trying to change. While the author I am sure had the noblest of intentions he missed the opportunity to give real insight on the immigration issue, instead it glossed over the real issue and left me angry and frustrated. This is a made for TV drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tortilla Curtain","review":"If the author was going to take on the issue of illegal immigration, then he should have taken it on fully and more robustly. The story is weak and cliche'. The character development of both the Mexicans and Americans is narrow minded and doesn't show the broader spectrum of people in this country or of those that come across the border. I have recommended to my book club not to waste their time on this book. Frankly, for someone unemployed, I'm angry I even spent money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please!","review":"This book is just terrible. We started listening to the audiobook on a trip, and it was so bad we only got through the first disk. For some reason I listened to the rest of it, hoping it would get better, and it only got worse. The author is the reader on the audiobook, and the exaggerated tone of his voice shows his bias of his message: how we should all feel sorry for the poor Mexicans who are just trying to better themselves in this land where all available resources should be free to anyone who wants them. He contrasts their bad luck in achieving everything entitled to them with the wastefulness and unhappiness of an ordinary southern CA family. He makes the point that even the white people's pets have it better than the sorry Mexicans, and the justice is that the Mexicans start eating the pets. This is the stupidest book ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just makes me mad ...","review":"... when Boyle goes to such lengths to create complex characters and then, for deadline's sake or waning interest, turns them (especially Delaney) into stereotypes by the book's abrupt end. And the ending is just Boyle washing his hands of the whole business. Bah!--don't waste your money for this cheat of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves no cliche unturned.","review":"Dumb Mexican squatters and dumb bourgeois white Californians. Nobody understanding their impact on the landscape, etc. etc. etc. A hackneyed story, although line by line readable enough.

There were so many disasters that befell the hapless Mexican couple that it was hard to take after awhile. The premise was an interesting one but was VERY poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring.","review":"Holy cow, what a worthless and boring read. Did Boyle actually do any research on this? It amazes me how certain writers can just sit down, fabricate lies, and then draw a royalty check. And with a writing style that could put the sleeping pill industry out of business."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tortilla Curtain","review":"This book is a WASTE of time and is an attempt to undermine the American culture. I would advise that NO ONE read this book! I wish I had not but I did want to determine its value and I conclude it is a no buy - no read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tragedy For Our Times","review":"The Tortlla Curtain deals with the controversial topic of illegal immigration. After reading 100 pages I had to stop for a month becauseI was afraid to read more of this sad story. I cared for the people in this tale. Neither of the two families were bad people. Once you knew them it was difficult to judge them. This is a great book for a book discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Multi-purpose Pot","review":"This pot is extremely well-made and should easily last a lifetime.

Judaism is its own religion that has its own covenant with God. No Orthodox Jew or Conservative Jew or Reform Jew would ever consider the Christian scriptures as part of the Bible.

Shame on the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Purim Joke","review":"This is one of the funnier things the misleading Messianic movement has come up with recently. This is the New Testament translated into 'Yeshivish' with all sorts of translation and pronounciation errors which make it even funnier. I once printed out a few verses to hand out on Purim so the chevra could have a good laugh.I think that they have gotten rid of the more overt 'Yeshivishisms' like 'Lechoira' etc... but it is still hilarious.I would say that this translation has the precise opposite effect of its desired intent, but then they might stop making it and that means less fun for us all...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing in common with Orthodox Judaism","review":"This English only Bible has nothing in common with Orthodox nor any other orthodox Judaism. It includes the New Testament, which is not a part of the Orthodox nor non-orthodox Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). It is the King James Version of the Bible slightly modernized and filled with popular Hebrew and Yiddish words.Its Goble's translation is more less as accurate, compact, and concise as the King James Version, and still old fashioned. The Hebrew and Yiddish words used there are popular and easy to understand especially for readers of the Ashkenazi decent. Their meaning is quite easy to decipher, so other readers should not have difficulties to read it at no time.This 4th edition has the same content on 1232 pages, as all previous editions, but is smaller at 8.4 x 5.3 x 1.6 inch and difficult to read.

The fact that Goble uses Yiddish phrases and Ashkenaz pronunciation doesn't make this \\"translation\\" Jewish, let alone Orthodox, anymore than cooking bacon in my synagogue kitchen makes it kosher. The good news is that in our communities, we are aware of deceptive missionary attempts like Goble's. Missionaries to Jews may find it novel and appealing. However, it is a visceral offense to any Torah literate Jew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goble's translation is helpful","review":"I don't know enough about the Bible to believe my version would accurately translate so many difficult phrases, but from what I do know, Goble seems to have hit the nail on the proverbial head in every place I've looked.

Sadly, it is but an excellent example of the deception practised by Messianic Jews in their attempts to trick uneducated Jews into converting.

There, the author describes in a clear manner the array of political figures in Iranian politics since the fall of the Shah, as well as the political and ideological struggles which have taken place between them.

The writing is a little odd--it reads like an older children's book, or maybe young adult--so the occasional f-bomb (and other epithets) tend to catch me a little off guard (and I swear like a proverbial sailor). I can't say much about the art, really - it's great and it's consistent with his other work, aside from the toy theme. I did catch myself wondering what Toy Story would have looked like had Brom done the art direction. If you're a fan of Brom's work at all, it's certainly worth the price for a fun read and beautiful pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"Five Stars! Loved this book! The Plucker is a beautiful novel - dark, tragic and creepy! Just what you would expect from the mind of Brom. The prose and pictures work together to vividly bring the world to life. The paintings are stunning and the story a real page turner. Not for wimpy children, but a real treat for adults!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty, but empty, box.","review":"While Brom certainly has an abundance of skill as an illustrator, he hasn't developed his storytelling ability as far as he should have before penning this piece. The artwork doesn't fail to capture my imagination, but the writing is weak, the premise shallow and the attempts to shock fail. I'm not unhappy with the purchase, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this volume for its literary content. Brom should keep painting, but leave the semantics to someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"BROM paints a story for us with both word and image that makes it hard not to fall in love with the main character Jack. The story brings you back to when you were a child and had so many toys, reminiscent of Toy Story with a very dark and sinister edge to it. I know I had always imagined my toys would get up and play at night while I slept and this book brings that fond memory into a twisted action packed demon filled glory.I recommend this book highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THANKS TO THE AUTHOR!","review":"I am the Great-Grandson of Burnham & Addie, Grandson of Carl & Gerry, Son of Sue & Joe.To John Edgerton - THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for preserving the history of our family.

Unlike the other reviewer our pictures came out great, indoor and outdoor shots. We were able to pass these out to various people at the ceremony and reception and got a wide range of great pictures. The benefit is that you don't have to bug everyone to send you their pictures of the wedding. I just gathered the cameras up at the end and got them developed. Now I'm thinking I'll buy a few of these for future parties, great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too good to be true","review":"I tried this product on a lark. I thought that for 39.95 it wouldn't be a big risk. It worked fair for about two weeks and quit working. The remote only worked for about a day. I thought perhaps the battery was bad but hadn't yet gotten around to changing it until the whole unit died. The main unit itself gets super hot when plugged in and is perhaps the reason this unit failed.

Alot of action and suspense in this book and the bittersweet ending was a surprise. I'm still confused on the whole ripple concept, but that's understandable, these things are difficult for me to grasp. I loved all the 13-letter words and Dess' math magic was always amazing. The characters and their interaction with each other was always entertaining, especially Dess and Melissa. I am really enjoying books by this author and I especially liked this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bittersweet End","review":"Westerfield is brilliant; bringing in so many twists and turns to leave us hungry for more. However, the ending left me wanting more, wishing for something different. IT was indeed bittersweet. The book up to that point was extremely enjoyable and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful ending, get out some tissues for the end.","review":"Definately a series that will be missed, hoping for a continuation for a next set of Midnighters with the original gang to help guide them alone their adventures that await for them. As for the ending, for any sister who is close to their younger sibling, you may want to have a tissue box nearby, you will need it. Run, don't walk to grab this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn back now while there is still time!","review":"Ok I read all 3 books in this series because I read scott westerfeld's other series the uglies (which I loved), but I was extremely disappointed. I actually felt embarrassed for the writer after reading these books. The story is stupid and at the end nothing gets explained. I had my Mom and a friend read them just to make sure it wasn't just me and they hated them too. However I highly recommend reading The uglies series by the same author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but this edition missing pages","review":"The book was good, but pages 284 to 312 were replaces with 30 pages from previous chapters.

Robert Gilpin puts forth the theory that would inspire Paul Kennedy to write his \\"Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\\" years later. Gilpin's theory is basically this: powerful states in the international system tend to spend a lot to maintain its militar proeminance. But while it is wasting a lot of money to enforce the \\"rules\\" of the system, revisionist powers can compete with less costs. When there is a \\"de facto\\" balance between these powers, there's an hegemonic war that settles it straight. And then, there is a new cycle. \\"War and Change\\" is really worth reading and it shows a different position in the \\"neorealist\\" debate inaugurated by Kenneth Waltz in his \\"Theory of International Politics\\". A final advice: just read it if you're a bit aquainted with IR theory, or else it'll be pretty boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"too $$$ & defective","review":"Was very excited to buy this multi-cooker. The size was perfect for me and I liked the style. Unfortunately the price was very steep but I was willing to spend the money for a quality product. Took it out of the packaging and after washing put it on the stove. It did not sit flat & was warped (the base). Thought I'd try cooking in it anyway and see if heat would make a difference but all's that did was cause a burn mark on one spot on the bottom of the pan and in the interrior. Washed and returned the item and got a refund. Purchased a compairable multi-cooker at a department store and am happy w/ it. Plus I realize a glass lid is best (which the Krona brand did not have) so as to see how things are progressing while cooking. You can find one of these just as nice and for half the price elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product is AWESOME!","review":"After going to the hairdresser and her telling me that my hair was extremely dry, I decided to give this line a try. I've used practically everything, from Nexxus to Paul Mitchell, Mizani to Biolage. Nothing has worked. Yes...this shampoo is very pricey, but I went back to the hairdresser less than two weeks after I bought this shampoo (and the 5-vial treatment from their Resistance line and the anti-frizz serum), and she noticed a HUGE difference in the moisture level of my hair. I can honestly say that I finally believe that I'm on my way to healthier, stronger, and hopefully, longer, hair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it or leave it","review":"Didn't really knock my socks off after I paid a pretty penny for it.

I would have liked a confirmation that I was ordering the right item for my vehicle. Yes, I did check the drop down for my vehicle...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fit/Easy to Install","review":"Very easy to install. Pros: Look great, smaller than most other visors on market, and no tape residue to mess with. Yes, the rear ones use double-sided tape, put you just peel em and stick em in the window chanel-so no big deal. Improve air flow into cab. Cons: Rt side visor restricts vison about 1 inch, but you just have to get used to it. Yes, there is some increased wind noise above 45MPH, but it is not bad. My Continental tires make a helluva lot more noise than these deflectors do! Just turn the radio up some and you'll be fine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fit","review":"I ordered the visors for a ford explorer sport trac, which the write up said it would fit, but when delivered, was no where near the right match. The order number were right, but on the box, they were for a ford F150, which is not the same shape as the sport trac. They were nice looking visors, but unfortunetly, I had to return them. A second try revealed the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered or as described","review":"I ordered these for a 2012 Hyundai Genesis and I received parts for a Ford Pickup.

It is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pretty, Well-made","review":"The doll is very pretty, and well-made. When I first took out of the box, I thought it was small. But when I see my baby holding it, I know it is just the right size. I bought a 17-inches 10-dollar doll from target first, but this doll is too big for her. (She is about 18 months old) Compare these two dolls, Bebe Do is obviously much better made and much prettier. But is it worth the price paid? I think that depends on your child. My baby actually likes the cheaper doll better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having Fun in Grandma's Day","review":"Finding out what it was like in Grandma's girlhood is quite interesting. Valerie McNamara is a real grandma who was born in 1935. Each book in the \\"In Grandma's Day\\" series focuses on a different aspect of life. Having fun was a whole lot simpler then. Tom Mix was the popular movie hero. Listening to radio shows at night was an activity shared by all family members. Trading cards was popular. Not the sports cards popular today but cats, dogs, gardens, and rather sexy ones of \\"Petty's girls\\" were popular. A wonderful way to make history come alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who plays 5-card draw any more?","review":"This is a pretty good book, but it doesn't address the games that are actually played in poker rooms now: Texas hold 'em and 7-card stud.

I don't normally review purchases but I had to review this one to deter other fans out there from purchasing this blu ray release. The visual quality is fantastic on this release but the subtitles are AWFUL. It's written in broken english with really bad grammar. The horrible translation ruins the poetic nature of the dialogue and completely ruins the movie.

While the video transfer is quite good, the English subtitles are so much of a mess that I had to stop and review several scenes before I could get a sense of the dialog. I've got a high tolerance for the occasional errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation found in subtitles on many otherwise excellent Asian releases of Asian films;but the subtitles here are so difficult to slog through that the viewer really comes away with a diminished sense of what the film is about.After watching this version, I rented the Kino release. The subtitles are excellent -- as is the film, of course -- so my advice would be to avoid this one and get the Kino. Also, if ordering used, be sure that the seller is in fact offering the Kino version -- I've seen this one for sale on the Kino page as well, so look closely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small","review":"Looks like a print out from regular color printer.

The paper rim on the interior top of the drum was not on properly but it doesn't impact the usage or functionality, it's just cosmetics. Improvements can be made on the craftsmanship.

He just could'nt wait to leave home and be \\"naughty\\". But in the end, he found his \\"way back\\", showing that what was instilled in him as a child was still there as an adult. He had to discover that on his own. I found the book quite comical at times. It was easy reading. Lee has a smooth way of writing and is very descriptive in a very nice and pleasant way. You can visualize in your mind what he is describing. I think the book may be a little to liberal for most conservitive Christians, but they need to overlook that aspect because the characters in the book are your typical teens today. I think it was a very good, entertaing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance Dashboards","review":"The first two-thirds of the book were extremely disappointing and added very little value to the understanding of how to create effective dashboards. Instead, the author spent far too much time discussing IT concepts and buzzwords such as datamarts, multidimensional databases, operational data stores and OLAP tools. Much of the book reads as a platform for why one needs to invest in IT to help manage your business performance. It wasn't until the final third of the book that some useful concepts were explored regarding how a non-IT person should go about developing a solid performance dashboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable information for business managers","review":"This book provides very valuable and practical information for business managers interested in implementing performance dashboards.

Here are a few reasons why:1. Every recipe is dripping with flavors and fall-apart-in-your-mouth goodness.2. Braising is hard to screw up. Everything is cooked until it falls apart, so it doesn't matter if you forget about it and it ends up cooking for an extra half hour.3. Most of the recipes freeze well and are easy to make a lot of.4. The recipes are flexible--leave something out, throw something extra in, it'll probably still be delicious.5. Most of the recipes are reasonably healthy, especially if you cook in a cast iron dutch oven so you don't need much oil.6. The book instills you with enough confidence to pick a bunch of ingredients and invent your own braises, which is a great way to use up leftover vegetables. The book is not just recipes--it's also a system of cooking that can be applied to anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for everyone!","review":"This book works beautifully for me: on the weekends, when I have time, I can do one of the slow braises in quantity and enjoy it during the week; during the week, I can choose one of the quicker stove-top dishes and enjoy it right away.

They don't look balanced as real ikebana should look, containers don't seem suitable for flowers, color combinations are not always harmonious, and in many cases it is not clear why this is called ikebana at all. There are some pieces of useful information such as diagrams, tools, and tips, but I don't think it reasonable to buy the book for those 10 pages (like I did).There is a really great book on ikebana: \\"The art of arranging flowers; a complete guide to Japanese ikebana\\" by Shozo Sato, but it is out of print I am afraid. For examples of good ikebana look at these sites: http://www.nihonkoryu.org/, http://homepages.stmartin.edu/fac_staff/elias/index.htm, http://www.ikebanahq.org/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Step-by-Step Ikebana","review":"I am a newcomer to flower arranging but I want my arrangements to look professional. This book is perfect for people like me -- the author tells you exactly what you need, what tools, what equipment, what plant and accessory materials, and then shows you step-by-step where to place each piece of the arrangement. I have varied my plant materials and accessories according to what I could find in my area, and the arrangements have been stunning. A book that explains the philosophy behind Ikebana would complement this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven part 3","review":"This is the third installment in the Heaven series, and excellent as always. Heaven is such a strong character, and faces challenges unimaginable. You just ache for Troy and her to be together knowing that they can't. Pick up a copy and get ready to read this in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotinally gripping","review":"I have just finished reading this book along with the prequels. I was compelled to read these books so I could understand the life behind Farthinggale Manor and the lives it disrupted. It is a touching series that made me cry and laugh but mostly understand the cruel but realistic ways that nature deals out to unforunate others such as Heaven and her generation. Unlike many books, this series brings out more surprises during the story and keeps you guessing what the future holds for Farthy. I was disappointed by the heartache caused to Troy and Heaven, but realise the manner in the book wasn't just about a love story but more about a girl whose whole life has been so unfair but who finally finds peace within herself after the truth is revealed. Virginia Andrews is an amazing writer whose books are addictive and I look forward to reading Gates of Paradise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallen Hearts","review":"I read Fallen Hearts because it was part of a V.C.

Andrews by chance, when I was a houseguest searching my host's bookshelves for a good read. I found the first two Casteel novels, and I enjoyed the tight, competent writing and intriguing plotlines.I recently picked up \\"Fallen Hearts,\\" and -- after the first 100 pages -- I won't finish it. I just learned that the book was written by a ghost author after V.C. Andrew's death; the contrast is remarkable. This novel's trite and predictable, and the writing is on par with that of a supermarket romance novel.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent continuation of the Casteel saga","review":"Doubtless Fallen Hearts might have been a bit different if VCA had been able to finish this story before her untimely death. Neiderman didn't keep all the facts straight from Dark Angel, as the exact details of Troy's death/return, and nearer the end of Fallen Hearts, the writing feels a bit more distinctly different. However, this is stilla decent continuation of the Casteel saga. Having the truth revealed (that Leigh wasn't the little whore that Troy made her out to be) felt good. I know some VCA fans might disagree, but it felt somehow appropriate to me that Heaven would be with Troy one last time. I was disappointed that Luke suddenly died, though. It seemed like such an 'convenient' death so Neiderman wouldn't have to work with him anymore. A definite good read even if not up to the par of a 100% VCA book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallen Harts- One of the best VC Andrews book","review":"Fallen Hearts was the third V.C Andrews book that I read; and I found that it was better that some of the other story lines in the Dawn, and Flowers in the Atic. Heaven is more realistic, and it is not one of those 'poor heaven' story lines like Dawn. Athough it has the typical incest, forbiden love, and broken heart; factors that are in V.C Andrews books it cumulates in the end to have a happy, optimistic, and mysterious future. Although I would have liked for there to be a book inbetween Fallen Hearts and Gates of Paradise; to go into some of the elements that made fallen hearts so good like Fanny and Logan's affair and producing a child; and Heaven cheating on Logan and conceiving Troy's child. Fallen hearts is the best book in this series and you probably won't like the other books in the series; they were some what dissapointing compared to Falling Hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"church book","review":"I never recieved my book can u send me tracking information to find out where it is. thank u Judith"},{"rating":"1","title":"Churches that abuse","review":"Very preachy and boring.

He shares what happened to these individuals, and then describes the patterns of abuse so that the reader can recognize signs of abuse or potential abuse.

Discouragingly, it looks as if this very tree may have been a return as the poles are already scuffed up a bit. Perhaps I received someone else's return. This is incredibly frustrating a week before company is arriving, and do you know how hard it is to return a Christmas tree! Furthermore, the instruction sheet gives no help line to call. I realize that all online orders carry some amount of risk that something like this will happen, but I've been ordering from [...] since they first started business in something like 1997, and it has just been within the last couple of years that I've received defective items.

Jack, the mutilated best friend, shows up throughout the film in various stages of decomposition to convince his friend to kill himself. David is a werewolf who must die to set his victims souls free. So, the plot is twisted but what horror film's plot isn't. The plus with this film, the part I liked, is the transformation David goes through to become the wolf. In an age where everything is cgied, it almost seems like costumes and makeup have become a lost art. Some cgi effects, like those in Cursed, are just terrible. Here, you don't have that. So, pick up the film and watch it. It's a fun, dark, twisted watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Travoltas best","review":"Phenomenon like Michael were both made in 1996 and this is a great example of the genius of John Travolta picking great projects and taking risks to make the movies that test our spiritual senses.

The way the people around him were see saw in how they saw him. Both skeptic but also wanting to test him and get something from him themselves.Then there were the underlying and I think well written \\"big government\\" questions when the main character is basically treated as an enemy of the government when it is discovered in his trying to help he is labeled a subversive of some sort.John Travolta plays such gentle and wise souls so well.

What she didn't count on was having to report that the school's agriculture building exploded and that a prominent university spokeswoman had been beaten to death in her lab.Alex also didn't count on having to solve the murder mystery herself.Using her widely acclaimed Gen-X writing style, Beth Saulnier takes an issue from today's headlines and turns it into a fast-paced, thrilling mystery.

We were all assigned this book as well as her 'Shakespeare's Use of the Arts of Language' (Columbia University Press) sometime during our years there.I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that the new footnotes and examples help to explain A E I O and S and P and M, etc. etc.--or maybe it's that I have gained a deeper understanding of the importance of grammar, logic, and the language arts during the passing years...for those who are interested in studying language and writing clearly \\"The Trivium\\" is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable Resource for Parents and Teachers","review":"Contrary to what some may think, this book is far from being outdated and is in fact invaluable for parents who take an active interest in the education of their children. Critical thinking is a lost art in most primary and secondary schools and it is now up to parents (and concerned teachers) to recover it for their children. Concerning rhetoric, logic and the importance of good usage (grammar), there is enough in this clever little book to set you on the right track.Speaking from experience, beyond the educational value, there is this: an opportunity for you to discuss aspects of culture and thought with your children in a discriminating fashion so that you will find yourself learning from them as much as they do from you in the course of employing this book instructionally.I have no reservations in recommending THE TRIVIUM and would be hard put to find anything in its class for value and utility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Survey of Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric","review":"This book is a great and thorough survey of grammar, logic and rhetoric. I do not recommend this book for those who do not have at least some grammar background, as some of the terminology and language of the book may be too daunting. However after some basic grammar instruction, or if you already have some understanding of grammar and language as a science/study, this is an excellent book. Covering such topics as the functions of language, grammar, grammatical punctuation, validity of arguments, and much more. Definitely add this book to your library, whether you're and armchair enthusiast of language, or as an aide in high-school through university studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, arrived damaged","review":"The book is great: a concise introduction to logic and its related disciplines. It contains more material than most university graduates and post-graduates (esp., but not limited to engineering and science) would ever see in all their academic and professional careers -- exactly the stuff that makes an education what it ought to be, the 'Ph.' in Ph.D. Sadly the book arrived with a big bruise in the lower front left spine.

This recording really brings out Lully's genius. The structure is much different from Italian opera seria, for those of you who have gotten used to the endless alternation of recititative and aria--much more focus is put on the recitative aspect. When the arias do come, however, they pack an incredible dramatic wallop, beautifully illustrated in the end of act II with Armide's aria \\"Venez secondez me desires\\" subsequent to her famous monologue \\"Enfin, il ist en ma puissance.\\" Herwegghe leads his ensemble in a virtually flawless and scintilating performance. The grand passacaile in act V is simply breathtaking. Guillame Laurens is incredibly powerful as the title role. This is a great recording. I highly recommend it for any fan of Baroque opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyed.","review":"Well done... The book appears to be well researched and is well written.

She was able to hold the country up, when the sky was falling around her. Her ambitions and attitude of breaking the rules made her truly deserving of her title.This book is written like a fairytale and the words just flow off the pages. Her words are vivid illustrations to the world that Orchid lived in. Even with the flow, it was moving in a slow pace. The author is constantly retelling and explaining non-important elements that did not appear at the right moment and bored the living wits out of me. But Anchee Min picked it up within a couple of pages. She did throw in unnecessarily remarks that skewed the whole focal point of the novel.But aside from that, I enjoyed reading this novel. If you can hang on and read through some of the slow paced chapters, the novel will truly be enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"A vivid describtion of life in the Forbidden City a century ago, writen in an engaging, easy-to-read manner.

The way custom had to be adhered to in the Chinese court was so restricting and frightening yet this woman through her insight, intelligence and understanding of people managed a position of power that can only be admired.I learned so much about the Chinese way of thinking and doing things. I also learned a different version of the opium wars and foreign intrusion than my history lessons giving only the \\"British\\" point of view.I am now buying The Last Empress to learn more about this fascinating woman.I can thoroughly recommend this book to those who want to learn more about China and also to those who want a thoroughly good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent novel","review":"This novel is good from a literary perspective. We follow the life of Yehenara/Yehonala/Orchid/the future dowager empress Cixi as she is taken as a concubine into the Forbidden City until shortly after her husband's death.Keep in mind that this is a novel, and while general historical facts are correct, the details of Orchid's life are speculative, and Anchee Min does a good job writing a story.

So please, pick up this book if you want a good read, but not as a historical text."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It gives a wonderful perspective on what it was like to be a woman in China in the mid-1800s. Of course, the woman who was portrayed in this historical novel was quite the unusual woman herself, coming into power through being a concubine of the emperor, but one who came to be highly favored because of her wonderful intellectual capabilities.The book itself was wonderfully written.

Although the author is obviously very knowledgable on her subject it just never caught on fire for me. The first 1/2 of the book was the best part as we were introduced to the details of Orchid's life, but the long section after her son's birth just dragged and dragged as new characters were introduced, new situations hurried through, and the promised intrigue failed to materialise. I did finish the book and the last few chapters were a little better.

There's very little about why or how they did a certain piece. Most pages have a single paragraph on the piece shown, which usually isn't very informative.It's useful to get the names of design studios so you can go to their web sites and look at some good portfolios, but beyond that I'm not sure what else to do with it.

Kantata, not so great.","review":"This Oster-Oratorium, BWV 249 like Bach's lesser masses, probably gets lost in the rush to his 'Magnificat', 'St. Matthew's Passion', and 'Mass in B-Minor', but this is a great, and nicely concise work. I am especially fond of this rendition in that even with my very rusty German, I can understand the words in most of the solos. I confess that the 'b side' Kantate 'Erfreut euch, ihr Herzen' BWV 66 is not up to the standard of the Oratorio. Some of the arias especially seem a bit harsh, and that's from someone who has no training in serious singing.

It just occurred to me today that I've been breaking out a lot more in recent weeks and that it's probably because I'm not using this anymore. So glad to see I can buy more on Amazon!To sum up - best thing is how good it is for my skin - clears skin without drying.

The lower edge (about two inches wide) that goes all the way around the bottom edge of this seat is ROUGH RUBBER! OUCH, you talk about rub burns!!!! I ride everyday about 20 miles at a time and when I got this seat, the first time I used it, I stop swearing under my breath about my butt hurting.

The Vitesse Cruiser bike seat makes it comfortable. It's not a huge distance but with this seat I don't get such a pain in the ... The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is even with my cousin who is 190lbs wet the seat is prone to tilt backwards suddenly. I have tightened as tight as possible without stripping the bolt.

This offering is no exception. Hopkins fans will love it -- or at least the first three-quarters. The first three quarters feature Hopkins playing brilliantly (and acoustically) in a variety of college venues. The last quarter of the tape shows Hopkins in the late 1970s, \\"plugged in\\" and dressed in electric blue and sequins, like a back-up singer from Abba. While it was interesting to see Hopkins play a modern electric guitar he seemed disturbingly out of place in the glam-blues environment. Kitchy? Yes sir. But still an important part of the Hopkins story.Those who want to see Hopkins in his element might want to check out \\"Masters of The Country Blues featuring Mance Lipscomb and Hopkins.\\" It more of a pure country/Texas blues offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing outlining tool.","review":"StoryView is an amazing outlining tool. I looked and read reviews of a lot of other software programs before deciding on this one. First off, let me say, it does look rather scary at first.

I am very lazy writer and I never get anything done with note cards. With StoryView I am always thinking about my story and writing. Its amazing. It has a brainstorming layout, outline layout, 4 act part, etc. There is a nice \\"track\\" feature that allows you to make connections between different characters and scenes and so forth. You can color coordinate different scenes to help you when you are done. Plus you can print out the whole time-line for pre-production use (if you are so lucky). So to sum up the program, it is simply the best software out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storyview Software by Screenplay Systems","review":"Recently, I bought the April issue of Writer's Digest.

Her imaginary character, Pixie Sage, comes crashing through the ceiling, literally, and into our hearts. Listen and be taken by the subtle compositions that even your baby will enjoy along with you as he or she falls asleep on your lap or in your arms. Kitty is touched by a lyrical muse who shows us that imagination and intellect do not have to oppose one another, and, like two wings of the same bird, they can lift us to places that we only visit in our dreams -- if we dare remember them!

Simply, Picture were one of the best and \\"Diamond Dreamer\\" in particular (well, at least as far as I'm concerned) is a forgotten treasure.The music in here, has a blue-collar earnestness and is not a million miles away from early Accept with a hint of Saxon (and Priest, of course) - but it's very genuine. Alias, Picture truly represents a sound common to a lot of other Dutch or Belgian bands from the era (Bodine, Killer...).

When I was done, I was shocked to see... my layers, looking bouncy and thick, plus much more volume at the crown, and all over body and shine.This is an amazing product, and for the money a much better deal than salon mousses such as Redken guts and the other \\"point and spray\\" varieties, which tend to weight my hair down more than giving it body and defined layers and tons of glossy, non-frizzy shine!

Cliff may not be an actor worth receiving awards for his acting, but I think he is a natural.

Most cabinets are 12 inches deep, thats standard. With the cables sticking out the back this is easily 13 and a half inches deep. Unless you want it sticking out in front (looking bad) you have to cut into your drywall as I had to.Also the width is misleading, when I bought this it was labeled as for 15 inch cabinets, when its 15 and 3/4 inches wide. Luckily our light rail bumped the width out far enough.The bolts that come with it seem to be a metric size. I needed slightly longer ones to make the install work properly (again because of the light rail) but being metric they were impossible to find.I ended up rigging it up by double laying the cabinet bottom with some 1x6 and boring into the actual cabinet bottom with a spade bit so my bolt head would sit lower.I finally got it installed, and it looks nice, but man it was a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit","review":"I wanted this to work out SO much!

Unless you mounted it in the corner or under a shelf that was extra deep, I wouldn't bother getting this. For the price, I want something that is convenient -- with the installation hassles, this was not.

I agree with the other reviews which state that navigation is a little difficult. To me, the sound is fine. It's easy to set up and use. The fact that you can hook your iPod to your receiver is great. But what I don't understand is why I can't use the Bridge to access the video on my video iPod. After all, it links into a Harman Kardon audio-video receiver. The receivers handle a host of video inputs. It seems strange to say the least that the iPod's video cannot be accessed and displayed. My recommendation is not to buy it. You can get video from your iPod onto your TV by using an RCA adapter cable available through Amazon for one cent (plus $5 shipping). While you cannot control your iPod through the receiver you get far more access to its content and greater control over its display. Surely some day we'll get a product worth owning. This is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly annoying user interface","review":"I bought the bridge for my AVR 645.

It works perfectly with your h/k receiver and remote giving you easy access to all your music. I especially like using it with the Abus feature to pipe music to my deck outside. The only thing I don't understand is why you cant turn on/off the shuffle feature of the iPod. This has to be done before you put your iPod in the dock. Not a big deal but just the same it would have been nice. Other than that its great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quicker Searches","review":"Love the sound. The AVR240 is my third HK since college.

If you have a large library you won't be able to scroll even remotely quickly. I have about 20 GB of songs, and it takes me literally five minutes to scroll all the way through to the end.

It is pretty cool and sets up in an instant and you can control it with the HK receiver or remote. What you control is the most of the Ipod's Music menu. This means you can scroll through Playlists, Artists, Albums, Songs, Composers - but not podcasts or games. Also, you cannot shuffle the ipod. The menus that you can control work pretty good, but have a bit of delay so they are not as fast as the click wheel on the ipod. The lack of the shuffle feature is the biggest downside in my book and will force you to build up your playlists when you want variety. Sound quality is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"The functions are hard to use when connected to my HK amp.

The premise is totally relate-able -- two former high school classmates, who never spoke more than a few words to each other, meet years and years later. It's a little hard to believe how grounded the main female character is -- she is dying of cancer, she is a single mom, she suffered a major trauma in high school. Yet she remains a happy hippie chef. I also had diffiult buying that the two main characters could fall in love so easily, just like that. They almost overnight went from strangers walking his dog together while she was in her nightgown and jeans to deeply in love. The daughter was also the usual jaded, hard-bitten, angry daughter. But, in the end, it kept my attention. So it was cliche -- but it did the cliches well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Read!","review":"What a marvelous book! \\"On A Night Like This\\" is anything but expected. The characters are real and heartfelt - complicated people who are fighting their way through a painful crucible. I cheered for them while feeling their sorrows. The style of \\"On A Night Like This\\" soars above - way above - the romance and chick lit it's been compared to. The mother-daughter struggles of Blair and Amanda are familiar enough, but Ellen Sussman infuses this relationship with some wonderfully wise twists. And Luke, while he earns his stripes as a jerk at times, makes for a worthy counterpoint to Blair's unvarnished emotion. The beautifully drawn California setting further enhances this sad but enveloping novel. This is a terrific read."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, compassionate, and real","review":"Blair Clemmens, a single mother dying of cancer, is so spunky and wonderfully flawed you could follow her anywhere. Her sixteen-year-old daughter, Amanda, is beautifully rendered. Throw in a romantic interest in the form of Luke Bellingham--opposites attract--and you have a story that is funny, compassionate, and real. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Just Awful","review":"Worst book I've read in a long time. I couldn't even finish it. The characters are so unbelievable and incredibly unlikeable.

I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Weekend","review":"Like some of the other reader-reviewers, I also read this book quickly but in horrified fascination. Unlike the others, I did not find it deep, complex, or compelling. Instead it seemed false, trite, superficial and contrived. The characters' reactions to the parade of horribles -- cancer, desertion, infidelity, rape -- never seemed authentic. There was so much binge drinking, I was surprised they could stagger from one improbable scene to the next. I was insulted by the plot and its ridiculous execution. But I was most dismayed by reading several hundred pages and not finding a single sentence or phrase that was memorable or well-executed. The prose is so prosaic, it was deadening. I didn't expect Anna Karenina but what is the point of writing without beauty or grace?"},{"rating":"1","title":"mindless and poorly written","review":"If you are looking for a mindless Harlequinn Romance, I would recommend this book.

It has a riveting plot, a pair of unique and engaging main characters in Blair and Luke, and an interesting mother-teen daughter relationship as well. While the story begins with a clearly tragic set of circumstances, the author prevents the book from becoming overly sentimental and mawkish. At each point where I worried that the book might dip into melodrama, the plot took a totally different turn. I would definitely recommend On a Night Like This to anyone who is looking for a well-written, compelling and emotionally satisfying story."},{"rating":"1","title":"good video/audio, lousy singing","review":"like so many, i'm a huge billy joel fan. but his voice is just so off in this one (lots of sharp/flat notes) that it's hard to watch/listen.some parts with the duets with others are fun though, but overall, very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sound","review":"The comments on the poor sound quality are spot on - I've bought many Blu-ray concerts and the overwhelming majority have immersive sound quality that really are fantastic.

His voice is really bad in this concert. If you can live with it then the back up and band is better than he is at the time he sang. I agree with one about thinking the man was drunk. You just don't have a concert like this and sound like that. Also the DVD comes in your not so standard case. Something like a clear CD case. The hard plastic kind and the middle hub was broke and we know what that could mean. A DVD that has moved during shipment and scratched a new DVD all to heck.

Instead the film becomes a scatological nightmare, with incredibly uneven pacing and confused plot(s) that end in a very dissapointing ending. The performances range from mildly interesting (Hopkins as Kellog) to pathetic (Dana Carvey as Kellogs adopted ne'er do well son). If you like endless poop jokes, the film is for you.

It had a great cast and seemed like a great plot too. Well, apparently a great cast can't save an awful film. All the movie contained was people getting enemas, people talking about enemas, and people trying to be celebant. I don't reccomend this movie, and trust me, no matter how good it may looks, \\"The Road to Wellville\\" is very bad. Don't waste you time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rorschach test","review":"Given the reviews here, 'Wellville' may be one of the most effective psychological tests available. In this way only, it's like Monty Python's 'Life of Brian' or Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' ...MY opinion? Within cinema over the past 100 years, this movie rates much higher than the book does among english novels. Boyle isn't terrible, he just isn't memorable. It's much harder to forget this movie. I loved it, perhaps because I'm a vegetarian who tries not to take himself tooseriously. This is a refreshingly playful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget The Movie Critics","review":"This movie is hilarious, wonderful. Although it's pretty much adult entertainment it is one of those movies that's a must have during the holidays. RTW can be viewed repeatedly without boredom, it is just thet hilarious, my favorite is Dana Carvey playing the village idiot son of Kellogg......too many LOLOLOLS to type them all here. It's 20 bucks well spent if you want some good old earthy humor and see some actors you've seen lately on television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniqe movie. Funny though.","review":"I liked this movie. The cast was great, the story was fantastic and there were many different levels of humor to appeal to most people. Big fans of John Cusack and Sir. Anthony Hopkins. The movie can be akward and uncomfortable at points; gratuitous man ass, you see. Very unpleasant. But other than that I really enjoyed it. If you like period films such as this one (takes place in the Belle Epoque, late 19th century America)and you like to laugh, this is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Husbands gift!","review":"My husbands favorite movie!

However -- beware! This DVD boasts as one of its \\"special features\\" the fact that it's a FULL SCREEN version, not a letterboxed version. I doubt there will ever be another DVD edition, so pick it up, anyway. The film wasn't shot in 'scope, so it's hard to tell how much you're missing -- either you're losing a small amount from the sides, or you're actually gaining a little on the top and bottom.

The people in this movie are amazing, and the story isn't bad, but its not a comedy. It's not a drama either. It really is just nothing.

Maybe the AMA?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At the San ...","review":"The Road the Wellville is wonderful evocation of life (and death) at the famous Battle Creek Sanitarium circa 1900. It's also a very funny satire of bizarre health fads, both those that were current at the turn of the last century and their many modern equivalents.The movie features excellent performances from a talented ensemble cast - I particularly enjoyed Anthony Hopkin's rendition of the eccentric, self righteous Dr. John Kellogg, and Matthew Broderick's terminally bewildered Will Lightbody. Lightbody's many encounters with the San's crackpot medical devices are great fun and reveal Broderick's talent as a physical comedian.The production design is outstanding and the director has a real sympathy for the quirky elegance of this period of American history. The luxurious lakeside San complex, with it's many gynmasia, lecture halls, dining rooms and boudoirs, is almost a character in itself.Highly recommended, especially for broad-minded viewers with an taste for period comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best price I have found on the Internet","review":"Because I buy virtually everything online, I have found Amazon's price for the product to be the best after doing numerous searches for a better price.

It changed my life, just as it caused James P. Cannon and other leaders of the US Communist movement who accidentally received a copy in 1928 to launch a struggle for Trotsky's ideas. Let it change yours. Workers and farmers parties in the USA, the revolution in China, how to fight fascism, the world economy and politics, all of these things are discussed, not abstractly, but as a defense of what Lenin and the original Comintern had given the workers of the world, what Stalin tried to take away. The ideas and lessons are needed in today's fights."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I know it must be quite a temptation, but a book's editors ought to refrain from putting in their two cents on the reader comments page. The language in the other review is just way too book industry to be believed. Moving On: I grabbed this book and cracked it open with much enthusiasm, only to be greatly disappointed. Peres da Costa's shallow, underdeveloped novel is hardly worth the read. Magical realism? What, those disposable and irrelevant feelers on the top of Mina's head? The story was boring, and by the time I got to the end, I knew what to expect -- a great fireball to end a nothing, nowhere plot. This book lacks depth and character development, and it's too bad these 300 pages couldn't have gone to a young writer with something genuinely interesting to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good album, boring DVD","review":"I was impressed with the Born Again album, which is Warrant's 1st since the departure of singer/writer Jani Lane. This DVD contains a video for each song on the Born Again album as well as some extras.The bottom line here is that the videos are amateurish. I've seen wedding videos that had better production than this DVD. Every video is basically the same thing with some random images flown in. Quality-wise, it looks like someone had a camcorder and some no-frills video editing software.Two words come to mind: low budget. I still like the album, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warrent Born Again","review":"I was greatly disappointed when I watched this video.

Terrible story, terrible acting, and it probably cost $ 50 to make. \\"Beat the Devil\\" is interesting to see, since it's a cult film. One bad feature - the synchronization of the speech is off - the actors speak, and you hear what they say with just a very slight delay. It's very slight, and it's not so bad that it ruins watching the film, but it IS a small irritant to see them speak and have the sound not match their lip movements. (The film didn't do much for me, but many people think it's great.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One step pottie","review":"We have an elderly Persian cat and the easy entry facilitates his needs.

The suspension of disbelief in this film is over the top; by the end of the movie I was laughing to see our hero full of bullets but still alive. Kind of like the movie itself. These video-games-to-movies struggle hard, but seldom work and that's because unlike comic books that have a cohesiveness to their world, video games' very appeal rests upon the game participants differing interactions to finish the story. As a game player, we are the main character of the video contest. Here, the story is already completed for us, so it's really all about how well the writers relate the protagonist to their audience, and this one, like most, by no means has a universal appeal. So one star for Mark Wahlberg & Mila Kunis' acting and another star for style, but even that's being generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"NeVeR ReCeiVeD","review":"This service was such a long & tedious one that I will never again purchase anything from amazon.

Sadly I was mistaken as Max Payne will now join the rest of the horrible video game movie adaptations.

The snow floating down through 95% of the movie makes for good ambience. Some of the action scenes are very good. The supporting caste iss good. The main problems of the movie are the pacing and the plot holes. The movie is not logically consistent in its own universe. Everybody has the same hallucinations on the drug. Beau Bridges's character confesses to killing Payne's wife; however, we see the killer scamper through a bedroom window through flashbacks. I don't think Beau could ever move that fast.Some scenes in the movie are really cool. When Max takes the drug, the snowflakes turn into flaming cinders. The shootout in the office building is done very well.In summary, don't pay too much to see this and be prepared to wonder if the movie is really worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I bought this movie because I wanted to watch it and didn't want to go and track it down at some redbox.

After all, it derives from a video game.But it is disheartening to see such acting and money wasted on such pretentious claptrap. IMDB has a spoiler-alert on their synopsis, but they hardly need it.

However, while a textbook should strive to be as good as possible in those areas, it's no substitute for the primary literature in peer-reviewed journals and shouldn't be viewed as such, and instead should be seen as more of a conceptual introduction, in which I feel it does well. It avoids the tempting parade-of-taxa style, and instead focuses on the important concepts uniting reptiles and to an extent all animals, such as osmoregulation, feeding, locomotion, reproductive strategies, etc.The section dealing with my primary focus, locomotion, is rather sparse, and contains some outdated information, but nothing that can't be corrected with a quick read through the literature.

When you let go the parent side goes up and the infant side looks as though it may tip backwards (flipping upwards) So there is no time that you could just let go of the floater.Also, swimming and trying to be face-to-face with your child is hard since the toy bar is right in between the two of you, and you basically have a toy bar in your face while swimming obscuring your view of your child.Over all, I wouldn't buy this toy again.

So all in all, poor customer service and a defective product make this a toy I would not recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DANGEROUS PRODUCT!!!!","review":"I purchased this item thinking it would be great. Wrong!!!! This product is not safe. My son is a large child for his age (1yr, 26lbs.) The item states up to 2 years of age, it doesn't specifiy a weight limit on the box. My son almost flipped over in this float just by leaning a bit to the side and also to the back. Don't let go of your child when using this float AT ALL. It's VERY dangerous! It's also a disaster trying to get the child in and out of this float. I wouldn't recommend this float to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Score one for summer fun!","review":"This was a great find for my little guy. I was originally looking for just a single float for the baby, and I found this. I thought it was a great idea, because it would keep you close to your baby, with your hands free.My son absolutely loved this toy. It kept him well supported, no tipping. (He weighs about 20 lbs.) He could kick his legs and play with the attached ball toys, but I think what he enjoyed most was being face to face with us. I would reccommend this toy to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"We both really liked it!","review":"I had this for my son when we visited the grandparents in FL. and he loved it. Now that we live in FL and have a pool I'm getting a new one for my 4mo old. I really liked it b/c since w/ your baby in *any* float you need to stay with them for safety, at least with this one you get to float comfortably along. The float is strong enough to hold you both.The one thing I don't like- no weight guidelines. I've found this with most of their products. I'd like to see a weight not an age guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"I stumbled across this video late one night while watching Philadelphia's public TV station, and I just couldn't turn it off--even though I was exhausted and needed to go to bed.

This film follows his lead and shows for some 30 minutes, using simple machines (levers, inclined planes) and fire, a series of continuous actions which accomplish nothing in particular except to entertain the viewer. No humans are shown in the film, though their work in setting up the event, apparently in a large warehouse, is evident in how smoothly, more or less, the whole crazy enterprise takes place. There is a certain underlying humor to the whole thing and also the anticipation of how the film makers will manage to keep the movement going. Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible party video","review":"The Way Things go is a wonderful, non-stop adventure of chain reations, unexpected outcomes, and visual stimulation.

After a few of weeks, i had comepletly forgot about this Amelie thing she talked to me about, and one day we were in her car and some weird acordian music came on..I was very intruiged, when she told me it was the Am��lie soundtrack, i shat my pants. I fell in love with the instruments, the music is so relaxing and reminds me of some good ol' Finntroll(polka-black metal band). Ever since, the Am��lie soundtrack has its occasional spin on the cd player. This cd is great for all fans of \\"humpa\\"(finnish polka) or any metalhead Finntroll fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est Magnifique!","review":"La musique du film Amelie est tres magnifique!

Yann Tiersen has composed music which is so beautiful, melancholic and touching that it makes you want to have a date with the partner of your dreams at a Parisienne streetcaf��."},{"rating":"2","title":"stup��fiant... il hante mes rves","review":"The film was such a beauty, and the music, composed by Yann Tiersen, brought it to life with a purity and freshness unrivaled by any other film soundtrack in years. Tiersen, has modestly emerged as one of the greatest composers of the last 20 years. Perfectly French, his music is breathtaking...it haunts my dreams.The soundtrack also features two scratchy old gems: one by Frehel, a terrific French singer from the 1930s, somewhat in the vein of Piaf, Mistinguett and Josephine Baker; and one by vintage Crooner, Russ Columbo.All in all, a delightful collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est magnifique!","review":"I first saw this film in Paris while studying as a foreign exchange student in August of 2001. As the nostalgic bon vivant I was then, this movie seemed to capture the very essence of Paris. I listen to the soundtrack now, six years later, while walking down the rainy streets of Seattle--the music makes me more aware of the people and things around me. There isn't a bad day out there that can't be brightened by the charm of this soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intoxicating as cognac!","review":"If you have seen Amelie, you know how you never wanted the magic to end. This CD is going to become a bestseller precisely because it allows those who have fallen under Amelie's trance to visit again that special world. And if you haven't seen the most bewitching movie of the year, you should go right away to see why people are so enthusiastic. But will this unique and oh-so-French music appeal to those who haven't yet seen Amelie? I'm betting it will, as I'm giving the CD to several family members who haven't yet seen the movie. Yann Tiersen has concoted an absolutely intoxicating sound here that features cymblas, piano and (mostly) button accordian. I don't know what the music of the streets of Paris actually sounds like, but I can dream it would be this whimsical, mysterious and lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMELIE THE SOUNDTRACK IS AS ENCHANTING AS THE MOVIE","review":"After you see \\"Amelie\\" you wish it was available on DVD just so you can have this beautiful romatic movie for your collection.The music brings back the wonder images of one of the most beautiful movies I have seen in my lifetime (I am 38).Yann Tiersen knows how to bring out the scenes and the subtle nuances from each character bringing every scene to a climax all its own.From beginning to end this soundtrack breathes life into music from every corner, an absolute must for your music collection, and go see the film! Tre Magnifique!I smell OSCAR for soundtrack as well as acting and best picture nods....John Williams watch out you have some competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful from the begining to the end","review":"Last year I was in a metro in Paris and someone started playing a beautiful french music in accordion. I followed the music and lost the station just to hear the music to the end. I didn't recognized the music at first, but it filled me with joy and I knew I had listened it before, but I didn't know where. I kept the music in mind. It carries the lovely mood of Paris.Months later that music still ressonated inside my memories and I finally remembered: it was \\"La Valse D'Amelie\\". Without thinking, I bought immediatelly this CD. All the musics are ingenious and passionate. Its a wonderful and indispensable CD.Just for the purpose of situating this review according to your own tasting, could be useful to know that I love classical music, jazz and movie soundtracks.Other lovely soundtrack you may like isPride & Prejudicefrom Dario Marianelli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic","review":"Magical. Fantastic. Amazing. There are many other words I could list, but you don't want to hear them all.This album will not disappoint you, the music is awe-inspiring. La Noy��e and La Valse d'Am��lie are simply the most fantastic songs I have ever heard, as are the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"I love this soundtrack, it's very magical and fantastical in a very French way. I think especially the Valse comes off very parisien of the romantic era where they seem to be perma-stuck in the '50s. It's very jolly, tombe d'amour kinda stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable Soundtrack to a Memorable Film","review":"I was unfamiliar with the work of Yann Tiersen until I saw the film Amelie and loved the score. Foreign film scores always seem to have a quality that others lack - Il Postino, Cinema Paradiso etc. to name but a couple - and Amelie is no exception. The general flavour of the music reminded me a lot of Michael Nyman's score for The Piano, particularly some of the more minimalistic movements. On the whole, however, this is far more accessible than Nyman, and its rhythms and melodies will captivate the listener almost immediately. Especially noteworthy is Tiersen's effective use of the accordion, evoking the Parisian setting of the original film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to Have It","review":"I heard this soundtrack while sitting in a coffeeshop, immediately recognized it and had to have it. I found myself listening with a guilty smile, reliving the multitude of small pleasures from the movie. Unfortunately, it was sold out at the first store I visited, but I found a copy here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-buy soundtrack","review":"There's no doubt in my mind that this soundtrack was a significant factor in creating the essence and beauty of the film Am��lie. From many quirky songs accompanied by accordions, to many sad, yet beautiful songs composed on piano. There are a few songs which I usually skip when listening, but the rest you can listen to over and over again and never grow tired. I highly recommend this soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, but.....","review":"For any that have not seen this movie nor heard the music, you are missing one of the greatest of all time. This is a must see movie, and once you see it, you will want the music.This CD however, is the same as the Amelie soundtrack with the green cover, that costs about 30 dollars less! The only difference of this cd is the cover, which was marketed for japan. Do not waste money on this cd, get the soundtrack with the green cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully delightful!","review":"The soundtrack brings me back to the scenes the songs were played in and it's maddening!! I loved the movie and now I love the soundtrack. It makes me want to go back to the theatre and see Amelie played over and over again. While the film itself displayed the true innocence of Amelie it was as much the music helping to portray that very feeling of a young child in France.While this is more about the soundtrack I must add that the movie was just as successful as the former (City Of Lost Children) by this same director, Jeunet. I can't choose which was a better film! The musical direction is just as awesome!It is not typical of me to purchase and enjoy a soundtrack, especially one that is mainly instrumental, but I couldn't resist since I enjoyed the film so much. If you are like me...watch the film first and then consider the soundtrack. I guarantee it will bring you back to the film ... a film that will leave you with wanting more of Amelie and her adventures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ahhhh Yann- the French magician","review":"This soundtrack is modern French minimalism at its best! Simple chord structures and haunting themes morph into complex, interwoven lines and rich instrumentation. The music manages to be simultaneously soothing and inspiring. The simple melodic ideas combined with instrumental and embellished layering makes this music as awe-inspiring for a mature concert pianist as a teenager with no musical background. Truly a wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I absolutely love this soundtrack! I listen to it as I'm driving around town and it adds to my joy everyday! My kids love it too! Fun, bouncy and beautiful! A must have! I have lots of soundtracks but up until now have not owned any French music; now I'm hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful music","review":"I love this CD! One of those you can just put in and hit \\"random\\" and let play through... every song is thoroughly enjoyable. Also fun to play on the piano, if you play. \\"Comptine d'un autre ��t��: l'��pr��s midi,\\" track number four, is my favorite, but they really are all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"All kinds of feelings","review":"In my shelf at home I have many soundtracks, I can most of the time when I'm at the movies tell who is the composer before the name appears, but this was the second time I bought a soundtrack that was composed by someone I didn't know, but it worked last time so, \\"why not\\". This time it worked out even better then the last time. I find that every track has a mood or feeling connected to it, and when I'm done listening to the whole soundtrack, most of the feelings that I have experienced; sadness, happiness, love, hate and so on I can find on this soundtrack.When I go to a deserted island, with nothing to do, except maybe eat ice-cream, this is the music I would bring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"I know nothing of the language of music to faithfully describe the pieces on this soundtrack. I do, however,love soundtracks and this one faithfully transcribes the happy champaigne-bubbly feeling of the movie and its actress, Tatou,into the poetry of sound. Each track blends well with the next offering the listener an entire CD of Parisian quarkiness and playful pleasure. Amelie's waltz makes me want to stand up and whirl while the rest urges me to take up accordian playing and wind out these musical dreams like a happy organ grinder on a street corner. If you want to recapture the happy charming feel of the movie, do, by all means, by the soundtrack, a bottle of good French wine and a crusty loaf---ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most excellent movie and soundtrack","review":"The movie was a very \\"cute\\" and magical thinking movie. yet as an adult i could't not help but completely falling in love with amelie. the soundtrack is truely wonderful as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD Ever!","review":"This CD has music to fit everyone. It goes with the likes of young and old. I, a teenager, love this CD while my brother and parents also love it. The music has piano, accordian, and even some old 40s music. It's a great CD to listen to and I recommend it to everyone. And if you like the CD the movie is awesome too. Even with subtitles, the movie is fantasic. And this CD could very well be the best CD I've ever listened to."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent complement to the Jeunet film","review":"Absolutely mesmerizing! The film itself is far superior to anything else I've seen in a great while, and the same is true of the score. Mostly instrumental (two tracks provide nostalgic LP songs), this collection of music runs the gamut from whimsy to contemplation, joy to sorrow. And though the music sometimes takes a darker, cynical turn, there is always a subtle note of a brighter turn to follow. This is truly a great companion to the film (I consider the two inseparable), but on its own merit, the Amelie score is a wonderful, delightful addition to any music lover's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent compilation... almost!","review":"This album encompasses virtually all of the tracks you need to understand why Love are widely regarded as one of the most innovative groups to emerge from the mid 60's West Coast scene. It even includes a short, typically rambling, interview with Arthur Lee that is a \\"must have\\" bonus for die-hard Love fans and which helps sets the scene for first time recruits.But... where is \\"Maybe The People Would Be The Times Or Between Clark And Hilldale\\" from \\"Forever Changes\\" (one of the standout tracks from their third, quite brilliant album) and \\"Emotions\\" from \\"Love\\" (a superbly atmospheric instrumental from their first album that is used throughout the film \\"Medium Cool\\").These omissions leave an unfortunate and fairly large gap in what should have been a perfect compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sensual Story","review":"Comes in Colours is a collection of the most popular songs from the Love's first three albums. The sexual revolution of the 60s accented with poetic metaphors of enlightenment provide the listener with romantic feelings of the period. Whether it's the thrill of discovery, the discovery of disappointment, the agony of abandonment, or the explosion of shared joy, each song creatively express feelings of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I don't start crying, it's because I've got no eyes","review":"This is a nice compilation of a grossly underrated band. The track lineup could not have been better chosen - almost the equivalent of Rhino's box set, without the filler. The only complaint, and it is a fairly serious one, is that the songs from \\"Forever Changes\\" sound substantially poorer than the rest of the disc - they are muffled, and have a slight high-pitched whine in the background. This alone keeps the disc from earning 5 stars. Musically, the highlights are many, including the propulsive jangle of \\"The Little Red Book\\", the manic frenzy of \\"7 and 7 Is\\", the majestic uncertainty of \\"Alone Again Or\\" and the beauty of \\"Andmoreagain\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid set that you will \\"Love\\"","review":"This is a first-rate collection featuring many of Love's finest songs. Thankfully, Raven places a heavy emphasis on the material from their essential first three LP's. True, their masterwork \\"Forever Changes\\" does not appear in its entirety. You really need to own that album seperately, anyway. Overall, a very thoughtfully constructed compiliation with informative liner notes. A wonderful place to begin (or end up)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lipo Sculpt Gel","review":"I was expecting the product to have information that wasn't provided on the internet but it didn't.

The music is exquisite, the performance admirable. If you want to investigate post Monteverdi opera, start here. You will certainly enjoy the sensuous Calisto of Maria Bayo, and a tour-de-force performance from Marcello Lippi singing as baritone (when roaming as Jupiter) and countertenor (when impersonating Minerva to seduce Calisto). Rene Jacobs is such a stupendous conductor that it's easy to rate him as one of the finest musicians in the World, this recording of La Calisto is ample proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, educational puzzle","review":"Like the other M&D toys we have, this puzzle is very well-made. The size of the pieces are easy for my 2 yr old to handle. Prior to getting this for Xmas a few weeks ago, she already knew most of her UC letters, and already has learned 50-75% of the LC ones through playing with this puzzle. My only recommendation for improvement would be to reconstruct a couple of the lower case letters, such as \\"i\\" so you can easily see the dot above the short line, and to put a \\"tail\\" on the \\"q.\\" Overall, a terrific toy and one I would purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"The only real problem with this puzzle was the shape of the letters on it.

I do not recommend this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I started teaching my 3 1/2-year-old son the alphabet in April using Leapfrog products (DVD, CD w/ flashcards). He's been familiar with the letters and their sounds and I thought that it would be good to have this wooden puzzle too for him to get the 'feel' of the letters in preparation to writing them. Although he likes the puzzle, he gets confused with the pictures on the puzzle board (i.e., the letter shapes look cluttered). In HIS case, this puzzle would be perfect if instead of pictures, it's just a solid color for easier, straightforward letter identification. The Leapfrog products were very effective in teaching him the letters and their sounds. In our everyday life, I ask him what letter a particular thing begins with and he can tell me the correct letter (example: What letter does \\"paper\\" begin with? --- while I emphasize the beginning P sound)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Melissa & Doug puzzle","review":"I don't think this is a real Melissa & Doug product.

It is designed for 3 years and older so we had to watch him in the beginning because he wanted to put certain letters in his mouth such as the \\"C\\" like Cookie Monster on Sesame Street. Otherwise, great learning tool for him as he is forming words and sounding out letters. He hasn't even engaged with the pictures behind the letters yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a puzzle with both upper and lower case letters!","review":"This is a great puzzle. It has helped our 3 year old son begin learning his lower case letters. He knows the uppercase but now can see the difference on the same puzzle. He likes the puzzle so much we bought a second one for our niece."},{"rating":"1","title":"good yet disappointing","review":"I am a very big fan of Melissa and Doug puzzles and my daughter has about 8 of their puzzles. I bought this one for my almost 2 year old so she could learn her lowercase letters in addition to the uppercase. She quickly did that, and she enjoys the puzzle. This puzzle seems doesn't seem to be made with the same quality materials as the others. All of the wood is very thin, feels like plywood. Some of the letters don't fit very well or are so similar it's hard to tell what's what, like the d, b, p, and q. None of these 4 fit perfectly and we go off color to figure out which is which."},{"rating":"2","title":"capital and lower cases together is great","review":"had read that the letters fall out easily, but i didn't care. i wanted the combination of capital letters and lower case letters side by side.

The holes for the letters are very shallow, and they fall out if barely even bumped. And, the actual letters themselves aren't very defined, like the \\"m\\" and \\"w\\". Those two are tricky enough for a toddler, and this puzzle doesn't make it any easier.

I can't imagine why authors Maslowski and Winslow would go to such lengths to defame an American soldier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shewd smear of the Vietnam War soldier.","review":"Looking for a Hero is a cleverly written book that takes well researched information and twists it in such a way as to distort the historical facts and reality of the Vietnam War. The authors would like you to believe that the VC/NVA were the heros and the American soldiers were either fools, suckers, cowards, drunks or anything else but not courageous. I believe the book is nothing more than a slanderous smear of America and its soldiers. If you like read the book and see if you agree with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master Thesis or historical fact?","review":"I found this book short on Joe Hooper and long on an attempt at a historical critique of the politics of this country during the Vietnam war. The two authors obviously never served but more to the point, they continually drifted away from the man and bombarded the readers with their perception of the politics, personalities and philosophies of that time and place. I think the authors missed the barn by about 8 yards. Those of us who lived through the war, and most importantly, those days of the 60's, vividly remember the atmosphere that existed in this country. I wanted, no needed, to know better the man, Joe Hooper, not just that he had feet of clay but what he was about and why he like so many ohers of us, answered the call of the bugle. That would have been the real story. Instead, we were treated to the authors rather flawed analysis of the people and the reasons for that terrible and costly endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible bias cannot be compensated for by little research","review":"This incredibly biased account of a hero soldier and the Vietnam War is not worth the trip to the library, let alone the purchase price. Hooper is a hero without reservation. Simply rehashing a few facts, readily available in other books and from some few malcontent veterans, does not in any manner compensate for the innaccuracies presented in this political diatribe.

The frame and resultant bike is very light weight, the seat is very comfortable, and the whole thing comes together fairly easily. The wide tires make for sure handling on unpaved park paths, the brakes are shockingly (literally almost flung myself off the bike once or twice) good, and the handlebar/seat alignment make for comfortable upright riding. The box showed signs of the shipping company's rough handling, but nothing was damaged.I knocked off a star because it isn't exactly the smoothest shifting bike I've ever been on. I've fiddled with it quite a bit to try to resolve that, but it's still a bit of the twist, rattle noise while the chain fights for purchase, and then (usually) shifting.

The greatest positive of this bike is that it's attractive in a low-key fashion, however, even that positive was marred by scratches in the pearly-white finish of the fork crown and a blistereddecorative decal on the downtube, from friction from the brake handle during shipping, because of inadequate packaging. Another reviewer hasreported the same damage on the downtube of her women's version of theSierra Madre.I will add more detail to this review as I can make time available.

Bad form.To have the audacity to put words into an Apostle's mouth to convince readers of the preterist spin on Revelation is unacceptable, even for fiction.A historical novel trying to incorporate as much non-fiction as possible with invented characters or real figures like Nero is one thing. Inventing dialog and scenarios with an emperor is one thing. But taking a Biblical character, both a Prophet and Apostle, and inventing dialog with the sole intention of teaching a microminority personal opinion on the proper interpretation of John's Revelation is over the top.A series that should never have been written as long as non-fiction-John-in-novel-setting is solely a prop-puppet for preterist ventriloquism."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO A GOOGLE SEARCH FIRST","review":"Before you buy this book copy/paste the following phrase into a Google Search.\\"Hank Hanegraaff\\" financialAfter your Google Search, come back for the rest of my review.Now, as you have seen, Hank has had real problems with financial accountability.

How can a person represent himself as \\"THE BIBLE ANSWER MAN\\" who claims to be standing for truth and righteousness and yet behind the scenes has had real problems with financial accountability in his ministry? Even Christianity Today has reported on this.My advice? If you just cannot live without reading this book, buy a USED copy so the money goes to someone other than Hank."},{"rating":"1","title":"The preface sums up the book","review":"In the preface the author says that the book isn't meant to me a Grand Unified Theory of history. That it isn't, but I get the feeling that the first draft was meant to be and that the preface was subsequently written to state the obvious failure. The first three chapters are good. The rest is an arbitrariliy arranged collection of occasionally interesting facts mixed with poorly argued conclusions.

I'm glad I did. The star is clearly an up and comer, with swift and fast moves that clearly put him in the category of great action star. However, there are a lot of people that can do good action. The difference between a kung fu star and stuntman is the acting. While the star won't win any oscars, he clearly has the ability to act, and I expect some pretty big things from him in the future.As to the story, its rather basic. Kid needs money and gets involved in underground fighting. He wins, and keeps having to fight better opponents. What seperated this from most stories is the dysfunctional and symbiotic relationship he has with his \\"girlfriend.\\" While I won't ruin the story for those who haven't seen it, this portion of the story develops with some suprising twists that do not allow for a traditional ending to the story. I recomend it for kung fu fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"Ok so this is like porn. They get right down to business. Which is great and what I want when I want to watch fighting. The acting is terrible. There is some really bada*s fighting for sure... but the last 30-45 minutes of the movie has no fighting at all, just this retarded badly done emotional crap. I would have rated it better if there was fighting all the way until the end"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed-result Fighting Scenes + It's mainly a kung-fu drama + Stiff Acting of Main Female = Worth renting","review":"The fighting scenes are both very good and very bad. It's very good because Jacky Wu Jing is so skillful at martial art. It's very bad because his opponents are so incompetent. Consequently, when Wu Jing attacks or moves, it's gripping. When his opponents counter attack or block his moves, it looks so fake that all the excitement is gone. On the opposite, the fights between Wu Jing and Donnie Yen in SPL/Kill Zone are exciting and suspenseful. It's because both opponents possess equal skills.This is mainly a drama with a kung fu background. The plot is supposed to be touching but it does not move me. It's because the acting of the main female actress is so stiff.In short, it's worth renting but not buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Take You There","review":"I had never heard of this movie but it sounded interesting after reading the cover and I like Ally Sheedy.

All it takes is an adventurous spirit (a willingness to take the road to adventure), and a few belongings wrapped in a bandana and slung over your shoulder on a lovely piccolo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Audio Edition by Peter Thomas","review":"Since we listen to a lot of audio books in the car, I always am on the lookout for books both my 9-year-old and I might enjoy. \\"Dominic,\\" as read by Peter Thomas, definitely fits the bill.Nice length for us; I like stories that extend over a number of car rides, because we get to think back about what has happened up to that point in the story. Seems like an antidote to the parade of 21-minute Netflix cartoons (anything to salve a mother's conscience)!Peter Thomas captures the tone of the story with a wry sincerity. Both the language and the storyline aim high for children in a most loving way. Somehow I missed this book in my childhood; I am so glad to be able to enjoy it with my child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GIANT OF THUNDER MOUNTAIN","review":"This movie is AWSOME!!

Perhaps too much time has passed for such a retrospective. It lacks the necessary feel of the time - no sense of the excitement that existed with the Ranger teams of the early 70s. There are no new insights into either the players or the team as a whole. Seems that everyone was a \\"Great Guy\\" and a Great Teammate. I recall those years as the most exciting in Ranger history, but this book manages to make it all seem very uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"MONTE CARLO AS A REFUGE FOR WWII SPIES","review":"Monte Carlo is a beautiful backdrop for this intriguing spy story. Katrina Petrovna (Joan Collins) is a glamorous & famous cabaret singer who leads a double life. Harry Price (George Hamilton) is an American writer with a bad case of writer's block and is vacationing in Monte Carlo with Lauren Hutton. Also stars Malcolm McDowell as an Irish mercenary, Peter Vaughn as a German businessman and Gestapo spy and Lisa Elbacher as a rich young American.It is the beginning of World War II and the Nazis have set up headquarters in Monte Carlo. What the Nazis are looking for and what they find is the story and I don't want to spoil the movie. One of the characters is imprisioned by the Nazis for spying and the escape plan is done very well.This movie has no subtitles and is not closed captioned. My husband has severe hearing loss but could hear the movie very well. The diction is clear, the transfer is beautiful and we loved the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"Purchased Monte Carlo, as I remembered seeing the original on TV several years back. Still a fun mini series with a lot of glamour. Entertaining stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This film induces sleep.","review":"There's probably a good reason MONTE CARLO didn't have the success of SINS--it's not as good. Joan Collins looks lovely and her wardrobe is beautiful, but i found this to be a very boring film. Olive Films has also released SINS on dvd. I highly recommend SINS--it's a delicious escape--much better plot, better acting, better fashion, better location, more Stars. I grew up in the 80s, and i loved watching mini-series, but i never saw MONTE CARLO till now. It almost put me to sleep--the boring pace, bad acting. I felt this could have been condensed into one 2-hour film. SINS, on the other hand, is one of my favorite 80s miniseries, and i'm so happy it's finally been released on dvd here in the States. This is just my opinion, but if you're wondering which is better, i recommend SINS--it's juicy fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of Hammer","review":"Having just seen this for the first time I was surprised at just how good it was. Whether those involved realised that it would be the last ever Hammer film I don't know, but it seemed as though a bit more effort was made with this.Firstly this has an excellent cast and unlike the later Dracula films Christopher Lee has a proper role which makes good use of his screen presence and unique voice. Denholm Elliot is also very good and the rest of the cast do a fine job. In many ways TTDAD resembles 'The Devil Rides Out' because it is also based on a Dennis Wheatley story, but I think the overriding influence was probably Hammers attempt to cash in on the success of the Exorcist and The Omen.Apart from one scene, which is very unpleasant (although you actually see nothing) this is a restrained and subtle film compared with the extreme violence in some modern horror films. So overall an enjoyable film which was a fine swan song for Hammer."},{"rating":"2","title":"TO THE DEVILS A DAUGHTER","review":"Again Christopher Lee cast as the evil priest in this hammer production,the show was good but believe the plot could have been better.anyway with natassia kinski as the lovely devils concubine is worth watching without any comments,strongly believe if this movie was produce now it would be definetly better with the new movie technology .will give 4 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Child-rearing Satanic style","review":"Satanism is no laughing matter, and Christopher Lee makes that clear to us. This film centers around a young woman who, during her childhood, was subliminally brainwashed into Satanism. Salivate is my favorite verb when describing Christopher Lee. You will have more than enough reason to, in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil of a Family","review":"Nastassja Kinski, daughter of devillish Klaus Kinski, appears as Catherine; the virginal offering to Satan in this strange, and sometimes original film.One of the more interesting scenes involves a small baby being 'unborn' - that is, moving up into Nastassja Kinski's body.Christopher Lee plays the bad guy (typecasting or what?), with Richard Widmark trying to save young Catherine from a group of Satanists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This movie is a disappointing contribution to the horror genre. There are a lot of sylistic parallels to the exorcist but without the punch. It tries to move in the same quiet pace and with the same tension, but does not pull it off. There is a lot of filler and not enough plot devices to keep it moving. The acting is wooden given the realism this movie was aiming for. Hammer movies are much better off as pure vampire movies. Christopher Lee is not very convincing as a heretic priest."},{"rating":"1","title":"To The Devil A Daughter","review":"Widmark And Lee are great actors and have great performances,but the story of an Ex-Communicated Priest(A Heretic) and Nuns,and a mysterious Order in Bavaria do not make sense,they could have just done it to be a Cult,but sadly had to go it the other way.The movie is graphic but that is the least here,cheesy special effects and low grade scenes(even for a Hammer Film) make this a snoozer."},{"rating":"1","title":"marginal at best","review":"This is what I expected from these guys, luckily they are broken up.

What a disappointment. Having just completed reading an excellent book on the three sister ships, I found this doco quite dull, to the point of sending me off to sleep. David McCallum and other narrators speaking the parts of survivors were so monotone in their presentation as to make a fascinating historical tragedy quite bland.The overlapping of historical photographs with film I found annoying, and even though the interviews with people who remembered seeing the ships being built in Belfast was interesting, a lot more detail could have been given and more historical photographs shown as to their stages of construction.This documentary was historically correct, but presentation and narration left a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting......","review":"This video is great.

For a while during the Vietnam War, the city of Hue retained its sacrosanct hands-off status, but eventually got engulfed by the conflict. The ensemble, meanwhile, became cultural ambassadors -- a position they continue to fill. The striking thing about the repertoire is how closely it resembles classical Chinese and Japanese music, with koto-like lutes and languid vocals, rather than the quirky and hypnotic folk styles of various Vietnamese provinces.

It's absolutely hilarious, and it sets the tone for a great action movie with some classic Seagal arm-breaking and one-liners.Seagal plays a narcotics cop who retires only to end up with controversy anyway. He teams up with his old buddy from the Army to battle a particularly ruthless Jamaican drug lord and his posse. At first, the drug pushers are just a nuisance, but when they retaliate by gunning down Seagal's house, he decides to fight back.Things to watch for:-A guy who looks like a Manuel Noriega impersonator-A gorgeous stripper-Animal sacrifice-Gratuitous voodoo nudity-Screwface! One of the best bad guy names ever-Reggae Samurai!-Reggae Skydiving!-Steven Seagal running again!It's Steven Seagal without the message, without the moral, but with all the butt-kicking goodness. He's at his arm snapping best, and I guarantee you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Marks for 'Marked for Death'","review":"Despite a sense of uneasiness over its stereotyped, drug dealing Jamaican villains (check the careful disclaimer at the end), 'Marked for Death' scores as a strong, well-crafted action movie. Unlike most of his rivals, Seagal is a more than credible fighting force, lopping heads and snapping arms with conviction.The DVD boasts strong colours and sharp focus, though Fox seem to have stumbled a little over the aspect ratio. While the box claims 1.85:1, the picture is closer to 2.35:1, resulting in a slightly 'stretched' look (the actors appear to have undergone rapid weight gain in some shots). Maybe my eyes are deceiving me, but everyone looks slimmer in the accompanying trailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific Seagal plot-to-get-lost-in!","review":"Don't try too hard to figure this one out.

Her album Rarities, B-sides, and other stuff is a concrete example of her ability to weave her thoughts and feelings into her performance making it into what she wants us as listeners to hear. The three remixes at the end of the album provide an interesting new beat to familiar ballads and give the dance music more flow and cohesiveness to it. If you have heard Sarah on mainstream radio and want to get an album that shows her range I definately recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"Dear God is easily the most offensive song I have ever heard.

While I like the cd; I have to agree with Lake131 that the song does not belong on this cd. It is going against all religious beliefs. XTC may have written it, why, only they know. I tend to agree that it is merely a cop out, blame God for OUR problems, no way. We create our own problems, and God is there to protect us. Satan causes disease, and hunger, and strife, it is his way of turning us against God. You better believe in heaven and hell, saints and sinners and the devil as well. Pearly gates and thorny crowns....He is NOT letting us humans down, WE are letting HIM down. Face reality people.

AND WHAT A OTHER SIDE IT IS! I want MORE songs with the same emotional level, I want more screaming. And no matter what your religion is, the text is a good one, it flows well and it show many of the things people have against christians. But enough about that...On the disc is also an early version of what might be her best song \\"Full Of Grace\\", assorted covers and things. In all, it's worth getting if you like Sarah, and if you are more fanatic it's a must have beacause of \\"Dear God\\" and \\"Gloomy Sunday\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Far more than Good Enough","review":"If you listen to Sarah for her voice this is a must own cd.

The thing that really dissappointed me about this one was the horrid story. The idea of Supergirl coming to earth in pursuit of a magic Kryptonian device only to get in a ridiculous love triangle between a gardener and nutty witch is pretty dumb for a superhero film. While Supergirl does have some okay moments, the conjured up monsters and the sfx for them were blurry and difficult to understand. Also, the inclusion of Jimmy Olsen, while interesting, doesn't seem to fit in anywhere.Lucy Lane was a good idea though. Overall I was dissappointed by this movie, but the only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of Helen Slater's one of a kind portrayal of Supergirl. Watch it, but don't expect to see a super-movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Guilty Pleasure","review":"I hadn't seen the movie Supergirl in years, remembering it to be truly dumb, silly fun.

However, if there were a sequel, I can guarantee that the original wouldn't be as significant. Faye...excellent performance right off the heals (I believe) of Mommie Dearest, didn't need to step too far away from the Crawford character. Helen...decent work for the first time out.

Every thing about the Superman movies, that made you care, was lacking here. Its like they thought if they just slap the outfit on this girl it would hypnotize the masses and deliver a decent movie. Apparently this only worked for the weak minded. This movie totally sucked. It was stupid and not in a good way. I'm glad it was just borrowed from my neighbors. As soon as it was over I made the kids return it. I didn't want that piece of crap stinking up my house any longer than necessary.

I know that a lot of people don't like this movie and can point out how stupid it is, and I am not going to say anything to disagree with them, but at least at no point does this movie try to take itself seriously.

At that time, the original, unmastered version was the only thing available and it made it unenjoyable to watch. The story, to me, is OK.

I did expect a \\"superman\\" feeling to it, which wasn't there but the special effects and strong star cast made it all worth it. I did wonder why Supergirl received no special attention from the city or people around her. I give special effects and acting 4 stars. I give the plot 3 stars.

An attempt at starting a seperate franchise (Reeve was balking at doing any more Superman movies), it tried to duplicate the formula, but lacked the budget and writing of the first two Superman films. Still it is great fun. Faye Dunaway is hysterical as Supergirl\`s arch enemy. Helen Slater is bland as the girl of steel, but she is so darn cute that you don\`t really mind. The plot is corny, the acting strictly comic book, and the most amazing special effect is the way that, no matter in what position Supergirl is flying or landing (including upside down!) her tiny red skirt remains demurely in place. Not high art, but fun and no worse than Superman 3 or IV, to be sure. Definitely worth a look, as long as you accept it for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie that deserves all the credit it's due!","review":"I saw this movie on TV when i was a kid, and loved it.

And the lyrics are of the same dubious quality as the music (?):EG: \\"Why don't you get a gun and just shoot it thru my heart?\\" This CD is of interest mainly in hearing how low a rock icon can go when he should just fade away into retirement; and in the level of popular \\"culture\\" that has sunk to such a low, even for those who hoped in the post 9/11 era, things might improve.

All information is presented in easy-to-understand language that will help the viewer to retain what they've seen and share with others.I encourage anyone interested in this topic to contact Dr. Lile and get a copy for yourself, and get a second copy to share.

I rolled my eyes at the idea of talking unicorns and a whole unicorn culture. But I found myself intrigued enough to keep reading. The story is a bit predictable, full of angsty growing up scenes and angry teenager scenes, but there are enough twists and turns that I kept reading. The world is interesting. I was a bit bothered by unicorns being the only good creatures, all others are evil, but the author hints that it is the limited view of one tribe of unicorns that are bigoted. Jan learns that not everything he has been taught is true. Renegade unicorns aren't the evil his tribe believes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aljan Lover","review":"I first read this book when I was 11 or 12. I have been absolutely insane about it ever since.

A few reasons stand out as to why. The acting was often stiff and almost always self-conscious. Tobias Motyka was the worst main actor in this regard (I say 'main actor' because the real estate agent takes the cake for worst actor, maybe ever). I found Matthew Faulisi to offer the most-credible performance in this film and quite enjoyed his take on the character, overall. The editing was abrupt and, at times, this further aggravated the choppiness of the script. The dialogue seemed unnatural for three twenty-somethings from Philly. Also, the actors sounded like they were from upstate New York, not Philly. To be fair, however, having lived in both places, that probably bothered me more than it would someone who hasn't lived either place."},{"rating":"1","title":"review","review":"this movie was ok it wasnt the kind of movie I thought it would b it just wasnt haunted enough or even scary. kind of a lame movie actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Sentence Combining -- a history of our profession","review":"I really feel that Bill Strong has reached a point in the profession where he has integrated his first love and success - - syntactic fluency and control - - with a sense of how that all fits into what he now realizes (perhaps he did before, too) is a bigger picture.

Amazon was excellent in replacing it immediately; however, the replacement worked for approximately two months. It also just stopped working. Amazon wouldn't replace it a second time and actually sent me an e-mail saying they are experiencing too many problems with this humidifier. Honeywell replaced it for me; I can't say how well the 3rd one works as I haven't used it yet since the winter months are over. I love this humidifier when it works; but unfortunately, that only happens for a very short period of time from my experience. There is some inherent problem with this product; although I asked Honeywell about their experience with returns and what kind of problem it has, I never did get an answer. I would love to recommend this product, but I can't as there is no longevity to it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"It looks like I can't give zero stars, so I guess I have to give 1. It has a built-in hygrometer that shuts it off once the desired humidity level has been reached. However, since the built-in hygrometer always thinks the room's humidity level is over 70%, and it is not willing to humidify beyond 65%, the machine never actually puts water in the air. It's kind of like if the heater in your house always thought the temperature were 90 degrees and thus never turned on.In the package is one of those \\"stop\\" tags that says that rather than returning it, you should call their 1-800 number and allow them to help you. They were polite, but had no suggestions. Thus I have returned it.

The noise bothers the wife but not so much as for myself. After two months of steady use the unit suddenly stopped running.

Cleaning required vinegar and a good soaking, but you can \\"fool\\" the unit into thinking you've cleaned by removing the digital control portion and replacing it. I found that I can rinse and reuse the mineral pads once and then they need replacing. After having a tough time finding them, I realized Home Depot stocks them. I've had the first unit for 2 years and the second for a year and they both started leaking within a few weeks of each other, resulting in soaked wet carpeting. I had to replace the one in my son's room with a cool mist as I was concerned about him getting burned. I'm not sure why they started leaking or if anyone has suggestions as to a fix.

For the size of the unit I had hoped the tank would last for several nights. A full tank in the same 10 x 12 room does not last 8 hours.2. When looking at the photo of the unit the rounded white handle topping the blue water tank is what you must attempt to set the tank on while filling. Very annoying and unstable. You MUST hold the tank steady while filling.3. The opening lid opposite the handle must be tightened VERY tight or it will leak. This takes quite a bit of hand strength. The knurls on the side of the lid are not sufficient to tighten the lid. You must put your fingers in the provided holes.4. Either the display is incorrect/broken or the unit cannot create 55% humidity in a 10 ft x 12 foot room. The highest humidity the display read was 22%.5. This is NOT a 4 gallon tank.

The fact that it failed after only one week is reason to be concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke, but after almost 4 years","review":"I really loved this humidifier, and Amazon isn't selling it anymore so I guess this review doesn't matter.

Unfortunately, due to an apparent inherent design defect, the digital readout (hygrometer), will not display the accurate room humidity. Regardless of the setting, the reading constantly defaults to 20%. As a result, the unit never shuts off. and has a tendency to overheat. I tried two units and both suffered from the same defect. I contacted the Customer service department at Kaz, Inc (Honeywell), which was a wasted phone call. Thanks to Amazon's \\"customer friendly\\" return policy, both units have been returned. I've been pleased with Honeywell products in the past, but they shot themselves in the foot with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell HWM450 Warm Moisturizer Humidifier","review":"The Honeywell Humidifier works well. Setting the percentage of humidity, fan speed, and hours of operation is easy. It produces a pleasant and noticeable amount of moisture in the air. One drawback is the accumulation of mineral deposits. The heating element must be cleaned often and the filter pad must be replaced routinely. Otherwise, a hard calcium-like deposit builds on the plate and is extremely difficult to remove. Overall, however, the unit is quite satisfactory and uses the water in the tank rapidly if the humidity level is set high.

It has been easy to clean and use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall great output and performance","review":"I purchased this humidifier after wasting tons of money on a humidifier that required filter replacement. This one works great! The humidity output is quite substantial though it does require me to fill the water tank 1-2 per day. As it says in the description it sends out up to 4 gallons of water, would have been nice to produce this model with larger than a 1 gallon tank.It does state that the humidifier is good for up to 1200 sq feet, I don't thinks that's accurate. But it won't prevent me from buying another one for the upper floor of my home.Overall, really impressed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I love just about everything about this humidifier. Works well, runs quietly, and is easy to use. The only thing I dislike is the water tank. It can not be stood up on end while filling and the cap is difficult to secure. But all in all a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off looking for something else","review":"Even when this humidifier works it is mediocre. The whole thing seems to be designed pretty poorly. Filling it with water requires holding the reservoir upside down because it doesn't stand on its own. The whole humidifier must be perfectly level or slightly slanted forward or it won't operate correctly. If it is not perfectly level or slanted forward the heating element won't get enough water and shut off automatically. This was a very poor design since I use it in a room with carpet and with the reservoir on the back all the weight is on the back of the unit. When this humidifier is running it can get pretty loud due to the heating element inside basically boiling the water. It sounds like you're sleeping next to a pot of boiling water. It would also be nice if you could turn off the heat function too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Stars Would be More Honest","review":"I was desperate for a warm moisture humidifier and, despite the bad reviews, went ahead and bought this one. What a mistake. After working fine for a couple of weeks, the contacts became sensitive, and I had to play with it a bit to get it to work. That worked fine for another couple of weeks. Then it exploded all over my wooden floors.

My first one was the honeywell HWM225 but it died after two years. The heating element is not good, too much mineral deposit, rusted. I bought the Bionair BWM2600, look good but the control is so pathetic and simple. The worse part is the noise of the boiling, so loud no body can fall into sleep. So decided to get the Honeywell HWM450 because someone mentioned it operates quietly and I some what agree.Pros:- relatively quiet.- small foot print- many control options: timer, auto shutoff....- easy to refill- included 4 mineral absorbing pads- 3 years warrantyCons:- Reset to default once you power off.

I thought, I'll just set it to a particular humidity and it will turn on/off as needed to maintain the desired humidity in the room. Big mistake. To think that a $50 humidifier would have a humidistat of any accuracy I suppose was a fault of my own. I have a precision hygrometer hung on the wall in my bedroom which normally registers relative humidity by up to 20-30% higher than what this humidifier registers. The unit's readout of current humidity will jump from 20% to 46% in no time. Highly inaccurate.If you are purchasing this solely as a humidifier, then know that it's quiet and reliable. However, its humidistat function is pure non sense. Doesn't work, highly inaccurate to a point of being pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died quickly","review":"While it worked, it worked well.

I read reviews til my head hurt and thought this was going to work out in my large living room or large bedroom. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the humidity up over 20%. Also, I had a hard time getting the thing going. It would go on, great, awesome, and stop. I took it apart a few times and finally got it going.

Anyway, I'm returning it and will probably go back to good old fashioned vaporizers (which is what I was replacing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works well","review":"This humidifier is quiet and works very fast. I am happy with it.

The tank is easier to fill and carry than past ones that I've had. And cleaning this one, although still a chore, is actually not too bad, and I especially like that it just calls for bleach and vinegar to clean it, which are normal household products I have on hand. On the downside, the product description didn't list this model as having a filter that you need to replace every couple months -- the filter is a mineral filtration pad that lays on top of the heating element, I still need to find where I can buy replacements. And I had hoped the larger capacity tank would mean filling it less often, but I find I'm filling it about 2-3 times per day. The last model I had was a cool mist one and it made a mess all around it. This one makes no mess and is easy to operate and clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good purchase","review":"I researched humidifiers, and read the other reviews of lots of products, but ultimately decided on this one. I think the other comments made here are spot on! The cleaning instructions do leave a bit to be desired - they appear to be copied from other models of this same brand, so they are a bit lacking. Also, my two cents would be that if you know you have hard water, make sure you clean this once a week, diligently - or you will have HORRIBLE mineral deposits that are very tough to get off. CLR did work, but it was a big job that required tools and muscle as well. Won't do that again!

I don't know if what I experience is normal or not but I'm not thrilled with the amount of time it takes for the filter that sits on top of the atomizing (heating) element to get filled with particulates. I can't find the filters in any store. I then have to pay (always) exorbitant shipping to get something that weighs mere ounces.The refill switch stopped working after 6 months of use. You then have to disconnect the thing from the wall and start over. No big deal really.Now for the reason behind the ** rating. This thing can run constantly at full bore, and I can't get better than 35% humidity local to the sensor. The room humidity has to be lower.

It has a shut off by setting humidity level and a shut off by count down timer. After a few weeks of use, the unit started leaking and you can't even tell where the leak is coming from. The pads do not prevent mineral build up on the hot plate. I am getting brownish deposits which I believe to be rust. The only way to remove it, is with white vinegar and old toothbrush which I had to bend into an \\"L\\" shape in order to get at and clean the stainless steel hotplate which boils the water.

The **exact** same thing happened with the previous three humidifiers. So, if you can live with the thing working for only two years, this is a great unit for the price.

Sadly, my husband (who is the most laid back human you will ever meet) decided to have it out with humidifier after spending 30 minutes cleaning - only to have it refuse to get back to work.

This thing is a lemon of the first degree. Then when I called technical support (less than one month after purchase) the folks at the number in the manual told me to call Honeywell. The Honeywell people told me to call the other folks. Neither group wants to claim responsibility for functionality of the unit, but both want to sell it.

I mean, what kind of engineer would specify steel screws in a humidifier? Maybe some cheapskate on the manufacturing line switched to steel screws, who knows? It's a terrible decision as a humidifier is a worst case situation for steel (duh!). I'm very disappointed. You do need to follow the advice of others for care and cleaning. There is a lot of excess water and the filters can get pretty gross, as would be expected in a humidifier. I gave up because of the rust stains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even at $23.15, this was a waste of money.","review":"I bought this humidifier because it was on sale for a bargain price of $23.15, or so I thought. The first problem was that it was very difficult to clean the scales off of the heating element, and the cleaning instructions were anything but informative. The second--and fatal--problem was the handle of the water tank. Less than 4 months after I purchased the humidifier, I was carrying a full tank of water back to my room when the handle broke off, sending the tank plummeting to the floor where it broke and flooded the carpet. If not for that fatal problem, I would have probably rated this item 3 or 4 stars, since it did do a decent job of humidifying my room.

For service, I not only have to pay to ship it back to Kaz, but for their \\"handling, packaging, and return shipping.\\" Even if they ship me a new unit as a replacement, I'm disappointed to pay nearly 50% of the original purchase price for Kaz to fix their defective product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a whole day of use!","review":"I love the comfort of warm moisture humidifiers, but I needed one with a large capacity to cover my living room.

It's huge, quiet, and has easy to use controls. Unfortunately, my excitement didn't last long... after having the unit on for most of the day, it shut itself off and wouldn't turn back on. The helpline suggested there's some kind of internal circuit breaker that can trip on the unit, and to resolve it, leave the unit off for an hour and try to turn it back on. That worked... for about 2 minutes. It shut itself off again. Very sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portable humidier","review":"I've had this humidifier for one month now. I've found it to be well-designed and well-manufactured. It is easy to set up and operate.This unit will deliver a lot of humidity in a hurry. We use kerosene room heaters to supplement our central heating, so room air gets very dry. Within a short time, this humidifier makes it much more comfortable, and the automatic feature lets it cycle on and off as needed to maintain my desired percent humidity. Unlike some cool-type humidifiers we have had in the past, this one does not make the air feel cold.We have moderately-hard well water, and this unit does require some preventative maintenance weekly, but so far I see no mineral buildup and the unit functions well. The maintenance is not onerous, and to do everything that the instructions say takes about 30 minutes, although much of that time is merely letting things soak with vinegar.I'd recommend this unit for anyone looking for a humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return twice","review":"While this is a good looking product I had to return it twice because of faulty parts.

The tank is easy to fill and I really like its operation. I'm comfortable with the humidity at 35%, but you can set it as high as 55%. When you first start the machine, you have to set the desired humidity since there's no memory function; but, once set, it works really well. The unit will typically run until the ambient humidity is +- 2% from the desired setting and then shut off. I haven't been able to find Honeywell replacement mineral pads; but there are similar pads available on Ebay. I don't mind the slight \\"gurgling\\" sound at all. The switches are a little flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for high output","review":"I actually bought this product to provide moist warmth for my office on chilly days. An electric heater warms better of course but really dries out the air and gets uncomfortable very quickly for me. I guess living in Houston has me used to humidity. This product does a great job. Produces a lot of steam quickly and continuously. I've only had it for a few days so cannot comment on its reliability but it seems to be a quality product and will be easy to maintain. It is a bit on the larger side which is good because it holds a lot of water but if you are looking for something small this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Week Lifespan","review":"I've read so many reviews that said this unit died after 2 weeks - here's another one. It worked great until one day I went to turn it on... no light, no sound...dead as a doornail. Honeywell wants me to return it to them, then they'd send me a new one, but like others I don't have the original box nor do I feel like spending more money for shipping the dead thing back. Very dissapointed, and wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased it. Save your money & don't buy this humidifier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell HWM450","review":"This is a good, easy to use humidifier. It does make some noises that take getting used to while trying to fall asleep but has three different settings that can quiet it down. It also has a timer to turn it off after 1hr to 18hrs (increments by 1hr). I also got mineral absorption pads (HMP-12P) with the humidifier. I have hard water and need to clean the humidifier and change the pad less than every 2 weeks. It has a LCD display that constantly shows the relative humidity. It can be set to turn off between 25% and 65% humidity (increments of 1%). Easy to set up, easy to maintain, digital buttons make it easy to control. Great Product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 2 weeks then totally dead.","review":"The unit worked fine for about 2 weeks. Then it quit and is not even turning on. Blew a thermal fuse that is not available in the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"major letdown","review":"The first week or so that I used this humidifier it worked fine. After that it gradually performed less and less until finally I just stopped using it. Even though steam would come out, it never reached the maximum humidity output it soared to the first time I turned it on. And after awhile it began turning on and off even when it was totally dry in the room. This is my second bad humidifier experience. I should have returned it to the manufacturer but I just chunked it. I too am looking for a reliable model, price is practically not an issue. I hate dry skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humidifier","review":"The humidifier put out a nice warm mist. It is good for a small room. I had to clean it weekly due to mineral build up. I think it helped a lot this past winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky and dangerous","review":"I had to toss it because more water would dribble out of the base than would end up in the air, and I had to either choose between soaking wet floors or electrocution if I put the humidifier in a container to keep the liquid off the carpet. Based on the other reviews I guess I just had bad luck, but with other humidifiers I've owned before this I've never had such a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I don't even want to give one star to this product but have no choice. If you really like this product, remember don't let water runs out because most likely it will fall asleep forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure it's a nice humidifier...","review":"I never got a chance to test this unit out since the one I received was, unbelievably, used. Used as in there were the immediately noticable water spots on the tank, used as in mold/mildew on the bottom of the unit.So this review is more directed at Amazon's service than the unit itself. I'm writing this review as somewhat of a warning as to purchasing products from Amazon's \\"Kitchen\\" department. I also ordered a coffee maker from them that was used as well (including used grinds in the brew thing).Personally, I'll stick with books, dvds and the like and use an alternative method to purchase these types of items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking ConEd bill","review":"The humidifier seems to work fine and did not have any spillage or odour. It has a humidity level control and a indicator but the user control is confusing.The controls should be simple considering its a simple humidifier.I could live with the controls as I got used to it but could not get used to the enormous electricity bill! You definitely need to think twice before buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I would have used a stronger word in my title, however, I am sure that they would not allow it to be posted. I should have read all the reviews before I bought the humidifier. The first time out of the box the unit boiled over causing major damage to the dresser it was on. I tried it 3 more times changing the location of the mineral pad (thought it was user error; I should not doubt my self so quickly) and then without it. All three times had the same effect, thank god that I had it on the tile floors for those times... I cannot believe that with all the people having the same problem that this item is still being sold!!! WHATEVER YOU DO AVOID THIS HUMIDIFIER UNLESS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PROBLEMS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"I normally don't write reviews, but this product was so bad, I felt I had to warm other potential buyers. I threw it away after about 4 weeks, because I unfortunatley did not keep the box to return it, and I couldn't stand it in my house any more, it was such a ridiculous design. The power did not work well, kept switching on and off, there was immediately green mold that collected in the bottom of the tank .The design was terrible , so in order to refill the tank , you first had to take it out of the humidifier, which had no way to stop the water , so it dripped all over the place and then you had to hold the tank upside down , with no handle to try and fill it up, and then , yep, turned right side up again to put it back into the humidifier it drips all over you , the floor etc. combine that with the green gunk and I am not a happy customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"it melted !!!","review":"Yes, the place from where steam comes out, has started melting/shrinking!!!

After about a month of constant use on a daily basis, I am very pleased with the performance. Unlike others, I have had no leaking issues. Most humidifiers are not easy to fill and this is no different. Most humidiers are not quiet and this one is no different. However, what is different is how quick it starts up and adds moisture to your room or household and the amount of moisture it puts out. Additionally, I found the humidity gauge to be very accurate. I have purchased other humidiers in the past that have since failed or are to hard to keep clean due to hardwater deposits, but I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Leaks Big Time","review":"This would be a great 5 star humidifier if it did not leak. Plentiful features and fast heating of water.I have had the humidifier for about a year. It worked fine for a few months, then began to leak. It is hard to get the cap on and off and now the cap is starting to crack in several places, I assume due to the heat. I recommend that you do not buy this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product, deosn't last with hard water","review":"I have read the long reviews by many of the customers and bought two (yes I did not learn from the first failure) of these. The first did not last a season, the second lasted less than one year. The warranty is three years, but by the time you pay to ship it both ways, you may as well buy another. Many of the reviews mention it needs to be cleaned constantly, and maybe I was not diligent enough. Anyway, I had a cheaper vicks unit for years before these two, which may not have been as fancy but sure lasted longer. We have very hard water which may have contributed. Note, those disks you need are not always at your local dealer (although always on Amazon!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I have been using this product for 2 weeks now. It does what it says. I placed this humidifier in between 2 rooms and it does a good job. My only complaint is filling up the water in the tank - it is difficult since it does not have handle on the bottom to hold the tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....","review":"We purchased this December 3, 2007 and today is February 16, 2008 and it is broken. Mind you, we used the mineral pads, did the cleaning, our heating element is still shiny and we used it only at night while we were home. We cleaned it today, plugged it in... no steam. Broke. It would cost us more to send it back than we paid for it, so now we're stuck.It worked great while we had it, all of 2.5 months or so. So if you feel like spending $45-$68 [depending on the current amazon price at your time of purchase] on a humidifier that works for 2.5 months with normal cleaning and use, go ahead. But we are disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"the thing leaks!","review":"I was unhappy with this humidifier. Within two weeks of having it, it began to leak and ruined my hardwood floors. I am planning to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DONT BUY THIS","review":"In my search for a good warm moisture humidifier, I bought this cause it has high review. But after I got it. it is very sad piece of machine for the price. It activates when you put the tank in, and the nodes on the upper side has to touch to conduct and tells the machine is ok to activate. well..... if you are on an uneven space, this mechenism will not work. Worse, (for some reason), the bottom regulator (a nob) (that controls when water needs to go to the heating plate) got stuck many times so I got soaked carpets..... i am an engineer (though software), i had to give up on this dude..... anyway, its my 2 cents. overall, the value and quality does not match. and worse of all, it did not work for me. Best !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit Failed after 6 Weeks","review":"After six weeks my unit started continuously shutting off. The manual says this can happen if the unit is not cleaned. However, I did clean the unit and replaced the filter with no success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Reservoir","review":"Had the unit for a couple months. It had trouble maintaining desired humidity of a small bedroom with the door closed. Overall, a decent unit but not spectacular. Needed cleaning every couple days, but my water is definitely hard -- so it was to be expected.However, after a couple months, I was filling the reservoir and the handle broke off. The reservoir instantly shattered after an 8 inch fall to the side of the bathtub. The handle it turns out uses very poor glue. I had two hands on the reservoir, and was rotating it back to upright position after screwing the cap back on. I would estimate probably maximum 10 pounds of pressure.I would not recommend this unit even if the reservoir hadn't broken. The parts/pads are a pain to get, support is non-existent, humidifier performance/features is nothing to get horny about, and the Kaz company might as well not exist. Honeywell is a name only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honeywell Misses Badly","review":"After producing an excellent cool mist unit that has served us well for years, Honeywell has seriously missed the mark with the Warm Moisture HWM450.Pros: heats quickly and emits warm vapor quicklyCons: Let me count the ways:1. Noisy and gurgly, especially on \\"high\\"2. Very fragile switches; returned one to Amazon when it broke, but the replacement has done the same thing within a week3. Will not sit flat in a sink or tub for filling -- poor design4. Plastic water container is quite thin and fragile; we cracked the first one just handling it in the sink, trying to fill it.5. Even though we tried filling it with filtered water, the heating plate and mineral pads solidified quickly.6. \\"Humidistat\\" on the first unit we received NEVER worked; the second one works in unpredictable fashion.7. Lid to water tank extremely tricky to thread on to the container -- often takes five or six tries!Advice: forego the warm mist and get the Honeywell Cool Mist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...until it fails","review":"I did my research, but didn't listen to all the comments of the machine just quitting without warning. It was a good machine for about six weeks, although you do have to keep it clean. But one night it just quit. I know I should of listened to the warning of others and kept the box, but I didn't. I definitely recomment that you do not purchase this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Detail! About time!","review":"The only thing that would improve this book would be to make it bigger!

Some good basic piping tips but not as informative as I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Abstract","review":"The book starts off strong with a thorough review of Euclid's constructions complete with explanations of the constructions themselves. Things go down rapidly from there.Most of the remainder of the book is a very abstract discussion of constructability under various conditions. After the first chapter there are very few concrete constructions performed.If you're looking for a discussion of the theoretical basis of geometric constructions under a variety of conditions this book is an excellent resource. If you're looking for practical, step-by-step constructions that go beyond Euclid you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gower","review":"Don't be fooled by gower's reputation as a stern moralist, the Confessio is an entertaining collection of mini tales (exempla) told to illuminate the seven deadly sins.

The nutritional advice is fairly sound, and the book does give you some creative ways to exercise without any expensive equipment or a gym, but let's get real.

The editor must have slept on the job as well.The whole book tastes like sand, but there are occassional insights that can help recover the cost of it, and that's where the 2 stars come from.Another bigger complaint against this title is that it doesn't show you how to build a real world application; just snippets of code here and there, with no clue at all about how to piece them together.It seems that Dino is far more keen on impressing his readers than delivery of value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book based on the rave reviews it has gotten, but have been grossly let down.

For an inexpensive net it does the job. I was able to set it up alone. I was able to hit my long woods at about six feet away. Whether using this one or another net, I recommend it. I am able to hit balls every night after work and then solidify my shots with a bucket of balls.

After about the 6th hit or so with my irons the net successfully rebounded the ball back, I looked down at the ball, looked back up at the net to be disappointed with the sight at hand, the plastic pole was literally snapped in half.

The net becomes like a tennis raquet and if you try to drive the ball into it it flys back at you at extreme speed and you end up with a black eye and near broken nose like I did, even while standing back the recommended 10-12 ft.

It's well worth considering as an investor if you're willing to invest a little time.

Also, I didn't think the repertoire was that good.I would like to say something in Sallys' defense, that being Sally is a great pianist, probably one of the best in the U.S.A. The problem comes with every great performer about when to shine, and when to hold back. I believe on the songs played on this cd Sally should have held back a little.It also appears that the piano Sally used, needed some repairs.

Cohen brothers are famous for intriguing and intellectual humor, whose bits i couldn't see here..Cohens' characters and stories are usually built-up, bizzare ones, but one usually soon admits the characters and the story to be consistent in itself, there are many subtleties. However R.A. characters are so raw, they lack depth, they do not blend.Scripting, directing, cinematography, acting, all are 3rd class. Is it a college graduation project? I wonder if Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter ever want to rememeber acting in this. I know why directors' comments are missing in the DVD. It's because they don't even want to comment on it.Narration is of the too-ordinary Hollywood style, these guys were independent filmmakers weren't they?I felt forced to laugh, but couldn't succeed on a single scene..Buying this DVD is money wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie!","review":"Raising Arizona was my first introduction to Nicholas Cage and I've been a fan of his ever since.

A strange priest also wanders around babbling about some evil that is present and says he is preparing to stop it. Eventually all of the above come to a head at the same time and place. The first half hour is slick and sometimes eerie due to good photography and strong settings. The film then begins to unravel into a very predictable film that revolves around sexual obsessions more than anything else.

Of the 5 or 6 greatest operas ever written (all Mozart's, in my opinion), some say Don Giovanni stands out as the most perfect achievement. Whatever your opinion may be, by getting this video you will be getting the very finest rendition of this masterwork I have ever seen. It is sung in the original Italian, with English subtitles.

It's top notch and breathtaking to look at, particularly the use of lighting effects, but that's all this film has going for it. This is an unbearably dull piece of film making. I saw it recently in a theater, and the soundtrack was nearly drowned out by the audience's groans of boredom. The use of \\"Little Red Riding Hood,\\" which so many reviewers have praised, is simply obnoxious. A small child can easily figure out this connection in the first act, but the film makers, not trusting the audience's intellegence, deems it neccesary to hammer this point into our skulls time and time again. The end result is a flat, emotionally lifeless waste of celluloid. If you want emotion in your anime, pick up \\"Cowboy Bebop\\" or \\"Grave of the Fireflies.\\" Just stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, But not for all.","review":"I initially bought the special edition of this movie because of a favorable opinion from a close friend of mine. It was visually stunning and very good storyline. I would say that this piece of work would be best suited for those who like movies such as Akira and Princess Mononoke. Movies that have more storyline than action to them.I enjoyed this movie, but if you are looking for anime that is all shoot 'em up then this isn't really the movie for you. It foucuses more on characters and the relationship they develop but still gives you several fight sequences that are really well designed.Rent it first to see if you would like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent film","review":"Jin-Roh is truly great anime. Despite the length of the film & depth of the plot, I had no trouble negotiating the story at all.

My cousin gave up watching after about five minutes, citing there was no action and the plot was boring.I have a lot of patience but even I gave up after a while. Jin-Roh was absolutely disapointing.

Yes these characters are the tired staples of Japanese anime convention that I personally have seen enough of (this is to say nothing of the supporting cast). The entire film revolves around a ponderous analogue to the story of little red riding hood: offering nothing more than a superficial gloss on a tired and witheringly mundane story. The animation is excellent and I get the feeling this would have made a far more effective short. It may not sound like it but I do consider myself a fan of anime, however this film shows very little of what the genre has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT,STUPENDOUS,OUTSTANDING film","review":"If you like good anime, if you like good movies that can grab you in the gut, get this film. This is the best drama that I have seen in a long while. The animation is simply stunning and the story blew me away.

I can't wait to see the next Okiura film."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best motion picture I've ever seen","review":"This movie is one of the best drama's I've ever seen with a twist that will most likely blow you away. Japanese Voice acting is amazing here and really brings the characters to life with emotion that you can feel and at times relate to, and though the story isn't technically complex, it's a bit hard to wrap your head around once it comes to a climax.

I truly wanted to like this movie once I heard that it was written by the director of Ghost In The Shell, one of my favorite animes.The opening sequences of Jin-Roh kept me interested in how Fuse, the protagonist, might come to terms with his involvement in the death of a young girl. But the as the plot starts unfolding, it just ends up being a convoluted mess. I couldn't empathize with any of the main characters, who were either frustratingly non-communicative or just spoke in metaphors to explain themselves.Kudos for art direction and excellent voice acting, but story is dissapointingly weak which ruined it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great anime for more complex minds.","review":"First off it you don't like animes where you have to think and pay attention then look elsewhere, but if you like animes with beautiful animation and a complex gripping storyline then this is a must buy. It wouldn't surprise me if the people who rated it one star are like 12 and consider Dragonball Z their favorite anime. This isn't the equivalent to an action movie, anime style, if that's what your looking for then Vampire Hunter D is the movie for you. You might want to rent it first if it sounds like something your interested in because the special edition version is a must buy if you like it. It's 20 bucks extra for a cool subtitled director's commentary, the soundtrack with twenty-two songs on it, a bunch of art, and a bunch of different trailers for it, it's definitely worth it to me but some of you might just be interested in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUD","review":"with as much hype going for this film, I was excited...andAkira is one of my ALL time favorite movies, I have to say though, the animation is Top Notch in this film!!!!

It starts out with a nice action sequence with cops futilly trying to capture a terrorist.

My friend and I can't quite remember what happened after that because we started talking about how cool this anime could've been.The biggest gripe with the film is that you just know that it's leading up to something great and just kinda fizzles out.

For example, instead of slowly teaching you how to find integrals, he gives three (three!) \\"easy\\" examples before he adds on sine functions and the like.Look at other calculus books before you buy this one.

I'm confused - the \\"Girl From Ipanema\\" song I have heard over the years on the radio is different from the version on this CD. I'm not sure, but this CD sounds like one of those \\"updated\\" CD's where they take the original music and put a new musical arrangement around it. This CD does not have the same relaxed, aloof feel of other Bossanova music I have listened to. Check out the Gilberto and Wanderley CD. If you are a Bossanova or Gilberto fan, I would recommend this one, it is excellent. It is a collaboration between Astrud Gilberto and Walter Wanderley that was released @ 1966."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Not Astrud's Best Hour\\"","review":"I dearly love Astrud Gilberto. Have almost everything she's ever hadrecorded. This particular recording has been issued, re-issued underabout 20 different versions of cd covers, faces, titles, etc. They allhave Astrud Gilberto listed on the front, but not always the same photoor caption. Same songs on every cd and same versions. For me, the ONLYkeeper on this is the gorgeous rendition of \\"Far Away\\" with Astrud andthe late, great Chet Baker in a vocal duet. I only wish the whole cdwas up to this standard, but alas, it is not. Those looking for theoriginal \\"Girl From Ipanema\\" version w/Stan Getz or ANY of Astrud'sother beautiful Verve songs need to stay away from this low point inher recording career. I don't blame Astrud on this project, and willforgive her. She obviously had bad advice and/or management with this.5 stars for \\"Far Away\\" and 2 stars for the rest of the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!!","review":"I've always liked this album. I've not listened that much to Ms Gilberto but I like her voice a lot, even though she sounds a bit distracted at times.

In here you'll find people like George Young, Eddie Daniels, Will Lee, Allan Schwartzberg, Warren Bernhardt, Jeff Mironov etc. I don't remember the others offhand.

Fortunately, I found the correct recording on the \\"Getz/Gilberto\\" CD, which is absolutely an incredible listening experience.

I watched it with my husband and son (we are all Christians) and found this film very disappointing. I believe the film makers missed a good opportunity here. Jesus was hardly mentioned and the focus was totally on Saturn. This could have been a very realistic view of Revelation but in the end I believe it had missed the most important point of all. Yes, Jesus will return truimphant one day when every eye will see Him."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly put together","review":"I didn't get past the first twenty minutes of the film. For some reason, they decided to focus on the bad guy instead of the good guy - a huge mistake. Without a protagonist to focus on, I got impatient waiting for the real movie to start, to get away from this nasty guy, but that never happens. It is all about him. The so-called good guy takes a backseat, while we get to watch the anti-Christ working his evil. The scenes are choppy, losely strung together - no unity or coherence at all. They look deceptively professional, as far as the picture quality goes, and the acting is professional. Maybe the rest of the movie gets better, but in my opinion, if they can't get it right in the first twenty minutes, the movie just isn't worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Store!","review":"great movie, everyone should watch it.

It portray Christianity as cartoonish. This is a definite b movie that is only made worse by the religous connotation. It's one thing to make a b movie; it's another to make a b religious movie. Not a good idea.Poor acting. Mediocre effects. I'm reminded of The Last Star Fighter except that was good... cause it was from the 80's and you were expected to have crappy effects.As always, these \\"End of the World\\" movies are anticlimactic. Big battle, bright light, badguys: \\"Oh, it's Jesus; let's give up.\\" Sorry, but I'll be kinda disappointed if that's truly how it is.

The special effects are better, the acting is improved, and the production values are obviously improved.Why only 2 stars? Simply put: what in the world is the movie about? If the producers feel that they are being faithful to Scripture, then they need help, badly. This movie's plotline wanders pretty far afield from anything I have ever read in the Bible, no matter how many drinks I have had beforehand. On the other hand, it suspiciously resembles any number of Tom Clancy (who, as far as I know, is in neither the Old or New Testaments) thrillers.Not as agonizingly awful as its predecessor, this movie nonetheless is in dire need of improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty cool","review":"this was a really cool movie though it left out mny important key signs that are in the bible the beast is supposed to suffer a mortal head wound then come back to life and the origens of the beast were way off base and the three opposing kingdom join the one world thing and then betray the beast only to be killed before the midway point and where on earth was the rapture of the Church and the signing of the seven year treaty two important signs of the times and they also left out the mark of the beliver and the mark of the beast! other than these and other errors it was a great movie if you want to see or read a drama about the end of times read or watch Left Behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Satan, too little Christ","review":"This movie spends far too much time dwelling on Satan and sets up an incredibly lame confrontation with the United States. There is also a weak effort at romantic interest.

This movie claims to be based on the biblical writings of the end times. Makes me wonder if the writers and the producers have actually ever read the Bible. Never even mentions the name Jesus. Please, if you know the Truth, or have any desire to, DO NOT watch this video, or it's predecessor, The Omega Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logan Should Have Run...","review":"...from this movie after reading the unconvincing script. Michael York must have been desperate to lend his name to the marquee, which his performance as a surprisingly hammy Antichrist could not come close to saving.

Don't expect \\"The Omen\\"...or even \\"Thief in the Night\\"...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Many of the FX in the movie were done really well! I was however disappointed in the story itself. The lack of creativity as well as research, made a good vs. evil theme looked more played out than it really is. I went to go see this film because it was suppose to inspire Christians. As a Christian to me it had no spiritual worth so it was just another movie. I have not read \`Megiddo' the novel. So I can't say if the movie is comparable to the book. But I have read \`Revelation', and this apocalyptic movie about the end time events, is a very poor depiction of it. If you want to see some in your face special effects, then go see this movie. A word of caution, focuses on satanic rituals at first and has its share of violence. I really don't recommend it for small children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Megiddo","review":"After purchasing this movie I wish that I would have just rented it. The storyline was good but there was so much stuff out of context of the Bible. There were many things missing from the film that happen during the rise and rule of the antichrist. There was no rapture of the believers, the two witnesses of God were missing, all of the plagues, and so on and so on. It states in Revelation not to add or subtract anything from this book or else. Well, I think the people who made this film are definitely in the or else catagory. I am a Christian and I would never use this dvd as a witnessing tool. I would be afraid of leading them in the wrong direction. To me it is just another film of fiction and fantasy because there's not much biblical content for this movie stand on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Megiddo","review":"Megiddo is one individual's interpretation of the Book of Revelations that leaves much to desire. This film is more of an a B- action adventure movie than a Christian film. The special effects are average and the script leaves much to desire.

I think that to shoot a screenplay like this one, there should be at least 200 million dolars available, instead of the low budget this movie got... Let's see why:The plot is about a HUGE war between China / United States / \\"THe Latins\\" VERSUS EUROPEAN UNION. THis alone would deserve expert special effects.THere's also special effects when Satan appears. There's world wide caos going on.Also, the movie spans a fifty-years period of time...The good point is to see that people still give leading roles to old actors. Michael York (one of the co-producers) is strong some kind of spiritual and political leader. David Hedison surprised me. He's still strong (I was always a fan of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA). Michael Biehn's career is going downhill since, whatever the reasons, he is not included anymore in James Cameron's projects, but here he tries his best.Anyway, altough a pretentious one, this movie is plain funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLECCCCHHHH!","review":"Was this a Christian Movie? What I saw was Satan entering a small boy, who then lights fire to his baby brother. In another portion of the film, the boy puts on a black robe, and smears an upside-down cross on his forehead with blood. Demons are flooding a chapel where he is. It's a very disturbing movie which is depicting Satan having a power which he doesn't have. It's rated PG-13, it should be R. On top of all that, the closing Bible verse is quoted incorrectly! It says that Revelation 15:17 concerns God living on Earth and having harmony, when in fact, the verse has nothing to do with that. After watching the movie, I hadn't felt like I had watched something that God would approve of. It reminded me of a morbid horror film, and I strongly advise against it. The opening logo for the film company had an 8-ball, that should have given me a clue. The 8-ball is a symbol for fortune telling and drugs, not for Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, Really Bad","review":"Really, really bad.

It is not at all funny where Ben's train takes him (to small towns, through tunnels, to the city, etc.). It is perhaps fun, maybe exciting or interesting, but no, it's not funny.This book is completely appropriate for those who don't feel compelled to read all of the text to their children. If, however, you are the type of parent who wishes to stay true to the original text, be forewarned-- your children will never score highly on standardized tests of verbal ability.

It was a blessing to read and re-read the book which evoked in me a deep desire to live a purposeful life and experience the bliss of growth. Living these insights can make every living moment full of meaning, gratitude and joy. The world is full of self-help books and new books are published every month but Joyce Shafer has the rare gift of distinguishing between the essential and the inessential, when it comes to conveying the precise truth about productive and purposeful life.

At 9mths, the dr suspected a soy allergy and put him on Nutramigen. Within 2 days his skin almost completely cleared (which before was dry, cracked, and weepy). After the samples from the dr ran out, I bought Alimentum (Similac's version). His skin flared up again. Bought Nutramigen, and skin started to clear up again. I know it has to be the formula. Everyone who saw him noticed the change in his complexion. I did have to mix a scoop of his regular soy in with the Nutramigen because it has a completely different taste and smell.

(OK, I'm also a schedule feeder, and scheduling definitely helps with sleeping through the night, but I'm convinced a happy tummy with no gas helps, too!) I know this is usually only used if there is already a problem with allergies or digestion but I think infants' digestive systems take time to develop and have a hard time digesting regular formula.

His first person report of some events reads more like \\"scuttlebutt\\" than any \\"historical\\" account. I'm surprised this book is non-fiction. I'm sure the survivors of my fellow marines who didn't make it home would be put off by the unnecessary graphic way he describes their deaths. He never went out on my team, thank God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about some of the finest that fought in Vietnam","review":"The second book about the author's experience in Force Recon in Vietnam. It provides a personal point of view from someone who fought side by side with some of the bravest and most courageous men in the war. It views training and missions and the dangers that went with. A highly recommended book, as well as the first: Force Recon Diary, 1969."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding book!!","review":"I myself being a Navy Corpsman and having been stationed with the Marines was completely amazed at how accurate and gripping all the details and accounts were.

Semper Fi!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent follow-up!","review":"I highly recommend any of Major Norton's books. This book is very well written, and provides an honest opinion of his experiences during his second tour in Vietnam. It also gives a good, personal look at the inner workings of Marine Recon teams in Vietnam.Major Norton's easy and honest writing style make his books very hard to put down once you start reading them. He also does a great job of bringing the sights, smells, sounds and tastes of combat in Vietnam to life for the reader.Most of all, Major Norton does an outstanding job of making one proud of all our fighting men & women who served in Vietnam; they did a great job and books like this one are long overdue.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to all who might be interested in the personal experiences of Vietnam combat, as well as for anyone interested in the extremely tough job of gaining intel on enemy forces in Vietnam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things that go bump & more...","review":"Thanks be for the bringing back of this ghostly masterpiece!

I now live in Beijing where knock-off Disney watches can be had for a couple of bucks.

I had the thought to look at Amazon, because if Amazon doesn't have it nobody does. THIS is not a plug thing for Amazon. Well, I found the Amish butter, read the comments and ordered it. I was shocked! It is wonderful. Just like Big Mama's! It has the same buttermilky taste. I have never posted a comment on Amazon, but this is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What butter?","review":"My order was not shipped due to the heat of the summer.

I've had mine six months, and I sincerely regret spending $700 for it, when I could've gotten the Sony for just a couple hundred more. It's making me insane! Do not purchase this TV if you obsess about the little details like I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Since that one, I've not read a coolest book by Pat Cornwell","review":"Mrs. Cornwell is one of these authors that writes a couple of good books and all the rest of her books sell a very well quantity only because of those written in the past. Obviously, she really knows how to do the thing she does, she criated her own style out of nothing and she has more than just \\"a couple of good books\\". Patricia Cornwell is famous and has an intriguing life that would give to the readers a very nice biography.BODY OF EVIDENCE is the best Kay Scarpetta book I've read till now. No other book by Patricia Cornwell moved me so much and gave me such pleasure. It's modern and it has also very nicely written characters that you'll love. And a wonderful plot, for sure. You won't be disappointed if you read that book. It's really worthwhile. One of those rare books by Patricia Cornwell that you buy and don't regret for doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The younger Dr. Scarpetta in action...","review":"This one's actually the second Kay Scarpetta book, and in this one, she's a lot less self-assured than the lady we've come to know. It's a mark of talent in an author when she can age and mature a series character over a number of books. There's a comment in this book about Kay's irritation over the way her shortness is a disadvantage when it comes to keeping up with taller people. Since even in this story she's a very tough person, it lends her an accessibility. Beats hell out of heroes who, though mere mortals, still never change, book after book. I get the feeling that authors who create that sort of hero are trying to deny their own mortality."},{"rating":"1","title":"incoherent, poorly written","review":"The plot was inconsistent--characters got left places and showed up where they were not.

I felt that it had a slow start and found it a bit difficult to engage myself in the characters. But after the first few chapters, I could not put the book down. The story line drew you into the characters and kept you guessing up until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I have read several of the Kay Scarpetta novels. This is one of the original, before the author began to branch out into fuller lives for her Medical Examiner. I am among the few who like the way the author played with back drops and imagination. That said, her original works are intellegent, fun to read and informative. Definitely not a mistake to buy and to read. Especially if you are interested in crime science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This is an easy to read page turner w/ lots of twists & turns. Fans of shows like CSI ought to enjoy this bk. since this is a trip down a similar avenue.

They weren't awful but they just didn't resonate with me. So, I pulled Body of Evidence, the second in the Kay Scarpetta series, off the shelf. I was reminded why I became a Cornwell fan. The plot is interesting with some great twists and turns. The characters are growing more complex. Mostly it's a tidy book with a clear beginning and ending. So many of the most recent Scarpetta's seems to leave things unresolved.This isn't an awesome book but a good solid read, particularly for readers who are new to the genre and would be more comforable with a known author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Suspense !!","review":"She is a wonderful writer!

I started out with Black Notice and The Last Precinct. After devouring those two, I decided to start at the beginning and read them all. This Scarpetta mystery kept me awake, reading until two in the morning every night until I finished it.Cornwell not only knows how to weave an intriguing mystery, she has the writing skills that keep even the most sophisticated reader interested. Her descriptions are detailed and accurate. She not only can describe a scene, she can show emotion in her characters that brings them alive. She also is able to keep the identity of the killer a mystery until the very end. I can't wait to read the rest of the Scarpetta series."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"it is a good book, maybe not the best one but I enjoyed it. It was my first Scarpetta novel and I will continue the saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarpetta rules~","review":"This book, really went into nice character development. By the middle of it, I felt like Beryl Madison, the first victim, was a real person, and I too wanted to know how she died, why and who did it.I had a very hard time putting it down, when it was 4am, its a page turner. The evidence and clues are amazing, and they really make u think.Overall, an excellnt medical thriller mystery....And despite what anyone says, I like Scarpetta, shes not harsh or feministic.

Got me hooked on the entire series, which I'm buying one or two books at a time. Kay Scarpetta is a great character and Cornwell has obviously done her research. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to give it two because the average was just too high","review":"Cornwell's writing is formula writing; the only creativity in this book comes through in an occasionally flowing bit of prose. For the most part, though, the characters have very few dimensions and the plot seems contrived. It certainly keeps you guessing, but only because the finale is so goofy. We know from the beggining what's going to happen between the good doctor and the killer; we just wonder who the killer is (and if we can trudge through the entire book to find out.) Definitely a brain candy kind of book, but not even especially good brain candy at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just lost interested halfway thru the book","review":"I know everyone has different interest or opinion. I respect that. Nothing wrong with that. I do love mystery and suspense. I have several favorite well-known authors. For some reason I read this author's books (first two books of the series) and I just lost interest halfway thru the second book and didn't bother finish it. Because I felt that the author was overdoing the character descriptions (unnecessarily wordy with characters as one of other readers had typed on the post) among other things instead of making the story itself or plot more interesting. Who knows the books at later series are much better, I wouldn't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"When I look back over the long history of Kay Scarpetta stories, I am sorry to say that the writing has fallen off considerably. While reading Cornwell's latest, I kept thinking, this is terrible, I can't wait to finish it.But I am faithful to Scarpetta, her neice and all the gang, and so I will keep buying and reading the books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Riveting!!!","review":"To be honest, I feel Patricia Cornwell has a true knack for Mystery writing. After all, she was everything this character is in true life. I must admit she is very detailed and leaves no stone unturned. But I do feel as in the suspense department is lacking a little bit, other than that, she is a great writer. I feel if your someone into forensic this is truely the book for you. Someone (my girlfriend) recommended this book and I think it really great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked it!","review":"My 2nd Kay Scapetta novel and loved it.

Keep them coming!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Patricia, what can I say?","review":"Although Ms. Cornwell is wordy, and sometimes it's irritating, I feel she weaves quite a tale. This book is interesting and a definite page-turner, if only to bypass the descriptions and needless explainations for the nitty-gritty \\"that's what I read Cornwell for\\" stuff!!I've read every book in the Scarpetta series and I feel as though I could visit Kay, Lucy, Pete, etc. if I happened to find myself in Richmond. Ms. Cornwell is always a treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never captured my interest","review":"When I had read over half of the book and I still was not interested nor felt strongly about any of the characters, I decided to call it quits. This was my first time to read Patricia Cornwell and I definitely prefer others like Sue Grafton, Janet Evanovich, John Grisham, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Ideas, Bad Novel","review":"The Calcutta Chromosome suggests an intriguing conspiracy theory regarding the origins of our understanding of malaria. I was so intrigued by the novel's central theme that I investigated the history of malaria and day-dreamed about the unlikely possibility of a personality-imbued chromosome.Unfortunately by the end of the book, I was so irritated by the disjointed plot, the flat character development, the numerous plot tangents that lead NOWHERE, and the sadly flat, bored ending, that I threw the book out in a fury. Fortunately I dug it out and sold it an unsuspecting used book store clerk."},{"rating":"1","title":"My opinion","review":"Mildly interesting science-fictional ideas in the service of an uninteresting novelist.Cardboard characters who do nothing but tell each other very long stories.Over-clever and disorienting plot structure.I couldn't get into this book and I don't understand the good reviews it received."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not understnd the end","review":"I loved the images the book evoked .I loved reading about the British in India and how they would behave and use euphemisms about the natives its so like how my mother and father would describe their experiences with the English in Malaysia.He writes very well ,he has a delicious sense of humour especially Murugan (call me Morgan) but although I understand the premise the end totally stumped me.I just cannot understand why he would end the book the way he did .I can accept some of the chromosome theory he tried to explain and the extraordinary coincidences with Lutchman and all that but why he chose to end it so weak is why I give it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After such classics as \\"In an Antique Land\\" and \\"The Shadowlines,\\" Ghosh's latest book is rather a let down, much like \\"Circle of Reason.\\" In \\"The Calcutta Chromosome,\\" the characters are not well developed at all, and they all seems so contradictory, especially Dr. Murugan, who carries much of the burden of this book. Part science, part science fiction, part mystery, the story becomes less compelling when doused heavily with the technobabble of science and computers (the latter is very unrealistic, even for a futuristic fantasy.) Simply put, it detracts from a potentially interesting story. Even the concept of the Chromosome and it's omnipotent possiblities is not developed enough to make the title a compelling one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A racy one-night read","review":"Ghosh is clearly on a fun trip here. No big ideas, no grand locales, just a racy account of a man trying to find his past through a list of clues embedded all throughout the book, written in a style that makes you move mesmerisingly, and often exasperatingly, from one chapter to the next - and back! It is as if Ghosh wanted to write a whodunit, and instead of having the perfunctory sleuth, makes one out of the reader herself. It is intellectually stimulating, only if your idea of intellectual stimulation is an intense game of chess - or better still, \\"Scotland Yard\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had great expectations from Ghosh when I started reading thisnovel, but in the end, it turned out to a disappointing read. Ghosh tries to brign together the mysticism of India, and the Sci-fi world of Arthur C Clarke, and in the end seems to fall short of capturing either of the two worlds, and brings them together in an incongrous way.Some points in the novel were interesting enough to make me turn the pages faster, but at most points, I just wanted to finish the book so that I could go on to a next, more interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Amateurish","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I bought it on the way back from a trip to India and I like science fiction. I'm not sure if predictable is the right word for this book, but everything one of the main characters theorizes about the mystery is true. You're never left wondering if some of the information is false. In most thrillers, things are slowly revealed to the main character through twists and turns and false leads. Not here - the main character somehow postulates the exact theory behind all the mystery and reveals it all to us. And he's never wrong. He is really a plot device to tell us the backgound and solve the mystery. It's not very fun to have the story spoon fed to you. This book seems like it was a first novel written by someone just graduated from college.I give the book 2 stars (instead of one) because I still had a hard time putting the book down at the end even if I didn't like it. I'd rather have spent the time on another book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghosh is Great","review":"I met and introduced Ghosh at my university last year. Got to go to dinner with him and other faculty at Butler University. His work never disappoints me. He is as intersting in person as are his characters. The Calcutte Chromosome is the ultimate page turner. Im almost to the end and I can't wait to snap up my next Ghosh book. Read In an Antique Land too..its awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing, ultimately disappointing","review":"Ghosh's novel of a conspiracy/mystery surrounding malaria, mosquitoes, and spirit transfer is a quirky, different sort of book.But even in an offbeat novel, you need some questions answered, As one of the reviews below states, you feel like the story stops 25 pages before it should.Worth a look for some intriguing ideas, but not executed as well as it could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful, frustrating Read","review":"The book definitely has all the suspense in the first 100 pages. But then it falls from a cliff. The plot ultimately turned out to be quite meaningless and the end came too abruptly. I do not know if I read it because it has references to Calcutta and New York, 2 cities I love quite a bit, or the story itself was good enough to read. This was an utter disaster and I do not think I will red another Amitava Ghosh in quite a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Disappointing...","review":"Chromosome is a fairly intriguing story revolving around the history of malaria research with a little bit of soul transmigration (of a sort) thrown in for good measure. It has a very complex narrative that draws you in, but in totality it wasn't as well executed as I'd have liked. The author's tendency to abruptly switch back and forth between flashbacks was a little confusing and the ending felt incomplete and left me more than a little disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted, boring","review":"The lead to this book is great, but about a third of the way in, the suspense is lost and the story gets sloppy. I love that the author played with time and tried to tell a story from varied perspectives, but he didn't tie things together coherently enough for that mechanism to work. I struggled to figure out what the point of it all was.The characters are talking heads; nobody's personality is distinguishable. It's impossible to care about anyone because all they do is explain things to each other. The unique perspectives are rendered unnecessary because everyone's perspective reads the same. Interesting bits from the beginning are dropped partway through and forgotten by the author completely.This should have been an essay or a fun, clean short story instead of a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning Meditation","review":"This book is a beautiful meditation on life. I wish I had it when my son was younger, but it doesn't matter, it's universal. It is a primer on Zen Buddhism and one of the best I've ever read. And it is a primer on motherhood that is revealing and comforting in ways unimagined. It truly flows with such ease and beauty that you won't put it down until the end. It also includes a wonderful chapter on tending your marriage after childbirth that is incredibly apt and meaningful. I highly recommend this book to all mothers and fathers, and to any person seeking inner peace. You'll find the way here."},{"rating":"2","title":"help for every mother, zen, christian, or other!","review":"With three kids under 5 I was struggling with a whole host of emotions and new depths of sleep deprivation. A desperate search on Amazon revealed scores of books for parents on how to manage the kids; almost nothing on how to manage yourself. Then I found Momma Zen. It is broken up into short sections to address all different kinds of issues: your anger, your guilt, your fears about being a good enough parent, your miserable sleeplessness. Each section can work like a daily meditation, and there's a \\"concordance\\" of sorts in the back that helps you go directly to the section you need. I've given this to three other moms, who all thought it was a lifesaver, just like I do! Buy it! SOOOO helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Momma Zen\\" is a wonderful guide down \\"the crooked path to motherhood.\\"","review":"This is no simplistic 12-step program to perfect parenting. Rather it is a thoughtful memoir of the author's own plunge into the amazing experience of motherhood that both turned her world upside down and at the same time gave value to everything. Her simple, elegant prose is enough in itself to keep you reading, but it is also graced with humor, and Miller's willingness to reveal herself for better or worse creates a bond with all of us less-than-perfect parents. The book is stitched together with insights from her practice as a Zen priest, but this too is treated with delicacy, and we are given instructions for meditation if we wish to try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my life.","review":"I arrived at parenthood and found it was nothing like I thought it would be. It was HARD! And I thought there was something wrong with ME for feeling this way.

At times I wanted to hide the mirror, cover it up with a cloth, and not let the words get too deep - there is that much truth in it. There was no such luck. Karen's honesty, humour and poetic writing kept me riveted. At the closing of the last chapter I felt lucky, grateful and humbled in my ego's chipped away state. Karen's gift to her readers is the ability to enjoy all of the moments of motherhood - from the sleep deprivation to the tantrums to the great deterioration in maternal personal hygiene. I can now find Zen in my son's need to be held way past his bedtime when I had planned on relaxing on the couch with the TV and my husband. Impossible? Read for yourself. You will want to read it on repeat. I highly recommend this book to you and every mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moms, are you looking for balance in your busy life? Look no further.","review":"Karen Maezen Miller artfully merges experiences from her own life as a mother with the wisdom of Zen Buddhism to help mothers like me who are stuggling to have it/do it/be it all.

The only file format it actually handles straight-through is wma (Windows Media Audio), a proprietary format itself. As I have no facility for creating any of these three formats, and the specification for the executable format of the on-board decoder is not open, I was forced to return this device in favor of another CompactFlash player. If you run Windows exclusively, you might consider the Lyra (or its equally proprietary successor, the Lyra II), but otherwise I would highly recommend another player which can handle standardized formats (such as the Kodak MC3 or the Frontier Nex II)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Book For Diagnosing Symptoms From Home","review":"I have all four editions of this book and have found it to be the most complete book for \\"diagnosing\\" symptoms.The book is laid out wonderfully so that you are able to easily find what you are looking for.

The price is astronomical for a toy that is not particularly well made. Ours didn't fall apart as quickly as the other reviewer's, but don't expect this toy to last long. Kids are inevitably going to play with the door latch; a responsible manufacturer would take that fact into account and make it as sturdy as possible. If it were on sale for $5 to $7, you could probably buy the thing without feeling ripped off. The current price (over $25) is absurd. That said, for as long as the toy lasted, my daughter loved it.

The result is part-documentary and part-live action \\"Toy Story.\\" I never thought I'd ever see this released on DVD, and even though there are no special features, this classic film alone is worth the inexpensive price listed here.

It is a highly educating experience to learn the development--or should I say the radical change-- of his opinions over the years. Anyone versed in the history of psychoanalysis should also discern a pattern not altogether differerent from Jung and others. As a polemical writer and literary critic Crews is substantially talented; as a thinker, alas, he is recycled Popper with a vicious bite, though I'm not sure he understands Popper, who supposedly converted him to a Freud basher. Crews is all too ready to attack Freud whenever he can,with his considerable rhetorical resources,and to this worthy cause he will devote the rest of his life, I'm sure.

I had the opportunity to visit Dominica once in connection with ecotourism and advanced environmental studies and nothing else distilled the folklore and culture better than Tin Roof. I could hardly put it down!Before, I saw the the islanders as flat characters, poor, unfortunate and unsophisticated. Tin Roof dramatizes the complex dynamics, rich family life and noble aspirations that each one of us can identify with. Mr. Christian skillfully weaves historical events with personal angst. He places the reader squarely center-stage as the stories unfold, often with suspenseful twists and amusing turns. Tin Roof is a must read for anyone considering even a cruise to the islands or wishing deeper insight into the mindset of colleagues naturalized from that part of the world.

Their habits, likes, dislikes, tricks etc., seem to be similar to what happens in Dominica. The food referred to reminded me of what I was used to back home. Also, the story about the corpse who wore socks at his funeral is a riot. I can imagine what went on in the small boy's mind as he saw the dead mans' toes. There is a story about a retarded girl,and how her family's love saved her. That was touching and made me think of how cruel people can be to the disabled. The last story \\"How is it, man?

It is their best work. Unfortunately, they split up right after they recorded it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a friend of the late Erik Braunn's...","review":"and as an avid IB fan... I have to say, to hell with this album. this was by far the worst pile of garbage the band EVER put out. Erik Braunn was a million times the guitar player Pinera or Rhino are...and I'm saying that to Braunn's praise, not to either of the latters' detriment, they're both great. But the songs are unimaginitive and it's clear where most of the fire on the previous albums came from...a 17 year old who was booted out for having too many creative ideas of his own. IB owed Atlantic another album after this one, but Doug Ingle quit the band and forefitted the deal... forever severing ties between Iron Butterfly and Atlantic records. But considering what a pile of crap this album is, the fact that they didn't follow it up should be seen as a mercy. So, in conclusion, screw this one, go get a copy of BALL or LIVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metamorphosis","review":"Iron Butterfly's best album lyrically and vocally. And probably the best from an album cover artwork standpoint, too. From the front cover's casket and cradle washing up on shore at sunrise to the back cover's nude flapper with butterfly in hand, it's unique. No two ways about it. The vocals on this album are excellent with not one but two strong baritones, Doug Ingle and Mike Pinera. I have to give the edge to Doug Ingle for having the better voice for this band.Doug wails his vocals raw on my favorite cut on this CD, \\"Soldier In Our Town\\". Written by Ingle and lyricist Robert Woods Edmonson, This is a beautiful acoustic ballad with EXTREMELY strong vocals and an electric, psychedelic fade out at the end. I can't compare it to any other song I've ever heard. If In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida was Iron Butterfly's tour de force, Metamorphosis deserves an honorable mention as a new Iron Butterfly sound for a new decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"as the title indicates: yes there was change!","review":"I enjoyed \\"BALL\\" by iron butterfly when it came out on \\"lp\\" (still have it) but when the group changed personal there sound changed also. very much for the better it was good to see doug INGLE get away from the church sound and more into the hammond B-3 sound sad to see them disband after this album. it truly is a classic record that is still fresh today after 30 yrs. hope you enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the butterfly","review":"This album has some strong material which holds up over time. Just one point of clarification from the prior comments, but it's so minor it is only for die hards. The \\"keyboard player\\" used an RMI keyboard. He raved about it in an article I read back \\"in the day\\" to the point where I checked one out. I believe the model was the \\"Rocksichord.\\" Not quite their \\"Keyboard Computer\\" model, which would come out later, but a versatile and unique machine on its own. You can tell it's not a clavinette or other electric piano because the RMI has a distinctive sound. Check out old Genesis stuff, like \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" for other RMI sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Iron Butterfly has always been one of my favorite bands and this album is great!Butterfly Bleu is a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than In a Gadda Da Vida","review":"Everybody knows that Iron Butterfly never received the same attention after In-A-Gadda Da Vida, yet after listening to this album one will wonder why this early hard rock performance faded from the limelight. New Day, the first actual song sounds like the lead guitar part was lifted from the aformentioned song, but is however a very good song. The next 8 songs especially the last should be the reason for purchasing this album. Though some of the songs have rather inane lyrics such as, \\"now I know that we are more than friends,\\" the instrumental parts of these songs are still very good. The final song \\"Butterfly Bleu\\" is hands down the best song. The song is 13 minutes of strange 60s wierdness. The guitar works with the vocals to concoct some of the strangest and most bizarre sounds ever heard on this earth. In short buy it just to be freaked out. Have a joint on hand and indulge.Highly recommended to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great record!","review":"This may not sound as psychadelic as the previous butterfly albums but it is a good recording in its own right.With the departure of Erik Brann and the addition of Mike Pinera and Larry Rheinhardt on guitar this album rocks! Great vocals by the band and a particularly inspired use of talkbox and other vocal effects by Pinera is really cool to listen to.Great drumming from Ron Bushy too.Crank it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is good but it is pricey and is not as stiff as i had pictured it to be but overall its good."},{"rating":"2","title":"fFound it thru AMAZON","review":"The product was as advertised and works well. It was delivered in a timely maner. The faucet on my water crock started leaking. I could not fine a replacement locally. It took not time at all to find one on line and order the crock lever faucet thru AMAZON."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement Spout worked great.","review":"I had a glass water dispenser with a bad spout on it so I ordered this one to replace it. The opening on the glass jug was smaller then the new spout so I had to enlarge it with a Dremel tool. Once I got the new spout in it worked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"crock water spout","review":"The product worked perfectly. the shiping was fast. Had a wonderful expericence with amazon.
