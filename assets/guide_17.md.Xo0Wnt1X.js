This trunk bag accomplishes what the backpack did, but with more comfort for me as well as a lower center of gravity for me and the bike. Despite its spaciousness, it doesn't quite accommodate my shoes (so I leave two pairs at the office), but it does hold a complete set of clothes otherwise.

I had previously owned a Tamrac large backpack and replaced it with this one. The balance, ergonomics, and cosmetics are much better on the Kata. I really like the yellow interior which makes it easy to find black lenses and accessories quickly. The side pouches are great for tripods and/or water bottles. The inside is roomy and easily reconfigured. The top handle is very useful and I like the fact that I can add the optional trolley when I know I'm going to be lugging the bag around the city all day.

I appreciate how the gods and goddesses are presented within the context of Celtic mythology and culture, and even of specific locations and the land itself. This is not a fanciful description of all the attributes of various deities. It is an attempt to understand the complex relationship between these deities and the people and lands of the Celtic world. The book is full of fascinating research and well considered speculations by an author who has devoted many years of his life to understanding Celtic myth and magic. I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about understanding the Celtic way of life and the Celtic relationship with magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a boring textbook","review":"If in reference for gods and goddesses, this is not the most informative book. I would have given it 1 star, but there were some decent illustrations, which is the only reason it gets 2 stars. It really reads like a very boring textbook, and doesn't go into too many gods and goddesses. It gives a lot of history about the ideas in celtic dieties, but not too much into specific gods and goddesses.

Macy - that of a loathsome, self-deprecating man who somehow is able to win the audience over by the end of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever","review":"I had high hopes for this movie. After Meg Ryan being off the scene for some some I thought she was better than this movie. It started off with the star wanting to commit sucide and the first five minutes were the worst part of the film - and depressing. The movie had no plot and certainly no substance. There was a LOT of profanity which could have been left out. I thought Hollywood and certainly Meg Ryan could have faired better. Don't waste your time and money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Deal is the Real Deal","review":"This star-studed film from Steven Schachter (director of the Emmy award winning TV film Door to Door) is an interesting film with a diverse combination of comedy and action. The Deal features many well known actors including William H Macy (Fargo), Meg Ryan (When Harry Met Sally), LL Cool J (Last Holiday), and Jason Ritter (TV's Joan of Arcadia). This film is a new inside look on the Hollywood scene and should not be missed. The DVD also includes a Free Digital Copy which is a neat addition as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie with very limited appeal","review":"Hollywood apparently has an abiding incestuous interest in its own shallowness, since several movies have been made about the phony baloneys who make too many of the movies. There are, of course, movies that are truly works of art, but they are not all that numerous. \\"The Deal\\" is not anywere near the top of the line.The story is a mess. William Macy's character is in the process of killing himself as the movie opens. He is living in squalor and is obviously not successful. But he is interrupted by a nephew with a movie script, which Macy doesn't read but decides must be rewritten--several times. Then his hype begins and soon a movie is being made without much of a script. Disaster follows disaster until it is all one great mess, which I assume is supposed to be amusing.There's a good cast of Macy, Meg Ryan, Elliot Gould, et al., but even a good cast can't make this amusing to anyone except Hollywood insiders. It's almost sure to be a yawn for everyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is the worst Meg Ryan movie EVER !! Thought she could have made better choices. Really lame.

I would of liked it if they would have had a option of characters to pick from and they put great work in the graphics of the monsters but not so much on the main character.

In cold weather the poly body of the wheelbarrow becomes brittle and cracks when even slightly bumped. The 'stands' are only about 12 inches apart, which means that the wheelbarrow is tippy while loading it, and the stands get in the way of your feet while moving the thing from one place to another. The tube in the tire leaked immediately, and the green poly body fades very quickly in the sun.

As someone in the movie comments (if I remember correctly), usually two DEs were thought necessary to successfully hunt a U-boat. On the other hand, destroyer vs. U-boat would place the odds more in the U.S. ship's favor. DE vs. U-boat was much more even."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still best example of pressures of hunter and hunted.","review":"This is still best story of hunter and hunted. (Later, more technologically advanced films principally focus on the sub. e.g. Das Boot, Red October and Crimson Tide.) Good guys/Bad guys-Americans/Germans nearly irrelevant to taut story line.

It's a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Sub vs. Sub-Killer","review":"This movie classic is one of the best action packed dramas of World War II dealing with an American Destroyer and a German U-boat. Robert Mitchum plays the American destroyer commander and Curt Jurgens plays the U-boat commander. Their sea craft cross paths in the South Atlantic Ocean and engage in a deadly cat and mouse game that can only end in the death of one of them. This duel of two very experience naval officers covers thousands of miles and is action packed. Over all the models are realistic enough that you can just sit back and be engrossed in the hunt. This movie not only shows us the mandatory hunting of the enemy in a deadly chess game where one mistake means defeat and death. But it also shows us that en in war there can be hope and one can show his humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWII submarine movie","review":"Another must watch movie. Excellently done film. Classic. Robert Mitchum and Chud Jurgens were great in their roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this movie like U-571?","review":"There was a lot of flak about _U-571_ because that movie fictionalizes the seizure of an ENIGMA machine from a U-boat... combining two real events involving BRITISH sailors and ships (the capture of the U-505 being almost irrelevant to the ENIGMA story).No (previous) reviewer had mentioned that _The Enemy Below_ is based on a novel of the same name ... involving a BRITISH destroyer hunting a U-boat. The movie tracks very well with that novel, other than some cultural changes for the US crew of the US ship. Therefore I think that Leonard Maltin may have it wrong when he says this is essentially a remake of a 1930's movie. I believe it really is an Americanization of the (early 1950s) British novel.Yes, the (original) _Star Trek_ episode \\"Balance of Terror\\" is based on this movie. Both are gripping and suspenseful, and have memorable moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Enemy Below","review":"This is a Classic!! One of the best stories to come out of WW2.

It is fresh, vibrant and beautiful! It gives a totally different insight into Maori and Hawaiian culture. I understand that it is 'just' a novel, but it didn't feel like that - it was direct communication from the main character - Cowrie. The main push of the book is recognition of and acceptance of racial differences - that moved me beyong comfort.

A formula series that woks, if you don't expect too much from it. Crime detection at the grade school level. Black and white. No special effects. No CSI. No really taxing challenges. If you do not want to be challenged and would rather relax, then this is a nice break. The butler, as is often the case during this period, is the one with the brains. Women are stereotyped. The action hero goes in doing things where he wouldn't last 2 seconds in todays movies. But of course he always wins by dumb luck. The real value of the series is that it is a window into the times. Audiences were not sophisticated, technology was simple, plots were not complicated. As is often the case in stories of this time, the hero is a rich man about town with no real job and solves crimes as a public service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the format issues!!!","review":"This is an amazing DVD, but be aware that the copies available for sale here are in PAL format, not NTSC.

Throughout the video he seems most interested in focusing on the clowning antics of the woodwind player, who spends a great deal of time dancing around and making faces, while the keyboard player and guitarist are making the majority of the music being heard.The music is good. I had hoped to watch the musicians creating it.There is a lot of footage of the drummer from under his snare drum. To be fair, there is plenty of guitar footage, but isn't this band dominated by keyboards?

Obviously I don't know how it will wear yet, but the slightly-tacky surface is great for foot movement on it. It's not real thick, so my feet don't sink in on it (especially important since there is carpet and carpet padding under it).

She begins in ancient Greece and follows the development of the \\"world views\\" of succeeding civilizations, until the birth of the idea of Antarctica.Into this context she places the intrepid men who sailed out and sought this legendary land since the 1500s. Most interesting is her depiction of the great explorers for the rogues gallery they were, as opposed to the sanitized versions from history books. Many were in league with the monarchy of their country seizing plunder from their enemies and seeking to extend the influence of the monarchs they served.The entire book is worth buying for the beautifully crafted first part which delivers a historical, philosophical and at the same time very personal context for understanding the role Antarctica has played through the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pratchett's Best Work","review":"Unfortunately, this book is really not a good representative of Terry Pratchett's genius. Here he takes on the subject of opera, but he clearly doesn't know much about it.

Dream/Agnes Knitt is really fantastic, but I do not think this book does her justice. Though she is the central figure, she doesn't get to spend the time in the spotlight that her fans yearn to see.If you're interested in Terry Pratchett, pick another book.

The critics' instincts were right while their memories were wrong. I now know my instincts about Pratchett's books are right, while my memory is not to be trusted at all.

Not a lot of substance or deep thought here, but Pratchett punctuates his silliness with simple observations on the human condition which are probably more complex than they appear.In an odd way, I think that sometimes Pratchett's wit gets in the way of his writing. Sometimes I found myself not laughing at something I knew was funny just because I found it too clever, or perhaps too practiced. Every once in a while, I found myself a little annoyed at how astoundingly profound the characters were in their silliness. Anyway, it didn't happen often, and \\"Maskerade\\" was still a delightful, entertaining read.I look forward to reading more of Pratchett's work in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story's not as catchy as its cover...","review":"There's Witches, Death, Greebo, and the wizards of the Unseen University. It's a slapstick off of The Phantom of the Opera that mostly everybody should understand and appreciate. But for some reason, it just didn't happen for me. I found the plots seemed to drag on for too long, cameos by Death, Greebo and the Witches too short, and the new faces Maskerade introduced far too one-dimensional and dry. This novel should have worked, but it didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the Best of Discworld","review":"This Discworld novel plays off Phantom of the Opera. Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg set off to Ankh-Morpork to find out why they have not received royalties due Nanny for her best-selling cookbook of naughty erotic and aphrodisiac delicacies, and to check up on Agnes Nitt, who has gone to seek her fortune and is singing in the background for a young airheaded opera starlet who looks good in a sequined costume, in a sort of Milli-Vanilli scenario. She has not yet joined the coven, but has found she doesn't seem to fit in anywhere else; her alter-ego, Perdita, is also not yet developed into the alternate personality it becomes in later books. This one is quite funny, and the plot moves along well. There's a pseudo-Italian imposter tenor, Greebo makes an hilarious appearance in human form, and we get to experience a lot of Granny, my favorite witch character. It loses a star only because it dissipates some of its energy on one too many minor characters and subplots."},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell off the bed laughing.","review":"Maybe you *do* have to know opera to love this book, but I grew up on it and thought the book was a riot.

Back then I'd always had a small curiosity about the Discworld series, but it wasn't until I found out that one of the books was based on The Phantom of the Opera that I decided to get serious and check it out. Well, Maskerade at least.A spoof it is, and a remarkably funny one at that. The lovely, demure Christine is turned into a ditzy stereotypical dumb blonde with the sort of figure that only a high metabolism combined with a scanty diet can achieve. And the book is based in an opera house, managed by two men who don't know what to do with it. The witches are in the book too, and there's a lot of the usual hilarious bickering and bantering between them. The individual scenes of the book are varied and interesting.Maybe I'm a little biased because it was the first Discworld novel I've picked up, but it will always be my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutesy.

Bull elk really do bugle, and it is a sound which if it did not actually occur, could never be invented. The Tarzan-like call is easily one of the most haunting sounds in all of nature.

One can use Pelikan's images to reflect on the meanings of Christ to the peoples of history and reflect on their meaning in present times. The images Pelikan give are all applicable today and can be helpful in understanding our relationships to God now. For example: how we as Christians can conduct a \\"just\\" war when we have an image of Jesus as \\"The Prince of Peace.\\" Or, how we can better understand the middle East peace process with our image of Jesus as our rabbi. Or, how we can approach our busy, packed lives using the image of Christ as the perfect monk.

The author chooses to devote each chapter to an aspect of Jesus' place within the culture of a specific period, so the discussion can be somewhat restrictive - for example, the overview of \\"just war\\" theory within Christianity is conducted only in the context of the medieval and Reformation eras and ignores the many later theological developments.

It is very easy to make an elegant display with different toppings, jams, fruit, drizzled chocolate, melted butterscotch, toffee bits, ice cream toppings, etc. on an assortment of mini cheesecakes. If you want an individual serving size cheesecake pan, try the Molten 'n More pan; unfortunately it has a dark nonstick finish, but I've managed to bake good cheesecakes in it by reducing the baking temperature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product!","review":"My dish for the holidays is always mini-cheesecakes. It was always frustrating to get them out of my mini-muffin pan. This pan has made it so easy! I no longer dread making this dessert. Just a note though... the cups on this pan are approx twice as big as a regular mini-muffin pan so adjust your recipe accordingly. I just double my recipe and get bigger mini-cheesecakes. I don't think anyone will mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallic residue on food after second use :(","review":"Would have given 5 stars if I was writing it about the FIRST use, but a week (and one gentle hand wash) later, the cheesecakes came out with a metallic residue all around the sides. So disappointing as I was making them for a special Christmas event. f course I cannot serve them now. Will post photos of the tainted cheesecakes here after Christmas.I hand washed it gently and also dried with a soft towel. There was no unnecessary wear and tear on my part. I will be sending this back. If anyone has recommendations on a similar item that does not leave residue, please leave a comment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for mini cheesecakes","review":"You all know how cheesecake slices can be too much after dinner etc. This solves that problem with small mini cheesecakes made in a removable bottom pan. I found that there was a little leakage, just as with any cheesecake, just put another pan beneath it to save your oven. I f I remember correctly, it takes a normal cheesecake recipe amount. The pan itself is sturdy and easy to clean without any special preparations. Recipe and tips on the box work fine as does your own recipe. Unique and lovely for those wanting different toppings. Very versatile. Can't wait to try it for other recipes: for example, would angel food cake work in this? WE'll find out.... what fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little tricky to use, but very fancy results","review":"I was very excited to use this pan to make individual cheesecakes with different toppings. They turned out nicely, but it is a little tricky getting them out of the pan, especially if you fill the wells all the way. I had to use one finger under the pan to push the mini-cheescakes out, trying to balance them so they didn't rock sideways and get smushed while I extracted them...not the easiest manouver!However the results are very striking and will certainly impress your guests.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cheesecake Pan ever","review":"I found a recipe for Mini Pumpkin Pie cheese cakes but didn't have the Mini Cheesecake Pan. I looked into what was the best pan to buy and found that the Chicago brand was best. Boy were the reviews right. The Mini Cheese cakes turned out just perfect. Everyone loved them.

I've been making regular cheese cakes for a long time and for my son's first birthday I wanted to make mini-cakes. I used the Chicago Metallic pan and it was the best little cheese cakes ever. They cook in 15 minutes instead of the hours. I would absolutely recommend this item, you will have it for years. If your making for a lot of people, i would also say to purchase two of them, that way you cut your baking time in half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product Quality","review":"After using the pan for the first time I soaked it in soap water to make it easy for washing.

Anyone who has lived in such an interesting country for as long as these men have (why are all the interviewees male?) should have some very valuable insights. While Kischer's sample may be quite credible and qualified, they are also rather boring on the whole. They worked in Japan, for a long long time, and that's pretty much it. I found only two interviews to be worth reading - Donald Richie's and Kischer's own interview (done by another journalist). Given the massive differences in male-female roles that apply even to foreigners, Kischer's failure to talk with women about their lives in Japan is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, but look at the freakin' price!","review":"I'm a literature professor, too, and I was thinking of using this brief, informative book as required reading for an upcoming class on the American novel in the 20th century. But then I saw the price!The full retail price is more than $90 for such a little book -- no illustrations, no glossy pages, none of the things that make science text books so expensive. It has about 120 small pages of text.Even its discount price of about $45 it is outrageous. Such a price nearly guarantees the book's failure on the market, however useful it might be. What student can afford that? Bedford Books must be staffed by either fools or King Midas's children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely an Introduction","review":"For the content this text might as well be an introduction to a more definitive and detailed work. It's really not worth the price or the effort. If it was an introduction/preface to another book, as a student, I'd skip it (and not miss much). Abrams' Glossary of Literary Terms, or the Handbook of Critical Approaches to Literature would be a more worthwhile investment for students; the sort of useful resource a student could return to throughout their academic career. It might be useful as a supplementary reference for high school students, the sort of thing kept in a classroom library. I wouldn't recommend it for personal purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"the absolute worst","review":"I can't even remember how many years I've been reading this series. And Patchett, while I've not read much of her work, she is well respected, so I figure it'll be a good collection. But of the 20 stories collected here, 15 of them are really bad. In fact, I'd say only five are worth the paper they are printed on (but I would never even think of including them here): Tartt, Percy, Munroe, Moffett, and the best story of the collection (if you could call it that) by Englander. Bad job Ms. Patchett."},{"rating":"1","title":"They ain't what they used to be.","review":"I guess I'm a throwback to the days when short stories were really stories: Hemingway, Anderson, Poe, London, even Stephen King. They had plots that moved, characters you loved or hated--page turners! Now, most SS seem to be emotional trips through someone's looking glass, vague attempts to reach into the reader's psyche for a response that we (I) have to work to deliver.But it's probably me. I am well aware that some of these stories were originally published in The New Yorker, Ploughshares and The Paris Review, but most do not satisfy (me).Modern short stories may be the height of literary excellence in 10,000 words; If these are \\"The Best American Short Stories,\\" I think I'll go back to novels, where you can quite often find a work of fiction that is both elevating and hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven, not worth it","review":"An uneven collection, with many kid, or coming of age stories. The stories vary in how polished they are, some seem like early drafts. There are a couple of good stories, Mary Gaitskill's Today I'm Yours comes to mind. The collection reads like the result of a committee selection process, nothing too interesting or different has been included. I'd recommend another collection, such as Best of Tin House."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is literature, give me pulp","review":"I confess to giving up on this year's collection after reading about half of the stories, because, in fact, there wasn't a gripping tale in the bunch. Those I did read lacked dramatic tension, interesting characters and a distinctive author's voice. If these bloodless exercises are what high school and college students are introduced to as the \\"best,\\" it is no surprise so many conclude that reading as a chore and not a pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a collection of boring, pointless stories.","review":"My daughter was assigned this book over the summer for her IB English class so I read it along with her. I enjoyed reading the rest of her assigned books: \\"Pride & Predjudice,\\" \\"Travels w/Charlie\\" and \\"Frankenstein,\\" but have to say that BASS of 2006 was PAINFUL to get through. I admit to a preference for novels and might expect a bit more from short stories. These short story authors may know some of the mechanics of writing, but, with very few exceptions, don't have a compelling story to tell. There is nothing like an O. Henry or \\"Incident at Owl Creek Bridge\\" among them - no plot twists, no surprises, nothing to make a story memorable. I don't blame Ms. Kenison for giving up! Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" by Kurt Vonnegut or \\"Jump\\" by Nadine Gordimer. There you will find stories that surprise and amuse you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linen Water Spray for your bed linens","review":"Sonoma Lavender Linen Water is a nice spray for your linens. It isn't the BEST that I have found, but it certainly is better than most. It does not have a heavy lavender smell, in fact, that is the only complaint I have is that the smell is alittle too faint. As the spray dries you need the smell to last, if it is to faint then you won't have much on your linens. This spray works well though, and if you spray it on your pillow cases you will see that you do sleep much better. Aromatherapy really works! This is the best so far that I have found. The price is very reasonable and you will quickly find that you can't live without it! Sleep well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stained a favorite blouse","review":"ACK!

Unfortunately, this is not the record to prove this particular point. The whole affair is overblown and overdone, and only occasionally you can catch a memorable idea. Of course, the wedding of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, was pure kitsch, and the record lives up to that, but too much is too much. The intro to \\"Heraldry\\", which you can hear on the site, can only be considered a bad joke, but one I did not get, especially considering the more jazzy and quite lively middle part of the piece. \\"When Summer Comes\\" is a nice ballad, one of the more memorable tunes on the record, but in general this is simple Big Band pop, something which was far better done by the likes of Wes Montgomery and others. Not a highlight in Peterson's career. I wonder why this should be an \\"Orignal Jazz Classic\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice compact unit, seems well made.","review":"Nice compact unit, seems well made.

If you are a Scientology staff member for very long, eventually you will see this book, either in this form, or a photo copy. This is the book that they use to train all staff on how to hard-sell Scientology services and materials to the masses. This is one of the few books that LRH mentioned and liked so its now permanently part of their teachings. It is a very short and crappy sales book, that can be read cover to cover in an hour or two. It is very basic and does not have many examples or techniques. Thousands of Scientologists all over the world have been drilled on the techniques in this book. Don't waste your money, just get a more modern sales book that is more well known and has more and better examples.

Its hard to pick a single favourite but, STRONG, MILLENIUM, NO REGRETS, WIN SOME,LOSE SOME and JESUS IN A CAMPER VAN are among the very best cuts on the album.

This quote shows the link: (p. 123) \\"...subordination of State to Law - human law is the sign of God's righteousness and the state is the sign (and not only the sign) of spiritual authorities.\\"As a historical piece that reflects the concerns during the reconstruction of France, this was interesting. Does the argument still offer coherence today? I would suspect from a postmodern or deconstructivist French perspective it does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great find!!","review":"I have it on a tape, I tried to get it on CD when it came out.

This video is very well made and I like that it showed a variety of candle making techniques and showed each step of the way, the candle made in sand was very cool and I like that it takes the all natural process even a step further.

Skin feels perfectly clean. I can tell a difference when I stop using it. The flakes around my nose reappear and my skin looks drier than usual because the dead skin is still hanging out. Much easier on your skin than using a scrub or a washcloth to exfoliate. It's chemically based and extremely gentle. When I run out of Aqua Glycolic cleanser, I go back to using ProActiv and my zits come back and my skin looks rough again. I don't use any physical exfoliants anymore and my skin looks great.

You get to be Sandy Cheeks, Patrick Starfish, and of course, SpoungeBob Squarepants. I can sit and play it for hours! I gave this game 5 stars because of the animation (it's in 3-D and the technique's not cheesy at all), the voices (they sound exactly like the do on the show), and most of all, how fun the game is. It's not like Mario for Super Nintendo, where you follow a path and that's it, it's more like Mario Sunshine, where you can go all over the place, like an adventure type deal. There are about 10 Stages and somewhere around 10 levels within the stages. This is a good game to just sit, relax and play for hours.

Everett's review on this one and I see we're definitely not the majority. Unlike her, I did manage to finish it-how I don't know-it was a struggle to keep turning the pages. Carly was naive, immature and cold and grinded me from the very beginning and Hank, trying to be an honorable guy, instead turned into a shmuck. I found it hard to believe that mere days after sleeping with him, she knew she was pregnant. She was a real dink to Hank for what happened in the truck and wouldn't accept her own responsibility until the book was nearly finished. He spends most of the book blaming himself for what happens to her and she spends just as much time blaming him. However, Anderson is a good author and she has written some great books. This just wasn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Catherine Anderson???????","review":"She is one of the few authors who ALWAYS make it to my \\"keeper\\" shelf. This time???? BIG MISS!!!! I gave this one to the Used Book Store as soon as I finished. Why? The first half of the book was a textbook and the second half was the most forced love story I've ever read.

In Blue Skies, we get page after page of visual cortex this and visual cortex that.... instead of character development. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i could have changed the channel","review":"This book reads like a bad Lifetime network movie. The female protagonist can be dramatic, selfish, mean, and unwillingly to take responsibility for her own actions, yet all anyone can talk about is how sweet and wonderful and strong she is. The hero of the story bends over backwards, jumps through hoops, stopping just short of begging her to be with him. The story was just blah. There was so much more time spent talking about her blindness than the pregnancy that forced them together in the first place, I was mainly bored throughout the whole book. I usually pass on the Lifetime movies and I should have passed on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated carly","review":"I really hated Carly. She blamed Hank from the beginning. It was her choice to get drunk that night and loose her virginity. He did not force her. I don't care if he was drunk. She is responsible for her own actions don't but blame on other people. Being blind all her life should not have been an excuse. I hate women who use a baby as a possession against a man. I don't care what he has done to you that does not mean you have to keep his child away from him. Carly was just childish. She was 28 but settled things by not talking but acting like a big baby. Everything was about her. I honestly wanted Hank to leave her. She was not a good person . They kept saying how sweet she was but I saw a mean selfish person. Overall story sounded like it was going to be good but only made me mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"Blue Skies is a dime a dozen, cliche modern-day cowboy/rancher romance with an innocent ignorant heroine and a hunky chauvinistic womanizer hero. The dialogue is corny and clumsy. The characters are superficial and underdeveloped. The plot has been done before. Pickup at a bar, one night stand. Pregnancy. Hero does the honorable thing--marries the heroine temporarily just until the baby is born, blah, blah blah. So what. Secondary characters introduced so that you'll supposedly be compelled to buy the other Coulter saga's--if you have to , use the library instead.And the medical diagnosis for the blindess is written like a clinical college lecture--too forced for me.I've read other Catherine Anderson novels that I thought were a lot more entertaining than this one. Definitely not worthy of the overall 4-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointed in this one!","review":"One of the authors that I never miss a book from but was really disappointed in this one.CORNY dialogue and stiff, unbelieveable charectors made this book a real disappointment from this usually great author.

A couple weeks later I was watching an older X-Men with my brother and it was about Hank (the Beast) helping treat a woman named Carly with blindness. She's able to see again and they fall in love. Catherine Anderson totally stole this story! At the least she should have changed the names! I was really disappointed, I was starting to like the series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real disappointment","review":"I've read all of Catherine Anderson's books, and by now I can practically write her plots for her. All of her characters are interchangeable, the women are completely helpless (although they are supposed to be strong and independent). But this book takes the cake. While I applaud the author for her use of disabled people, the writing for these two characters drove me insane. Everyone controlled Carly's life, and inbetween ridiculous conversations about why Carly had to live in an unsafe environment through which she could not navigate, we get the doctor's conversations full of medical jargon. This could have been SO much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one, Ms. Deveraux","review":"Hank Montgomery and Amanda Caulden's story kept the reader turning the pages. The friction was there with just the right shadowing of romance.

The story pits the daughter of a large ranch owner against a union organizer, both of whom didn't expect a riot. The story is well plotted and fast paced, but steps out of the normal light romance.

I still remember the story though. A crack team of German paratroopers are sent to England to kidnap or kill Prime Minister Winston Churchill. There's also an IRA gunman helping the Nazis on their mission. He gets romantically involved with an English farm girl.The story is very well detailed. The SS scenes are probably as realistic as they get. The Germans blow their cover when they try to rescue a boy from drowning in the English village of Studley Constable. This leads to the hold-up of hostages in a church. That's when the action really begins. Like Higgins states in the book, at least 50% of this story is documented historical fact. You have to decide for yourself how much of the rest of it may have actually happenned.If you like this book, also check out \\"The Dark Side of the Island,\\" one of Jack Higgins' lesser known books. It's another great adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book and the movie are really good","review":"I saw the movie when it first came out many years ago, and I also read the book then.

With the most interesting plot revealed in the summary and my interest in WWII, I chose it over the others. I was disappointed.The plot carries out relatively smoothly but with far too many changes in direction, switching point of views more often than necessary. The character's personalities are well-established, I'll give it that.But the point when this story picked up was in the last 80 pages or so; way too late for me to still be interested. At page 275 or so, I got interested in the book more, only to be thrown for a loop when I got to the ending. That ending was one of the most disappointing I've read in a long time. The revelation at the end, which was not straight out given to you, ruined a good portion of that book for me.Disappointing. Definitely not something I'd consider a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not catch my interest...","review":"I tried to get into this book, I really did, but it failed to capture me.I love espionage novels, 'Eye of the Needle' being a reallygood one, but this book... the characters failed to draw mein. It took some effort to finish it.Notice the number of times alcohol is mentioned in this book.People keep drinking as if they are paid for it...Try Frederick Forsyth instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated. Decent story but not a thriller","review":"After reading Robert Wilson's \\"Company of Strangers\\", and really enjoying it, I sought out another WWII thriller book and came across the Higgin series. I choose this book because supposedly it is his best.I was completely underwhelmed. I found the pacing slow and boring. Little character development and I honestly didn't care who died and who didn't.There was little emotion and it all seemed a bit too much like a story being told, but I wasn't in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read!","review":"I read this one a long time ago. It was incredible then. I recently re-read it. It's even more incredible now... Even though I know the plot, the end and have seen the movie...Higgins is a master. Just the idea of kidnapping Churchill in 1943. That probably would have changed the war, if not the outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity of characters make an interesting story","review":"Unlike some other books, this one presented the characters in a logical order, not cluttering up their backgrounds or popping them out of the blue before tying them to the story.The tale is credible, the characters likable, including the Germans, the Irish, and even Preston could be too if more work had been put into it. It may be hard to accept traditional enemies as being humans and even honourable but that is how life is.As practically everyone knows that Churchill lived to see the end of the war, it was not a real issue whether the Germans succeeded but the Higgins wove the tale in such an absorbing way that the reader actually forgets that and think it really could have been pulled off. In fact, the last part of the book hinted that it could have as easily really happened, that the team succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE EAGLE Has Landed","review":"i enjoyed the book; well written & flow of story moved right along, would highly recomend book to others.will read other books written by author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best WWII Thriller","review":"This is a great book. If you like thrillers and a war setting then it's a must. The WWII scene can seem a bit tired in some stories now and the Germans just caricatures - people without feeling, sense or moral dillemmas. What was so inventive in this book is it is written from the German perspective about a special forces type raid into England to take out Churchill. However the men chosen for the mission are full of doubt over the validity and direction of the war and what they are being asked to do under the Nazi regime. Thus Higgins develops some deep characterisation and we want it to work out well for these guys, even though it probably won't. The book is well structured and well written - Higgins at his prime, in my view, as the Sean Dillon series quickly descended into a formulaic process of screwing on a carswell silencer and taking a swig of bushmills every second page. Skip that go back to this book - it really is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eagle Has Landed","review":"The Eagle Has Landed is just an excellent story. Higgins does a nice job building the piece and characters into what becomes a plausible action tale. There is not a lot of symbolism or hidden meanings, just a straightforward action adventure. It is a tough book to put down! I definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUNNING WORLD WAR 2 THRILLER!!!","review":"Jack Higgins is a genius. This book was outstanding. The movie doesn't compare to what the book offers. A pleasure and a great joy to read. Highly recommended to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Higgins Created a New Formula with this One","review":"First published in 1975, The Eagle Has Landed, sets up a wild adventure with an incredible cast of characters to carry it out (and to meet it). The professional and highly capable Oberst Steiner is very engaging as is the enigmatic and charming Devlin. It is a fun romp with decent historical accuracy. What Higgins did so successfully is to have the reader confused about who they are rooting for! I love the line from Steiner, \\"Difficult decisions are the privilege of command\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Eagle Takes Flight","review":"'The Eagle Has Landed' is Jack Higgins' first novel and it's easily one of the best WWII novels I've ever read. Higgins' masterwork is the daring tale of a German plot to kidnap Winston Churchill from a coastal English town. The story is fast paced and the characters are well drawn. Paticularly facinating is Higgins' depiction of Heinrich Himmler. A wonderful story in the tradition of 'The Day of the Jackal.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story","review":"Well written, the story was believable and held my attention.

I received my 3 bottle shipment only to discover that Watkins had changed the product! They changed the label, but hey, most products change their label, no biggie. WELL, they changed more than their label! The lotion now is kind of greasy and it smells more like lemon furniture polish! YUK!! I called the Watkins company and the woman I talked to said that they have been getting complaints about the changes. Why would they change such a good product? The only reason I can think of is, of course, greed! The stuff is not inexpensive as it is. I plan on returning my purchase and looking elsewhere for a better product.

Top comedians and character actors of their day give wonderful examples of the way the Brits perceive and imagine other nationalities behave. All built around the early days of flying, the pompous upper class played by Robert Morley, the free-wheeling Americans and, in particular, the British scallywag played so well by Terry Thomas ably assisted by his flunkey Eric Sykes. Not to mention the Fire Chief played by Bennie Hill in a style he is the out and out master of.If you like to laugh, this is for you.Just down right good entertainment for the whole family"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent Movie With Flying Machines!","review":"A wonderful movie with wonderful machines. Make sure you see the special features with info on the aircraft. I am a real aviation buff, and build and fly vintage R/C models. I watch it more for the planes, but the story and acting is good also. It's truly amazing what flew in the early years of manned flight. The models flown in the movie are good modern reproductions with upgraded safety features and slightly more powerful engines. Yes, there were actual flapping wing planes. This is a fairly factual movie of a typical early air race, tho it needs much more dust, dirt, grease, smoke, fire, and grunge. And we can't forget the real facts of mortality which these pioneers faced."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most enjoyable movies I've ever watched","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful movie. I have watched it again and again. It seems to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, yet it was a very good old fashioned, innocent, and more professional humor than most other comedies. I think it is a work of art and should be added to DVD format. Being that much of my family is German, Gert Fröbe was my favorite character. A funny and warm resemblance of the Prussian gentleman of the time. All the national characters were funny too. Terry Thomas was wonderful and gave me plenty of laughs. The Frenchmen and the Italian (Emilio) were great too. You will just feel naturally happier after you watch this movie. Don't even hesitate to buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesson 101 in Laughter!","review":"\\"Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\\" is one of those movies that you couldn't care less what critics have to say. As a measure of its success it was spawned by \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\\" and followed by \\"The Great Race\\" and \\"Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies.\\" I'm just enough of an old geezer that I attended the openings of all these movies back in the day. If critics ever take into account audience reaction to assist them in determining a film's success it should have been clear to them in the early stages that \\"Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines\\" was a hit just by listening to the seemingly continuous laughter. And, with a cast the likes of Stuart Whitman, Sarah Miles, James Fox, Robert Morley, Gert Frobe, Jean-Pierre Cassel and Terry Thomas, et al, how could 20th Century Fox miss? Simply put, for me, it's one of those rare DVDs you can pop into your player, sit back and forget about a troubled world and laugh for 138 Minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent Men/Flying Machines","review":"Another entertaining 1960's comedy with some interesting flying machines, not to mention, Sarah Miles, Red Skelton, and Stuart Whitman!

For those that are new to this, alternate it with your usual body cleanser to get used to it.After using this regularly along with my glycolic lotion and vit E lotion, I'm left with smooth and more even toned skin. My only wish is that it had a higher percentage of glycolic acid. Even though it's not made for the face I have used it on my face at the most two times a week as I didn't want to irritate my skin.

Fifteen year old Tamara has lived in a different house every year, with only her parents and her brothers as constants. She decides that this move, to yet another rented house, will be her last! The story goes that this one was abandoned by parents who couldn't stand the grief of the death of their beloved son who died of leukemia the year before. Her father is an artist who needs new things and landscapes to paint, hence the moves, and her mom, a radical, too political woman, gets desperately ill later on. There's humor to go along with the serious melodrama and poetic writing that will keep you thoroughly engaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic characters on a bittersweet canvas.","review":"This story is told from the perspective of a 15 year-old daughter of atheist parents who move to a new house every year so her father has new landscapes to paint.

Fortunately, there are humans trained by the \\"good\\" aliens to stop them. This book is a lot about spirituality and the warrior muse. It is a refreshing intake, different from the usual macho mentality in those kind of books.Sadly, I was expecting more character development in some of the supporting cast, like Kabiki, the sister of Jamila (a character in the first book).However, this book is superior to the first in every way and recommended strongly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single Man Screaming","review":"This book and the message is so moving.

I love the way he connects with the past to give a lesson on faith, spirituality and change in humans. This book signifies change in our brothers and I can not wait to see the positive effects of the change.

I also enjoyed the inspirations that accompanied each chapter. As a single black woman, I remember the relationship \\"games\\" all too well and I particularly enjoyed the Inspiration titled \\"Game Time\\". This novel was enlightening, inspiring and entertaining.

The bubbles are okay but they shoot out cold air, which makes it kinda chilly, and I noticed no thermal chances like the name states. Also, It is quite uncomfortable because the suction cups dont stay at the bottom of the tub, and I have an old ceramic tub, not plastic and it still doesnt stick. Whenever I sit up the mat floats up and shoots up air on top of the water level and I am constantly struggling to get the mat to stay down the entire time, so combined with the noise level and the cold chills from the air bubbles, i didnt get much enjoyment out of the spa mat and I hardly ever use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has endured many years as my favorite album.","review":"Though I enjoy music of many different genres, this album transcends genre for me somehow.

There is a version for older children, but my 4-year-old isn't old enough to write a list of words on a sheet of paper.

That's saying something, since the latest installment has jet fighters, truck crashes, freeway collapses, cool hacker guys and cool hacker bad guys.This first \\"Die Hard\\" is a classic. Sure, it's not completely original (what is?), but it puts together fast-paced action, a wise-cracking hero, a skyscraper to fight in (and destroy), and great cop-buddy chemistry. There's more, of course: 1980s cynicism and corporate greed--but you already know about that.

His performance did not seem made up, but as a real guy in a bad place. Alan Rickman played a great badguy and Bonnie Bedelia played a smart part as Willis's wife stuck with the other hostages. A great and believable film with a down right great director (John McTiernan) this film is all the goods. Great sound, music score and visual effects! Also superb action! Grade:A-"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: Willis","review":"Die Hard is finally available on DVD. I'd rather see it on the big screen, but of course, I'll take the DVD. It does not disappoint. The picture is superb, sound crisp and the overall effect is light years past the grain and static of the well-intentioned video. But a video cannot contain this film.

And so will you, especially on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, good transfer","review":"I'll not waste anyone's time with a review of this movie, everyone's seen it by now. My comment on the DVD is: great. Even with my very basic home theater, I was able to enjoy the quality of the transfer. THX is my favorite of the surround systems, so I was glad to see that the producers used it for one of my favorite \\"kill 'em all\\" movies. The sound was clean and dynamic.

During the X-Mas party where he meets his wife, the 30 story building is taken over by terrorists and John manages to escape the takeover and hides from them inside the building. From here on, the action is non-stop. Exlposions, gunfire, helecopters, this film has got it all.

Several trailers and T.V. spots, audio and text commentary tracks, state-of-the-art animated menus, outtakes/deleted scene reel, magazine articles, and. . . an editing room for scenes from the movie!

Bruce Willis stars as John Mclaine who goes to a party which ends up being interrupted by a group of terrorists. Mclaine, the cop, obviously has to do something about this.This is the best action movie ever with some wickedly cool scenes. Bruce Willis proves that he is a great actor with some great lines (yipikaye mother f#$%^*) and when he curses at the lady at the police station on the phone because se thinks that it's a prank.

Die Hard has got to be one of my favorite action-comedies. It has got some great action in it and some very un-expected humor. This movie was the movie that changed all action movie fans' lives.For all the people who don't what DIE HARD is about here it is: John Mclane is a New York cop who is seperated.

So, wearing only a beader, khakis, and bear feet, John is a one man team out to stop the terrorists and save his wife.This movie is the perfect party movie, perfect friday night movie, perfect for almost any time.

Lombardo weaves together stories that are not only entertaining but also beautifully written. He describes his characters and environment so simply yet manages to capture every moment with such detail that the reader feels that he is a part of the story, standing right next to Petey in the Wallace Playlot or watching Petey's father load the bakery's delivery truck. Lombardo is a gifted writer, and the only way to better experience his narrative is to hear him read his marvelous work aloud."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Debut","review":"There are many passages of beauty in this brilliant first book. A \\"Winesburg Ohio\\" of the Italian working class enclave of Bridgeport on the south side of Chicago, Lombardo's book is written with tenderness, humor, and deep affection for people he knows well and a city he loves. Lombardo recalls the work of Stuart Dybek, but he is not as relentless, objective and hard-edged. This is gentler fiction, but it is very fine on its own terms. Funny and touching passages about his moralistic and loving father (not unlike the bus driver father in \\"A Bronx Tale\\") ,about his father's emotional reaction to a Tony Bennett recording, about Italian working people, and about a chance meeting with a first love in a laundromat are haunting.

I have read many complaints about her books, how unrealistic some of the stories have been. But I love these books.They are fun to read. Don't analyze the books, just have fun. I have had a hard time putting them down. \\"Sorry Shadow (my blue merle collie), but mom is reading her book - just lay down beside me so I can pet and read at the same time\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I love James Quinlan. To me, this is the finest and best in this FBI-based mystery/romance series by Coulter. I have re-discovered Coulter because of this series and love most of what I've read. I especially like the spunkiness of Sally and the tenderness and intelligence of Quinlan. We are introduced briefly to Dillon Savich, who is prominent in the rest of the series. I would love to see more of Quinlan as a major character, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Whenever I am off from school and have nothing better to do, I either go to the bookstore or the library and get a pile of Catherine Coulter books. Unfortunately, this time I got my hands on \\"The Cove\\". I was a bit taken aback from the very beginning, because the hero was not given any depth. Random thoughts and descriptions of other peoples' perception of the man were the only clue given to the reader about his personality. It would have been funny had it not been so painfully annoying and boring. The heroine was a very odd character. She had no depth and all I could discern about her was that she was confused and acted pretty stupid, despite Coulter's attempts at infusing some intelligence into the woman. I would recommend that no one read this book, because it will probably only result in a headache and a lot of wasted time. Read the \\"Bride\\" series by Coulter. Those books actually seem like romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is just too ridiculous...","review":"I've been starving for good murder mysteries lately and I can't get enough of them. This book does not fall into that category. I read this book all the way through, but I wouldn't have if it hadn't been for all the crazy stuff that happened, which I guess kept it from being completely boring. It really was just ridiculous. I think it was very poorly written, somtimes hard to read/understand, and conversations between characters were too lengthy and sometimes one sided. Just a silly, silly book. Because of this, I will probably never pick up another book by Catherine Coulter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This was an amazing book. It was the first book of hers that I read that was not a historical romance and I was very pleasantly surprised by it. Great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me wondering what was going to happen next","review":"I loved this book, I enjoyed the suspense and the romance between Quinlan and Sally.I have read 3 of Cathrines book and I still have 6-8 more to read.

A lot of thrills, chills and love in the air. Just when you think you have it figured out...you don't. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply great","review":"The Cove was the first Catherine Coulter's mystery novels I've ever read and I must say it made me want to go straight to the nearest bookstore to buy the others. I kept wondering all the way long about the mystery: totally gripping! give it a try, it's worth it, I don't know why some readers found it boring...do we have the same concept of the word???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Coulter's best","review":"I've read some of Coulter's historical romance novels, and enjoyed them, but this is not one of her better efforts. I'm halfway through the book, and am persisting only to find out the solution to the mystery. The characterizations are inconsistent--at times, characters change attitudes practically mid-sentence. I half-expect the villains to be wearing top hats, capes, and twirling black mustaches. The dialogue is amateurish and silly. I know that she has re-written other books of hers, and I think that this one needs the same treatment, because it reads like a book written by an adolescent who only imagines what adults say and do. I will probably try one more in this series to see if the books improve, but not until I \\"cleanse my palate\\" with a few other books. ETA: I have now finished it, and the ending was so contrived that it really wasn't worth my time--time I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilling...","review":"I purchased this (used) on the recommendation of a friend, who referred to this book as the first in a series of \\"FBI thrillers\\". What a mistake. I guess I should have realized that this was not what I was looking for when I read on the back cover that it was a \\"romantic\\" thriller. The characters were unrealistic, the dialog juvenile, the \\"romance\\" was painful to read, and the plot was absolutely absurd. The main character, a FBI \\"special agent\\", supposedly gifted at interrogation, ended up beating his suspects more than interrogating them, and breaking more laws than upholding. This book had nothing whatsoever to do with the FBI or thrillers. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably poorly written","review":"How does an author like this get published even once, let alone again and again? Speaks volumes about the reading public. This book reads like a bottom end 'made for tv' movie. One reviewer said it was like a high school story made up around a campfire... couldn't agree more, except at least the campfire crowd would not have pretended the story was plausible. The characters, the plot, the setting, are all so far fetched the only reason my husband and I finished it was for the entertainment value, even though the childlike writing made us cringe. I mixed Coulter up with the entertaining Patricia Cromwell, which is another reason we kept plowing through. I'm sharing this with anyone who loves good writing. Don't waste a moment of your time on this junk. There's too many good books in the world to spend on crap like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense, Suspense, Suspense.","review":"I enjoyed The Cove. I could feel Sally's terror each time the \\"Doctor\\" came at her with the needle. I enjoyed all the main characters as they were well conceived. I felt some of the secondary characters were a little stiff/cardboard. This book is a keeper. I could not put it down. I loved the added \\"twist\\" of the inhabitants of The Cove. I am looking forward to \\"The Maze\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alfred Hitchcock would have been jelous of this book!","review":"Small towns just lost their utopian imagery. I will never look @ small towns the same again. This book offers the perfect escape from our hectic lives.

They are much more enthralling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is a terrible book. I have not read this author before and won't try again. I checked the Kindle edition out of my library so fortunately I didn't waste any money. I didn't finish the book. It is that bad. Unbelievable characters, horrible premise, poor dialogue... Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book was f'ing horrible! I couldn't even get through it. I know it was written in the mid-90s but come on. The way the characters talked was irritating. Who the hell says \\"Damnation\\" anyways? The heroine - if you can call her that - was flimsy and not substantive at all. I found it hard to believe that a determined FBI agent would fall for her. Whatever the \\"mystery\\" was it didn't hook me at all. Everything felt disjointed. I'm thinking the latter part of the series may be better since its more contemporary, but I don't know if I'll ever get to it. Definitely skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read. I wouldn't know where to begin to try and explain all the things that I didn't like about this story or the way it was told. It was simply beyond belief. That there was any positive reviews just goes to show, to each his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wasn't Impressed","review":"I love to read the historical-romance novels written by CatherineCoulter, but my advise is to skip the mytsteries. The Cove was predictable, and left me sorry I'd wasted the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired and Untrue","review":"I used to like Catherine Coulter's books quite a bit. But I have to say that \\"The Cove\\" was so contrived that I could barely finish it. The romance was weak, the plot overblown and unrealistic. Plus, the heroine was so stupid she set my teeth on edge. Every move she made seemed like a ploy to keep the book from ending when it should have...on page 50. I'm sorry to say it, but if you want good romantic suspense, go with Linda Howard's \\"Now You See Her\\". You'll never be satisfied with this stuff again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!!","review":"I know I'm in the minority, but I found this book incredibly boring. The dialog was stilted and forced. It lacked suspense, was long winded and beyond unbelievable. The only thing I felt for any of the characters was pity - they appear in such a bad book. I got to page 81 and couldn't go any further. This is my first Catherine Coulter and it will be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"I read some of the other reviews, and I agree and disagree with what was being said.Yes, it did get boring at times, but the last 3-4 chapters made the entire experience worth it!Perhaps I'm just not as good a guesser as others, but I was caught completely off guard and surprised by the ending.Most books don't make me say things out loud, but this one did.So, I say check it out!What's there to lose, besides time that would just be wasted on something else?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published?","review":"The biggest mystery here is: how did this tripe get published? The story is something like an English murder mystery, but it's completely undone by its cardboard characters, flat tone, halting pace, and randomly shifting points of view. Coulter sums up dialogue when she ought to let her characters speak, and sentences meander in tortured ways. Most disturbing is the omniscient point of view--a writing technique that went out of favor after the nineteenth century. She tells the reader what one character is thinking or feeling, then shifts to the thoughts and feelings of another character--all in the same paragraph. Besides being unnecessary and amateurish, it saps the suspense from the story and defeats reader empathy for the characters. After a few chapters I knew I was wasting my time and put it down, though I read a few pages at the end to find out if solution to the mystery was as predictable as I thought it would be. It was."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"She is one of my favorite authors and I have enjoyed almost all of her books. This one keeps you on the edge of suspense. Definitely worth your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Book started out okay, although I didn't sympathize with Sally/Susan too much. One minute she's smart enough to escape a pschiatric hospital by hiding drugs under her tongue. Next she's too stupid to not be found whenever she runs. She was an idiot. I don't like when women are constantly weak, frail, pathetic, and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself!","review":"Not often do I start a book and am not able to finish it. This one was suggested for my book club and was painful to read. The Cove is pretentious, confusing, lacks basic structure and is overall bad. I cared nothing for the characters, as schizophrenic as they were. Multiple plots divided my lack of attention and found me pleading for the book to end. Trust me; spend your precious time reading something, anything, else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, trite, trite.","review":"This is a less than one star book. It is a waste of time and effort. A huge disappointment. I is just Awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"childish","review":"This book is a good example of why authors like Elizabeth George, Ursula Hege, Michal Connelly are enjoyed so much. \\"The Cove\\" was childish, no suspense, and where the author says on the cover that \\"Yes, I actually scared myself a couple of times\\", I have to wonder what it was she read.I'm disgusted with myself for wasting the time that it took to read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars for this One","review":"This was a ridiculous story, poorly written. I have rarely encountered a more implausible plot. The plot twists, while completely absurd and thoroughly unbelievable, were also completely predictable. No thought or research whatsoever went into the police and FBI procedure and the result was a wildly imaginative farce. The attempts to portray the \\"heroine\\" under the influence of drugs, brain-washing and abuse made her seem incredibly gullible and certifiably insane-- not very likeable and certainly not someone that a normal person could relate to. The \\"hero\\" was a Neanderthal, and a thoroughly unethical FBI agent. This book is truly a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot, poor writing","review":"The plot of this book was interesting if implausible. However, the dialogue and timing were odd and choppy. Not well written"},{"rating":"1","title":"No idea why I read the whole thing!","review":"In my opinion, the worst book I have ever read bar none, and I have read some less than stellar writings in my lifetime. I too am sorry I had to give it 1 star...If you do not heed my warning to avoid this book at all costs, please do not waste your time trying to read it until it gets better as I did.

Besure to read the other two books in the trilogy, The Maze and The Target"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of book","review":"I have to say that I read this book very quickly because I wanted to see how it would end. Had I known there was going to be sexual violence in it, I certainly wouldn't have read it. I know it's fiction but still, it is very far-fetched. Everytime something happened to the \\"heroine\\" I kept thinking \\"oh not again!\\"... the bad things kept happening and happening and it was like \\"oh, just get ON with the story please\\". Really, if you want to read a mystery, read Agatha Christie. No sex, no violence just classic mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published?","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all, it was unbelievable, contained poorly written dialogue, and did not know when to end. Coulter tried to give her heroine as horrible a past as she could (without subjecting her to actual rape), but it was way over the top. Even the romance was tough to believe, especially that Quinlan, the FBI agent who fell in love with Sally/Susan (why make a distinction between the names?) would act so gaga in front of fellow agents is ridiculous. I am not going to read any more of the \\"FBI\\" series and hope that this review will keep you from reading also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"If this is your first Coulter book, don't give up. She really is a talented writer. But you would never know it from this book. I am a Coulter fan, and I was very disapointed in The Cove. the writing/story was more for the teenage group. I knew what was going to happen before it happened, there were no suprises. I found Sally's behavior to be frequently stupid. Who would continue to mouth off when they are being hit in the face and the ribs?? She did this frequently. I finished the book because I have this thing about leaving something unfinished, but, believe me I kept counting how many more pages to go. I'm hesitant to read anymore of Coulter's mysteries. However, she is very good with historic romances. I'll just stick with those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I do this to myself??!!!!","review":"I know her books make me mad when I'm done...yet I keep reading them, WHY ME????This book had the typical 2 plot storyline where one doesn't really have to do with the other. This book contained evil geriatrics, sadistic \\"fathers\\", a weak-kneed woman, and a hunky-yet-burdened- FBI agent. Put that all together, and you've got the COVE...I have to give her kudos, though, she keeps you interested, but the pay off is like buying $100 lottery tickets and winning nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Ever...","review":"I am sorry I have to give this book a star. I have to put it into the category of the worst I have ever read. A friend (I now question the friendship!) recommended Catherine Coulter and lent me her copy of The Cove. The book began in a fairly intersting tone, but I found I was always waiting for something to really happen! The characters have absolutely no depth and as for Sally St. John, she is an insult to the world of fictional characters! The dialogue amazed me in this book; I had the feeling that a 12 year old had written it, although if that were true, it probably would have been more sophisticated. Anyone who enjoyed this novel must not have much reading experience. It was written on a 3rd grade level, full of bad grammar, cliches and poorly connected dialogue. I felt like the characters were very uneducated, even though a special agent would not be and Sally supposedly worked on Capitol Hill. What a joke! This is my first and last Coulter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm.","review":"I'm not sure if it is just the Kindle version, but there were so many errors. Missing words, misspellings and grammatical errors that detract from smooth reading. Plot is ok, but not developed well. Some parts are hard to follow, where conversations have one character speaking two paragraphs so you have to re read to who is saying what. Again, this distracts from the story. In other words, I had to put the book down (as opposed to couldn't put down), and the sad part of it was not the story, it was tiring to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"Looking for a new author to read and made the mistake of checking this one out. This book was horrible! I read for about an hour and decided to not punish myself by reading the rest of the book.Completely far fetched and dialogue very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am surprised I finished it","review":"Normally I have found amazon reviews to be very helpful, looking at the general rating I can find good books to read and skip the bad ones. I fail to understand how this one has such high rating and this is the first time the reviews got it wrong for me. I was listening to the audio and many times I was going \\"what ?!\\" out loud (alone in my car of course :) There are so many loopholes, it could be used in the class to teach how not to write a mystery or romance. The one star is for occasional one-liners that were funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Saturday Matinee\\" material","review":"I didn't read the Coulter FBI series in order, so I know that this isn't her best work in the series. I went back to this one for background information on one of her recurring characters. It is a good \\"light\\" read and shows off Coulter's strengths - characters and setting of place. I FEEL like I could drive to this town and know my way around. She has a wonderful way of making you feel the wind in your face and hear it howling around the eaves of the house. As stories go, it's \\"eh\\". I highly recommend others in the series - The Maze, Riptide, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joining the Minority","review":"I apologize for all you Coulter fans but OMG can just one of her FBI series books not follow the formula: Big strong FBI man meets damsel in distress and two weeks later decides he want to marry her and have babies? Ugh. I read these sorts of books for the suspense and the mystery which for the most part she does fairly well; however, it is so mired in the thinnest of sexual undertones that it can be hard not to discount the whole storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First-- Can't wait to read the rest of the series","review":"I read incredibly fast and so I am always looking for a good read by an author that has published many titles (so I have somewhere to go if I like the book). This is the first in the \\"FBI Series\\" Coulter writes. It's pretty good. The plot moves quickly, and definitely has you guessing at the end about what is happening in this sleepy little town they call \\"The Cove\\". Some of it's a little unbelievable, but that's okay with me. I liked it enough to pick up a couple more of her books in this series. I would recommended it to anyone who enjoys romantic suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously Suspenseful Puzzle","review":"\\"The Cove\\" is Catherine Coulter's first book in her \\"FBI Series\\" setting a fast pace of suspense, unbelievable treachery , danger and a maze of mysterious townsfolk that will seduce you into thinking that The Cove is a sweet sleepy little picture post card perfect town. Beware! Remember in true Catherine Coulter form we have to have a modest amount of romance just to smooth everything out!FBI Special Agent James Quinlan shows up in this sleepy little town under cover as a private investigator looking for a missing elderly couple but essentially has been tracking Sally Brainerd since her arms-dealing father, Amory St. John was murdered. Quinlan believes that Sally is the key witness and must be brought back. Little does he know that he has just stepped into an intricate web of deceit and he is completely unprepared for what befalls him?Just when you think that you have it all figured out you will get the surprise of your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I love all of her books. Good easy light reading. Something interesting to try to figure out while enjoying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard cutouts","review":"I finished the book because I had to see what happened, but I found it a disappointment. The plot was wildly improbable, the characters just cardboard cutouts. I guess I like something a little closer to reality, a little more believable, with some characters that feel real. Did you notice? Everyone was either incredibly wonderful or the epitome of evil. I'm taking Catherine Coulter off my list of authors to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read....","review":"I listened to this book on CD and while the reading was good the book was one of the worst I've ever 'read'. The plot was very convoluted and the entire book needed a very heavy editorial hand, there was much repetition of past events. I thought the heroine was a mess and the entire story set my teeth on edge. This is my first read of this author and I will NOT be reading anything else by her. I love good writing (Sue Grafton, Jan Karon, Sara Paretsky, Margaret Maron etc) so I don't intend to settle for sub-standard. I think the following quote sums up my feelings: \\"Reading good books ruins you for enjoying bad books\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"I had heard the Catherine Coulter was a good author to read so I started at the beginning with The Cove. I have forced myself to plow halfway through and am really seriously considering stopping. I keep thinking it's got to get better, right? I am constantly rolling my eyes at how ridiculous the characters and plot are and the just plain bad writing. I have heard others really like her books and maybe somewhere along the way she fine tuned her writing skill but this one is just really, really bad!If you like Fern Michael's books, then you will probably love it. She's another successful author that writes horribly!

I happened to read it third which may have colored my perceptions of it. I really enjoyed this book. I am glad that it has been reissued in hardcover as I now have a complete set. The mystery of who was the killer kept me guessing until the end. Catherine does an excellent job of keeping you in suspense in this book and it has many layers. I loved the characters in this book and really enjoyed getting to know them. Some of the following books in this series are better (The Maze and the Target), it is a little uneven in spots, but this is definitely a keeper and an excellent introduction to the workings of the FBI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every so often I come across a book & I gotta ask....","review":"Somebody actually got PAID for this? Is this supposed to be supsense? Question: Where's the suspense? This is my 1st Coulter novel & I'm really disappointed. Coulter relies too heavily on long passages of dialogue to tell the story and reveal character (personally I find that writing style not only annoying but ineffective). If u really want to read it, I recommend checking this one out at the public library but be sure to return it in time -- even a $0.25/day late fee would be too much for this dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a good book!!","review":"I tried. I honestly did try to get through this book but I finally had to admit that I was wasting my time. A friend of mine had suggested I read this author saying I would enjoy her books. If The Cove is any indication, then I think I'll have to pass on any of her other books. I found this particular book to be silly from the start. Plot, which one? And not that I don't like multiple plots, but there wasn't any depth at all to anything, including the characters. The conversations between the characters were almost juvenile. Don't get me wrong, I like a good love story mixed in with some intrique but the lack of a good foundation on the plot/s or characters in this book made the entire story unbelievable. I could go on but I won't. Suffice to say that this was the first, and last Catherine Coulter book for me. Just a badly written and thought out book all the way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally inane","review":"This was a terrible book. I will never read another Coulter book again.

I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. A monkey could write a better book. I bought the second in the series as well, but I am hoping I can get a refund for both. The plot was intriguing, but the writing is that of a teenager forced to write a book report. Actually, a teenager's book report is probably better than this. Don't bother. I can't select no stars, so it's only being give one star because Amazon is making me give it a star. Save your money and buy something better - a coloring book is better than this series. I still can't believe she has 18 of this so-called series.

The third use is for my chronograph when working up handloads for my rifles and it works great especially with the levels. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone at this great price.

I think that someone in the shipping house must have had a bone to pick with UPS because the tripod arrived in a box with an additional 5+ pounds of screws (see image gallery)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Low-End tripod","review":"For small, lightweight, pocket cameras, this is a decent tripod. And pretty handy for making panorama's.I use it for that, as well as a make-shift light stand. Be aware that it WILL move around and/or vibrate in a strong wind."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK product for the CHEAP price","review":"Overall quality is probably 3 stars.Price for the product is 5 stars.One thing that is nice about it is that it comes with 2 detachable plates so you can have it ready for your camcorder or camera, or just keep the extra one in the safe.UPDATE..............After having the tripod for a couple months now... I have realized it is alittle flimsy. For the basic need of family, or short shoots, it is good. However, if taking pictures in low light and want that long exposure, this tripod will be a hassel. I think eventually i will upgrade to a real tripod in the $200+ range. Until then, this will work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent light weight tripod","review":"Have gotten a lot of use out of this item.

I only used this a couple of times inside, never outside, and only for taking a couple of photos. The plastic sleeve with the thumbscrew to hold the center post in place snapped off in my hand without applying anything but the lightest pressure. Too late to return to Amazon, and to get it replaced or repaired by Sunpak involves me paying for postage. Not worth it. I will try and fix it with super glue, but don't expect it to be the same. Not recommended, spend a little more and get a real tripod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken, dirty, looks used.","review":"I received the tripod late, and when I opened the box and gave it a once over, i noticed a number of disappointments.1: It looks like it was rolled down a hill.

I have no idea how it broke off. I just pulled it out from under my bed to use it, and the handle was sitting next to it. My friend had one and an unimportant part of the plastic broke off, so I thought it would be fine. The tripod still worked. But with a broken handle, it is really hard to make vertical adjustments. It feels solid, but then has random bits fall off.Several people who gave it bad ratings said you should just spend a bit more and get a better quality. They are absolutely correct. Go to a camera store, check out the Manfrotto or Gitzo tripods, then come to Amazon to save 10-20%.

Good height extension, it's lightweight and the quick release plates are very handy. Unfortunately the locking mechanism for one of the legs gave out on me the 4th or 5th time that I used it.

The focus on the events on the city helps to present a clear understanding of the actions of the people, without distracting with too many distracting external details.The narrative starts with the pre-Jewish occupants, and acknowledges that Jerusalem has always been somewhat off the beaten path. However, ever since it became a holy city to the Jews, it has had a degree of sacredness that made it attractive to Jews, Muslims and Christians.For the past 1500 years, the western Christians are presented as the outside force most harmful to the peace in Jerusalem, with the Eastern Christians and Jews being most often victimized. The Muslims were often the rulers of the city, generally being the most peaceable of the overloads, though often even neglecting the city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biblically Inaccurate","review":"I was unable to finish this book because Karen Armstrong's Biblical references are so glaringly wrong.

Too much of this movie TRIES to be cute and funny and clever, and when the trying shows, it's a sure sign that it's not working.Some performances are spot-on. Almost all the bit parts are done beautifully. Tom Nardini as Jackson Two-Bears is outstanding and charming. But although Lee Marvin got an Oscar for his dual role as Kid Shelleen and Tim Strawn, I felt he was just too over-the-top to match the rest of the cast. Obviously the director didn't know how to rein him in...or chose not to.I don't praise the \\"wandering minstrels\\" Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole; rather, I find them annoying, intrusive, jarring, and self-serving. As for the songs they sing, for the most part they're eminently forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I enjoyed this in 1965, but 40 years later, it's painful to watch. Badly directed, the \\"comedy\\" is heavy handed and extremely forced, made worse by an inept supporting cast. Jane Fonda is adequate, but has zero chemistry with Michael Callan (who went on to have basically no career at all), thus depriving the film of a center, while Dwayne Hickman has nothing to do but stand around. Lee Marvin eats the scenery and the several laughs in the movie belong to him. But he tries too hard and is often as unfunny as he is funny. Despite his oscar, this is one of his worst performances. The song interludes wear thin very quickly, with the songs simply telling us what we've already seen. So even though it's not a long film, the songs make it seems much, much longer.

There's $20 down the drain. For twice the price right now, you can buy Felco pruners which is what I'm going to do right now. 2 stars as they worked nice before they gave out. I would probably risk another pair for $7-$8, but not at this price.EDIT (6/4/10): Kudos to Fiskars for coming through on their warranty.

Except for this one.The third time I used it the bolt on the floating axis on the lower lever popped out.

Now the idea is rather gruesome, but Swift is not meant to be taken literally. The idea was so show how ridiculous people were being, fighting over religion and economics, by showing an idea that, truly could have worked for the time and place if people were okay with child murder.

Shameful toy to sell for the high price. Caveat emptor!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work at all","review":"Bought this toy for our son for Christmas. Very cool looking toy but when we tried to turn it on; new batteries and all, still no power. No contact between the transmitter or the sub. Very disapointing, especially to our 8-year old who now has yet another plain old bath or pool toy. Hopefully I will hear back from the seller soon and get a new submarine to try again. I'm hoping this was just a defective product and not an overall representation of this toy from Swimline."},{"rating":"1","title":"A water toy that is not water tight.

After a few days we noticed the whole darn thing was full of water and the electronics wouldn't work any more. We gave it some time to dry out, and found it still wouldn't work. I tried to do a return, but was told I missed it by one day. Basically, I just took 31 dollars and flushed it down the drain. I thought Amazon stood by their products to a greater extent. I will think twice before I buy electronic products from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy didn't work","review":"Although this toy has great reviews I seem to have got a faulty one. Firstly it didn't dive then after 30 minutes in the pool it stopped responding to the RC (replaced batteries) and would only go in circles on the surface. Looks like a quality toy but it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken, and sold out so I could not get a replacement in time for Christmas","review":"This looks cute but neither the remote control nor the submarine worked, with new batteries in EACH. The sub has a red light on the front that lights, but the engine propellers would not function and work at all. The remote control had a fitting issue in the battery compartment and as long as I held the battery in, and did NOT put the battery closure back on, it would sometimes turn on; that wasn't helpful, however, because the sub did not even work. Fortunately the seller gave me a full refund and told me to keep it so now my son just plays with the broken sub in the bathtub."},{"rating":"1","title":"*****Electronic Disaster *****","review":"Bought this toy for my son for Christmas. When it got warm enough to use in the pool, It worked for about 5 minutes, then the transmitter stopped working to control the sub. I found that if you place the antennae of the controller right next to the sub it would respond. I changed the batteries to ensure it had new batteries again and the same result. What a piece of junk !! I thought this was a quality product being that is was in the high forty dollar range. I will be contacting amazon t try to get this resolved, based on the other reviews, I see that ours is in line with alot of others. Waste of money in my opionion. My son is very sad an disappointed too, he is really into things like this at 6yrs old. He even thinks he had something to do with it not working and he didn't. Will keep you all updated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"Bought this for my son for Christmas. Out of the box, I did not work.

This was a replacement sub for one that died in the tub. Same issues, sub will only work if placed right next to the remote. When first taken out of the box the range is really good. After using it for say an hour, the range drops to nothing and the sub becomes virtually useless. It is highly probable that water gets into the electronics shorting them out. The only problem is that I can't find any water intrusion. Its a shame because otherwise it seems to be a decent toy. But if its not going to work except for one day, its not really worth it. My advice is to wait for the next revision to see if that works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I have this item it works very good.

It takes a little to get used to the format, specially when I had only used Lonely Planet before, but in the end it was a great purchase and a very good guide. This guide is divided into many little chapters; each one represents a tour, depending on what you want to see. I found those little tours to be breakable and able to be mixed, so you can get to see a little of everything.However, every guide you buy now, I think, must be complemented with fresh information from the internet, gathered through different websites, a couple of days before departing."},{"rating":"1","title":"can you imagine a plastic rule that doesn't work?","review":"Length:: 0:12 Minsthe shape of this rules is very odd, its like pump up from the ground, like having miniature angled walls at the sides, that means the numbers cant reach the edge (border) of the rule, so because of that to have some kind of precision or descent reading is almos impossible!...imagine that"},{"rating":"1","title":"did not recieve the pictured ruler","review":"I know the item title says assorted colors, but I was hoping it would still be transparent at the very least.

They don't last long, but they are interesting to see. Bart and Du Pre wrap this case up in usual fashion.Although some might think that Notches is a bit grim, I did enjoy it. Notches is the story of how Du Pre takes matters into his own hands regarding two serial murder's (skinned little girls keep showing up along Highway 2 and another highway that runs north and south...can't remember the name right now).

For that purpose, I highly recommend these at the price we paid ($9.99/set). Sheets made in India.PROS:1. Softer than comparable (non-sateen) twin sheets available at Target, Wal-Mart, etc. for children's beds.2. Inexpensive option to have your children sleep on soft sateen, although these are not the super-soft sateen we have on our bed.2. Price ($9.99)CONS:1. The sets do not match in color (shades are off within the set to varying degrees), so if you're trying to impress folks on your adult bed, these are not a contender.2. These are obviously seconds, e.g., the seams don't run straight on the pillow cases. Just like the discount t-shirts you get with the side seams that curve to the front or back.

Wish I had saved my money and bought a brand with quality I can trust.Referring to white and sage.Unhappy with the sheets as they washed not so well, wrinkles! They don't fit the mattress properly, a wee bit small--part of the mattress shows with the fitted sheet on (it being on as far as it will go, which is not a good fit) and the flat sheet is too short to be able to have the bed sheet height at the top of the bed as I would normally have with other sheets and to be able to tuck it in at the bottom. The pillowcases are also a tight fit. I actually only have 'full' size pillows on the bed as opposed to queen... as bed in question is a queen. So the pillowcases would not be ample on the queen pillows.Looking to return the two sheet sets for refund.I think I could have better luck at WalMart!Previous commenter...did you get a refund upon return since you were dissatisified?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for \\"cheap\\" sheets, you have found them","review":"These are by far the absolute worst sheets we have ever owned.

Other than that, the fabric is so soft to sleep on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft, cheap, what else do you want?","review":"Yes, these sheets do get very wrinkley, but IMHO comfort>appearance. They feel soft enough, and they're quite cheap (or at least they were--they don't seem to be availible anymore.) They do pill, but not enough for me to notice when I'm trying to fall asleep.A word of warning though, the photographs are very misleading. It seems as though they purposefully used strong lighting to wash out the colors. From the photo, sage looks like it should have just a hint of green, but the sheets I got were a horrible sickly shade of \\"hospital\\" green. I also bought a set of the \\"sand\\" color, which turned out to be a medium-light brown instead of a light tan.

After only a few showers, the material started to smell moldy at the bottom... so much so, that in less than the 5 months we've owned it, I've washed it at least 4 times! The polyester fabric holds the smell in.... So, I'm looking to try a cotton liner this time. Hopefully the cotton will not smell ... (Also to note, I bought two of these liners for 2 bathrooms). I only use one bathroom and my husband & son use the other ... so it's not like we have 10 people showering daily....in my bathroom, it's only me, and in theirs it's 2 people showering daily.

This fabric liner is so much lighter, looks *nice*, can be used alone (though I use a fabric curtain with this liner - simply I prefer the appearance) and is so easy to toss in the wash.Use this fabric liner with double hooks for a great appearance while improving the overall experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"Please stick with buying plastic/vinyl curtain liners.Even though it is suppossed to be water proof, it is FAR from it.The first time we used it, it made a big mess on the bathroom floor.Even aiming the water down on to the curtain, it leaks through.What a waste of money, and in this economy, we need every dollar.Don't buy this product!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"I should have followed my hunch with the description saying \\"water resistant.\\" It's fairly attractive and I was pleased at first, but soon some water started appearing on the floor.

After the 3rd wash all the water resistance was gone and I had water coming through the kitchen ceiling!! Makes a decent shower curtain (although as some said the creases don't go away), but as a liner it SUCKS!!! Off-gassing or not, I'm sticking with vinyl.

So far, hasn't gotten moldy or mildewed. The color is bright white and it has a striped pattern to it. It could be used alone and would look perfectly fine. I use it as a liner and have an outer curtain. When I'm done showering, I shake it off a bit and hang it outside the tub to dry. The fabric is nice and thick, but doesn't weigh too much.

This was a liner on a rather expensive designer fabric shower curtain and I'm not too happy that it left a rust stain on my expensive curtain.

I still have a couple left and plan to throw them away. The product is made in china so beware.I have now started purchasing the product at Walmart and PetSmart again.

This was a complex story with many elements involved; the film covers these points well. Michael Jayston's resemblance to Nicholas II is almost eerie; Tom Baker is an excellent Rasputin; and Janet Suzman is wonderful as Alexandra, who was a wife and mother above all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Czar, he goes!","review":"Good film about the Russian Revolution. Gives one a good understanding of the issues Nicholas dealt with, i.e, the Russo-Japanese War, the anarchists, the communists, his son's hemophelia, his wife and Rasputin. All of the issues and characters are here. One cannot watch this film and NOT feel for Nicholas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a great video.

The movie captures a well-suited cast, a remarkable screenplay, and stunning costumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant, Ambitious and, yes, Bloody","review":"N&A, though over thirty years old, still plays with the bravura and sweep that a big historical film epic should and that we expect. It has ripened well with time and has lost none of its power. The fall of the Romanovs and the rise of Soviet Communism would be an extraordinary cinematic undertaking in any age, but few contemporary film makers would attempt so ambitious a project. A shame really; our present epics are more about CGI instead of ... well, anything, and certainly not serious subjects like history. Looking at a film like Nicholas and Alexandra should make us realize how mainstream movies gave audiences credit for intelligence decades ago - and how they need to start doing so again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Loved everything ! it was on time and not a knock off like i thought it would be! if you want to get thrown into what is happening in Russia at this time, This is the movie for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"After I had read the book, I decided to look for the movie, we can never compare the book with the movie ... but it is pretty close the movie is like instead of walking you're jogging, they want to cover the whole book in lest them two hours, other then that they went by the book, the Winter Palace, the Sarko selo, the hemophiliac Alexis, and definitely the way they died. I will recommended it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Like Nicholas","review":"I appreciate other reviewers' lovely comments about the beautiful settings of this film but I was so irked by Michael Jayston's representation of Nicholas that I could not watch to the end. Michael Jayston is an actor I greatly respect and like but in this he showed Nicholas to be a humourless and very uptight man. What really irked me was the argument between Nicholas and Alexandra where Nicholas actually blames Alexandra for their son's haemophilia.Nicholas was a family man first and foremost; descriptions from those who knew him, speak of feeling at ease in his presence, and the warmth of his eyes and his smile. None of that came over in this film - instead he appeared to be permanently on the edge of exploding with temper.Having said all of that, the costumes, the era, the settings were beautiful.Most Beautiful Princess"},{"rating":"2","title":"review of Nicholas and Alexandra","review":"Tis is the story of the last czar of Russia and his family from the Russo Japanese war to theie execution by the bolshevics"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work :-(","review":"Hi -- When I attempted to play this movie, I couldn't.

Especially the pious Grand Duchess Tatiana showing her body to one of the Bolsheviks and crying to Olga about how \\"I am so pretty, I want a man, wah wah wah\\"... the characterizations of the Imperial Family, if you have read about them, are just so under-defined.

Ask the Dust is a brilliant work of prose and raw display of emotion that spills on to each page as if the mind of Fante was dictating words subconsciously into print. Incrediable Book with a great ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the greatest book I've ever read.","review":"This is the first and only John Fante book I've read. I am a Bukowski fan so I figured this would be a great place to start. Nothing could prepare me for such a book. Not only is Fante the best writer I've ever read, but also the greatest storyteller. Unlike Denis Johnson who is a great descriptive writer, but falls apart in his character development. Fante is better than Bukowski. Whereas Bukowski can at times be very scary, Fante just seems downright romantic, even at times of being an ugly person. I defenitely recommend this to fans of Bukowski, Denis Johnson, and even Harry Crews. Ask the dust is a phenomenal book. The ending is by far the best ending I've read, even better than the ending to Post Office, and that's saying alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, guys...","review":"Look, I like Bukowski and bought this book... on the recommendations...but so what? It has the reality and Tom Waits style urban edge to it, but too much is off or missing. From his simply wrong attitude towards soft drugs to the unsatisfying gotta-kill-em-off end, I was taken less by the atmosphere of LA in the 30's than the annoyances. Perhaps I should read it again...there is some honest writing here, but by no means five-star stuff. And I like this period and setting, and Chandler for that matter...."},{"rating":"1","title":"For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. -Genesis 3:19","review":"This Bible verse is a sober reminder of death- the grim situation of sinful mankind separated from a holy God. What does this have to do with the John Fante's book? The book is as bleak and hopeless as death itself. Some people enjoy reading about hopelessness, monotony, boredom and despair. I don't. Not only is the book uninteresting, but I don't even enjoy the writing itself. Most books either have good writing, or a good story- only the great ones have both. This one has neither, not even close. On top of its total lack of quality, the book is unnecessarily crude. I wish I could think of something positive about this book (usually there is something) but all I can think of is that now I know to avoid Fante's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"The protagonist has a very unique look on life that one does not really relate to well... he is however, a very interesting character. I liked this book and found it to be a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What would the dust say?","review":"I read this book because I like the tragic qualities of C. Bukowski's books; therefore, I assumed I would enjoy the writer who influenced Bukowski. I found Bandini weak and did not sympathize with him. He was his own worst enemy, and he still found it legitimate to moan and groan over his writing, expenses, and love interests. He senselessly degrades people and is perplexed when they do him wrong. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it.","review":"I read this book because several people with normally very compatible tastes in books with me recommended it. However, after reading this work, I just don't get the huge depth most other readers seem to find in this work. It just seems to me like another detached non-romantical romance that isn't very masterfully written. While the book is very non-assuming & direct, it lacks the substance its reputation carries. Want to read an \\"Ask The Dust\\" that's in your face & is a literary masterpiece, try Frank Norris' novel McTeague. Even though I seem to be the only person I know that doesn't really love this book, I don't think my opinion is off. This book doesn't \\"do\\" what it's \\"supposed\\" to do to me. The author's references to Aurturo Bandini (sp?) seemed more authentic than the exploits of the people in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring novel","review":"Despite being a useful piece of literary jigsaw for those interested in the author Charles Bukowski, this book has very little to reccommend it in its own right. It would seem Bukowski took Fante's idea for writing semi-fiction about his own experiences- circumstances, and added a whole lot of decent observation and humour. It does have a good ending but it comes way to late for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"How can a man write a simple book that reads as if it is up to date even though it was written 70 years ago? My answer: Fante was a genius. An over used word to be sure, but I think it is highly needed in this case.Bukowski said that Fante was his favorite writer and it is easy to see why. Ask the Dust is straight forward and yet compelling. Indicative of an American's struggle with the culture, yet uplifting.I don't have the ability to render Ask the Dust the praise that it deserves; I will just continue to cherish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparkling dust","review":"This book was a real discovery. I had never even heard of John Fante until I read about him in a book about Los Angeles literature. His (alter ego) character Arturo Bandini may come across as a narcissistic fool, but who cares when his story is conveyed in such achingly gorgeous--yet never wordy--prose? Fante evokes his character's surroundings with a lyrical concision that is admirable--and in a couple places nothing short of heart-stopping. \\"Then she was gone, and I sat with my teeth gritted, looking at a room like ten million California rooms, a bit of wood here and a bit of rag there, the furniture, with cobwebs in the ceiling and dust in the corners, her room, and everybody's room, Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego, a few boards of plaster and stucco to keep the sun out.\\" And: \\"My feet were cut when I put on my shoes and walked out of that apartment and into the bright astonishment of the night.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"ASK THE DUST will always be my favorite book.","review":"John Fante is quite possibly the least known of the great American writers. Mention his name to someone who hasn't read him and they will say they haven't even heard of him. Read one novel, particularly ASK THE DUST or THE ROAD TO LOS ANGELES, and you will wonder why you've never read him before. After reading ASK THE DUST, it is highly reccommended one read THE LETTERS OF JOHN FANTE AND H.L. MENCKEN for the story behind the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, amazing writer","review":"The copy I have has the Bukowski intro and anyone can see why Bukowski loves this book. It is so fresh, so well written, it could have been written today, except we don't have writers this good today (IMHO).I heard of the book when I heard an interview with the author's son (whose book sounds good too and his son has led a Bukowski-like life). He said his Dad stopped writing novels when he became a screenwriter (making over $1000 a week in the 30s - a lot of money) but he said his Dad was always a true novelist. I'm not a writer, but this book inspires one to write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love LA","review":"Fante inspired Bukowski to write his lurid tales of degradation and redemption. They both had a lot of hate in them, and they went on to show us dark corners of their souls most writers avoid.

You would think that those two together would come up with something really amazing, but that is not the case. The problem is with Oscar Peterson. He is technically brilliant as always, but... he plays SWING PIANO almost through the entire album. A duo of this kind is a unique opportunity, and I would have expected Oscar Peterson to think through the possibilities that this opportunity offers and come up with an original, integrating accompanying style. Instead, he plays a boring stride background behind Dizzy Gillespie over long passages, which can hardly be inspiring for the trumpeter. The result is that each of the two plays his own stuff, almost without interaction.

The details provided a good visual picture of the city, the characters, the method of crime investigation, and daily life of the period. I couldn't put it down until I finished it. But.....the ending did not deliver. Things that were fascinating such as the search and discovery of both the fig tree and thumb stolen from Dora's corpse were left unresolved.The title clearly implied that the \\"fig\\" was an important element of the plot - it was dropped......who excavated the body and stole the thumb. Clearly the implied murderer was not drawn as a gentlemen capable of getting his hands dirty. So, was it Jofsez the gypsy? How did syphillis figure in? The story seemed to imply that it was going somewhere with the disease. Ultimately, I was disappointed in this book which started out great, held my interest, and fell flat and left me feeling dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about atmosphere?","review":"I was expecting to read about a murder, an investigation and a determination of facts. Instead I was continually drawn in to Ms. Shields research into Vienna's culture and her fascination with Gypsy mythology. Her writing seems to be pointed toward admiration of her own skillful research rather than creating a believable narrative.Only three people are given any voice in the story. She populates the book with a dozen characters who have no personality. I would have liked to get to know Herr Zellenka, Phillip, Otto, Egon, Franz....And, as usual in today's writing, Ms. Shields includes mention of sickening and gory affairs. After all, we have to let people know all this has been happening for centuries. What? Bestiality is still wrong. It doesn't improve by arbitrarily tossing it into a new book.The \\"atmosphere\\" is heady, but that's all there is to the book. The rest is just a sick plot without a real beginning or end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fig Eater or Where is the Fig?","review":"Ms. Shields decided to slap all her meticulous research on the pages instead of turning it into art.

It started out well, with a wonderful location and time period, unusual characters, engrossing atmosphere, and a shocking crime.Unfortunately, it all came apart very quickly. The Inspector and his wife evolved from unusual to overwrought, needy, secretive and selfish. The engrossing atmosphere went sour as the author padded the book with several contrived and irrelevant scenes. And the crime itself was solved in a ridiculous way that completely ignored the main clues of fig, excrement, and severed thumb.And finally, if there was any link between this story and Freud's Dora, I completely failed to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"To compare this book to The Alienist is a crime, no pun intended.

All of the characters were strange and unhappy, not a likable one in the bunch. I kept waiting for it to get better, but now I wish I had put it down before I got to the \\"mystical?\\" but dumb ending, and moved on to a better novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"style not substance","review":"I was glued to this book on a vacation at the beach until the last chapter then sorely let down thinking I had missed something after all the build up, all the subtle nuance, the supressed eroticism that preceeded it. I think the author needs a bit more experience in setting up a plot and bringing it to a satisfying conclusion, even though I was enthralled with the descriptions of early 20th century Vienna, forensic and psychology research of that era, curious ideas about sexuality and especially female sexuality, and the tidbits of gypsy lore. Like other reviewers, I think this begs for a sequel with Erzebet and Wally. I haven't seen this brought up but there is a real homoerotic subtext in Wally's feelings for and dependence on Erzebet, which would make for a good continuing plot concept. This is a good writer who needs some assistance in following through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting psychological thriller","review":"A mesmerizing, haunting book and highly unusual psychological thriller embellished with interesting historical detail from early 1900s Vienna. The plot alone is interesting enough, but it is the multi-layered portrait of the various antagonists and the lingering atmospherics of the setting that make this book really worth reading. In the end the reader understands that there is more than one route to the truth, and even the most surprising perspectives can yield useful answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of Caleb Carr's The Alienist and Angel of Darkness. I am tired of any period novel being aligned with Carr's works. This pales in comparision to his fine novels. Ms. Shields' attempts at creating suspense are thwarted by her own inability to follow through. I don't know if this is a result of bad structure or bad editing. Either way, I found the novel to be a huge waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It....","review":"This is one of the very few books I absolutely could not get through (a rarity for me). By the time I had reached the middle, enough was enough and I put it aside. Though I will admit to peeking at the end to find out \\"whodunnit\\", I can't say I was particularly surprised at the outcome (seemed predictable to me; I had my suspicions of that character at the outset). What did bother me was the continual references to the occult, witchcraft, etc. Erzebet seemed to change from sweet to evil; but the characters in general were too flat to be bothered with. Overall, the narrative description was well-researched but, ultimately boring. I have no intention of finishing this book and wish I hadn't paid the money for it. A true example of not being able to judge a book by its cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"Someone chose this for our book club and not ONE person liked it. I tried to read the whole thing, some of the settings were appealing, however parts of it got so bizarre and it was just strange. Sorry to the author or anyone that likes it, but out of 12 women, not one person finished it or liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Gives A Fig?!?!?!","review":"As someone who loves mysteries, and adored \\"The Alienist\\" particularly, this book was a huge disappointment to me. There were too many loose ends which Shields deliberately left undone. It was pretty mystifying wondering why Shields chose to weave the story together the way she did...it's not a satisfying way to construct a novel at all. I re-read the last few pages over and over again wondering at first \\"Did I miss something here?\\"However, the way Shields evoked Vienna made me want to visit. She has a real talent for bringing a place to life even though most of her characters seem pretty wooden and aren't filled out enough.It also made me want to read more about Freud's \\"Dora\\" which was a more interesting character then the sketched out murder victim in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich in culture and history, but poor story line","review":"I picked up the book because I was intrigued by the description on the back of the book. What a disappointment! The author does a good job describing the life in Vienna in the early 1900's and Gypsy folklore, but the story line is unintersting and at times confusing. It's hard to get into the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unsatisfying ending","review":"I felt this story was difficult to stick with. I put it down and picked it up over the course of over a month, primarily because I generally try to finish any book I have begun. The references to the inspector's criminal training was extremely tedious. It wasn't until the end when I was reading the questions for book clubs that I discovered a primary theme was \\"hysterical women\\" of the time. I felt the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying. It didn't naturally flow for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy it for the cover...","review":"the cover art is the best part of this whole book... the author seemed to have the right intentions but totally missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Index Cards","review":"Ms Shields packed this book full of odd facts, however, she forgot to develope her characters so the reader would care about any of them. After reading this novel in a book group, it was generally agreed that Jody had done her Masters Thesis on Viennese KafeHauses. Things happened for no apparent reason other than she an index card with a fascinating fact that just had to get in the book. All the male characters had major character flaws, or where maimed. The real Dora must have had a brother, and Jodie felt compelled to put him in the story but didn't work to hard at it. Ms Shields being an editor for DETAILS mag I foolishly thought she might have given fashion of the day more than a glossing over. Gloss is an excellent word to describe this book. I believe it would have been a better book if the editor had been stronger that the author and made her do the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Extremely disjointed and full of incomplete thoughts.This book had an interesting premise though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not get it.....and I still don't!","review":"I purchased this book long ago...but for some unknown reason it must have fell in the library...anyhow, I just found it & read it. Yes, yes & yes..I agree with all the reviews: nicely written, lots of very specific details which indicate a great research, nice story.....but ...WTF?!! What the h*ll happens at the end?? Actually..Where Is The End?? When I finished it, I thought that, maybe, since I had misplaced it, maybe some parts (explicitly the last chapter!!) got tore up..maybe damaged..the Book Printing Co. forgot to print it. I mean, this could be the only logical explanation...otherwise: the fig, the thumb, the digging of the body, Joszef? What did they have to do with the story??? I kinda guessed who the potential killer was..but I did not care because I wanted to see how those pieces fit all together. Well..they don't.I never ever writing a book review.....but I was so frustrated (still am) that I had to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful bore","review":"I adore literary historical fiction, but gave up on The Fig Eater halfway through--something I almost never do--because of the dragging pace (excruciatingly slow even for literary fiction), half-realized and uninvolving characters, and the frequently self-indulgent artiness of the author's prose. The use of the self-conscious present tense (a choice that, in my opinion, should be used only for good reason, and sparingly, to set off particular sections of a novel) for the entire narrative didn't help matters. Nevertheless, it's obviously well-researched and 1910 Vienna is described in lush detail. It's too bad the plot and characters don't live up to the evocative atmosphere the author created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews before buying.","review":"I really struggled with this book and the only thing that got me through it was the hope that in the end, it would all come into fruition. I was sadly disappointed. Too many unanswered questions, no closure, and the ending was just bad, bad, bad. It was not the intriguing murder mystery I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I loved the tenor of the writing and the atmosphere of this book. I thought it outstanding. The negative reviews I have read seem to come from people who prefer the straightforward, \\"tidy\\" detective novel. I was not bored at all, and found it very engaging. Yes, there were numerous what some called \\"loose ends,\\" but I do think that such was intentional. Not everything turns out to be what is expected nor does everything turn out to be relevant. I, frankly, am a bit intrigued about where the fig came from . . . must we be told? Or can we not stretch back in our chairs and wonder?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown...","review":"I loved living in 1910 Vienna - the book was wonderfully researched, and was masterful at portraying the characters and times. And, the mystery grabbed ahold and held on - and seemed like it was really going to have a \\"whammo\\" ending. But no - and don't you feel like you've wasted a bunch of time when that happens. In this case, the read was interesting enough that I don't feel totally robbed, but disappointed - oh yeah! Most of all, I was lured by the title and the search for the fig tree, which seemed to gain in significance with each page, only to end in a total fizzle. We found it - so what? This book had such potential - what a shame. Surely someone along the way - agent, editor, publisher - read it and saw its shortcomings. With all the glowing reviews, one wonders if anybody really read it. Jody, fire them all and start with a new crew. You are a great writer and I'll take a shot at your next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"S---L----O----W","review":"It starts out intriguingly but then goes nowhere so slowly.....It has lots of nice historical touches, but none of the suspense and pacing that a great mystery requires. I think this was her first novel, and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING BOOK BECAUSE OF UNRESOLVED LOOSE ENDS","review":"Publisher's Weekly got it wrong with its claim of atmospheric suspense. The murder mystery began with a strong opening and then quickly became a plodding chore to read. The principle reason for the change was that there were just too many loose ends. The author provided three potentially interesting tidbits that provided a real opportunity for exploration and yet there was no follow through. The most obvious missing threat was the figs themselves. The reader is left wondering why this very essential part the novel simply disappeared. This was also true of the uniquely introduced subplots of the thumb and syphllis.The theme of the book had real potential but the delivery was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I do give a fig","review":"I did enjoy this book. I will admit that it took me two tries to get into it, but then it became a real page turner. I was transported to a City and time unfamiliar and very appealing. I liked the focus on the main characters, the Inspector, his wife and Wally. But I did want to know more about the husband and wife's relationship, and was left with unsatisfied curiosity about Wally, and even Rosza. Other than the Inspector, the men were not a very interesting bunch. I continue to be puzzled about the importance of the fig. The ending was a rather too convenient way out, but perhaps it was the only way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing is the most appropriate word to describe this book. I thought the premise was exciting and the book really should have been so much more than it was.The amount of loose ends was staggering. And the anticlimatic ending really made me regret my purchase. The book was full of too many minute details that did nothing to help the story along.Although, the author certainly proved that she did a great deal of research on the period and subject matter of the piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Like slogging through mud","review":"I read this over a year ago, and I STILL think about how bad it was. It looked like the kind of story I really like, historical novel; murder mystery. Ms. Shields made it incredibly difficult to even understand what was going on. I never seemed to know where the characters were, and how their actions related to the last thing they were doing. To add insult to injury, Ms. Shields adds a confusing layer of Gypsy mythology to everything the protagonist does, liberally sprinkled with Hungarian words I immediately forgot. When the story finally resolved itself, I couldn't care less."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fig Eater","review":"A combination of suspense thriller, historical fiction,who-done-it, this beautifully written and well-researchednovel will place readers in turn of the century Viennainto a world of murder, folklore and the forensicscience of the day. I have seldom read such a literarybook that has all the page-turner qualities of a modernsuspense thriller, yet evokes its historicalsetting so compellingly. I hope Jody Shields writesmore fiction like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fig Cheater","review":"Huh? What happened to the ingested fig? To the excrement in the park? To the severed thumb buried in the floor? Yes these are major fuel sources that (up to a point) propel the plot forward. What happens, even in the broadest of terms, to the characters? To Wally for instance? Atmospheric yes and in some ways gripping but what a stinker of an ending.For Amazon to sell this book with (and by implication to compare it to) the exquisite \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" shows either a seriously impaired scheme for pairing books (set in 20th century Europe seems the only obvious similarity) or a desperate attempt to pawn off an overrun of lousy books on the coat tails of a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I thought the book started out as if it would be a good read; but after a few pages it became very disjointed and just plain boring. I know the author did a lot of research to write the story, but it just didn't come together, and I never had any empathy for any of the characters. I was glad when I finished the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Gave it the Benefit of the Doubt","review":"I tried. I really tried to finish this book. It sounded so promising and the beginning was a page turner. At page 166, I gave up. I am the type of person who will sit through a horrible movie and likewise, continue to read, until the end, a terrible book if only to tie up loose ends. I blame myself for not having the sado-masochistic tendencies needed to read this book in its entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a cozy mystery","review":"If you are interested in the book but discouraged by the one star reviews, click to \\"Search inside this book.\\" The beginning seems representative of the work. The narrator maintains a distance between the reader and the characters. (Contrary to what a reviewer said below? above? the author does not jump between narrators; the narrator is omnipotent.

It turns out that the author herself has written (and cites in this bibliography) many works critical of the notion of ritual abuse.

First, I am such a huge Count Basie fan that I named my dog Basie. I love jazz and my favorite musicians, along with Basie are Charlie Parker and Cannonball Adderley.What I like about this album is that it gets down and dirty with the Blues, and really evokes emotion. Williams and Turner are great and they sang in a way you would expect them to sing in a club. Not the over produced, main stream pronunciation you may find on other albums. Also the Basie Band sounds great - very tight with a range of songs from slow to fast blues. My favorite parts of the album are the solo's. Sometimes it seems saxaphone soloist are paid by the note, but here you have well constructed solo's that reach a electic crescendo.

Rechargeable batteries seem to work the best with 1-3 second recharge times between flashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Flash.","review":"Real bright flash,work great with my camera.Lights up a long way, away,getting more into my pictures.Camera flash isn't enough flash,383 flash makes up what the camera can't reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best skillet I've ever owned","review":"I've used a few skillets in my time (teflon, stainless steel, cast iron, glass) but this is the one I like the best. The enamel coating prevents the leeching of hazardous metals from going into your food. Or a different way of saying it: your food doesn't taste like the pan. It cleans really easy with hot water and the cook time is the same as using regular cast iron. I highly recommend this skillet to anyone concerned about cooking the healthy way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than what I envisioned but great","review":"I really like this to cook with as it's deep.

Instead I'm writing out of disappointment at the fact that this very standard mystery (the only thing out of the ordinary about it is that it was written in Cuba) was put out by Akashic Books. I've followed Akashic from its beginning, when it was publishing some very edgy, interesting stuff. But these days they seem to be publishing mostly only standard thrillers and mysteries like this one. I suppose that's the market place, where the money is, but I still find it depressing when an interesting new publisher degenerates into yet another distributor of mediocre pap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nada del otro mundo","review":"Si ya conoces la historia de los caballeros del Rey Arturo, entonces no encontrarás nada nuevo en este libro. Es una lectura simple que repite el cuento, tal vez con un estilo más llano. La reina Ginebra pierde relevancia cuando es ella la principal protagonista de la conciencia de Sir Lancelot, y el Rey Arturo es mostrado como un hombre todopoderoso, a cuyos pies se rinde el honor de cualquiera de sus seguidores. Lancelot se alza como el que debió ser Rey...

No real HISTORY of the Aztecs or anything like that.

There aren't too many levels to chose from or modes to play, so it can get kinda boring after a bit, but that's when you give it a break for a while and come back to it later! It'll be just as fun after that! So yeah, give it a shot, it's fun. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is a blast...","review":"I'm not a Star Wars fan, but this game is so much fun. I haven't had this much fun on a game for a long time.GOOD:There are so many vehicles to use. There are also some cool characters....and jetpacks. The levels are creative and the \\"capture the base\\" style play keeps respawn play strategic. Playing with so many bots gives a big battle feel that I haven't experienced in a game. Also, there are many details from the SW movies that are added into the levels.BAD:The online servers aren't set up very well. It's hard to find a game with a friend, or any specific room at all. Also, some of the blaster guns trail way behind your crosshairs and this gets annoying. As with any online shooter there are occasional teamkillers.If you like first person shooters and/or Star Wars than get this game. It seems that Lucas Arts is releasing online patches quite often to fix all the problems in this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"Excellent game all around.

I was surprised at how great the graphics were and how fun it was for any kind of gamer. This is the only grab a character and shoot game I have ever enjoyed, and this one deserves more than five stars! No matter which faction you decide to play, it will still be challenging. My favorite is the Imperial Army for ground play. Playing one of the Imperial Troopers and getting to highjack one of the enemy X-wings was just too much fun.

The graphics are pretty good, but operating the vehicles stinks. The X-Wing, Y-Wing, Tie Fighter, etc are cool but it's like trying to drive a dump truck in a two car garage. Online the characters move very slow across a board and you are stuck with the weapons your character starts with. I own both SOCOMs and nothing compares to that online gameplay. The online play here is a constant respawn until one team occupies and kills the other teams reawn points, and knocks out their 250 soldiers/droids. Headsets due work, but it is a constantly open mike. I recommend renting it but don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The nice but evil side","review":"Battlefront is a great game.

Unfortunately it was rushed out to coincide with the release of the trilogy on DVD. The major draw is, of course, online play. Online play however is truly awful. The PS2 version is totally handicapped by a poor online lobby. You can only see about 6-7 games at a time and you can't scroll down fast enough to choose one. The PC games shouldn't even be listed since you're on a PS2. Why? It just clogs up the lobby. And I'm not a big fan of gamespy anyway, so that's 2 strikes. You can only play against 3 other human players, so you may as well play single player. Oh well. Do yourself a favor and rent this one or wait until it's only 20 bucks or so. This really hammers home the point that George Lucas only cares about the greenbacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"The game is great I got it pre owned but it came with the manual and the box the graphics are good but not as good as too the story line is great every star wars fan will fall in love with this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Battlefront","review":"Video Game was entertaining.Video Game arrived in a very timely fashion.Video Game arrived in excellent condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game","review":"I just wanted to say this is a great game.

My little brother and I can play this game for hours at a time without getting bored. I am 25 and he is 13, we enjoy getting to fight with each other on the same side and he has fun because he is able to participate in the battles that he has seen in the movies. I mean who has watched the movies and did not want to drive one of those great big at-at's(looks like a big metal cow with guns)in the battle of hoth(the snow world) and get to fire on the rebels? Or be able to fly one of the snow speeders to try and destroy one of the at-at's by flying around its feet with a tow cable? This game is a lot of fun for all ages and it has a lot of replay value buy it you will like it if you liked the battles in the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good rental","review":"Battlefront was fun for about a day or two. It would be best to rent it before you buy it. This game is a little disapointing like some other star wars titles in the past (Clone War, Power Battles)and it's not really worth the $49.99 price tag. There is just something missing.People who are calling this the \\"GTA Vice City of Star Wars\\" are crazy. The controls for the X-Wings and Tie fighters are so clunky and the big battle campaigns can be completed in a couple of hours on the hardest setting. Don't get me wrong it IS fun but it does not live up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong game","review":"I ordered Star Wars Battlefront 1, but I received Star Wars Battlefront 2 in the mail. I was expecting to get the first one, but instead I was sent the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails for the Single Player","review":"The battles in this game are kind of short, and, what's worse, winning them doesn't depend on the level of player participation! As one reviewer noted, you can win many battles in this game by killing one enemy, or none at all. Maybe it's different with online play, but I've not ventured into that arena yet, and have no plans to in the future.The graphics are much like the CGI of most George Lucas films; they're kinda pretty and also kinda plastic and dull. The same goes for the sound effects. The laser blasts sound... well they don't have that much \\"ump.\\" Also noted by one reviewer, the player isn't at the center of the action in this game. It's just an all around dull experience; I won't be renting the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old very fast","review":"This game is fun at first, but gets old way too fast. Their aren't very many different places to go so they get pretty old. And although every battle is tecnickly different, the computer played bad guys do pretty much the same thing every time, so even the battles get old. It might be fun to play multiplayer - I don't know, I've never tried - but I doubt it. There are some fun things about it that keeps it relatively playable, but not many. If you find this game at a yard sale for a small amount of money (as I did), go ahead and get it, but it's not worth more than about $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Unless your very small or you like extremely repetitive gaming, this isnt for you.

I am very disappointed and will not order used merchandise again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand all the postive reviews...","review":"It's a Star Wars game, but it's a pretty bad one. Ok, the graphics look awesome, as a multi-player game I could see this being good. Single player mode can have two extreems, easy or hard. Those aren't selectable settings, but the way you choose to play. At each \\"level\\" your character becomes immediately involved in a large battle, your character is one of many fighting this battle and there are no specific goals other than taking over command post. You can elect to piloting ships, steal an AT-AT etc.. but this really only serves to bring a loose bit of freedom. It makes the game a giant mush without any order to it. You can fall back and let the computer controlled team mates win the level for you or you can engage in combat and (usually) be destroyed almost immediately. Bottom line, this is a poor game. One of the worst Star Wars games ever made. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! Ughhh! Someone help me get these awful images out of my brain!","review":"Star Wars Battlefront. The best-selling Star Wars game ever. HA! This game is a truck-full of old banana peels. The style of shooting is blah, the droids die almost immediately and it gives a poor rendition of \\"all the great Star Wars battles.\\" To the makers, that ment the droid and clone armies fighting to the finish and Rebels and Imperials shootin' eachother. But to great Star Wars fans like me, this includes the battle in Episode V between Luke and Vader and the Episode I joust between Darth Maul, Qui-Gon Jinn, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, plus others. The gameplay is difficult and a lot of times I got killed was because of the stupid targeter keeping me glued in one direction and I couldn't see that Rebel from behind! And the characters weapons are all trash ecxept the snipers which hardly ever hit. Take my advice. Buy Battlefront 2 in November and leave this depressing pigsty on the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disspointment for ps2","review":"I waited and waited for this game to come out, then ran to get it.

For you people that could careless about star wars but are a big gamer(like me) then you will love this game.i suck at shooter games but for this i could make an exeption. the graphics are really good,when fighting it takes a while to get used to the controls,theres four sides to choose from rebel,emire,republic(clone troops), and cis(droids). on each mission thers 200 troops vs. 200 troops and your ally troops and enemies are so smart its almost like playing with other humans,you can give the other troops around you orders you can tell them to follow you and back you up,to move out,to hold there positions,and to hold there fire.and your enemy sets up there attack very nicely so if you take one more step out of your hiding place youll be blasted to a million pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starwars Battlefront, THE BEST GAME EVER!","review":"If you are a person who likes starwars you need to either buy or rent this game!

That means multiplayer.Well Just try this game; you won't be disapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool stuff,few bugs","review":"Battlefront is a good game. But there are a few problems. One of the problems is that it takes forever to turn the vehicles around. Another bad thing is that the soldiers are complete fools. They don't ever think to do anything smart, and they don't obey orders well. But this game is great. The vehicles are fun to pilot, particularly the x-wing and the snowspeeders. Another great thing is that each unit has their own strengths and weaknesses. And blowing up several units at a time with a grenade is fun.

From taking them off/putting them on I found several times they didn't fit right because the lens was trying to jump out of the rubber.- FOG. These things fog up on command. In almost every skirmish I tried to use them they ended up be completely foggy.- Only for small noses. I know that sounds silly, but as a guy with a bigger nose I found that the bridge area on these was extremely small and made them sit funny on my face.- The tint is a bit too dark.

People feel lots of inclinations (hunger, desire for sex, desire for acheivement, etc.) However, if moral inclinations simply \\"evolved\\" just like all our other inclinations, then no one is under any OBLIGATION to obey them.If you really want a solid answer to the question of what morality is and why it should be followed, check out \\"Relativism: Feet firmly planted in mid-air\\" by Greg Koukl. A solid read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Against Modern Religion","review":"This book is basically the Atheist Bible. Shermer uses evidence from many fields of social science, even from the Bible itself, and statistics of self-proclaimed Christian pollsters to present to us that morality was not of divine influence, but rather evolved just like physical attributions. It's a science text, so most of everything is presented in a concise, well-proven manner.Shermer's second most important point presented to the reader is that religiosity and morality are not hand-in-hand, but rather, as one increases, the other decreases, as he demonstrates using polls from Christian organizations, comparing the divorce rate of athiests and agnostics (14%)and self-proclaimed Christians (17%). He also states that religious people have a higher rate of possessing less-desirable personality traits, such as authoritarianism.For anyone searching for a scientific truth to the human state, look no further than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy, pop, reductionistic scientism","review":"I've been reading a lot of books and articles about evil lately, and this is about the worst. Shallow, reductionistic, pop publishing. Mostly a stringing together of various and sundry studies related to morality, with semi-coherent and semi-informed interpretations of them. In the end, it's a lot of evolutionary psychology. In parts it is simply an argument against religion. If this is the kind of crap that most people are reading, no wonder our culture is in the sorry state it is in. I instead higyly recommend Vetlesen's Evil and Human Agency (Cambridge) and Claudia Card's The Atrocity Paradigm: A Theory of Evil, for readers who really want to understand evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but more Opinion than Science","review":"Micheal Schermer's book is interesting but there is little science here and he fails to elaborate on many of his claims. It is difficult to call something science when almost of all of your claims are not based on the scientific method, but based on one's perspective. This is like twinkie science. I kept waiting for a claim that could be substianated beyond a reasonable doubt. Schermer doesn't try to explain many of claims pretending as if they were self-evident. Most of this book is based on a nuanced definition of the word transcend and the invention of a new word \\"premoral\\". Nevertheless, this was a brave try at trying to explain morality without a God, better than most, but at the end of the day this twinkie science is full of too many \\"empty calories\\" to be functional as an substantive explanation of good and evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Shermer summarizes the consensus from various scientific disciplines.

It came out at a time when a fan like me seriously missed new music from great groups such as KANSAS, which could be why I enjoy it so much. I don't understand how anyone cannot like this album as a KANSAS fan. It takes you on a ride from the start with \\"I Can Fly\\" then brings you home with \\"Peaceful and Warm\\". I'm not sure what Steve Walsh was going through in his life but I think some raw emotion comes through with an ultimate expression hope. I'm not sure why some people do not like the song \\"Need\\". I still play that song at the highest volume that I can. There's something about it maybe it's the rhythm or the emotion. Of course, these are just my opinions.To those who love KANSAS and do not have this album, all I can say is that it is still one of my favorite albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Effort","review":"Freaks of Nature is an underrated and probably under-listened to effort by the boys from Kansas. There is solid, energetic playing and some good material here that deserves several listens to appreciate it all. Steve Walsh's voice is in good form and David Ragsdale brings not only his own tasty style to the violin parts, but co-writes several of the fine tunes as well. Phil Ehart's drumming is just as tight and intense as ever, but also a little more thoughtful...some unexpected moments make the songs even more interesting. They really breathe new life into the Kansas sound with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been 5 stars.","review":"This is one great album, but track 1 is weak. -A better song, and it would have been 5 stars. The rest of the CD kicks, especially the title-track and \\"Black Fathom 4\\". -Brilliant compositions !. However, Steve Walsh is certainly not what he used to be. I don't know what his scheme is. Sometimes he sounds like a cross between Klaus Meine, Toni Childs, and Ronnie James Dio all rolled into one. -On a bad day...before breakfast. He used to be the best in the biz. -Such lungs, and now he's blown them. Too bad. It's still a good record, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perplexing and Powerful","review":"When this came out, I didn't bother buying it. I was too disappointed with their previous studio release, \\"In the Spirit of Things.\\" I figured Kansas was finished. So why bother plunking down $16.99 for it (which is what new CDs cost back in 1995, you young whuppersnuppers).I got the CD for Christmas 2011. I was utterly blown away. \\"I Can Fly\\" is an incredibly intricate tune that features overlapping time signatures. I like the result; even if you don't, you have to credit a band for trying something so complex. Other highlights include \\"Desperate Times\\" \\"Black Fathom Four\\" and the title track.So, if you like educated rock, superbly played, just GET IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"The past is gone so why try to compare this to those albums from the band's golden years.

The story is a powerful one about a woman's love for her husband and her loyalty to him. Gwen Terasaki is a remarkable woman and her story allows us to experience life as she knew it during some of the most tumultuous times in the recent past.

I have all three of his cds: Robbie Nevil (1986), A Place Like This (1988) and Day 1 (1991). All three are strong both in musicianship and songwriting craft. Robbie Nevil also has the greatest soul singing voice next to Daryl Hall for a white guy. It's a shame that the record company or Robbie didn't want to continue. This best of collection is a very good snapshot of his career, and it's the only thing non-fans will have since all three of his cds are out of print. Even Richard Marx's cds are still in print! This compilation includes all of Robbie's American hits like \\"C'est La Vie\\", \\"Dominoes\\", \\"Wot's It To Ya\\", \\"Back On Holiday\\", \\"Who Needs Somebody Like You\\" and \\"Just Like You.\\" This is a must have for any rock collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and thoughtful","review":"I found this gem in a bookstore in Tokyo.

Any later writer who wants to produce a biography of Faulkner will inevitably find himself or herself relying on much of Blotner's work. The reader, however, will not be so grateful. Blotner seems incapable of distinguishing between that which is important and that which is not. It seems as though he has dumped almost everything he learned into this book. And he learned quite a lot. Why we need, for example, to know the names of everyone Faulkner came into contact with? Finally, Blotner is not a gifted writer; his style is typical of the academic. I can only hope someone writes a shorter, more readable biography of Faulkner someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"An earlier reviewer: \\"It won't be displaced for many years to come\\"","review":"... couldn't agree more.

At times I felt unreasonably close to the main character. I was both repulsed by her and sympathitic of her situation. She lived in a difficult world of hand to mouth farming, segregation, and misogyny. But, she was also disgusting in her treatment of the African habitants. I don't think I have ever read a more hypocritical analysis of African life in my life. The author gets it so right that you often find yourself cringing.

The only thing I dislike is it's Full Format you you miss alot of the off-screen action. The widescreen edition is older and is $40... not worth it for me now. Hopefully in the future they will fix this problem and offer an affordable version in Widescreen.

The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The African Queen, Prizzi's Honor... Annie???? Oh yeah, that makes sense. Carol Burnett, a brilliant comedienne, is completely unfunny here. The girls who play the orphans are loud, overbearing, and annoying in the extreme. Ann Reinking, Bernadette Peters, Tim Curry-all wasted.

The wonderful variety of songs were replaced with merely Tomorrow repeated over and over again. The version from 1985 or so with Carol Burnnet and Albert Finney was sooooooo much better. If you are looking for a true version of Annie that is the one to buy. Not this silly, \\"creative\\" version that Disney turned out.

Which I think is the better time for Annie. In fact, Annie and all the girls are orphans. Don't they have a adult, like a aunt or uncle or grandparents to live with if thier parents are dead.

I was sure it would be widescreen anamorphic. But, alas, we Americans are given another \\"pan and scan\\" version of a \\"scope\\" movie. Why? It seems someone, somewhere, (and there seems to be a lot of \\"someone's\\") is hoping to kill the DVD and Blu-ray industry and thus worsen our economy. (I include Blu-ray because we keep getting so many B movies released while the \\"Classics\\" are held back or offered first to other countries.) Why are we getting such pittyful releases? You now have to go to Australia or England to get the \\"goods\\". Anyone in the \\"know\\" know why? (This reviews the format not the movie itself.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with the DVD","review":"First off, I would like to make it clear that the 1 star rating is for the DVD, not for the film, which I would give 4 stars. I would like to warn anybody out there who is planning to purchase the DVD of this film that there is a major problem in the framing of the widescreen version. Throughout the film, there is a starnge electronic \\"zooming\\" that often causes viewer to lose picture on all four sides of the image! This is apparent in many of the shots of the film... Although, this problem lies only in the widescreen version, and that people purchasing the disc for the pan and scan version will experience no problems. Just felt I should let everyone know that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love Annie...","review":"My childhood favorite movie. I actually wore out several VHS's as a kid because I watched it over & over. I still really enjoy it & now I'm able to watch this with my daughter & see how much she enjoys it. Wide Screen would've been nice but I think for the little ones Full Screen is better so I'm not going to complain about that much. The features are great & Annie is darling. Music is awesome & I think any little girl would fall in love with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I didn't care for this version at ALL. The bright spots were Andrea McArdle, Kristen Chenowith and Alan Cummings! But the orphans were dull and underused, Kathy Bates was NOT mean enough and Victor Garber wasn't gruff as Warbucks is supposed to be. Alicia Morton has a sweet enough voice, but she is NOT Annie material...she doesn't belt like Andrea McArdle or the other Broadway Annies I've seen! There's no power in her voice at all. Overall I was tremendously disappointed, and the ending was so awful I cringe just thinking about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Musical for Children","review":"I loved this movie as a child and now my 1 1/2 year old daughter loves it -- especially \\"Hard Knock Life.\\" The acting, singing and dancing are superb -- and the orphans are all so adorable and talented.

ANNIE is great! The characters are fantastic! The songs even better! And the story is wonderful! Even if everything seems perfect, it could had been better... Alicia Morton does a great job in the role as Annie, but Kathy Bates plays Miss Hannigan too nice! She is supposed to be a hard, tuff and mean! And it's a shame that Disney made this version so short... (If you compare it to the first ANNIE movie from 1982...)Over all, this is a great, colorful movie, worth some 1000 watches, with the whole family gathered around the TV/PC. The DVD is great, and you get the picture much more clear up!

I tried to watch this but it came no where close to being an o.k. version of the original. I didn't like the new Annie, new Mr. Warbucks, and esp. didn't like the new Miss Hannigan. Kathy Bates is a wonderful actress, but she's no Miss Hannigan. If you loved the original and don't like remakes of classic films, don't get this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm suspicious....","review":"While this movie was cute well, movie-wise, I'm suspicious of the fact that the orphans were made up of what seemed like EVERY major ethnic type! ...\\"I'm not saying that the girls in the movie were not good or even that some of them should not have been cast anyway, I'm just, well, suspicious. ... ( However, Audra MacDonald as Warbucks' secretary Grace Farrell did make sense to me despite the fact that it didn't to some people.

First bad move was getting an Annie without curly hair, excuse me, but isn't that one of Annie's trademark's? They changed the plot, second bad move, which took out some of the best parts of the original movie.

They are wearing dresses. They are doing handstands. If you are wearing a dress, it's going to fall down.\\"Mrs. Hannigan was too...\\"Well, I don't know what to say about this.

But there were at least two \\"D*mn\\"s and two loud-and-clear \\"G#ddamm#ts\\" I knew this movie was PG, but it's Annie for goodness sakes!

Don't waste your money on this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie with crummy transfer","review":"I can't complain much, however, the Laserdisc was pan and scan, the DVD was pan and scan and later on released in letterbox.

But I suggest that you watch the first one! The casting couldn't be better, the songs are classic, and the kids are cute as buttons.I love a number of remakes, but this is not one that I could grow to like. . .

Being a film lover I have now moved on to DVD and I'm very disappointed that this film is STILL not being offered in widescreen. They bothered to add a DTS soundtrack but still no widescreen??? Some of us like to watch movies as the director intended, not hacked apart in the full-screen editions. So I still will not be buying this film, even though it is one of my all time favorites, until it is released in widescreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the Broadway production","review":"This 1982 movie version is far from the 1977 musical and Broadway classic. If you want to see a version with songs and plot line more true to the Broadway musical, buy (or rent) the 1999 version produced by Disney."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no one like Annie!","review":"Who cares what the stuffy broadway reviewers think? This is a terrific family film! The music of Annie is such a delightful reminder of my childhood, singing the songs with my sister in our living room, and I'm thrilled to share Annie with my daughter. She loves this as a kids' movie, and as an adult, I can appreciate the performances of Carol Burnett, Ann Reinking, Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters in a way that I couldn't as a child. Don't hesitate -- buy this dvd and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will we get a PROPER Widescreen release?","review":"Were all (actual) widescreen prints destroyed or something? I'm not a big fan of this movie, in fact I much prefer the 1999 version that actually adapts the musical. But when I saw this for the first time it was in Pan and Scan and yet during A Hard Knock Life you could see the kids knocking themselves out clearly. Here they zoomed in on the picture so that they knock themselves out offscreen. And this has the worst pan and scan job ever too- half the time we only see the characters' noses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full-screen?!","review":"This DVD of \\"Annie\\" is the full-screen version, wherein 40% of the picture has been chopped off the sides. It is virtually unwatchable, and Sony should be ashamed for releasing a widescreen/scope film in this way.Sony has previously released the widescreen version of the film on DVD, but without the special features or DTS sound, so it might be best to wait for a future release that presents the film properly and has the bonus features. Or wait for the inevitable Blu-ray release which should be really nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Becca's Favorites","review":"Ok, so the first thing we look at is the fact that this is technically not the real storyline for the musical Annie. But the second thing we look at is that kids will enjoy this version more, I know I like it better than any of the other movies, but the musical is still the best thing, if only they had the obc doing a performance on vhs, then that would be the thing to get. None the less, I love the musical Annie, and this is what got me started, it takes away from the real setting(eg: the real thing was during christmas, not the 4th of july, and some songs are missing and some were replaced) but it is still a great way to start kids into a love for musicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie is a masterpiece! Great for kids of all ages!","review":"I am almost 18 years old and I have been watching this movie since I was a baby.

Somehow Disney managed to destroy the story in an unprecedented way bya) changing the character of the characters (from intelligent to... well, I don't know)b) removing some of the (best) characters andc) removing several (the best and most intelligent) parts of the plot. Stuff that was very intelligently plotted and made a lot of sense is replaced with something that even the kids remarked was just plain stupid.I am giving this a 'two', but that is how I would rate it on its own merits. Compared to the real thing, this one only makes you upset. Shame on you Disney..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The quintessential '80s family musical!","review":"A great family classic, this version of Annie only improves when compared with Disney's recent lackluster remake of the same name. Albert Finney's Daddy Warbucks is a classic archetype of big business affected by inevitable conscience, and Carol Burnette's comic genius is amply displayed in her portrayal of Miss Hannigan as a boozing witch with an eventual heart of gold. The music is phenomenal and the choreography makes me long for the lost genre of musicals. If you (or your children) haven't seen this movie yet, don't wait a minute longer -- click that mouse and bring this great movie into your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone, Overbloated","review":"A John Huston disaster! Some nice touches, a great Annie and a nifty Punjab..but too much overacting in this overproduced musical. But thank heaven the songs weren't ruined by this rococo mess.Call me spoiled, but l saw and greatly prefer the Broadway version which respected a more sophisticated audience and which gave us several \\"inside\\" and tongue-in-cheek jokes. The movie rams everything down the viewer's throat.

I've loved the original movie for years, but I wanted to give Disney's Annie a fair shot. I had to fast forward through most of the second half. It was just awful.

I thought for sure this special edition would be a great addition to my collection.WRONG!It's not in widescreen! Does the late (and great) John Huston, who shot this film in 2.35:1, deserve to have the special edition of his film chopped up to Pan & Scan? For those who say you only lose a little off the sides, consider this: for 2.35:1 films like \\"Annie\\", you lose about 40% of the original picture. 40% in my opinion is much more than a \\"little bit.\\" Imagine having 40% of your family portrait chopped off!If you really love this movie (and many do, including me), you should let Columbia know that you want (and deserve) an anamorphic widescreen presentation (which means enhanced for widescreen TVs) in its original aspect ratio (OAR) of 2.35:1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Albert Finney version","review":"I always hated the over-the-top ending of the first Annie movie--just plain silly.

Yes, the stars in this trash are Broadway stars but they can't act their way throught a paper bag.

I grind my teeth and go insane every time I think about how bad this movie and it's soundtrack are. I hate it so bad I would rather go to a Barbra Streisand concert or see all 9 hours of Anne of Greene Gables and those evil PBS fund raisers in between than suffer the sheer torture of Annie.

I'm a huge Play fan and am so excited that they are doing something like this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changes to the material, but unbelievable star power.","review":"This movie has an incredible cast, perhaps the best ever assembled for a made-for-TV movie, musical or otherwise. Kathy Bates, Audra McDonald, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming, Kristin Chenoweth... Even Andrea McCardle, the original Broadway Annie, has a cameo appearance! Plus, Alicia Morton, who plays Annie, is obviously quite talented as a singer and actress. The director and choreographer is Broadway's Rob Marhsall, who does a magnificent job. What more do you need? Unfortunately, a better script. The script has been altered in a number of significant ways: The show has less of the 1930s atmosphere that the stage version had, a few (quite good) songs have been removed from the score, and the ending has been altered almost to the point that it doesn't make much sense. Despite these problems, this is a very entertaining movie, far superior to the 1982 film version, with a cast that can't be beat. Do you love musicals? If so, don't miss this Annie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OverProduced, very Overproduced","review":"If anyone has ever seen the Stage version of this musical, you can't help but understand that this version is overproduced. Hard Knock Life is over choreographed, as is Easy Street as well as some other songs. Ray Stark should have kept to the simple trick of the original stage play. He did not keep it simple. Gone is \\"NYC\\" only to be replaced by \\"Let's go to the Movies\\".While the Disney version is cut down to the 2 hour TV. movie, it works better.As for the idea of releasing this as a full frame disk, wait for Columbia to wise up and remaster the film for wide screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it!","review":"The music in this video is great.

I was disappointed, to say the least. Especially since John Huston (one of my favorite directors) was at the helm.To me, Annie is family fare, and this movie had some elements not appropriate. There was one expression of profanity, the remainder were some suggestive dance sequences I was embarrassed to have my daughters see. And considering my daughter was an orphan in the play we did, she was taken aback at some parts of the movie, too.And the time the movie was made showed its dated-ness. I thought the musical sequence where the driver (an Asian) and Punjab (an Indian or Pakistani played by Caribbean Geoffrey Holder) dance was stereotypical in its portrayal.We found the Disney version, which I hope is closer to what we did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A children's movie that is not fit for children","review":"This movie is just plain icky. Carol Burnett's character drinks constantly, is in her underwear most of the time, makes sexual advances to Daddy Warbucks, and does a burlesque dance with Bernadette Peters and Tim Curry.

Any movie that my kids will sit still and watch all the way through and doesnt irrate me is a five star."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great adaption to a now classic show","review":"I have to agree that this is the superior movie version of this show. I simply adore Audra and Kristin and Kathy and Alan, and they are wonderful in this movie. The choreography is very creative and tastefully done...especially the \\"N.Y.C.\\" number...that has to rank as one of the best production numbers on film which features the original Broadway Annie, Andrea McArdle. What can I say? Who cares if this Annie does not have an afro of red hair? There is so much more going on for this movie that that is just a silly gripe. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Greatest Of All Times\\" - not Muhammed Ali :)","review":"This movie has been my favorite since I first saw it on NBC in 1984. My aunt recorded it for me, but over the years it was recorded over. My husband knows this is my favorite movie, so he tried to surprise me with Annie for Valentine's Day last year. Unfortunately he bought the \\"new\\" Annie. It was okay, but not like the original. Seeing the extra footage of the original Annie movie made me love it even more! Great for the kids too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for KIDS!","review":"Obviously. this isn't on par with great movies like Gone with the Wind, or Casablanca, and maybe Eilleen Quinn isn't Shirley Templee. However, when I was 8, 9 and 10, I LOVED this movie. I liked the optimistic singing and both the innocence of Annie and the humor of Ms Hannigan.

He uses the mistakes of politicians, TV news reporters, actors and actresses, to illustrate the kinds of mistakes made and demonstrates remarkably simple methods for correcting them.

I have owned a deaf dog for four years. This book was not helpful or useful to me at all. I would imagine that someone who is considering adopting a deaf dog, or someone who has just adopted a deaf dog would find it helpful. The book was published in 1997, the same year I adopted my deaf dog. I never encountered the problems the author discussed, and a great deal has changed in the deaf dog owner community in the past four years. Basically, if you have already gotten past the basics with your deaf dog... pass this book up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, repetitive and rather incomplete.","review":"The author states that she doesn't want a deaf dog owner to feel the hoplessness and fear of loss that she experienced when she discovered that her puppy was deaf; then she does just that. Owning a deaf dog is no more of a challenge then owning any dog. A good dog training book was a better investment with much more practical information than can be obtained by reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must for anyone who owns a deaf dog!","review":"This book was a great first source in learning about deaf dogs. As a new adoptive owner of a deaf dog, I found it to be not only an excellent source of information, but also a source of hope and reassurance that that we can raise a deaf dog and deaf dogs can lead full lives given the opportunity. It is a must for anyone considering adopting a deaf dog or is new to training a deaf dog. I thank the author for providing this information and inspiration in a concise and clear format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deaf Dog Adopter","review":"I bought and read this book as I was preparing to adopt my first deaf dog. Although it does not cover everything, it is a good foundation for understanding the subtle differences of deaf versus hearing dogs. The basics, such as \\"how to wake a deaf dog\\" are priceless when trying to create a calm, soothing environment for your dog. For the items, not covered in the book you will find resources in the appendix to assist. As with all dogs, each deaf dog is a little different from the others. It is a constant learning process and the best guides are the experiences of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living with a Deaf Dog","review":"Our beloved miniature schnauzer(age 10) suddenly went deaf & we were at a loss as to how to successfully communicate with her.

However, I feel there needed to be much more, since there are many issues/situations that have arisen with my deaf puppy (e.g. separation anxiety) that are just not covered in enough detail to really help address the problems. I would recommend the book as a good place to start learning the basics of living with a deaf dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Living with Deaf Dogs","review":"I found this book sadly out of date with current training methodology and thinking. While she has some useful and helpful information, there were a frightening number of suggestions that involved aversives ranging from alpha rolls, to holding a dog's mouth shut while staring into his or her eyes. Much of this training is based upon the now discredited belief that dogs operate on a dominance paradigm. Some of these suggested training methods are downright dangerous to both the dog and the owner and some of them may very well make problem behaviour worse.Overall, I was pretty disappointed with the heavy handed nature of the training suggestions."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mouths that Roared","review":"I figure this Danny DeVito film deserves two stars for its two nagging mouths that rage on ceaselessly: Anne Ramsey and Billy Crystal. Ramsey plays an unkillable troll whose repulsive personality becomes a perversely charming refuge from Crystal's incessant sado-narcissism. Crystal's character is so neurotically self-absorbed he can't stop babbling to himself even when he's required to share the screen with other actors. And in a rare change of pace from his usual wise-ass, cynical screen persona, DeVito plays a moron who can barely express himself.If you find Billy Crystal's follicle-shriveling monologues the most hilarious schtick ever, this film will wrench tears of joy from your eyes. In my case, the mute button was what enabled me to tough it out to the end of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning:This Blu Ray you Need Upgrade","review":"I had to return this film and when I got second copy, I called customer service, they told me I need Upgrade WTF??This is a pain because you need internet, and now I have to go to someone with internet to Upgrade.Unsure why n\\"Throw Momma from the train\\" needs upgrade, I got tons of Blu Ray/Dvds had no problem and No need for this drama.I wish They put Upgrade on Cover, So I will NOT buy it, Rather than putting in disc and saying you might need Upgrade..These Companies that do this,Suck!The film is good but still Need Upgrade and I gotta find a way to do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie ...","review":"What is the deal with this movie?

Ramsey's performance is a work of unbelievable talent--genius, even--unparalleled in it's ability to make me with ROAR with laughter every time I see it.Anne Ramsey died shortly after making this film, and I'm glad she got this performance in the can before her clock wound down.

They meet at a writing class and Owen asks Larry why he didn't like his murder story. Larry says \\"There were only two characters, one of which is dead on page two.\\" One day, Owen goes to see \\"Strangers on a train,\\" and gets the idea for Larry to kill his mother, and himself to kill the X-wife. He does. Well, almost. Andt hen for the rest of the picture, he wants Larry to kill his mother. The scene when they try to throw momma from the train is so funny! And the other great scenes are ones such as the scene when Owen hits Larry over the head with a frying pan.The DVD should have had more special features. MGM is a lousy company at doing that. I mean, take a classic flick like \\"Elmer Gantry,\\" and give it only a trailer. The cut scenes deserved to be cut, but if you want to see them, do so.Rent it or buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY G-D","review":"I have seen this movie at least 100 times, and it is still as funny since the first time I watched it! Anne Ramsey is a remarkable actress and I don't believe she has ever performed like this before. The combination of Danny Devito and Billy Crystal couldn't have been pulled off by anyone else. They gave an outstanding performance in this film. The plot is absolutely fabulous and is more realistic than you might think because there are quite a few of us that have, at one time or another wanted to 'Throw Momma From the Train'. The picture quality might not have been the best, but with a story line as 'to the point' and commendable as this one....... Does it really matter?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Comedy","review":"This hilarious and imaginative take-off on the Hitchcock classic \\"Strangers on a Train\\", showcases Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito at their best. Crystal is totally convincing as the frustrated author, and Danny DeVito achieves a combination of humor and pathos in his portrayal of Owen, the man-child who is totally dominated by his overbearing mother. Owen's cantankerous little mom is played by Anne Ramsey, who steals the show with her brilliant portrayal of one of the meanest, nastiest (and yet funniest) characters ever to grace the screen. The misadventures of these three will delight the viewer again and again. Get this one - it's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"For designers, surfers, skaters and snowboarders","review":"This is quite a cool book really, although like lots of graphics style books, they are best for browsing rather than reading.

The production is incredible, the cast perfect. But the real reason for watching this opera is Julia Migenes. She doesn't sing Carmen. She IS Carmen. She is Carmen with all her raw sensuality and alure and on top of that, what a voice!! So many greats have sung the role of Carmen without understanding the character of Carmen. Who cares how well someone sings if they just don't deliver from the heart, from the soul. Migenes gets it, and she delivers. And Domingo isn't bad either. (That was humor for those of you that take these reviews way too seriously).If you've never enjoyed an opera before, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good but be aware...","review":"This is perhaps the difinitive version of Carmen to see on a TV set. Domingo is fantastic and so is Migenes. You should be aware that in this \\"Movie\\" there are a number of places where music was acutally composed and entered into the Bizet Score. If you know the opera, those sections stick out like a sore thumb - if not, it will pass you by and you probably will not notice any difference. Great acting, singing, and orchestral playing. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"What a great flick! The story is timeless, the music is stellar, the cast is perfect, the performance are spectacular, and the filming is tops. The story is a clean do-right soldier who falls for a tainted no-good gypsy, losing everything he values due to a bit of bad luck. The music will dwell in your mind and in your heart long after you've returned to the mundane world. The cast is unbelievable - instead of actors, you will see Carmen, Don Jose, the solders, the matador, the soldiers, the theives, and the world they inhabit. When Carmen sings of love, you will wonder why you never understood the concept before and when Don Jose sings of his love, you will understand exactly why he follows Carmen to his doom. You will never even notice the camera - you flow thru the world of Carmen and Don Jose as if a bird."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a long-time opera fan","review":"I have been fortunate to attend opera for over 25 years and have purchased a number to own, from my original 33-1/3 records to VHS and now DVD. I own both VHS and DVD versions of Carmen and have given away about 6 copies to friends who weren't \\"sure they'd like opera.\\" All rate Carmen as outstanding and it has provided a doorway for them to enjoy others. I think Carmen is a wonderful combination of great music, wonderful photography, and best of all singers who are also great actors. Every time we get caught up in the story and hope it might end differently \\"this time.\\" I heartily recommend it as a first-time opera experience for anyone who wants to try it out. It doesn't get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"Although not entirely faithful to Bizet's opera, this is a passionate, realistic, colorful and sensual movie that I enjoyed very much. Placido Domingo is in fine form as the doomed Don Jose-his tragic transformation from straight-laced soldier to desperate madman is believeable. Julia Migenes is a sexy and commanding Carmen who has a great on-screen chemistry with Domingo. Ruggerio Raimondi is perfect as the swaggering bullfighter Escamillo. Faith Esham is amazing as Don Jose's sweetheart Michaela - her Act 3 aria is one of the great moments of the film. 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizet's Camen","review":"Beautiful opera in film mode so you can see a lot more than when on theatrical setting. I got it so cheap because it is on tape form rather than on a dvd. Also it was so cheap compared to other sellers to the extent I thaught it will be in an auful condition, but the opposite it is great. I am fameliar 5to this specific production. So I knew what I was buying but was afraid of the low price lest it would be bad condition BUT IT WASN'T. Thanks to the seller and to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"This production has little to do with the original and includes cuts, additions. changes and endless extraneous footage of irrelevant incidents and stray dogs wandering about. Domingo has the only real voice in the lot and is badly mis-cast as a mama's boy. Migenes has neither the voice for it nor the breath control to sustain what she does have, the Micaela even less so. Even the usually dependable Raimondi has trouble reaching his low notes. For the gold standard go to the 1988 production from the Met with Agnes Baltsa, the world's greatest mezzo, singing a Carmen that will make the paint sag on your walls. Jose Carreras is the perfect Don Jose and Leona Mitchell is a Micaela with a voice to remember. Samuel Ramey is the Escamillo and the whole is conducted by James Levine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gritty realism juxtaposed with the artifice of opera","review":"This film version of the great Bizet opera aims for gritty realism right from the start - during the opening credits a bull is impaled and killed during a bull-fight - of course this realism goes out the window as soon as the characters open their mouths and begin to sing!This is a well-mounted and well-sung production but the juxtaposition of a realistic setting with the artifice that is opera just doesn't work. The cast are not helped by the obvious lip-synching especially noticable during close-ups. The limitations of the singers as actors are also ruthlessly exposed.Lovers of the vibrancy and passion of Bizet's great opera are best advised to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is defintely not the Carmen to own.","review":"This offering got off on the wrong foot with me with the gratuitous begining scene of an innocent bull being tortured in a bull ring.Opera is a total experience but rests firmly on the conductor and the singers, those requirements are not met here,the visual effects of the on location shoot do not compensate for the mediocre totality. If you are going to own one visual Carmen, let it be the 1982 Baltsa/Carreras, if you are primarily interested in the vocal performance then you must own 1964 Callas/Gedda (finest Don Jose ever)on CD, or the De Los Angeles/Gedda (forgotten performance date)Domingo gives a far more vocally convincing performance in the Covent Garden production w/ Denyce Graves, who not only presents herself well but can also sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hybrid opera-movie perfect for DVD","review":"Everything other reviewers have said about the passion Migenes-Johnson brings to the role is true. In DVD, the viewer controls the subtitles, so those VHS complaints go away. This realization of Bizet's opera is really a hybrid -- neither true movie nor true opera, but the medium is perfect for the story and the music. I loved the camera angles and the adaptation of the original to this medium. Not a substitute for the staged opera, but much more satisfying visually and the singing is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maltin's Carmen review is Brain-Dead","review":"My wife (born a few blocks from Carmen's tobacco factory in Sevilla, Spain) and I agree with most of the 4+ star reviews about this movie-opera.

It is intended to tote along with you on a Rainier ascent, that is obvious because of the books lightweight nature and the fact it folds into a small area. But the vast majority of mountaineers now use licensed guides, thus the book is irrelevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebration of emotions","review":"What if a man is not influenced by any thoughts of others and stays totally isolate of all human hypocrisy? What if a man has only nature around him and nothing else to prejudice his sense of right and wrong? This is exactly what this movie is all about.Two children, stranded in an island, form their own set of ethics and morals...as they have to with no adults around. Their lives, as the Director wishes to convey, are a voyage of discovery. They discover the best food to survive on, they discover the places they should not visit, they discover adoloscence, they discover the rebellion of the teenage, they discover love, they discover passion, they discover the joys of family and finally, the irony of life. They have nothing to influence their discovery and that, in itself makes the movie an adventure and enchanting.This is one movie that's a must in all collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"I find it totally great","review":"I saw this movie when I was 13 (now I am 21) and I found it very beautiful.

Infact, Brooke Shields and Pheobe Cates are both very very extremely enormously immensely gorgeous women in the world.Nudity from 2 exellent girls in this planet.... I gave Paradise 5 but The Blue Lagoon 1Sorry ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beta male fantasy","review":"Of course Brooke's character would want to have the only boy on the island inseminate her; what choice does she have?In a version of this story where the girl shared the island with two boys, as soon as she began to ovulate, she would assess one boy as the alpha and the other boy as a beta, then offer herself sexually to the alpha boy. The beta boy probably wouldn't get any sex at all from the girl, unless he killed the alpha boy (like in \\"Lord of the Flies\\"?), which would promote him to acting alpha boy.But showing the brutal reality of human sexual selection wouldn't make as good a date movie, would it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the one that caught this?","review":"So I sat down to watch The Blue Lagoon. It's a great movie, but I couldn't help but notice how young Brooke Sheilds looked. It could have been because she was only 15 at the time. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it illegal to put a 15 year old naked in a Motion Picture? Two words come to mind....Kiddie Porn. Just a thought..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can it get more tacky?","review":"The action and dialog of this film are easily one of the worst ones I ever have seen. The plot is highly improbable, the form how the lifes of these two kids develop impossible. The behavior of the two defies all logic and is a bad transplant from what somebody who seemingly never lived through adolescence nor ever read a book about it believes to be adolescent behavior to an idyllic south sea island. The admittedly very good photography cannot save the moment nor let the viewer forget the stupidity of the movie itself. This is compounded by the total acting incompetence of Brooke Shields - and she isn't even good-looking enough to forgive her for her ineptitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innocent and Good","review":"While the plot might be a little bit weak, camera shots are amazing. The first time I saw this moving I was about 12, the nudity portion did shock me at the time. Right now, I'm can watch this moving again and again, as it leaves the innocence feeling after the titles go off. Acting is good, so is the set up, so is the camera shots. I think this movie should be bought just because.I think it is great and i guess, it reminds me of being 12 every time I watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"Entertaining romantic fairy-tale with Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields.

If you want to watch it with your children, that's your perogative, but let me say that I watched it when I was 11, and I was quite blown away by the graphic depictions of sexual scenes in the movies, and it wouldn't have made much of a difference if my parents were there with me or not. Granted, these are \\"tender\\" scenes without violence or disrepect like many other movies, but still, I had never seen anything like it, and it was too much all at once.

With nowhere to go he stays at a boarding house but a young boy who lives there thinks the stranger looks like a man he saw at the train station earlier. Now he's gotta shut this kid up before people get wise.It might sound good but it ain't. The acting is passable but the script feels like it was slapped together over lunch.

I totally loved the non-standup comedy details of the film- Hanks making comments about \\"going under\\" as he tries in vein to clean himself up before going onstage after not having taken a shower in awhile due to the fact that he's been kicked out of his apartment, Sally Field's portrayol of a woman wanting more in her life than just motherhood, etc. You really get the feeling that these are real people with dreams and you want to root for them, hoping that they'll \\"make it\\". I found myself getting nervous before each of their stand up performances. Anyway, great film, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTREMELY UNDERRATED!","review":"This is such a good movie! Tom Hanks plays a promising, self - destructive comic with emotional problems, and gives an OSCAR-CALIBUR PERFORMANCE!

It actually came out about the same time as \\"Big\\", which Hanks was nominated for, and I never understood why this film got slighted. Check it out, and see the first sign of the greatness to come in \\"Philledelphia\\" and Forest Gump\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Memorable - Comedy & Tragedy","review":"This was a memorable film for me, both good and bad. Almost 20 years later, some of the scenes in here bring either a smile or a frown to my face. I guess that means this is a powerful story. It left some indelible impressions, at least in my sensitive memory.Tom Hanks was mesmerizing as the haunted comedian, a man with a lot of talent to make people laugh but a guy tormented by the lack of support from his father. There is a scene or two in here with this dad that is so uncomfortable to watch that it has prevented me from seeing this multiple times.Too bad, because I do remember some wonderful, funny scenes such as Hanks in the hospital entertaining the patients. Sally Field also gives a touching performance as a housewife trying to break into the stand-up comedy business, and John Goodman is likable as her husband.Overall, this is an interesting film with very emotional scenes you won't soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story and funny","review":"Not many people even know about this film.Tom Hanks is great in this. Sally Fields does a great job in this also. Also watch for John Goodman who does his usual fantastic supporting role in this. Plus a young Damon Wayons inthis!!! You can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I remember seeing this movie in the theaters. I saw it on television today for the first time in a long time. It is pretty much as plain as I remember it. If the comedy club scenes are supposed to make you laugh, they did not succeed with me.Not being a big fan of Tom Hanks, he met my expectations of a boring performance. Sally Field should have avoided this movie. It is interesting to see this movie if you are into 1980's movies, but I don't recommend buying it for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs an editor","review":"Don't think this book will help most people. There are too many dimensions missing and wrong. On the Federal mantel the writeup says cut the columns 10 1/2 inches wide but the drawing shows 12 inches. The picture of the mantel shows a full brick clearance at the side of the firebox but the drawing is more like 5 inches.I got an idea of how a mantel could be made but you must work out your own dimensions. There is no bill of materials as stated before. I think there must be better books on this subject. Not too important but one screw is drawn with left had screws.

It's a tangled tale of love, adultery, deception, self-deception, jealousy and attempted suicide, all rendered with deadpan humour and with just enough darkness lurking behind the scenes to make it even more interesting. Many of Murdoch's novels have a central character cast as the master manipulator, but here it's never clear who is manipulating whom. The portrayal of the ponderous, rather smug protagonist is a masterpiece of sly character assassination and the immortal Honor Klein is...well, you'll have to read the book to find out. Heartily recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing, riveting, brilliant","review":"\\"A Severed Head\\" is a dark but extraordinary novel, full of emotion, surprises, and sumptuous writing.

However, the male puppets seem to end at the waist. When I unpackaged them, one of my graduate students stopped by and asked why the father was wearing a pink dress!

The Vietnam era generation (of which I am not) and those longing for the success of the 90's will appreciate the intertwining of worlds both invented, inverted, and completely true--as JFK survives Dallas, Clinton is a whistle blower, Sinatra lives the latter part of his life sans tongue--while sex permeates the novel just enough to make it as slick as the real and reinvented presidents who play the lead roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Review of O'Sullivan/Sheffrin","review":"Lacking is ease of use.

Ann Radcliffe writes page after page, after page...of picturesque descriptions of Italy and France's countryside.That being said, I found The Mysteries of Udolpho to be long winded and drawn out. The first two volumes are rather mind-numbing and I skimmed over much of it. I never felt a connection towards Emily and felt rather indifferent towards her well being. I found her to be rather insipid and became tired of her constant fits of weeping and fainting. Her servant, Annette, was more intriguing than Emily and her pathetic weakness.I would personally recommend skipping The Mysteries of Udolpho to read Sheridan Le Fanu's novel Uncle Silas.

You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Told You So - Count Basie","review":"All performances of Count Basie in the 60s and 70s are excellent masterpieces of the swing era. \\"Too Close for Comfort\\" is inimitable !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A NICE LOW BUDGET GOSPEL COLLECTION...IT MUST HAVE WORKED...THEY RELEASED 4 (FOUR) VOLUMES!!!","review":"For anybody who has a stripped budget, this will work.

However, it is far more than that. A powerful story about a Jesuit priest who has the courage to show solidarity with a poor, native tribe in South America, despite the militant attempts by his fellow Europeans to enslave the natives. Stunning performances by Jeremy Irons and Robert DeNiro. A tribute to Christian missionaries everywhere, who work powerfully to spread the love of Christ around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film, based on historical facts.","review":"The content of the film is excellent. the DVD is good, but at some point the picture stops, few seconds after it runs again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irons, De Niro, Neeson","review":"...all give stellar performances in this film, which has quite possibly the best original soundtrack of any film in the past 50 years. The screenplay is uneven, but the cinematography is unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See - On DVD, Please","review":"Absolutely one of the finest portrayals of the founding of the Americas (Brazil). I am a history buff who has been to Brazil many times and this film electrifys me. My VHS copy has worn out because I recommend it so highly and lend it out so many times. I will not buy another VHS: I have to have it on DVD. Please Tell me when it comes out and I will spread the word!"},{"rating":"1","title":"INCOMPLETE & LOOSE","review":"This was advertised as a 2 disc set but only came with one. No biggie for me as the price was low but still, falsely advertised. Also, the lone disc was loose & floating in the case & was scratched. Still plays ok but who knows for how long"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Makes History Fun","review":"I had to watch this movie for a history project and loved every minute of it. I am a fan of any work that portrays indigenous peoples as the victims they really were, and as people, not animals. This movie brought many to tears, and it also gave us a graphic realization of how much European explorers messed up a beautiful culture. But all in all, it ends on a high note."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"It is hard to watch this movie and not be moved in some way. Two great actors at their best, De Niro and Irons. Historically informative. Stunning scenery and outstanding soundtrack. This film has the best scene of forgiveness I have ever seen (when De Niro is confronted on the moutain.) The final scenes are breathtaking. The movie raises the question of whether Christians should turn the other cheek or not, when confronted with violence and patent injustice. No simple solution is offered. A brilliant film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mission","review":"The DVD arrived in excellent condition. It was used by our 2012 ILAC Summer Program in the Dominican Republic. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mission - Marvelous and Moving","review":"I had viewed this movie a few years back on VHS. It stirrs the spirit.Truly stunning in terms of photography and the musical score is enchanting. The storyline is very gripping which is a study of personalities of two jesuits - Mendoza (De Niro) and Gabriel (Irons) - striving for a common goal but with different mindsets. The acting especially of Jeremy Irons is remarkable.A Must-See Movie. Simply Great. Awaiting the DVD release of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the kids......","review":"Movie was harsh and got more difficult to watch as time progressed.

With all the trash and garbage on BD how about watching one of the best films ever made that is a true story! Real life is stranger and more exciting than any science fiction you will ever watch. Struggle between absolute good and absolute evil. This mission was the real deal folks!This film reminds me of a priest that I knew first hand in Guam during the Vietnam war. He was tortured for years in a prison camp during WWII. They told him to deny Christ and the torture would stop. He looked at me and said, \\"I just couldn't do that\\".I was a Baptist but now just a Christian. Drop the labels folks!Thanks for the BD version! Very nice gift for every Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mission","review":"This is such as awesome movie (The Mission), that I just had to buy a copy and view it over and over.Also since the Movie SCORE (Nella Phantasia) was eventually redone by Sarah Brightman with her adding lyrics to it, it just tied both together perfectly!If you see the movie and listen to the SCORE, then you have to also listen to Sarah Brightman's version of: Nella Phantasia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful film about religion and politics","review":"The Mission is a tremendous film about South America colonial politics in the 18th century. Based on a true story, it shows how Catholic Missions and their priests on one level protected Indian tribes from greedy businessmen, while the Church hierarchy had to compromise with the Spanish and Portuguese governments in order to prevent the Church's complete expulsion from South America (Unfortunately, the Portuguese eventually did kick the Jesuit Missionaries out of their colonies, thus removing the most active protectors of the native peoples).The film also focuses on the power of faith to redeem even the most rotten of scoundrels (Deniro). A touching, fantastic, and powerful film. No wonder the Vatican (on their website) rates The Mission as one of the top 100 films of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's Will - Man's Reaction","review":"This is one of my favourite movies. Only a DVD format and DTS sound will do justice to the cinematography and the soundtrack.The storyline is gripping and thoughtprovoking. It is about how two men of the cloth (de niro and jeremy irons)react to the will of God in the best way they can to defend the natives from the greedy imperialist designs of the colonists.Why is this movie still not out on DVD in spite of it being given a sales ranking of 825 by amazon and a ranking of No.13 in Latin America. I guess this movie was released by Catalyst logic on 01.01.02 but am confused that it is not available on amazon.Is there a chance that it will be out on DVD shortly. I'm waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"good example of ethnocentrism, and a great movie","review":"this movie was great. It was fun to watch in class to learn about ethnocentrism.

This film definitely left you thinking - if you could get through all the gory violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You promised your life to God, and God is love!\\"","review":"One of the lesser-known Deniro films is also a gem. But I think Jeremy Irons stole the show as a sympathetic Jesuit. Liam Neeson was so young in it, it must have been one of his first roles. Beautiful sceneries and blu-ray really made the experience all that better. I'm glad I added this to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine movie in the old style","review":"This movie is a favorite of mine because of its adherence to the old principles of movie-making: beautiful cinematography and attention to detail. The movie isn't trying to make you jump in suprise, but to immerse you into its characters and its scenery.If you feel a need to have an action sequence or plot twist every five minutes, this is not the movie for you. If you enjoyed the languid plot development of movies such as The Deer Hunter, which aim to tell a human story rather than to force a series of exciting moments, then you will love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, Awesome","review":"I could watch this movie only one time because of what I call the 'disturbing nature' of the film. It is probably too close to being true. The music, however is well worth owning and listening to over and over and over. The integration of music with the characters is amazing. An excellent film, well directed and acted (and played). Haunting, sad, beautiful. Deals with the push of the Catholic Church to 'convert' natives to Christianity. There is a serious question of which were closer to God, the natives with their music or the Church with its pomp, pagentry and blind ruthlessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does right or wrong matter?","review":"Esta película es una de las más fuertes que he visto. Me gustaba mucho y la recomendara.La música que juega Gabriel (Irons) para cultivar relaciónes con los guaraní es un hilo a través de la película. Es muy poderosa y transmite un sentimiento que crea un bono con el espectador.Los temas que se tratan abarcan varios áreas--el político, los indígenas, la esclavitud, el cristianismo, la iglesia católica, el pecado y la penitencia, la lucha entre lo bueno y lo malo--cuando, como siempre por las edades, lo más importante es quién tiene el poder. De estos, especialmente me gustaba la contradicción entre las enseñanzas de la iglesia católica en vista de las acciones de ella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"One has to watch this film in it's entirety un-interrupted...taking in the beautiful cinemotography, the lush soundtrack, the fine acting, and all the detail that went into potraying the era of sword and missionary in South America...the film does have some critiques on the imperialism that went hand in hand with Christianity, but not without showing the Jesuits misionaries rising above all this to stand for the opppressed...the film touched me like no other..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cinematography! Should have won more Oscars.","review":"The Mission is a moving story about Jesuit priests who try to convert Amerindians in South America. Irons and De Niro play strong roles. I think it should have won Best Score (Ennio Moriccone) and Best Director (Rolan Joffe) and Best Actor (Irons). The movie was so moving I almost cried when I first saw it. I don't want to spoil it by telling why, though. I recommend this movie to everyone. Other movies I would recommend: The Last Emporer, Lord of the Flies (1990), and Amistad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon's reviewer is wrong","review":"Read the other 4 & 5-star reviews... this movie is flawless. It grapples with some of the greatest and most difficult questions of religion, spirituality, and humanity. The cast is ridiculously awesome. Jeremy Irons' character is a great role model for anyone who considers themselves a learner in the life-long process of becoming more like Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a happy story, but interesting","review":"Great photography, good acting, sad story.

I enjoyed it very much even thou it was a homework assignment. rent it the descriptors of the time period will open your eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"another languishing Native American film until Western Europeons save them","review":"This movie puts forth the lie to the ethnic cleansing of America. It shows if not for the kindly members of a Western Europeon church, the people would \\"really\\" suffer. The history in this film only supports the myth that the people of the Americas were rescued by the church. Absurd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of destructive invaders","review":"This is a hard-to-watch yet necessary depiction of the destruction caused by invaders in a South American jungle in the 18th century. The natives were doing just fine, and even the Jesuit priests were not disrupting things too much for them, but then others decided to take over the area and make it their own, forcing out everyone who was already there.There are some horrifying scenes of people, including children, being shot and killed. Also, I question the priest's decision to remain in the mission with the people facing certain doom by staying there.I also am not sure I liked the casting of DeNiro as a European mercenary turned priest.However, the locations and other performances, as well as the music, make this a compelling film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie...See it!","review":"Great movie with fantastic script, editing, camera work, and a dynamic soundtrack by Enno Mariconne (yep, the same guy who composed Once Upon a Time in the West, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, and all those other spaghetti westerns). Let's not forget about the acting -- Robert Di Niro, Jeremy Irons, and a very young Liam Neison...My only criticism is that this DVD version was way overdue...But at last it is out...Don't miss it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Water Fall Energizes Spirit","review":"Robert de Nero in a dual role: one being his usual self as in his other movies, and the other becoming a Priest at The Mission in the jungles of South America. His conversion comes when he begins to side with jungle Natives in their struggles against colonialism by Europeans and church leaders. His self penance was to painfully lug, without help, all his heavy colonial war armor up the high steep side of a mountain over which dropped a wide jungle river. This verticle climb next to the waterfall was the only way to get to The Mission. He battles against the colonialists as he helps the Natives to defend The Mission and their jungle and their way of life. A movie that is a prelude to what is happening today to the Natives in the jungles and to their spiritual way of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"the dvd did not work on my TV and I sent another set of the Mission to a friend which didn't work either.","review":"The DVD seemed to be set up for Canada and USA and did not work for us or for my friend who had it from me as a Christmas present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corruption in the palace of justice","review":"Here is a true view of the Church and State working in disharmoney.So corrupt are both the Church and the very catholic (christian) states of Spain and Portugal that it never occures to them to put the believes they espouse before their need for power and money. A tale (based on fact) to break your heart. There is no defence for any of the actions in this story. Again we see deeds done in God's name, and the bloody hands that result. Like WWI, a \\"war where God was on everyones side\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Movie","review":"The movie \\"The Mission\\" is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Roland Joffe puts together an all-star cast and tells a religous story of the Guarani, a indian tribe settled deep in the Paraguay jungle. The hero of this movie, Father Gabriel, played by Jeremy Irons, leads a group of Jesuit preists to convert this Indian tribe into Christianity. However, the ending is a sad one due to the Spanish and Portuguese wiping out the missions as well as most of the tribe. Robert DeNiro also plays a role in this movie as Rodrigo Mendoza. Him and Jeremy Irons are a blockbuster duo. The movie is filmed in the jungle with an excellent use of the camera and as well as a outstanding score. This movie was directed with the intent to inform the audience of the hardships faced by the Guarani in this time period and accurate history. I really enjoyed this movie and recomend it for all to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film and history","review":"This is a fairly good depiction of history in South America during Colonial times.

The cinematography is breathtaking. No one should be limited to the TV format of this movie which demands the wide screen. I am in disbelief that this film is still not available on DVD. Ennio Morricone's score is outstanding - Beautiful! Get the soundtrack, turn up the bass and the volume, a glass of wine...whoa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The All-Star of Films","review":"From the opening scene to the breath-holding finale, this film is best compared to a awe inspiring work of art. The story is simple: man struggles with man, man struggles with himelf, man struggles with \\"God\\". The morality of the movie is somewhat lost in the visually appealing location that the movie was filmed in. Several times I had to remind myself to take a breath. The movie, along with the soundtrack, are easily one of the best pieces of art Hollywood has every released.

There is only one movie that pulled off having all the characters die in it and that was Glory. I don't under any circumstances recommend this movie to anyone.

There is one whole chapter extoling the merits of it. However, no formula is given and the reader is directed to the author's website.

In this business, beware the well-chosen example.Perhaps you are still willing to overlook the lack of empirical proof. Are some of her trading concepts even logically coherent? No. For example, Gann methodology fails William Eckhardt's \\"c-test\\" (See a back issue of the magazine, \\"Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities\\").We are not talking about the author's intentions, motivations, or character here.

It should really be metal. It turns out the ratcheting mechanism gives more torque than the handle can take.It might be good for cutting flowers or something, but don't rely on it for bigger jobs even though it says it is good up to 3/4\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've known better...","review":"I had a cheap pair of ratchet anvil pruners I was replacing that lasted several years. But I should've known better than to buy another plastic one. This broke the first cut on a branch no bigger than a half inch - really. And, no, it wasn't iron wood. Better stick with loppers or bypass clippers. I'll read up on other Fiskar products before buying again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted less than an hour","review":"It worked great until the handle broke. This is definitely a light-duty tool.

The first cut was amazing! Clean cut, perfectly true, and very easy. The second cut worked, but took several attempts. It was clear that the ratchet was only wokring some of the time. After 5 cuts, the plastic handle broke! I never applied more than the pressure exerted by one hand squeezing the handles, and I am a 65 year-old retired desk worker, not a 25 year-old pro tennis player with a grip of steel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The pruners were able to cut small to medium size single branches, but if your trying to cut more than one piece at a time the gear releases. If you need to cut anything over one-half of an inch or old hardened wood, don't try it. I did and the cheaply made plastic handle broke. Also the cutting blade is loosely fit and will turn to one side or the other when trying to cut anything heavier than a twig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiskar ratcheting pruner.","review":"I can't believe the first time I used these pruners, they broke! Literally, on the third branch I was cutting! It wasn't even 1/2 inch thick though it states it will go up to 3/4 inch.I thought by buying a name brand like Fiskars, it would have some quality and integrity. Nope. Cheap China made product. Very disappointed.I read all the reviews on the ratcheting pruners and thought this was the one. I have a great set of Gerber's, but this had the better review. Maybe I received a defective set, but it broke so quick. The material is not good quality, just cheap plastic.I would not recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk! Avoid!

My old one is on loan, and not likely to come back to me. I'm baffled by the reviewers who claim that this product is flimsy, and breaks easily. Since these pruners are relatively inexpensive, I've been knowingly overusing and abusing mine, taking cuts which I know I should have done on my next larger sized (15\\") pruner. So far, no problems, but if I ever do break this product I will consider it to be my fault. I've already tested them beyond what should be considered normal or reasonable. I also have the Barnel 8\\" rachet pruner, which has metal handles. I suppose it is stronger, but it's heavier and less comfortable than the Fiskars' pruner. At a price of less than $10, I've certainly gotten my money's worth and am happy with the Fiskars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy NOT FOR THICK BRANCHES","review":"I found that the shears bend and twist if you attempt to cut a branch at an angle under 50 degree instead of a straight 90 degree to the branch. of course this is not a problem with very small branches, best for flower stems etc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiskars Ratchet Pruner","review":"I have found these awkward to use: large for small hands; they don't open far enough to get around average sized stems or branches; and they lock constantly, necessitating several squeezes to open again.

I'd rather not be spoken down to by someone who has produced such a poorly copyedited text...about copyediting.This book is a required text for a graduate class (in an English and Publishing program) and we all spent a fair bit of time complaining about it.In spite of this, it is reasonably helpful.

While it is understandable that many times plots are rewritten for film, the sudden change of the assasination attempt from South Africa to Norway is confusing to me. The photography of the film leaves much to be desired too. The lighting is simply too dark, making it almost impossible to see the faces of the many black characters in this film. I've seen movies from Scandinavia better made than this one. If you want a good suspensful Scandinavian movie, try Insomnia instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny 5 Is Indeed Still Alive!","review":"THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVS!I was bought up watching this and the original and I never repeated any of the language in the movie, if any language at all there's very little swearing after all it is PG13...It's one of the greatest sequels of all time, having a good story and casting whilst also keeping in touch with the originals heart warming moments and humour.This movie shouldn't be watched to be judged like some of the other reviewers have...it's there to be watched and enjoyed by the whole family big or small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph of the robot spirit","review":"This movie is great in a horrendously cheesy, yet beautiful way - it is a triumph of the human (robot) spirit. Poor ol' Johnny 5 comes to the big city, open eyed and pure and is beaten down and taken advantage of. The classic struggle between hope and idealism vs. the often dreary and dissapointing realities. But yes, one glorious spirit is capable of awakening the lost hope in others and emerging victorious."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Robot Lives Still","review":"This is almost as good as the original although this is good too.

This is a great family comedy that everyone will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"annoying and funny at the same time","review":"Johnny Five is annoying and funny at the same time. his search for input made me feel like laughing. his voice on the other hand, is very annoying. I forgot to mention the sad part and that is when he is being hacked to pieces and his so-called friend Oscar is directing the demolition. he gets revenge on Oscar toward the end and then temporarily dies, being brought back to life by Ben. all in all, get this movie if you're a kid at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel Beats the Original!","review":"I don't know how [...] collective reviews give Short Circuit a higher rating than its sequel. I truly believe this is one sequel that is better than the original!Fisher Stevens was highly enjoyable as Ben Jahveri. An West Asian technological genius that computes his robot buddy Johnny 5. This movie has a good balance of comedy, concern, & romance. Sometimes weaved together in the same scene.This is one of those movies where you don't have to know about the first part to enjoy the film. The storyline is not carved out of the original, with the exception of evolving Johnny 5's character. In the first movie, Johnny 5 couldn't speak English, or interact with his surrounding well. This time around Johnny 5 is the whimsical counterpart to his human superior.. or is it the other way around?All in all, a fun & friendly 80s comedy. 4 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome movie","review":"This is a great movie for everybody.

The character of Johnny Five has an irresistible charisma that I just love. Sure, other movies feature an out-of-it's element protagonist possessing unusual abilities that both benefit and alienate it, but Short Circuit 2 also has believable characters, good dialogue and delivers an emotional impact. Witnessing Johnny Five's trials and tribulations proves to be an interesting experience.The biggest complaint I have is the fact you can't take the movie too seriously. There are some impossible actions taken by the robot that will leave you with a \\"yeah right\\" feeling. Also, some harsh language is used which I found to be unnecessary. It would've been better to leave it out in order to make the film suitable for all ages.This is one sequel that's superior to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Johnny comes marching home again","review":"This is the sequel to the movie \\"Short Circuit\\" and relies heavily on having \\"Short Circuit\\" viewed first.

This movie contains a love interest (Sandy), and economics. The action comes from when they leave Johnny (you guessed it) home alone. He is bamboozled by petty crooks, and abducted by ruthless people because someone wants the warehouse access.So will Sandy and Ben get past the awkward stage?

It is meant to be funny as she and her friends play baseball, have unusual pets such as caterpillars and germs, and interact with their unusual relatives and neighbors. It involves a holy man with an actual shrunken head, baseball lessons as a birthday present, a young girl with a crush on a priest, a magic shop, a magic show where Kate sticks her head into a guillotine and other similar silliness.A quirky book, the picture on the cover where a female in what looks like a formal dress is winding up to whack a baseball with her bat can sum up the story. It is a fun book for children to read; you really do not know what is going to happen next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the worst, sell out the best","review":"Here we find yet another glorification of the 1960's as if they were the height of western civilization.Instead, however, we find that these characters have held on to the worst indulgences of that era (casual sex, drugs) while selling out the idealism that made the era so promising. In other words, keep the stuff that makes you \\"feel good\\" while dumping the activism that just might threaten your upward mobility and materialistic lifestyle.Such a movie might have been compelling had it condemned such a philosophy.

But the soundtrack, innovative in its day, is very tired now, compared with all the copycats that have followed. I recently visited Beaufort, S.C., where this was filmed.

It is one of these 'theme' movies, in which the issues of what's happened in their lives becomes the main story, instead of secondary issues picked up in a main story.The result is a movie which goes nowhere, does nothing, and is totally and utterly boring.A star line-up, yet what a waste!

Why not release those scenes depicting the characters way back when and finally getting to see Costner?

I will also add totally believable. David Lean's Direction and Photography is outstanding. This isn't a movie as much as an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars","review":"The movie is an excellent adaptation but can't quite match the mastery of the original novel. It has an all-star cast. The cinematography is fine as is the pacing. If it lacks anything, its the depth of the novel, which is a common failing in film adaptions. I recommend it for war and drama buffs alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ALL ABOUT DOING ONE'S DUTY","review":"David Lean loved to create, populate and inhabit worlds that no longer exist. He once famously said, \\"I only feel alive when I'm making a movie.\\" In The Bridge on the River Kwai Lean imprisons us in a lush landscape and forces us an to put our minds to a task that will give us some relief from the harsh reality of being a POW constructing the Burma Railway. Controversial to many as a condemnation of a British character flaw of \\"doing one's duty and being happy in your work.\\" The same notion was also reflected in the Nuremburg Trials. This taut story by Pierre Boulle also offered a final moment of redemption - however posthumous. But that's the hell of war. See William Holden, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, and Sessue Hayakawa are at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holden shines once more but loses the Oscar.","review":"The Bridge On the River Kwai (1957) William Holden and Alec Guinness clash while prisoners of war at a Japanese camp. Loosely based on a true story, the movie takes some liberties with the leading characters, so for you historical buffs out there research is recommended. I'm not too keen on Sir David Lean's epics due to their tendency to drag on for quite a while but I do admire the vast scope of his productions. The famous \\"River Kwai March\\" is just as memorable as the film's literally explosive ending. Although Holden is billed as the lead here, it was Guinness who grabbed the Oscar gold as a veteran Brit with a bridge to build whose duty places him at odds with Holden and the true goal of the film: To destroy the bridge at all costs. Jack Hawkins co-stars as the only character with enough common sense left by the end. Perhaps the most watchable of Lean's films on a repeat level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Masterpiece Quality","review":"The jungles and mountainpeaks, rivers and animals make this a cinematic masterpiece. I would love to visit Ceylon but of course not during war. Its beauty is just absolute. The picture's story was also quite good. The overall theme to me was is there honor in wartime. To we become quite human and do what we can to survive or do we cling to the rules and stay soldiers to the end. In the movie Alec Guiness plays the rule oriented Major caught in a prison camp being told to build a bridge with his other subordinates, should he keep up the farce and play Major or leader until they are freed, following the rules no matter if it kills him. William Holden who is one of the subordinates disagrees, one other sees his point. Guiness becomes obsessed with his leadership and the bridge is his projection of obsession and his eventual demise. A stunning visual feast. Ceylon is and should be a dream come true not a place for negative energy to florish.Lisa Nary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but slow.","review":"Shot beautifully and with wonderful acting, it is truly a treat to look at. The story is a bit slow, unless you are fond of military action, and doesn't make all that much sense till the last scene. It took me a while to understand why Alec Guiness's character really wanted to build the bridge. But it was worth sitting through the whole movie for the last scene, involving the bridge. I was on the edge of my seat and very involved in the movie by that point. I would recommend this movie, but I enjoyed another of David Lean's films, Doctor Zhivago, much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problem With Viewing","review":"The movie is excellent.

The setting is a World War II prison camp somewhere in the jungle. Hot, sticky, and yucky. The prisoners are required to build a bridge. The prisoners do what they can to keep the bridge from being built, until one day, when a British Colonel whose spent too much time in the sun shows up as a prisoner. He actually designs and builds a great bridge. It's a good film about the struggle of and against human nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictional account of wartime atrocities","review":"This film is an attempt to sensationalize one of the most horrendous atrocities of WWII in the Pacific Theater, namely, the building of the 'Death Railway'. The film under-emphasizes the fact that thousands of Allied POW's died at the hands of the Japanese in building their strategic railway through southeast Asia. Many of the characters and events depicted in the movie are utter fiction, and thus has no place in my collection. For a more accurate account, read Clifford Kinvig's book 'River Kwai Railway'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!!","review":"There is probably not a film of human drama that compares to this.

One day I saw that The Bridge on the River Kwai was playing. I walked out of the theater knowing I had seen one of the best movies ever made.The plot is about a bridge being built by Allied prisoners of war. The battle centers around two strong willed men. Col Nicholson (Alec Guinness) a british commander who refuses to comply with Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa)who runs the camp. During this battle Cmdr./Maj. Shears (William Holden) escapes only to be called back into duty to destroy the bridge that now Nicholson has taken great pride in constructing.This is one of those movies that is slow paced but done so deliberetly. Director David Lean paces the movie so by the end you don't even want to go to the bathroom, (Lean would use the same style in the brilliant Lawrence of Arabia)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Great movie. A most have for every video library. Alec Guiness is priceless in this movie.

From what I understand, the scene where the bridge is blown up was one of the most dramatic special effects of its day. In this era of computer animation and digital enhancement, this is hard to imagine.Evaluated in the context of its time, this movie is no doubt a classic. The acting, the direction and the cinematography are all first rate. The whole production is based on the true story of the American POW's who were held in a camp and forced to build the infamous bridge. I am guessing for all of its acclaim, it is very close to the actual events that happened.Everything on the DVD is good. My only beef is with the chapter selections, there are not enough of them. You find yourself having to fast forward through chapters to get to a specific point. Other than this small issue, this is a DVD worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"This made me think of renting Bataan (1943) with Desi Arnaz.","review":"I will watch just about any movie with William Holden in it and I have been curious to see the much hyped The Bridge On The River Kwai.

But the BIG disappointment was the sound -- here remixed into 5.1 channels of compression-free Dolby Digital.General sound quality, too, was okay. Until, about 20 minutes in, when my speakers started to spit out occasional (say every five minutes) ear-splitting 'cracks\\" -- the type that long experience tells me can blow a tweeter.My system has the sound decoded by the Blu Ray Player - a Pioneer BDP-320 -- which then goes to an Onkyo 606 receiver.Never before (not since)has my system reacted this way to a visually perfect disc.Anyhow, back the disc went to Amazon.

I fail to give it five stars because it is not accurate on many points and is written with extreme Protestant bias. Taken as a whole, however, the book is a fascinating tour of ancient mythology and its influence on Christianity. No one who reads the book and takes the time to follow up with some research can deny its basic premise that Catholicism takes much of its symbolism and doctrine from other forms of ancient worship.

He says that candles in worship are used by a false Church which follows Bablon's mystery religion, but in scripture, both Old and New Testaments, we find the use of candles by God's people and in the heavenly worship. He objects to the tonsure of religious orders ignoring the fact that St. Paul in the book of Acts shaved his head as a sign of a vow he made to God. Space prevents me from listing all of the errors in his work.

Got the jig in place, attached the 2 1/8\\" hole saw and went to town. Sure some of the plastic jig got chewed off but whatever I expected that.. It want much... Getting the mandrel off was a herculian effort but I got it off finally... Went to attach the 1\\" hole saw to mandrel and found it doesn't fit... Not even close. The threads for it are substantially smaller so it is essentially useless to me. there is no way to get it in the supplied mandrel. None... Now I have to go to the hardware store and get the right tools when I thought thats what I spent $20 on in thr first place. This product is junk. If all u need is to use the 2 1/8\\" hole saw this is the overpriced tool for you... If you'd like your door to have the hole for the deadbolt stay far away from this item. Seriously..

Now a different store had more choices, which looked slightly better.Even before I could use it, I had trouble. I had a helluva time getting the hole saw off the mandrel. Then once the jig was on the door, it wobbled like crazy. The provided hole saws are terrible. And the plastic guide for the end of the door? How do they figure those two little plastic tabs will keep it aligned so I can \\"router\\"? I had to hold the template with one hand and \\"router\\" with the other. With my 18V Dewalt drill, that is not easy.The only purpose I found for it was to put it on the door, mark the holes with pencil and take it off.

Apart from that, it worked very well and actually used it on a second door with no trouble at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"I almost ruined my door using this jig.

At every turn, there is a new an intriguing soundscape to propel you into a Drum n Bass nirvana.Tracks like Slam, Tarantula, and Another Planet are so well orchestrated that you would think you were listening to a modern Mozart on the 1's n 2's.Pendulum's Hold Your Colour album is one of those albums that, if you really like drum n bass, will be playing for your friends whenever you have one near.I give this album 5 stars. As a real fan of the genre, Pendulum brings something new to the table that all predecessors lacked, absolute intensity at every turn.

You're not going to watch this movie for the plot and the dialogue. You're going to watch this movie to see Rita. Her performance as Gilda has got to be one of the sexiest performances I have ever seen. I can't think of an actress at work today that could have done it better. Her beauty and appeal are perfectly showcased in her \\"striptease\\" to \\"Put The Blame on Mame\\". It's hard to believe that she only takes off one glove in the number, because it has the same affect as if she took a lot more off! Plot and dialogue? Forget it. Rita?

The many reviewers on this site have done a good job describing the plot, the passion, and Rita's unequal performance. But Gilda is much more than that. It is the incarnation of the 40's film atmosphere of elegance and romance. We are in post war 1945 and the American film noir genre is blossoming, and ironically where? Not in L.A. or N.Y. but in Buenos Ayres where ex Nazis populate the countryside. Another way to look at Gilda is through nostalgic eyes. You have to be old enough to remember the post war years of the optimism turned pessimism. And in the middle of it comes Gilda, a movie that nobody would dare remake and stay alive, that gave us the once in a lifetime gift of the love Godess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good phone if you never leave it off charger","review":"Everything about this phone is good, except the battery life.

Not scary, not creepy, not atmospheric, not funny. Not anything but boring. Boring.I suppose if I believed in supernatural cars this might do something for me. But I don't and it doesn't. In my opinion if one goes through the Carpenter canon in chronological order this would be his first dud. Even the usual great Carpenter music that accompanied so many of his movies back then is missing. He relies on commercial hits of the past.A dud. Did I mention the acting is horrid?

Simon Phillips is, of course, just fantastic. On this, his third solo effort, he turns off the sequencers and does it all with real musicians. The ensemble contains the core from Force Majeure - Anthony Jackson, Ray Russle and adds Mitch Forman and various percussionists. Several of the compositions seem to have more body than Simon's earlier work without losing any of the Simon signature fireworks. Absolute must for any drummer. I would have given it 5 stars but I would reserve that rating for aclassics like 'A Love Supreme\\" or 'Kind of Blue' and so forth>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laci's side of the story","review":"I read this book in 2 days it was so riveting. The honesty that Sharon Rocha shares with the reader is nothing short of astounding. Even though her grief is still evident she opens her life to us and lets us see the true Laci, from a mother's viewpoint. Who would know her better than her own mother? You will laugh with her as she shares stories of Laci's youth and cry with her as she descries the pain her family has been through. . This book will share the truth and tragedy of life and death.What a great tragedy it was for Laci to ever meet Scott.After reading this book I can honestly say that the world was blessed by Laci and Conner and they will never be forgotten"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"One of the most honest, gut wrenching books I have read in a long while. I highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Emotion","review":"Like many, I have followed the Laci Peterson case from the very beginning. I have put off reading any of the books, because it just felt weird to me, like Laci was being exploited for someone else's gain. However, I was (of course) very interested, so when I saw that Sharon Rocha had written a book, I knew it was one I had to read, and I was right.Several times, I had to just put the book down for a little while to keep from crying. Everyone knows what a nightmare Laci's disappearance was, and how it ended... but this book shares what only a mother knows, and feels. It's heartwrenching, to say the least... It's also sweet, and shines a light on Laci like I have never seen.I have recommended this book to everyone. It will touch your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart wrenching but worth it","review":"This book is heart wrenching, but is a good view into the family's story (Laci's family) and of the trial. You really feel for Sharon Rocha and you know that this is the TRUTH! I recommend this book if you followed the story and trial. It brings everything together."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Honest, Heart-Touching Book","review":"This is a wonderful, well-written book. It is very detailed and accurate. Not tabloid lies. Sharon put her heart and soul into this book and shared with the world her most prized possession - Laci. My heart goes out to her. I couldn't stop reading and I cried throughout the book. She loved and trusted Scott and could not believe he would do this to Laci. It's a book about love, loss and deception. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books I've ever read","review":"being a mother, my heart bleeds for Sharon...I cried through the whole story - that Scott deserves nothing less than eternal hell - he did it - there is no doubt - I just cannot believe the difference from \\"lover\\" to \\"murderer\\" - I've seen it, not the murderer part but know of hot/cold people - it boggles the mind that even when they(Laci's family) tried to extend sympathy to the Peterson family they said \\"F you\\" in those words - I cannot get over that unless their own shame for what their son clearly did astounds them as well - I don't know - I just know that this book is amazing and I kiss my little ones extra hard because I cannot imagine having to go through something like this - God Bless Sharon, and Ron and Bret and Amy - hopefully you shall find peace - never again will I sweat the small stuff - this book had more of a profound effect on me than I thought it would - every mother/father should read it - it's unreal...."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"This was a great book, it made you mad and sad. Sharon is a geat writer. Would and could read it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written and Emotional","review":"I loved the book. It was well written and very emotional. I have been caputured by the story of Laci and Conner from the very beginning when the world heard the terrible news that she and her unborn son went missing. I have the utmost respect for Sharon Rocha and her family. They have been through the hardest thing imaginable and have kept their composure in the press and have done good deeds and still try to help others.If you loved following the case through the news, you'll love hearing the truth. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly touching tribute to Laci","review":"Sharon eloquently puts into words the horror of losing her daughter and grandson. Her pain is still raw but her strength is so inspiring. Her story is incredibly tragic, but I believe she will be able to help others who find themselves in similar situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laci book review","review":"my mom asked this book for her birthday and she raves that it is very good. i was impressed that it was a better deal to buy with Amazon.com than going to any other store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Righteous","review":"Reading the book made me, at times, feel sick to my stomach. Sharon Rocha's righteous position is hard to bear. Is she the expert when to decide which of Scott Peterson's behavior is appropriate and which is not? Anyway she draws the line and basta. She has no doubts once she has made up her mind and she somehow manipulates the people around her to feel and express the same. She's been through hell and at the same time she highly contributed to make the investigation a circus. I hated the way she treated the Peterson family, how she interprets their very actions. I had the notion that if it was her decision there wouldn't have been a trial, her point was made long before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"It took me no time at all to get through this book. It wasn't exactly what I thought it was about. In the reveiew I read it said it would give more case specifics, I didn't see anything I didn't already know. I liked it though because it told me about Laci and what a great person she was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharon wrote an excellent book!","review":"Sharon did an excellent job describing all characters. It was hard to put book down!!! I laughed, cried, & smiled while reading... I barely knew about the case since I was a lot younger when Laci was murdered... After reading \\"for laci\\" I've decided to donate money to Sharon's fund & write her a letter. AWESOME book!!!! 6 STARSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Moving.....","review":"I have read several books on Laci/Scott Peterson and this one still remains my favorite. Sharon Rocha clearly put heart and soul into the writing and truly wants everyone to know Laci. It is unthinkable that Scott Peterson did this to his innocent wife and their unborn child. This book has brought me to tears on more than one occasion as I'm sure it's done with many others. Highly recommended ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Laci Peterson book","review":"I purchased this book after I read the article in People Magazine about Sharon Rocha, Laci's mother. After reading the article, I felt like I knew her, and I really liked her; so, I bought the book. The book provoked many emotions in me. I cried when Sharon talked about Laci, and I became furious when she wrote about Scott's behavior when Laci was first missing. His behavior was enough proof for me that he was quilty, not that I ever had a doubt before.I especially enjoyed Sharon's writings about Laci's childhood and some of the things she did, such as calling her mom from a car phone for the first time and thinking it was the greatest thing she had ever done in life.I admire Sharon Rocha's strength. If you want to know the truth about Laci Peterson and her murderer, this book is the one to purchase. Five stars all the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL BOOK","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK ABOUT LACI. READING THIS BOOK WRITTEN BY HER MOTHER, MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH HER AND I COULD FEEL HER EVERY EMOTION. I THINK EVERY MOTHER SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This Book was so moving and sad, it was a story that needed to be told by Laci's mother. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable work.","review":"\\"For Laci\\" is a beautiful, well written book. By the time I finished it I had smiled a lot, shed many tears, and felt I knew Laci, her family, and friends. Sharon Rocha has bared her soul in this book and done it in a most dignified and honest way. It sounds trite to say \\"I understand how she feels,\\" but after reading this book, you truly do - from the pride and joy of being a mother, to the horror of discovering her son-in-law was a murderer. I've read other books about this case and found them sleezy and wished I hadn't wasted my money. I've read \\"For Laci\\" twice, and loved it even more the second time. I will probably read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly touching book worth the read","review":"For those who thought they knew everything about the Scott Peterson case, think again! Not only will you learn a great deal more about the facts of this case, but FINALLY you will learn about someone who was lost in the trial... LACI herself! It is truly unfortunate that the victim in such crimes becomes lost in the shuffle and her life is only important relative to the crime. This book concentrates on the woman who was so brutally killed, and a mother's love for her daughter and her determination to find justice for her death. Ms. Rocha is a remarkable person and I applaud her strength and courage. Finally, a book about the case from someone whose motives are not about money, but about remembering Laci and Connor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is What Unconditional Love Means","review":"My mother bought me this book and I read it very quickly; I realized why my mother had given it to me ~~ it is about the unconditional love and bond between a mother and daughter. My heart breaks for Sharon and her family; I applaud her for writing such a special tribute to Laci and Connor. I just finished it on December 23, 2006 and I know tomorrow will be 4 long years since Laci has been gone. A wonderful book for anyone who is grieving and in need of comfort and healing. Laci and Connor will remain in America's heart for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book and Easy Read","review":"I loved the book. I couldn't put it down. I know the story and I have read most of the books on this subject but this one stands out as the best.I really got to know Laci and her family and what it was like for them to go through this tragedy.Thank you, Sharon, for sharing with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading even if you watched all the trial coverage","review":"First I bought this book to support Laci's mother's cause of funding for search dogs. After having watched ALL the trial coverage and the trial, I didn't know whether I'd be interested in reading the book but it was worthwhile. It humanizes the victim of the crime, you feel that you are supporting her mother by reading the book, and you do learn new information that wasn't presented previously. If for no other reason than to support her mother, I would recommend purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The human side of the story","review":"This is a very touching & heartbreaking book. It expresses the forgotten humanity of this widely publicized case. While reading it, one feels Sharon Rocha's visceral & primal pain from losing someone so close to her and the horror she felt when she realized who the killer was. A must read for anyone who wants to know what happened in the case, when it happened, and what it's like for the family and friends left behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb book! A MUST READ.","review":"I was touched by the Laci story from the very beginning, when she was first announced missing. I finally had the chance to buy and read the book and it touched me just as much as expected, if not more. Be prepared to shed tears, many tears. You feel such sadness for this tragic loss. And at the same time, I admire her mother for having the strength to speak out and be a voice for Laci. The book is so captiving, I stayed up until 2am some nights reading page after page. I finished the book in less than one week. If this book doesn't move you, then I don't know what will."},{"rating":"2","title":"very emotional","review":"Reading this book was so emotional for me. After asking a friend a suggestion on a good book, she recommended this one. Reading this book made you feel as if you knew exactly who Laci was. Sharon shared so many experiences that I became so attached to the book, literally crying and smiling while I read. This paticular book touched on so many facts about things Scott had said and done that I never had known of previously. I reccomend this book to anyone who wants the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me cry","review":"This book made me cry so many times, but I loved reading about laci and how she really was. Sharon is the only one qualified to tell us about her daughter.Good Read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Outstanding Rendition - Among the Best","review":"I, like many others after reading Laci's mother's book, was sincerely touched with deep heart-felt sorrow. Many amazing new insightful pieces of information were disclosed about laci's life, for example, about her sorority life at Cal-Poly, and her life with ex-boyfriend Kent Gaines who went on to later shoot another girlfriend in the back, for which he's serving a sentence for now in the Washington State Peneteniary. Spoken from the heart like no one else could, only Laci's mother could tell this one, this way. Definitely the favorites of mine on the subject are this one, and Brad Knight's Laci Peterson The Whole Story which likewise I found very insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"From joy to tragedy","review":"This mother brought out the deepest emotions from the joy to the tragedy of her daughter. Can't help empathize or feel the loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST BOOK WRITTEN, by far about LACI PETERSON","review":"I have read every single book written about the Laci Peterson case and this is the best book written by far. Aside from the obvious (the heart filled story of a mother's tragic loss) this book also gives:1) So much insight into who Laci Peterson was.2) New information about the case that no other books, articles,court tv or any transcripts gave.3) Private journal entries that Laci wrote up to her death.4) Intimate recorded conversations that Sharon had with Scottthat have not ever been released anywhere else, but here.5) Sharon addresses other books written about Laci6) She also discusses her reaction to psychics and how the EVPplayed a role (this was very interesting)You must read this book, you won't be able to put it down. Very well written and makes you understand Laci and her family in a more personal way..............Sharon, Laci would be proud of you, as we all are. God Bless you."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart breaking","review":"this book is one of the best boobks i have ever read it is honestly a tear jerker and to hear what the family through breaks my heart and i wish i could meet the family after reading this i have a seven month old now and evrytime i picked up that book i always think about how lucky i am to have himgod bless Sharon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written","review":"Beautifully written by a loving mother who became the voice of her daughter and grandson. Prayers for this family.I watched this when Christine and watched the trial and learned so much more in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL WRITTEN DOCUMENTED BOOK BY SHARON ROCHA!","review":"If you followed the Laci Peterson case from the day she was reported as missing on Christmas Eve, 2002, as I did, you should read this book. Laci's Mother, Sharon Rocha, has written an insightful book documenting all the moments from that time up through the trial when Scott Peterson was convicted.The book must have been very difficult for Ms. Rocha to write, as she relives the horror and loss that she has suffered. I give her credit for standing her ground and standing up to Scott Pererson and his family, in her pursuit of justice for her daughter and grandson who were tragically and senselessly murdered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best read in a long time","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I was totally in awe of Sharon Rocha for her strength and determination to bring justice for Laci and Connor. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who was as enthralled with this case as I was.Clare Scott, Las Vegas, NV"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mothers Journey","review":"I have read all the books on the case. This book is an intimate look into a mother's journey resulting from the death of her beloved daughter. There was more to who Laci was as a person (she was a daughter, BUT also a friend, wife, sister,daughter in law, aunt..). This book is ONE perspective of Laci as a person. Sharon Rocha brings her to \\"life\\", in the way only a mother can. If you are searching for new facts, evidence or smoking guns- this is not the most accurate book and certainly not the most objective out there (nor do I believe that was Sharon Rocha's intent). The focus is on her daughter and her feelings and insights as a mother). I was disappointed in the jabs at the Peterson family. I feel it kind of took away from the story and Laci's memory, somehow. Taking this with a grain of salt, if you are looking for insight into a mother's journey through a wrenching, tragic loss and into part of Laci as a person, this is the book for you. Lovely pictures as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST book I have ever read","review":"I am not exaggerating, this is the best book I have ever read, for many reasons. One, you can LITERALLY feel the emotions of Sharon Rocha with every word written. Two, you learn about Laci and by the end I felt like I knew her. Three, you learn the truth about Scott's actions throughout everything. Four, I now know what Scott's family is really like (I DO NOT think highly of them at all!). And five, you cannot help but let your emotions out while reading this book. Until reading \\"For Laci\\", I have NEVER had a book make me cry. Definately a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real and moving","review":"This heartbreaking story also speaks of the light. Ms. Rocha begins by saying she feels Laci was guiding her through those dark days when everyone was searching for answers. I believe she was, and still is. Laci is alive in spirit and this book is still more proof that our souls are on a journey that our bodies can't complete - and no human, no matter how misguided or cruel, can change that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true story of love","review":"This book was amazing. There is not one bad thing that I could say about it. It truly made you realize that while Laci was a victim, she was also a real person. After reading this book you will be able to remember Laci for who she was, not how she was taken away from the world. I would like to thank Sharon for sharing her feelings and her daughter and grandson with us. I am sure that there are many people out there who will turn to this book for comfort...and that is exactly what they will get."},{"rating":"2","title":"The love of a mother...","review":"Well written, straight from the heart. Lacy's mother, does an amazing job despite her hurt and loss. I read the negative reviews and cannot fathom how some people would even consider defending such a person. (person???) The negative reviews only made me want to read this book even more. Thank you to the 1-star critics...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Angel in Heaven","review":"This story was written from the heart as only a mother can. I can't imagine going through what Sharon and her family went through, having daughters myself. You will cry and cheer her for telling Scott off at the trial. She minced no words and told it like it was. God bless her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharon Rocha did a great job","review":"I read this book over 2 days. I just couldn't put it down. Sharon's story was heartfelt and emotional. After reading \\"For Laci\\", I felt like I've known Sharon and Laci for my whole life.I've read the other books written by Amber Frye and Anne Bird, but \\"For Laci\\" was definately more touching and personal.At some parts of the book, I could barely read because I had tears in my eyes. And at other parts of the book, I had to put it down because I got too emotional.This book is a must read for anyone who followed the Scott Peterson case. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Laci & CONNOR","review":"This is another one that will break your heart. Scott Peterson will get what is coming to him one day. Rest in peace, Laci & Conner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow read!","review":"I bought this book because our sorority alumnae chapter chose it as a book club selection. Not one of the ladies was able to get through the book. The book should not list an author, instead list the person who compiled a bunch of other peoples ideas together. Most pages had more in the footnotes section than on the page. It was accurate - from what I read, but extremely dry and devoid of any life. What could have been a historically accurate depiction of the struggles that women went through to start their own collegiate social clubs, was instead a pieced together collection of excerpts from other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Graduate Book","review":"This is a book that I adopted for teaching my graduate class.

I'm a drummer, not a guitarist, so I won't use this for it's full potential, but all I wanted to do was slow the tracks down to figure out what's being played, and this works great! You can even loop sections to play over and over again, making it easy to practice the parts you need to learn. And unlike most MP3 players, the volume goes a little louder so you can hear the music while you play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea but not a good product","review":"I have used the Tascam CD trainers for many years and I bought one of these MP3 trainers when they came out. I liked using the MP3 files instead of messing with CDs. However, the controls on the MPGT1 were kind or crappy and never work as well as the play, stop, rewind, loop, controls on TASCAM's CD players. The menu system is awkward and the big bumpy wheel control is just a crappy control."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like short stories, you will like this book","review":"I have just started reading fiction, so I have a rather limited background on what is \\"good\\" and what is not. Be that as it may, I can only tell you what I like. The story I read \\"The Rocker\\" seemed, at least to me, to be a well written, easy to follow and interesting narrative. It put me in mind of Chekov's short stories, wherein the reader quickly realizes they identify with the people in the story, and they seem to take on a familiarity.I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys short stories that the reader can \\"involve\\" themselves with, if only for the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatness","review":"this is an example of a good comedy from ex snl other than will ferrell who is hella funny chris kattan is the funniest person to come off snl in the past few years. it is a great comedy and it's worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!!","review":"I caught this movie today on HBO, didn't rem what it was about, but I like Kattan, so I watched it.

I laughed, actually, I laughed a lot. But I wondered why I was laughing and sometimes felt bad. There are a lot of missed oppurtunities and way too much slapstick.

It's one of those movies that is almost so bad that it is good. This movie is all about the situations that Corky Romano gets placed into based on his own aspirations and his \\"family's\\" needs.

The FS brand ones didn't stay too curled off the roll, but these ones want to roll right back up and it makes for a pain when you're trying to make the bottom of the bag seal. But don't let that stop you from getting them, especially for the price.

I also bought a box of these Seal-a-meal bag rolls to use with it. These bags were easy to use and were the perfect size for my machine. I've found that you can't be cheap with the amount of bag that you use because the juices in the meat tries to seep out during the vacuum stage and it can compromise the integrity of the seal. I like that you can write on the bags and that the item inside is very easy to see and identify. I've heard you can re-use bags but I'm a bit skeptical. That would all depend on how easy it proves to be to clean them and dry them between uses. As I only use this system for food storage, it pays for itself by helping to eliminate waste. Since the bags are the expensive item in the equation, shopping around for them makes good sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"The title states TWO 11 inch by 18 feet rolls, this is NOT TRUE!

When I tried to use it, it would run and not make a seal. I was stuck with no way to seal a lot of meat so had little to lose by taking the unit apart to see if I could fix it. It turned out that where one hose connects to two barbs (at the accessory port and cancel button) was broken. I was able to patch the leak by bypassing those two functions, and after that it worked well.This was a manufacturing defect, and the material that was broken either had to be dropped or crushed.

Such seems the case. The \\"unprecedented\\" access she has to you materials in regards to Mailer's work and life is a reedy claim, a dead blade of grass the wind blows away, and the author's absolute inability to bring any insight, interpretation or analysis to Mailer's work is infuriating. Now , one may presume, Mailer's career is at a point when the longer view of a 51 years of writing is most what this work demands, and Dearborn gives us summer re-runs.

I look for a movie to stick to the boundaries it was given for ex. if this movie was set on boundaries like the Matrix .. where you can fly, dodge bullets, jump on horses, jump in the air and shoot people.. then it would have made more sense but it was not set on those boundaries making it a stupid , hollywood film that really was just .. terrible. Also you all know that Jake screws around too much and would have been shot.. Mal with his stupid two shotguns fighting 6 people in a bar and winning was absurd..

Where War and Peace becomes boring and confusing after ten pages, Silverado keeps the pace and as far as there is a plot, it is clear from beginning to end.

All this just after an ambush that seems to have the sound and editing crispness of Shane. The cast is the best ensemble I have ever seen. Period. Brian Dennahey, Kevin Kline, and Linda Hunt are standouts. I really enjoyed Kevin Costner's debut as an ADHD young gun, and John Cleese was a pleasent surprise. The clearcut good-versus-evil storyline is well told, well directed and the sets and costuming are authentic. You will enjoy this movie if you ignore the fact that 1) females are purely background characters (with the exception of Linda Hunt,who steals every scene she's in) and 2) this is no 1990's politically-correct, retelling of the western fable.

The book never really explains why an obvious black nationalist is married to a white woman except to \\"get whitey!\\" The narrator admits to raping a white woman and his wife acts like it was justified? Please! The story drags and drags and then goes no where.

I've read and re-read nearly every novel and short story he's written, and even if I had been told prior to reading \\"Galilee\\" that it was a departure from from CB's usuall style, or that it was boring, I still would have read it. I usually complete a Barker novel with similar feelings to that when one returns from an exotic vacation,.... vivid memories of strange sights and customs and regret that you couldn't have stayed longer.

This just took me more work to unearth that place than say Imajica, or Weaveworld, did for me prior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clive's lost it...","review":"I have always been a huge Clive Barker and have bought every single book he's written without bothering to check what it was about: if it's Barker, it's good. All of his books were \\"unputdownable\\": you just had to know what happened next. That is, until \\"Sacrament\\". I didn't even finish it as I couldn't care less about the ridiculous main characters and the even more ludicrous and incoherent storyline. \\"Galilee\\" starts of promising but lacks everything an 6-700 page book needs to be interesting until the end: characters you give a damn about, a story line that has to have a semblance of coherence, interesting dialogues. As with \\"Sacrament\\", I stopped reading it halfway through, basically because I just didn't care how it finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last Barker I'll read; bad, pretentiously bad.","review":"The plot is made up of approximately 10 pages of silly premises related to a tribe of gods who somehow got hooked up with the Kennedys (hence the \\"warring families\\"). The remaining 627 pages are drivel. When you get to the answers to all the earth shattering questions he tries to set up (which come in a few coherent pages about 2 or 3 chapters from the end), you feel cheated . . . \\"I had to wade through 600 pages for that?\\" It would have been a decent 150 pg dime novel, but for the heft of it it should have at least conjured a coherent fantasy; it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful start, but got lost somewhere in the middle","review":"A great fan since \\"Weaveworld\\", Clive Barker has never disappointed me, both in his writing as in his movies. Reading the back sleeve of his latest \\"Galilee\\" I counted to buy his best book so far, but how wrong a person can be. After an intriguing start, a tantalizing idea about the two opposing families and promises about a possible clash of godly forces, I was left with turns in the plot, characters and storyline that almost completely put me off. Too bad that a beginning so impressive can grow so stale, and takes so many pages to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, slow, boring, boring","review":"This one of the fews books I coudn't finish. I've gotten through 2/3th of the book, but that was about as much as I could handle. The beginning wasn't horrible, but then it just went downhill. A weird mix of fantasy, bible, and kama sutra. Half-god jerking off a horse??? The title of my review pretty much says it all - it was very slow, very boring, and pretty tastless (no, I am not a prude, but the book was tasteless nontheless). This was the first Clive Barker's book that I've read, and I probably won't try another one for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"600+ Pages of Nothing","review":"First of all, the scene with the character (who the hell it was doesn't matter), sitting in a room and somehow seeing the \\"mother of the world\\" bleeding from her vagina was more disgusting than erotic. The female lead nameless from my perspective (since it isn't important enough to remember) is a stupid bitch. She needed to just leave. Flee from her family by marriage and Galilee both. Its like choosing between hell at 500 degrees F, or 505 degrees F. Both are untenable. Galilee was some sort of sexually irresistable force. Barker has stated that this a tribute to his Black lover of umpteen years. If I read this and understood this was dedicated to me, I would have bludgeoned Barker with it to within an inch of his life.Sloppy, Mr. Barker. The late Sidney Sheldon could have written this and made it palatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks!","review":"I was somewhat interested in the first few chapters of the book.

I was not convinced of the Geery evil in the least..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this book","review":"I'm a Clive Barker fan. However, I'm not a fan of this latest book.

I wish I could give negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexy, but not very special","review":"To be fair, I don't think anything could live up to IMAJICA, one of the best fantastic novels ever. It's got great sex, but there's no grand passion. It has magical beings, but no real magic. I finished it, but it left me lukewarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for something different - No one does it better.","review":"An excellent effort for an author who continues to defy the limitations of imagination. What a pleasure it is to see an writer take such care with every sentence. Perhaps, it's once again the bizarre paths Barker takes us on, that deprives him of the acclaim he so richly deserves. While most authors churn out another rehashed \\"the devil did it\\" or court drama, Barker weaves another creative gem. I thought it was much stonger than Sacrament and perhaps his best since The Great and Secret Show. I didn't mind the different direction this book took, because it was done well and still ala Barker. I do however long for him to once again reach back into his horror cook book, such as the chilling short story books he earlier released. The only negative to book was the fact that that the story ended with still unfinished business. Hopefully, Galilee will sail again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime","review":"I have been a fan of Clive Barker since the release of Books of Blood in those awful paper backs with the masks on the cover. I actually had a good chuckle over that with Clive at a booksigning for Weaveworld. Sure he has changed, we all have, and some might not appreciate the direction he has grown. But Galilee is a wonderfully written novel that is not slow, boring, or \\"trashy\\" romance. There is alot that happens beneath the surface in this book which I thought was absolutely amazing. Clive has always had the ability to suck me into his worlds regardless of the strange, or lack of strange things, that happen in them. Galilee is a fantastic example of how Barker has grown and changed, yet remained the same. Sure it doesn't have monsters or parallel worlds but it is still weird. There are a lot of things to like about this book and I can't wait to see what he does next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clive Barker, low-key but on top of his game","review":"Clive Barker, the writer, is himself a work in progress. It is therefore without surprise that Galilee comes across as another reshaping of his themes and tricks. Yet, even though Galilee is never as brilliant and pyrotechnic as Imajica or Weaveworld, nor straightforward like Cabal, it may be Barker's best balanced book so far. Chiseled, measured, it will disappoint the horror afficionado and still remain a little too odd to be really mainstream. But it is elegant, cunning, and shows once more that Clive Barker dreams more with other British writers like Tanith Lee than with the hordes of Stephen King followers. Most interesting, by comparison to a genre that loves to create chaos as a story progresses, Clive Barker manages, better than ever, to make order and structure gradually emerge. And, oh well, it is already pretty well cut to make a screenplay. Just in case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost but not Quite","review":"There were places in this book where I was spell bound, particularly the story of Zelim, the civil war journal, the first dome sequence. At other points I felt I had fallen into a slow Jackie Collins novel. It felt somehow that the book had been badly edited, parts left out that needed to be there, other parts embelished that would have best been left simple. There were too many string left loose. This was my first time with the author, and likely I will read future works, particularly any sequels to Galilee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galilee is Strange and Beautiful","review":"This book is at once strange and beautiful. It was hard readng in the beginning, especially if you are a hardcore Clive horror fan. However, once you push past that idea in your head and read on the world in this book changes completely. I had to sit down and read through the middle section instead of working because I got so caught up in this love story between Galilee and Rachel. Its amazing how the \\"narrative\\" inside the story keeps pulsing with this relationship out of the gate, and all that it encompasses. I've never seen a writer turn a page in his own writing style, so eloquently. Read it, but remember, its not horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"I would give this novel a zero if I could. It has no redeemingqualities. The story is a hallucinogenic nightmare of cliches,predictable (boring) characters and the requisite orgy scenes mentioned in passing.Another reviewer correctly summed it up as a cross between X-Files and a soap opera. Add a dash of salacious talk show and you've got the plot.Pure drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clive Barker in Anne Rice Territory","review":"Sad to say, this one is a clinker. Mr. Barker has taken on a subject that would better suit Anne Rice's prose style and her temperament. This simply is a silly book, inflated, badly structured, and, finally, dull. Clive Barker is a far better writer and a more clever deviser of plots than Ms. Rice, but this reads like one of her lesser efforts. It was a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is epic","review":"I have never read anything of his , except The Thief Of Always.

Eddie Maddox was a favorite character of mine , he's the writer of this book, and a Barbarossa . He didn't talk about himself enough , I think .

I expected it to be a \\"classic horror\\" with a monster, stupid women, lots of blood, etc., etc. However, and much to my delight, I was wrong. Barker's books are wonderful and image provoking tales that can leave a reader breathless and wanting for more. When I read \\"The Great and Secret Show\\" I was spellbound by the image of a hole opening up in the space between me and the wall. If you've read the book, you know what I mean. I have also noticed that the hero in a Barker novel is almost always a woman. It is truly a pleasure that a man can see deeper than a woman's good looks to her inner strength. \\"Galilee\\" is yet another work of art depicting strong women, a fabulous tale and characters that you'd love to believe are real. A must read...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to put it down","review":"I don't understand the 5-star reviews of this novel. I've read everything that Mr. Barker has written and continue to buy his novels as soon as they are released, which may have been a mistake this time. After 250 pages, I still feel that the story hasn't gotten anywhere. I've hung in as long as I can. Galilee will go back on the bookshelf until I run out of things to read. I hope Mr. Barker reads his readers comments, and if so, I offer this...your imagination is far too vivid and your talent far too large to have wasted the time of both yourself and your readers with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbara lives on","review":"I read Imajica (both volumes) last year, and I must say I was gobsmacked by the sheer brilliance of Barker's narrative and imagination. So I started reading Barker's Galilee with relish, expecting an intriguing and fascinating tale of mysterious gods and goddesses, etc. But, woh! After some 200 hundred pages, it felt like I was fourteen again, reading my daily Mills & Boon paperback! I mean, the Rachel character was just soooo predictable and how on earth did Galilee decide she must be the one and only after sooo many (women...and men...and children...)? Nope, your standard Barbara Cartland yarn here: from rags to riches lass finds out her handsome John John Kennedy look-alike husband has somehow turned into a monster, but fortunately is bedded by the super-endowed Galilee who whisks her off (eventually...) to his \\"kingdom\\". Boring....and Barker must definitely have a sequel in mind....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love/hate...","review":"This one is simple. You love it or hate it. It is an involving book of charecters with tragic flaws. You can not go into this book expecting typical Clive Barker. It is a fantasy romance, not a fantasy horror. It is not scary. If you like Barker give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"(SIGH), I must say being a colossal Barker fan I was more than a bit let down. The book moved slowly, while gradually gaining momentum. I was left with the feeling of unfullfilled promises. The characters had the potential to be, well enthralling but were mostly just annoying and never really delivering. I wasn't too particularly fond of the first person angle either, it just doesn't seem to suit him. There's no denying his ablilty to etch the landscape of his words on one's mind but 'G' was simply a poor display of story-telling. I shudder to voice the words but: GALILEE WAS AN UTTERLY PAINFUL DISAPPOINTMENT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dallas meets the Munsters","review":"The Geary family are a bore. I think Barker's been watching too many soap operas because this book is a snooze. Does he really expect us to care about these characters? They're rich, good looking snobs.

This is weak stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped...<yawn!>","review":"Unfortunately, this was my first Clive Barker novel and it was less than I had hoped it would be.

I suppose not being a romance fan didn't help either..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor attempt at romance without the fantasy I expected.","review":"If you want romance, you'll have to wade through three quarters of this disappointment for one erotic moment.

Hey Clive, stick to the Weaveworld theme!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clive's best...","review":"While this book was interesting and engaging, it was too long for its story.

I admit that the plot does not reach a satisfying conclusion but the romance does. We should not forget that the book is sub headed a ROMANCE and that is the part of the novel that reaches a satisfying climax.

BARKER is a genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was letdown....","review":"I am a long time fan of Clive Barker, and have eagerly read all of his work. As a dark fiction author, he is brilliant. He is always a powerful writer, but \\"Galilee\\" just left me flat. I'm not against a writer changing \\"genres\\", but the storyline, though it does deal in part with some type of immortal clan, just seemed like an overlong soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"The never ending story","review":"This is my first Clive Barker book, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought the book started out great, with interesting characters and a mystery about the relationship between the families. It really bogged down in the middle, and seemed to drag on and on. But I stuck with it to find get to the good finish that I thought was there. Well, it never arrived. The last two thirds of the book never lived up to the build up. The mysteries of the past were briefly commented on but never really explained. I guess this means a sequel, but I won't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of his genre.","review":"Clive Barker writes excellent thrillers, but with \\"Galilee\\" he is out of his element. I optimistically plowed through 400 pages before giving up, but the book was just too slow-moving, lackluster, and ultimately insignificant. I have no curiosity at all about what happens in the last 236 pages - that says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic","review":"I share the dissapointment of us all who disliked this book. Let me say only this: I never give up on a book I started so I finished it and than immediately took it to a local secondhand bookstore and sold it for 1 EURO. I only got this much because the guy liked the cover art. That's all to say...Barker is really a great artist!

A well-woven plotline was sacrificed for frequent forays into the labored \\"isn't sexuality diverse?\\" area. The idea that women, as a rule, fall in love with men who are well-endowed, sexual maestros is one-dimensional and ridiculous. If this is supposed to be poking fun at the predeliction of women to fantasize about the heroes of \\"bodice-rippers,\\" the joke goes on too long to be truly amusing. Actually, the whole book seemed like one long joke at the expense of the reader: characters without depth or true complexity, a plot which meandered into nowhere, and a cynical use of cliche plot devices to fill in the threadbare parts. The ending was a bleeding wound with a Band-Aid stuck on, presumably so that a sequel may be written, the Band-Aid ripped off and the two parts grafted together. I won't be around to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not classic Barker, but close enough...","review":"Now this is an odd fish. While Clive breaks away from his usual horror and fantasy world, he also merges them into this sweeping tale that his half soap-opera and half Biblical epic, as two powerful families verge together for a showdown that, alas, will not take place until Book Two. But still, this book pulled me in and kept me there, as I lived with the characters, breathed with the characters, as I do with most of Barker's works. And while this is a comedown from his brilliant \\"Scarament,\\" it is still a gripping, entralling journey of wonderment. Before going, I will recount a small story about when I brought this book. A friend of mine read the cover blurb of \\"Epic, Erotic, Fantastic,\\" and laughed. A passerby stopped and commented, \\"Clive Barker, right?\\" When she affirmed this, the stranger nodded and said, \\"They're right.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Too Much of a Good Thing = Overkill","review":"A promising start reminding me of the classic gothic novel, the story line begins to unravel in psychotic episodes supposedly experienced by the character/author. I could just imagine Barker saying to himself \\"Gee, can't figure out where this is going so let's be truthful and let the author say he's loosing his ability to tell this story.\\" This leaves the reader feeling manipulated and foolish to continue reading hoping that something would at some point \\"come together.\\" Being a true fan, I stuck it out but was disappointed in the queasy kissy face ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for everyone......THANK GOD","review":"Exquisite..the mixed reviews of this novel are a comment on the cultural wasteland we live in. Yes the novel is long...and yes its vast and there are many characters and subplots and it isnt all neat and tidy on the final page. It isnt functional..meaning it isnt presented to be a formulaic entertaining \\"thriller\\" where all the characters have a distinct purpose which is obvious and predictable...Barkers characters are exotic irrational, beautiful, and always chaotic. It may boil down to good vs. evil, but in the same way that Francis Bacon is just a portrait painter. Barker like Bacon is an ARTIST, and its often abtract and not initially easy to digest. It may make you uncomfortable or alienate you, but its always sublime."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor attempt to move from his field","review":"Clive Barker has amazed us with WeaveWorld and Everville. His charcters are rich and involving. Every book so far has been an occasion to take the week-end off and spend 48 hours in suspense and awe. What happened here? Seems that Mr. Barker has gone the way of Stephen King. Once a great master, King has lost his touch of affecting our psyche and making us look over our shoulders at night. Barker had that same affect until Galilee. Great horror novelist should avoid the romance novel and stay with there art, scaring the hell out of the reader. I hope that Barkers recent trend with Sacrament and Galilee is not the end of another great horror writer and the beginning of another Stephen King \\"Insomnia,\\" or \\"Rose Matter.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Swedish fan #1","review":"Ther's a certain pattern when I look around among the reviews.

We know you can do better Mr Barker (sorry girls)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romeo & Juliette for the Hellraiser Generation","review":"Clive Barker's saga of two families that have been feuding for generations is conventional by his standards. In that I agree with fellow reviwer's; yet this so familiar theme is given the Barker dark twist as The Barborossa family hides not only secrets, but powers as well. This novel is billed as a romance and is at that, however Barker's gift for language, description and the human condition lifts this book above most in the category. I found the story compelling and again differ from many Barker fans in not being disappointed with this offering. It was a slight departure from his usual style, granted but I think it shows him growing as a writer and more importantly author to not depend so much on gore and graphic description to keep his readers enthralled. The ending was open enough that I am eagerly anticipating a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - especially for a Barker book.","review":"The master of horror and oddly fantastic worlds has underdone himself with Galilee. It is a fasinating story of two warring families that leads the reader into thinking that there is going to be a catastrophic battle, all in the name of love. The story drags on and on with promisses of war, death and destruction but to which none ever happens. The book is filled with all sorts of information, past and present, and takes the reader through the ages of time but does little in what we expect to happen. I was hooked for the first half of the book but then I just wanted to finish it. Read it if you are a Barker fan but be forewarned that it is NOT what you are used to. It could have been condensed and made shorter and I think the author ran out of material to work with in the end. I would compare this novel to Rose Madder by Stephen King but Rose Madder is a better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Globe Master Sun Glasses","review":"Great quality unfortunately it just didn't fit.

Made in the USA, real glass lenses, American Optics has a military contract so these are the real deal. Classic, timeless style.They are a bit heavy, but you get used to that. Also, it would be of benefit to have them professional adjusted at your local optician. Most of them will do this for you for free. This will result in a better fit for you as not everyone's face is the same.The nearest competitor is Randolph Engineering sunglasses. Those are also very good but they cost like three times as much so I'm not sure that they are any better for the money.I do wish these had a earloop rather than bayonet straight design as the bayonet doesn't seem to fit as well for me. But this is a minor complaint given the price paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Gun","review":"These glasses are indeed of good quality. They fit perfectly and look impressive. It is rather difficult to find American-made sunglasses these days, especially those which are affordable. They are a fine choice and indeed worthy of the U.S. Military.

I decided to fork over a little more money for these, and I just care for them. They are flat across the eyes which leave the sides wide open causing glare from behind. The grey lenses are decent for bright days, especially up in the flight levels. As soon as you get under partly cloudy sky, everything is too dark, especially the cockpit. They don't seem to offer any haze penetration either. In the first week I got big scratch on them.

I was concerned that they aren't polarized but so far it hasn't been an issue. I have a smaller face and have trouble finding a good fit. The American Optical's in the 52mm are perfect for me.

Every track is well crafted, almost scuplted. With masters of music such as Jerry Marotta, Larry Fast, Jesse Gress and The California Guiter Trio the artistry soars.I couild not find a track that I did not like, which is a rarety on most music cd's. Buy it...you will not forgive yourself if you do not.This is pure Tony Levin at his best, done his way ... from his heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most tracks seem unfinished","review":"Tony Levin is clearly a talented bass guitarist with the soul of a true progressive rock artist. This album, while conveying this talent and soul, unfortunately falls short in terms of giving the listener a full fledged, finished product with most of the tunes. It's like a handful of rough studio mixes and jam session recordings were suddenly deemed good enough to release. Every track shows promise but many could use editing and tweaking of some sort. This CD goes in my car for background driving music as a rhythmically interesting album, but it's not for living room, bedroom, or party listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALL IN LINE","review":"I wish I could agree with the other reviewers here, but after listening to this I have to wonder what's really going with \\"Pieces of the Sun\\". Is this CD just an exercise in the selling power of the Levin brand? After hearing it, I simply can't think of anything else. Not that we can reasonably expect sustained innovation and perpetual invention from every musician and every composer, but Mr. Levin's prior and many remarkable accomplishments make this CD pretty hard to swallow.Here's the (generic) experience: Whenever this CD is playing I find that (1) somewhere, about ten minutes in, I will forget what I had put on and that (2) when I take the CD out of the player and remember what it's supposed to be, I tend to let out a little groan that seems to bother the dog. \\"Pieces of the Sun\\" teaches me once again that, unfortunately, a great name does not guarantee great music. Check out Upper Extremities instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything He Touches is Good!","review":"This record is growing on me everyday. There is nothing radically different about this prog rock record, but it is solid, well written and performed and sufficiently powerful. Best tune is \\"The Fifth Man\\". The writing is very good. The players on the record are all top-notch. This is prog rock that is niether dark nor bright. Extremely well executed! It as something on it for everybody that respects Tony Levin's work\` or prog rock in general, Very little vocals. Great spin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoking Progressive Rock at its finest!","review":"Hold on to your headphones, it's going to be a driving progressive rock instrumental joyride.Legendary bass presario and prog rock veteran Tony Levin and company will ignite all your senses from head to toe. With the roaring and searing guitar of Jesse Gress, Jerry Marotta's rythmic and driving drums, Larry Fast's mesmerizing synthesizers and Levin anchoring it all with his bass wizardry this is a fine progressive rock recording.From the explosive opening track \\"Apollo\\" to the melodic third track \\"Aquafin\\" this disc takes you on a very enjoyable ride. They even throw a cover version of a very unrecognizable oldie but goodie \\"Tequila\\". There are many great tracks on this cd!So all you progressive rock fans out there that are looking for a new and adventurous sounding cd, you found it.

What I got was a DVD with no menus in English and absoulutely HORRENDOUS sub-titles. It's like they chose to translate every 10th Japanese sentence and even then, only into English sentence fragments. Despite this, I liked the film enough to order it from Amazon.com.The new copy (from Amazon) has menus in English, an English soundtrack and subtitles so good you can follow the story and even follow nuances of the story.The lesson I learned is that not all DVD distributions are created equal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mix of action and story.","review":"The Princess Blade succeeds where so many kung fu films fail: it doesn't sacrifice the story or acting for the fight scenes. The swordplay in The Princess Blade is pretty incredible. The cinematography allows you to see the fights in detail but still allows the aesthetics of the choreography to be seen. The story, while simple, is easily to follow and allows you understand and care for the characters right off the bat. I've seen many reviewers complain that the middle of the film was slow. In other words, there is a story between the fighting.If you want a good story and excellent fight scenes, The Princess Blade should be next on your \\"to watch\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film that's a perfect companion to Azumi!","review":"Princess Blade was a great film about a female assassin trying to forge a better life for herself. I loved the film for it's setting and look into a futuristic vision of a Japan going back to it's samarai like roots. What really struck me about this movie was that it was like a companion piece to another film that I truly love. That other film is Azumi about another female assassin who has an important decision to make. Azumi has to deal with a lot of the same problems that Yuki has to confront. Both lose their mothers and have father figures that prove false to them. I saw Princess Blade first and throughly enjoyed it, but I would also like to recommend getting Azumi. You'll find that it has a lot in common with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a weak 4 stars,but still 4 stars","review":"This movie has some cool samurai stuff in it via new age samurai.It has some cool moves but at times is slow and there is no tempo to the movie.The acting is decent and the dvd is ok I would recommend it! Dont expect the greatest going into it and you might be suprisling happy over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blunt \\"Blade\\"","review":"I'm a sucker for Asian cinema but \\"The Princess Blade\\" doesn't cut it. Set in a corrupt, futuristic Japan, young Yuki leaves her assasin gang to discover her royal roots as a princess.Don't let gravity defying martial arts (simillar that of \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\\") and the sword slashing gore-factor (simillar to that of \\"Kill Bill vol.1\\") fool you. The bullet-dodging scene in the beginning is worth a peak but I suggest hitting the stop button after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let anyone tell you this is a good movie...","review":"good reviews of this movie are another example of the kindheartedness of movie goers... after reading the hype surrounding this movie, i did a foolish thing... i bought it sight unseen. another harsh lesson learned. onto the movie: a transparent plot coupled with terrible acting and dialogue, one would think that at least the fight scenes would redeem this film. guess again. crappy SFX, silly posing and posturing stop any hope of the validity of this as a movie worth watching, let alone owning. the introduction of out-of-place random characters, no explanation of even the secondary characters roles and no evident trace of final resolution all add up to this being one movie to avoid even on penny night at the local vid-mart. in the words of the great urban poet Chucky D: don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my money.","review":"This movie was absolutely horrible.The action is cheesy and not even remotely well choreogeraphed. There are a few decent moments mixed in with a whole lot of junk.The plot takes up the middle third of the movie, and it's a total joke... I could forgive the crap plot - if it were just an outline supporting the violence. But when you consider that the action isn't worth a dollar to watch, the plot suddenly comes more into focus.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie sucks","review":"Movie Boring...Story Drags...barely any action...if story drags should have atleast good story to keep interest but it had nothing...booo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed movie with Yumiko Shaku!","review":"Princess Blade is an exciting movie that has fast paced sword fighting scenes and good acting. Yumiko Shaku is convincing in her role. \\"Sushi Prince! Goes to New York\\" is her most recent movie role.Her character (Yuki) shows that she is not invincible. during her sword fight with the wise sage Kuka, the audience is able to see that she is in conflict against a powerful enemy.This is a five star movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Asian films I have seen lately","review":"Some excellent cinemotography along with some excellent action sequences make for an interesting movie. The only thing is that the pacing is not great. There is a huge amount of action in the first half and then the Princess stumbles upon a soulmate and she finds some measure of happiness and it drags a bit. I think some her relationship with the truck driver/terrorist could have been developed before she goes to meet Kuka, so that that fightwould come after some relationship development. As it is, the movie is action, action, slow, action, slow, slow, slow, action. Better pacing would have made it even better. Still, the action is good and character development is decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A typical bad B movie of the Ninja genre","review":"The acting is not worth mentioning. The fighting scenes are heavily edited but they still can't hide the inferior fighting skills of the actors. The plot has been recycled thousand of times by other action films.In short it's not worth watching. Tony Jaa's movies are much better in terms of fighting techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good beats the bad parts","review":"I enjoyed this film for the most part. The action sequences of sword slashing and the escape moves were really good. I didn't like the drums in the beginning and end, kind of corny. Like others, I thought the subtitles and english dubbing sukked! However, since it was a japanese movie, perhaps it'd be better hearing it as the actors/actresses themselves in japanese. Then, the english subtitles worked fine. Better hearing people talk in sync rather than a mouthed language one can understand. Anyway, Yuki was really cute. Btw, nowadays buying movies with special features can help alleviate the bad parts in a movie. That said, I wouldn't have bought this movie w/o it's special features (a 2-disc [special edition])"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH BLAH BLAH","review":"I was all geeked to watch this but was disapponted...I don't feel lke they picked the right person to direct this movie.

I don't know...and then there was a mini plot with a brother and sister that SEEMED OUT OF PLACE!! sigh...Azumi was a much better martial arts sword movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was a major let down","review":"Acouple years ago there was a Asian Film Festival in Philadelphia. One of the films playing at that festival was Princess Blade. However I missed the screening and was very upset. When I was finally able to purchase the DVD release of the film I was very excited. However after viewing the film I was very disapointed. The main problem I had was that the heroine is not a believeable asassin, during the action it seems like she can barely hold onto the sword. The film is not very well acted and this does take away from character development. There are a few fights in the film that were somewhat entertaining. That is why I gave the film 2 stars, overall I did not enjoy the movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"if i could have given 0 stars","review":"what an idiotic book. first of all, get a magnifying glass to read the tiny print on this pint size booklet.

Not to mention that Mr. and Mrs. Kramer both make about $30,000/year in this film from 1979. What a bummer reminder!Otherwise, it is a well acted, high quality scripted film. Hoffman should have won an Oscar, as well. Although this topic seemed more relevant in the '70's, one can still appreciate the agony all characters went through. Great, great acting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb melodrama!","review":"Those late seventies were so turbulent and depressive that the same show business looked insight the soul and spirit of the most of people. Somehow this decade constituted to the American Cinema what the late Fifties to the French people. We don't talk a true New Wave literally speaking but a reencounter with the roots of the human being. Watch for the winner titles in those ages: Melvin and Howard, Julia, Annie Hall, People like one, The verdict, Deer Hunter and obviously this one .It was necessary to adapt to the screen this simple story because the family as institution was experiencing an evident disintegration process, that was one of the multiple consequences of an existential, emotional and ethic disarrange.The film shows us many common places about the custody of a son product of an unhappy separation and all the efforts of a father in search of his son's love.Brilliant performances and notable direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oscars...","review":"Kramer vs Kramer is a decent movie. Not a master piece or a brilliant movie. It is... okUnfortunately, Kramer vs Kramer will always represent one of the most unbelievable things the Academy did. To give this movie five Oscars and to simply dismiss Apocalipse Now, sounds today as an heresy or a bad joke.Maybe the people in the Academy had too much to drink that year. That is one possible explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star NOT for the movie","review":"Is there any chance the movie studio will get a clue and reduce their list price?!

They show a woman completely nude! The description says that it is a movie about family values, but it is the furthest from family values. It portrays a woman leaving her son and husband behind because she \\"isn't happy\\", and proceeds to show the husband sleeping around. Definitely not a family movie by any standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful twaddle","review":"This won a load of Oscars. Why? This is as bad as \\"Ordainary People\\".

First, it gave Meryl Streep her first Oscar (as a \\"Supporting\\" Actress, so don't expect to see a lot of her). Second, it's an interesting look at what socially was probably ground-breaking gender-bending in 1979: the question of whether the best \\"mom\\" for a child caught in divorce could be the dad. And third, the young son caught between his parents is simply adorable!What I like about this film is its realism. Neither parent is portrayed as the bad person, and the emotional development of each character is believable. The acting is superb, and the film is well written, directed, produced, and cast.On the negative side, it is an emotionally heavy film, as, like in reality, the child is in such innocent pain. Also, by today's film standards, even though it lasts only 105 minutes, it is a little slow at times.Adult themes, sexual situations, language."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good film","review":"i'll never forget this film cuz that was the year my folks split up.and i read the book as well.but the film touched on alot of difficult subject matters.Dustin Hoffman&Meryl Streep give great performances.it holds up after all of these years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Oscars for this peace of fluff?","review":"The voters must have been on drugs or paid off to vote this run of the mill movie 5 Oscars.

We see here the seeds of the downfall of the boomer generation as well as the usual double standards in play.Let's get this right -- Streep's character mothers her son for 5 years but somehow that is not as wonderful as Hoffman's 18 month investment? Somehow his shorter time \\"counts for more.\\" Streep leaves for 18 months but somehow that is \\"more\\" than Hoffman's abandonment of his family emotionally for 6 years? This is the same thinking behind now calling actresses \\"actors\\" because that \\"means more.\\"Please - I don't know how Meryl played that part with a straight face. And of course HER best friend of 6 years supports him not her! It's interesting that whenever women take a step forward - the men always have to compensate.

Once you get used to the language, this is a quick read that is very enjoyable and I find myself going back to over an over. Shakespeare was a genius playwright!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Shakespeare works","review":"This version of Hamlet was a great read. Shakespeare's works can be difficult to understand, but this text was an easier read. The notes that were placed on the pages facing the text were very helpful, especially if I had difficulty understanding some of the language. I also thought the background on Shakespeare's life and the introduction to his language was also helpful in reading Hamlet.This text left me with many thoughts regarding certain aspects of the play. For example, the big question, was Hamlet insane?I do not think Hamlet was insane, in fact, I feel that his anger toward Claudius and his mother were justified.I highly recommend this William Shakespeare book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used book","review":"As promised this used book was in very good condition and arrived with no problems.

Just some high schooler's to-do lists and even a page covered in purple stars and hearts.

I grow weary of the multitude of Country music fans who rant and rave about the latest steel guitar rendition of some once timeless Rock & Roll piece, just because the top of their charts have become dominated by the wife of Mutt Lang.

Way to go!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"cheapie\\" is right!","review":"I waited months for this DVD to come out, thinking that maybe Disney would begin to realize the demand for more villain entertainment. I was really disappointed. There were a few really old cartoons that I had not seen since I was a kid but other than that, it was really cheesy with no real story or anything inventive. They basically slapped together some old toons and put a new label on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for small children","review":"I bought this for my 3-year-old granddaughter, and it frightened her. Not appropriate for small children. I threw it out. This is the first Disney story I have seen that I felt was inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped it would be from the box description","review":"Well, the review title pretty much sums up my feelings on this DVD. While a couple of the cartoons were pretty funny, the packaging makes this seem like it'll be a movie about the villains taking over the House of Mouse, and as other reviews have mentioned, such is only an afterthought and a cool song. It's not just the packaging either--the overall marketing and the trailers shown on other Disney DVDs make the same claims as the info on the box. Let the buyer beware!Having said that, if you're familiar with the \\"House of Mouse\\" TV series, this should come as no surprise. It's basically an extended episode of the series--in that series, there are several cartoons with a loose plot hanging them together, exactly what you get in this DVD. Still, it would've been a bit more honest of Disney to market it as what it is rather than upping the anty. Rent before you buy, that's my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect too many villians!","review":"Apart from a few brief moments you won't see any of the classic villians. I am glad I got the VHS frist to check out the what I am going to see before I buy the DVD.I can tell you I feel so cheated that I am sure there won't be any Mickey's Mouse House of Villians DVD on my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"When I got this, I expected to see one big story with interesting plot twists. Instead, it's just a bunch of Disney shorts mixed together. It doesn't focus on the whole \\"House of Villains\\" thing at all, in fact, for half of the film I'm wondering \\"when the heck is this thing even going to really start?\\". It ends with one of the dumbest battles ever. Basically, Mickey takes a lamp and [draws] Jafar into it, and all of the other villains scream and run. Hello? I'm pretty sure that all of them combined are much more dangerous than Mickey, even without Jafar. It barely even focuses on the villains at all, giving them maybe 5% of the entire screen time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mickey's House of Villians","review":"Villain's? Beware! It's a good thing for the adult crowd that Disney has guaranteed your satisfaction or your money back. I'm very disappointed in the program. I expected to see more villainous action instead of the sleepy new and old restored footage put together in this remarkably boring DVD and Video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Better Than You'd Expect","review":"I know, straight-to-video.... But don't judge to quickly. I really enjoyed it (and more importantly so did my 4 year old). The bad guys didn't \\"win\\" long enough to be upsetting & there were tons of great disney shorts throughout. I was very hesitant to buy it, but am SO glad we did :) One note, this seems to be a Halloween movie (all the shorts deal with Halloween). Additionally, if you had problems playing the Rolie Polie Olie DVD, you may have problems with this one as well -- but you can play the movie fine if you go to the chapter selection part & just start with scene 1/opening credits (you don't miss anything & the close-captioning still works). Hope this helps -- I highly recommend this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should be","review":"Read this review before purchasing this product. When I saw the trailer for it I was very excited. The trailer had all the villains but they were shots from the original movies. I personily love the villains, lets face it there the best! I thought if it was as good as the original movies I would love it, but sad to say it does not compare to any classic disney movie. Most of the time it was just old and new cartoons that were pretty boring. My favorite villain Maleficent had only one, I repeat ONE line in the whole movie! You may like this film, or you may not. I would advise that you rent it before atcually buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISASPPOINTMENT","review":"As a fan of the great Disney villains, I eagerly looked toward this release, thinking I could see my favorites in one film. Well, WRONG! This is nothing but a series of Mickey/Donald/Goofy shorts strung together with a Halloween motif. You see the Disney villains on the front and back of the DVD cover, inside on the insert, but hardly in the movie! I don't know why the Disney folks allowed this sham to take place. If they wanted to release these Mickey, et al shorts, do it without the idea of the Disney villains. There is one scene where the villains sing a Broadway-like number, but it is too brief to be enjoyable. Maleficent, Cinderella's stepmother, etc are all relegated to just scenes where they sit in a cocktail-like sitting watching these mini-cartoons of Mickey and his friends. Knowing the likes of Maleficent, etc, they wouldn't stand for such goings-on! This is like watching Disney Animation 101 with the guise of Advanced Disney Masterpiece. AVOID!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and reusable","review":"We have really taken to the Seal-a-Meal system, which we use to package all our food purchases that are going into the freezer.

After this little dissapointment i went ahead and tried to install it on my computer. My DVD drive didn't even recognize the disk. This particaular version of the game as far as i can tell really sucks and if i were you i would avoid it with every part of your being. The other titles on the other hand are great.

Granted, I can only leave her in it for about 10-20 minutes before she wants to be held, but at least it is a little break. Sometimes she is even lulled to sleep. My baby really loves the little white bears on the mobile. The music is fine, but sometimes I just let her listen to the swoosh-swoosh of the rocking - it is not loud and it seems to calm her. The whole Windsor collection is very attractive and will suit a boy or girl baby fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Motor!!!!!!","review":"I bought this swing for my daughter when she was a month old. I loved the look of the swing, plus it gave great head support, and it didn't hurt that my friend had the same one and loved it. Well about a month after I purchased it my friend's motor blew on her swing. Luckily babies r us gave her a new one. I figured she just got a bad swing until this morning the motor on my swing blew as well. Only after 3 months of using it... and it's not like my daughter over used it... I put her in it only every other day for no more than 20 mintutes so it's definately not from wearing it out!!!! For the money I paid for this swing I expected to use it for a second child!!!! So 2 of these swings motor blew that can't be a concidence!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"carsonsmama","review":"I was not a big fan of this swing.

I will definitly be buying a cradle swing for the next baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This swing definitely met our needs","review":"Our daughter didn't like the swing for her first few months, but by two months she seemed to enjoy it more. The mobile didn't really turn very much as it should have according to the directions, but she never looked at it anyway. All in all, it worked well for us, and the print pattern was great for a girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I didn't give this 5 stars because when my daughter was a newborn she HAD to take her naps in her swing. Her head would always fall over & I had to put blankets between her & the swing to support her head. But she's still in it & almost 9 months & loves it. I really like like when I have to change the batteries, I don't have to hunt for a screw dirver, just grab a quarter from your pocket, pop it in the whole & bomb, your done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mobile Issue","review":"I love the swing. Both of my twins fit well in it from 2 weeks old. And the pattern looks nice in the living room.

I have my 3rd daughter and needed a new swing since my last child was a baby 7 years ago. I do like the open top, and I like the colors I have ( a green plaid). But I do not care for the size. My daughter is 4 mo. now and she is a big girl. She does not really fit comfortably in the seat that seems not quite wide enough for her. I am not very impressed with the buttons you have to push a dozen times, and we have a decent sized house but the swing just seems to \\"big\\" at the base. Maybe this is normal for full sized swings but I don;t really like the amount of space the entire swing takes up. This is just my opinion. Hope this helps someone. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing!","review":"My daughter loved this swing, and she began using it just after she came home from the hospital. The seat was well cushioned, and the music was very soothing. All things considered, it was relatively easy to put together. Unfortunately, we lost this swing to Hurricane Katrina, but I plan on buying our baby girl another one as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD motor","review":"This swing never worked consistently. At first thought it was draining batteries but realized it's a motor issue. Now the motor is shot (of course it's past the warranty period). Seems a common theme based on other reviews. We didn't use it very often either.Bought the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Swing used for our second child (didn't want to spend another $100 on a swing) and have not had any problems. Have used it twice as much as we used the Graco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Swing instead","review":"We orginally had the swingomatic and returned it within two weeks of having it. The motor is ten times as loud as any other swing, it requires a push start every time, and sometimes that doesn't even work, and the customer service at Graco is HORRENDOUS.Save yourself time and headache and buy the Fisher Price one for 10 bucks more. You'll thank yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, versatile, and very easy to use.","review":"Extremely solid construction, will handle any SLR camera with telephoto lenses.

The characters are very humorous (some cuss a lot, this is not for kids) and being able to mix songs in the studio is a definite plus. It has every aspect of the rock music business, from choosing band members, recording and mixing songs, album cover design, public relations, marketing, booking concerts, band interaction, touring, scandals and rehab. My only complaint with this game is that the eight different scenarios are a little too easy. I really hope someone creates another game like this involving the rap or country music business. I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Easy to Play Sim!","review":"This game is easy to learn, fun to play, and doesn't require half of your life as does another popular game you may have heard of or played (Sims anyone?).

It is a very reasonably priced title, so it is well worth the ($$$) to pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Laugh for very little","review":"This game can be had for fairly cheap, and I highly recommend getting it. as a rock manager you get a variety of different missions(get the rich producers ugly daughter a recording contract, help an 80s band make a successful comeback without breaking up) that involves a cast of funny cliche band members(including the Oasis inspired Golander brother). Also you mix the songs they record often with very funny results.In the end this game gives you enough options so that it is replayable, and entertaining enough to be worth the low amount it will cost.-cjw"},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is MISLEADING!","review":"Ugh.

Every song kept me amazed at how talented he and his his choir is. The bomb song on this album has got to be \\"He Reigns\\", it was full of energy and power, and the choreography was all that. And then after that they displayed their classical talent with \\"Great is Our God\\", this is so uplifting, it diplayed the choir's true singing power.

Beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'll preface this by saying I think What Another Man Spills is a brilliant record and Nixon a very good one, so I bought Is a Woman with the hope that it'd be of the same quality. But the slow, softer side of Lambchop that Nixon emphasized has taken over completely on Is a Woman. The songs no longer depend on the melody--you have to concentrate to even discern a tune in the slo-mo tinkling of piano and whispering bass. Instead the focus is entirely on Kurt Wagner's lyrics and voice, neither of which are the strong suit of the band. It's as though he's trying to invent twisted piano bar lounge singer standards, but with often banal lyrics (increasingly irritating when the weight of the song rests on them) and Wagner's muttered delivery it's just not very interesting. And there are no sweeping, gorgeous choruses (like on Nixon's \\"You Masculine You\\" and \\"Up With People\\") that raise the level of the songs this time out, the songs here just drift on aimlessly until they end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A-Musing","review":"How Lambchop became pegged as an \\"alt-country\\" band is a grand indie joke, a collective brainwash by unenlightened critics. On their sixth release, Is a Woman, Kurt Wagner's unclassifiable crew of rotating musicians is an absurdist lounge act in Vegas. These 11 tracks rarely rise above a whisper. This quietude - initially compelling - defeats them. Each song begins with a calm authority drawing us in, yet without much in the way of modulation, nearly every one drags midway, until we lose what little narrative or thematic thread is there. The tunes evaporate before they're over. Through it all, Wagner muses: a backporch philosopher on a muggy, long afternoon. How very southern of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullest of the Dull","review":"...Words can't describe how unimpressive the songs are.

The dialog was quick, witty, and real. The actor who played Phil was great. He was able to hold his own with Gena Rowlands and that says a lot!!!

A general claims that he could be hiding in one of the buildings but if that were true wouldn't they just have to look for the building with a big dinosaur shaped hole in it?Another example is when Mathew Broderick determines Godzilla is pregnant by giving it a home pregnancy test.

Their embarassment with the subject matter shines through in every cheese-soaked moment of this film!!Displaying total ignorance of Japanese kaiju, the filmmakers instead give us a mutated iguana that can't even face up to the military. D&E's perfect antidote to the \\"cheesy man in a rubber suit\\"... cheesy, just-a-guy-at-a-computer-terminal spfx!!This film is pure trash that has no redeeming qualities whatsoever!! Keep your brainless dreck. Give us some plot, character, and intelligence. The original Godzilla was born out of wartime dread and the fear of nuclear annialiation. This creature was born from the pursuit of the almighty dollar. He is a fake that deserves to be flushed down the cinematic toilet forever!! To D&E, go pick on someone else. Leave the King alone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla lays an egg, in more ways than one.","review":"Godzilla is WHAT?!?! Godzilla is a giant fish-eating(?), egg-laying(!), tunneling(?), no-breath(!) creature, of varying intellect and size, that stomps around New York for two days, leaving the Keystone Kops, er, U.S. Army, to do most of the damage to the city, with minimal civilian casualties. How do we explain this? Simple.This was actually a different movie, with the soundtrack redubbed to replace 'Atomic Iguana' with 'Godzilla'. They should have kept the first name. I'm glad my folks bought the DVD instead of me, and I'm still trying to get a refund from the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me see.....CRAP","review":"Crap, crap, crap.

This was a real clunker. I wish Matthew Broderick would have quit acting after \\"War Games\\". What a dry, boring performance. And that girl. I can act better cutting my toenails than she did in this movie. I did like the new Godzilla better than the rubber suited lizards of the past, thought they too have their charm. Why did Godzilla have to die in the end? I would have liked for him to have stepped on Matthew Broderick and his ditzy girlfriend and finished the movie giving a huge roar of triumph as he destroyed NYC. No big loss in my opinion. And the story...STORY? What story. The best scenes were of Godzilla running around the city dodging the military's finest. All, in all, I would like to edit out all the humans and just have Godzilla destroying things for two hours. He was the best actor in the film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's called a script...learn to write it","review":"Okay, the G-man is cool, the characters are colorful, and even though it is set in the disaster capital of the world (New York), the movie has too much freakin' rain in it!!!

The sound effects are excellent!! With my sub-woofer turn to 75% it felt like Godzilla was walking down my street. If you do not have a sub-woofer this is a good argument to go out and get one. On the other hand the movie is a little long but the special effects will keep you hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been great","review":"Godzilla (1998) is a movie that really frustrated me in that it doesn't have any depth to it at all; it plays out like some video game with special effects with a weak and elementary script. There's no darkness to this movie, nor is there much seriousness, doom or suspense. The overall mood of the film is very light, which makes it a laughable experience overall. I thought that the story of Godzilla was supposed to be darker; it lacks the elements of a similar franchise, King Kong. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. The second star is for special effects. Sorry I have to be so honest :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at ALL COSTS!","review":"No stars for this piece of.... well, you know. In this version, Godzilla has no fire breath, runs AWAY from tanks, and is female. Despite what the director says, laying eggs = female (he claimed it didn't mean Godzilla had gotten a sex change; yeah, dude, next time you ovulate, let me know). Bad acting, bad dialogue, scenes directly ripped off from \\"Jurassic Park\\". An insult to Godzilla and his fans.Everyone who's seen a REAL Godzilla film is pretty much familiar with the genre. Why these clowns felt they needed to \\"reinvent\\" the character is beyond me. As the saying goes, \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\".Godzilla reduced to a big iguana.

Atleast they could convince a guy to burn up in a hot suit while giving one [heck] of a show.

They should have put some humor and character into Godzilla in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rape of a legend","review":"I could handle the bad acting and the thin plot. What would you expect from a Godzilla movie? What really is horrible is the way that id4's creators and Toho's executives allowed some guy named Tatopoulos turn the big guy into a spiked iguana with a chin that makes it look like Jay Leno. As a fan of all that is Godzillian (I am fourteen and saw my first Godzilla flick when I was two), I have come to expect some things from a godzilla movie that this movie spat on. Examples: Godzilla does breath fire. Godzilla is not vulnerable to humanity's weapons. Godzilla was created by American nuclear testing (what's the deal with all those French guys?). The tribute to Tomoyuki Tanaka at the end of the credits is a laugh. He's probably rolling over in his grave thanks to this mutilation of his creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toho Studios should sue for character assassination","review":"When you find yourself (like me) looking at your watch repeatedly during a supposedly exciting film, you know the film stinks. I can't honestly say I had high hopes for this film, being a fan of the originals, but I was willing to give it a chance. Sadly, it didn't deserve it. Jean Reno was the only person who came out of this misguided project with any credibility. Poor Matthew Broderick looked completely lost, especially in the first half-hour or so he was on screen. And frankly, for a project whose main appeal seemed to be how fantastic the special effects would be compared to the Japanese films, the effects are surprisingly cheesy at times (check out the helicopter chase scene - can we spell FAKE-LOOKING COMPUTER-GENERATED TAT?)

Yes, I'll admit, I bought the hype and rushed out to see it the day it opened. Why can't these people use the gazillion dollars they use on special effects and come up with a script and a plot? Sure, it made a ton of money but did you ever meet someone who said they liked it? The one true highlight of the film is watching French actor Jean Reno do a dead-on Elvis impersonation.

That being said, this is NOT Godzilla. Godzilla looks like Godzilla. The filmakers could have made a CGI version that still looked the real thing. You can't just create a totally new monster and name it Godzilla and expect people to accept it. Well, on the other hand, I guess you can, but the real fans will not accept it. Also, Godzilla is a male. And he breathes atomic breath. And he attacks Tokyo, not NYC. This film is Godzilla in name only. What the filmakers did is the equivalent to making a James Bond film, casting Angelina Jolie in the title role (Jamie Bond), and changing her from British to an American.Oops. I've said to much.

As a kid I'd spend my Saturdays at the neighborhood theatre enjoying grade B horror films from Roger Corman, Hammer and, of course, the latest Toho Godzilla movie. When I heard Godzilla was being remade into a multi million dollar film I couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately I got my wish. After seeing this new version of Godzilla I had the same sinking feeling I had after seeing Godfather III. All the money the producers threw at this picture can't save it. A confusing script, an overdose of cheezy computer generated effects, sloppy editing, mis cast actors, weak music and alot of money waisted. What is sad is the fact that the money was there to make it right. It all starts with a decent script. Give me King Kong vs Godzilla any day over this mess. Hopefully, someday, Hollywood will remember how to make films, not video games.

The U.S. military whose weapons can knock out a jet fighter travelling at mach 2, can't hit this giant sized clunker standing still. As far as Godzilla, where are the glowing dorsal fins, the radioactive fire breath? See the first Godzilla movie (1954) with the late Raymond Burr and you'll see a great movie (O.K. rubber monster suits aside) about a mankind coming to grips with an ancient terror who is impervious to modern weapons.

To pad out the 936 hour running time, Devlin and Emmerich throw out every crass one-liner known to man and then some. Mankind threatened by annhilation? Of course we have time for a tepid romance subplot and goofy jokes that children would scoff at. Why not just send the Three Stooges out after the creature?

After all, an actor can only carry a movie so far if the script and plot fall flat on their face.But I have to admit that I sort of liked this movie, SORT OF. No, I'm not claiming that it's great or a must-see. But for those of you who appreciate good special effects and cheap thrills it might be worth at least a rental.

The only thing that stopped him was an unknown chemical compound that was so dangerous that its inventer destroyed his research papers and sacrifised his life for peace. GINO(the fake Godzilla aka Godzilla In Name Only) was stoppable with man's modern artillery, the only real abilities he has besides being a giant mutant Iguana walking on two legs is being able to blow out \\"Atomic\\" wind from his mouth(instead of fire), and being able to reproduce asexually(why am I calling it a he?) GINO didn't symbolize what Godzilla symbolized either. If GINO symbolizes anything, he symbolizes what he is, a giant iguana.

OK, it doesn't have the dark tragedy of the original, but it really is pretty fun and there is a lot more humor.In addition to the theme of science run amok - yes, Godzilla is a mutant due to French nuclear testing in the Pacific - there is a hilarious theme of silly bosses and their smarter underlings, who of course are the ones who solve the problem by sheer guts and practicality. With the New York characters, that makes this more original than most monsters-in-the-city films. The acting is indeed very good and the special effects are spectacular.It won't rock your world and it isn't faithful to the original, but this is just a monster flick, and it is definitely better than average. If you take it for what it is, you can enjoy it.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared to the other 22 movies, this one's awful!","review":"I get more of a smile when I watch the Big G's death scene in Godzilla Vs.

Naturally the army is called in, but despite their advanced weaponry, \\"Godzilla\\" manages to make a mockery of their attempts to bring him down.But where the army fails, a motley assortment characters, a scientist, a French secret agent, and a couple of journalists succeed.Added to this is a lame love interest element and the occasional bit of slap-stick humour, and you have a suitable film for killing a couple hours on a cold winter's night."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!!!","review":"Well, I admit I was interested in this movie when it came out.

In fact it is a good updating of \\"The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms\\". In this movie the beast is a (CGI) quadra-ped once again terrorizing New York (Not Tokyo). Eating policemen and finally meeting his /her end in/on a New York Landmark.The movie is not all that \\"bad\\" although it is played a little \\"too cute and tongue and cheek\\" for the Scifi genre.

Him aside, it's all drivel. Okay, Godzilla himself is great, but like Star Wars and many other films, Godzilla is a style-over-content movie. The plot is feeble. The characters are one-dimensional. The music is weak. The script is awful. The dialogue is rotten. Almost everything about it makes you want to feed Roland Emmerich to his own creation.

Two or three missles kill him. In the original Toho Godzilla movies, Godzilla dosen't even budge when a missle hits him.

They did not show Godzilla too early into the movie because they were building up the suspense, instead showing hints of his size and the damage he could inflict (The first boat attack, claw marks, foot prints, the 3 tug boats, big waves, loud groans).They showed how he became Godzilla, great characters, action, the humor was a little dry, nice ending hinting to a sequel that probably never will be (with these producers anyway). Overall I really liked it, I thought it flowed well and it kept my attention. I think everyone was expecting something more, bigger or maybe more violence - who knows, but if you want more, I suggest renting the older more boring Godzilla movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"T' was commercialism that killed the beast !","review":"This is not Godziila, perhaps a giant lizard attacking NYC, but those are two different things.I love the campiness, bad dubbing, and low tech effects of the early (real) Godzilla flicks but most of all I love the SPIRIT that those films were made with.This high-tech 1998 mis-named Godzilla movie is just a long string of computer effects, corporate sponsors and overall emptiness.

Not only is this brain dead, it's an incoherent, Jurassic Park rip-off, and it utterly destroys the original Godzilla legend/theme.

Godzilla is a pretty good movie. Anyone wanting to take this movie seriously shouldn't be watching in the first place.

This movie can go a long way for middle-aged people who want to take their children to a movie that they can enjoy themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb special effects... but no writers to be found.","review":"The movie Godzilla will blow you away with the special effects. On DVD with a good sound system, you'll be mesmerized. Godzilla running through New York City being chased by helicopters and tanks is just amazming. Unfortunately, they were not able to dip into the $100 million dollar budget and find a couple of good writers. The writing for the old Godzilla movies made more sense and they were in Japanese subtitles. (The Siskel and Ebert jab probably killed their chances of making this movie into a potential classic.)

The problem? The title of this movie is GODZILLA. We all know this was Emmerich and Devlin's attempt to give us an American Godzilla movie, but they fell way short of that goal. If you want to see our big Ape-Whale in true form, go get Gojira, Godzilla 1985, vs. Biollante, or any of the 90's Godzilla movies. Even Godzilla Final Wars is top-notch Kaiju fare.

Plus there are no other monsters; it's just Godzy against helicopters and jets. We loved GZ VS Megurious, and GMK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Round-eye Godzilla BAD!","review":"This is not Godzilla. This is a Jurassic Park T-Rex on steroids. If you want to see Godzilla, see the Japanese films. This film is basically a remake of the 1956 movie Godzilla, King of the Monsters and although the original is in black & white, it is far superior to this movie. If you like special effects, this may be the movie for you as \\"Godzilla\\" does look impressive, but unlike the real Godzilla, the CGI monster lacks character and soul. Sorry folks, but the Japanese have got us beat as far as making Godzilla movies and well they should since Godzilla is a Japanese original and 99% of the time the original is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla 1998","review":"I saw the original Godzilla at the movie theater when I was in 8th grade. It was Awesome!! I loved scary movies; therefore, the monster Godzilla was frightening. Raymond Burr as a reporter is great because he advances the plot as relays his emotions to his newspaper!! Now, as far as the 1998 remake...THUMBS DOWN!! There were more special effects and so forth, but this Godzilla is ridiculous. It's like taking Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and redoing it. BOO!!!HISS!!!

It should have been left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"POS got to me so fast, and i couldn't wait to pop it in and watch it!

That said, I really liked this rendition, too. I just can't agree with all the sticks in the mud that feel Godzilla is only good if it's a guy in a suit stepping on models. I would still buy any of those in Blu-Ray as well, though.I docked it a star for a few issues I had with this movie. My main issue was the way they basically stole the ending death scene from the King Kong movie with Jeff Bridges. Not that I thought either ending was special, just too familiar. Another is how Godzilla breathes fire only when he roars and kicks up some vehicles which collide and explode in mid-air. It just seemed way too contrived.As far as effects go, Godzilla has held up quite well for a 12 year old movie.To say this was an intro to Godzilla and liked it but decided to not like it after seeing the old ones. That's just schizo."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A REAL GODZILLA MOVIE","review":"This is NOT the Godzilla we know and love, this is a feeble Hollywood fabrication.

I have to guess that the people who made this movie had never seen a Godzilla movie. As a Godzilla movie, this rates -10, because Godzilla is simply not in it.As a generic monster movie, it's really not very interesting, and not particularly well done, aside from the special effects.

I guess I'm different in that I never went into it with the intention or idea of comparing it to the original Godzilla. I knew it was a reinterpretation and I thought it was awesome. My 16 yr old son and I watched it recently on one of the cable movie channels and he was even more entertained by it than I, if that's possible. If you look at this film that way instead of trying to compare it to the original you will see an exciting, action packed film that really is awe inspiring and terrifying. Yes, it does have its campy, funny moments... they just have nothing to do with the monster. I honestly don't understand why people didn't enjoy this film. My own sister, who's just as big a Godzilla fan as I, didn't enjoy it. \\"He's not the original Godzilla!!\\" No, he's not. He's bigger, faster, meaner... better.

This could not even begin to compare with the worst of the old Godzilla series when they were in rubber suits jumping on popsicle stick trees and buildings. Apparently Jean Reno [from the professional and Ronin] must have been a die hard Godzilla fan as well becuase that is the only reason i can think of why he put his great acting abilities in such an ultimate B-movie. The old story of how Godzilla was born from A-bomb tests is much more convincing than this. The story was very very weak and lame. The special effects were alright but they made godzilla look like a big fleshy cartoon. He looked totally unrealistic, with that enormous chin he looked like the batman on the animated series. Give me a few million dollars and i could make a better movie with my old Godzilla collectible figures, some legos and an 8mm camcorder. An absolute must not see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this when I was little, still love it now","review":"I saw the Godzilla renake when I was 9 and I loved it, I was looking around the sale DVD at Media Play the other day and I found this for $5.

Added a long trailer for Sony's other Godzilla releases which is awful and in some places deceptively shows scenes from the wrong movies (EX. The teaser for GODZILLA VS. KING GHIDORAH shows the Godzilla Ghodorah battle from GMK: Giant Monsters All Out Attack and the one for GODZILLA FINAL WARS suspiciously shows a lot clips of there own American version of Godzilla while omitting clips of the real one.) andalso added three episodes of the animated series. bUt they are three of the same episodes available on the Animated series discs.

All those millions of people who warned me can't all be right. This is what I get for being hardheaded! I actually found myself rooting for poor Godzilla. Think about it, all she wanted to do was find a place to lay an egg and raise and nuture her child. Is this any reason to persucute this creature? With all the so called geniuses in the science lab, could they not have found a way to tame Godzilla, rather than attack her and annilate this presumably docile giant lizard? This movie is a sad commentary on humanity. It portrays us as over-zealous human beings reacting to a situation with extreme violence rather than thinking it out and dealing with this encounter in an intelligent way. This was a very cruel movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable - Make sure you view in Dolby Digital","review":"I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit. 2 key things is to (1) forget about the original Godzilla which this is not and understandably has upset Godzilla fans - think of this as something entirely separate (2) view this movie in Dolby Digital Surround Sound. Its Amazing and significantly enhances the film. When seen in this light the movie is a lot of fun, with good acting killer special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal characters, banal monster, kill them all","review":"Another big budget turkey from Roland Emmerich, who proves again that it always pays to underestimate the intelligence of your audience. Godzilla is ugly, the characters are boring, the romance is, well, uninspired, and frankly you hope the stupid monster destroys all of New York and then chokes to death.

The trailers were awesome, I thought this would be all the fun of the cheesy Japenese movies and all of the glittering special effects of Hollywood rolled into 1 fun package. Unfortunately, the writing wasn't so much a script as it was a collection of one-liners and cliches stolen from other movies, the \\"love\\" scenes and others were so strained it was clear even the actors weren't into it, and the effects seemed like someone had lifted all the footage from Jurassic park and ran it through a bumpy skin filter.If you are a godzilla fan like me, I recommend catching the trailer and passing on the actual movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla is a 500 foot turkey","review":"The level of dialogue never rises above \\"It's coming this way!\\" or \\"Let's get outta here!\\".

It felt more like a really long preview than an actual movie. Some of the effects were very well executed but like \\"Independence Day\\" I just didn't get excited by the havoc. I guess my biggest complaint is the utterly shameless ripoff of the end of \\"King Kong\\" with poor Godzilla's final heartbeats pounding loudly for all to hear. Geez, couldn't they have ripped off stuff from a GOOD movie? ;) P.S. I know I shouldn't be looking for technical accuracy in a movie about a giant lizard rampaging through New York but... a Sidewinder missile blowing the top ten stories off of the Chrysler building?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Rooting for the Monster!","review":"The Godzilla effect is eons better than the one of the cheesy Japanese films but that is about all that this entire flick has going for it! The characters portrayed by Broderick and others are so uninteresting that I was hoping that they would meet an early demise. Which is to say, the unbearably bad movie would have been over much sooner than it was.Like another reviewer, I DID like the Puff Daddy/Jimmy Page tune heard over the end credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh....","review":"While this is a moderately good monster movie, this is a horrible Godzilla movie. It's virtually identical to \\"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\\". And another thing that bugs me about this movie is the total lack of research. In the film, the AH-64 Apache helicopter is shown as a one-man chopper with guns on either side of the cockpit. The real AH-64 is a two-man chopper with one machine gun mounted UNDER the cockpit. Also, the creature's claws are all wrong. Lizard claws are flat on the bottom, whereas the creature's are rounded, like birds. And whoever came up with that \\"within a year, these 200 babies could become 40,000\\" line should watch the movie again. The first one wasn't able to lay eggs until it was at least thiry years old. Thirty years seems like planty of time to hunt down and destroy those hatchlings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Shame......","review":"Godzilla could of been a really good movie. That is, if it didn't have such a stupid and pointless plot, bad acting, awful direction, was more scary and actually had a purpose. It was a poorly-done, deeply flawed, pointless disappointment that I don't recommend.I rate Godzilla 5 out of 10. The special effects were sort of effective, and it is a total shame the whole movie wasn't as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flop","review":"Sad to say, \\"Godzilla\\" pretty much falls flat on its face. The characters are mostly stupid and many of the lines in the movie are chessy. Some of the special effects doesn't quit make up for that and I really expected this to be a great sci-fi movie of '98. I can't believe the guys that made that awesome \\"Independence Day\\" made this. Oh well, maybe \\"Godzilla 2000\\" will be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real Godzilla","review":"This movie isn't terrible, but it bears little resemblance to the Japanese version of Godzilla that became so popular all over the world. This version is part Jurassic Park, King Kong, Anaconda, and other similar movies. The producers of this film must have lost their focus somewhere along the way. Also, the 1998 \\"Godzilla\\" was incredibly overhyped, especially by gullible fans on the Internet who thought it would be a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size does matter... but the argument doesn't","review":"This film doesn't even reach the cheesy entertainment retro B popcorn genre, you'll enjoy this one only if you are mind-retarded, ID4 was a hit one is a punch out.

Where can you go wrong? Godzilla vs. Mothra- Very well done, spiffy effects, and GOOD DUBBING. Godzilla vs. Monster Zero- It's not the best, but very hard to find otherwise. It's pretty OK for some laughs. Godzilla's Revenge- Oh, this one's bad. The little kids will love it, though. Parents- Avoid at all costs. Terror of Mechagodzilla- Very good, kinda cheesy. But Mechagodzilla is cool, so not a bad deal.Overall, a good, worth your money deal. I like most of these movies, so go ahead. Buy them. Enjoy them with the kiddies."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the stupid movies ever! Very disappointed!","review":"This movie copies ideas from Jurassic Park (Little Godzilla chases human) and Aliens (a lot of eggs). Disappointed!The most stupid idea is that Godzilla is dead finally??? This is total unacceptable for a classical Godzilla fan, If you grew up with the real Godzilla.The director and porducer toatlly forgot what successful idea they made in \\"Independence Day\\" (Alien can not be beaten by any human weapon, So is Godzilla), They makes people both in USA and Japan very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Film Is A Huge Disapointment","review":"This film was terrrible! Let's start with Godzilla himself or should I say herself. This unworthy Godzilla looked like a giant iguana who is a big chicken. When is the last time you saw Godzilla run from anything? This one ran from the army people like a punk. I never once saw \\"it\\" breath fire. The so called acting was terrible. The whole movie was focused around that worm doctor and his roody pooh girlfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but it has nothing to do with classic Godzilla","review":"Godzilla is supposed to be a big scary moster that gets mad and rises out of the sea and breathes blue stuff everywhere and blows up everything that gets in its way, not a mother thats just trying to protect its babies. Its still a cool movie though. Good plot, great special effects, and most importantly, massive destruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hank Azaria was the best part of this piece of [junk]!!!!","review":"I sat through this movie, watching a giant monster stomp through New York, yet Godzilla never appeared.To me, Godzilla will always be a guy in a rubber suit stomping a styrofoam copy (a poorly constructed one) of Tokyo. That's the ONLY way to enjoy Godzilla."},{"rating":"1","title":"grrrrrr.","review":"Alright, this film sucks. No other way to say it. No plot, no good acting, and it as the worst 2D special effects.

GRRRR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little of Interest for Godzilla or Movie Fans","review":"Just plain bad idea. The film makers obviously thought they were updating a classic but unfortunately captured none of the original spirit.

Still better than the Phantom Menace.","review":"I hated this movie like anyone else. Yet after seeing the new Star Wars movie I can say that even a plot does not help a bad movie. It is what it is, a bad film. Godzilla was boring and stupid but I felt like I wasted more money on the Phantom Menace."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"He doesn't look, sound or even behave like Godzilla! So you have to ask, what's the point? If they renamed this \\"Jurassic Park 3: Attack of the Giant Computer Generated Lizard\\", I suppose you could write this off as mindless effects yuks. There are much better ways to spend a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good even for nonmonster lovers.","review":"This movie was better than I thought it would be. I was expecting something more along the lines of the old Godzilla movies and was pleasantly surprised. The monster was really neat looking and the special effects were great. The plot was predictable but entertaining. I would recommend this movie for anyone who would like to see a good remake of an old classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"a heartless, brainless and souless film","review":"other than some fine effects work, this is the definition of bad filmaking. Bad script, bad acting, bad directing. (get the idea that this film is bad!)an empty souless film that wastes the talents of its FX crew.

From the point where each charicter was introduced I waited patiently for them to die but no, they all live to shock and horrify once again if theres a sequal. I would have rather seen some guy in a rubber suit with paint chipping off the eye then this hemaphrodite iguana that is the size of a 4 story building in one scene then in the next he is stepping on a four story building.There are no redeming qualities to this movie the actors are as bad as the characters they play, Godzilla just shows up and the people (seeing a new species) decide to kill it. The moral \\"if its different it must die.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"MOTHRA! MOTHRA! WE NEED YOU! GODZILLA IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL","review":"Plot stinks. Give anything to American movie producers and watch them just destroy a good thing. Godzilla is supposed to be our hero, but in this movie he is the bad guy, with no evil monster to fight with. Furthermore, the acting, directing and special effects are pretty weak. Godzilla definitely resembles the Tyrannasourous Rex (how do you spell the T word?) from \\"Jurassic Park\\" also toward the end of the movie where they are at Madison Square Garden, it looks like a rip off from \\"Alien\\" with eggs (pods) scene. An absolute utter waste and dissappointment....I can't believe they are going to make \\"Godzilla 2\\".....if they do they need to call \\"Mothra!\\" for help!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Bad","review":"I was prepared for a bad movie, and this one dissapointed me.

What a waste of time and money.Hollywood thinks that all you have to do to update a movie is to add computer effects.

It should have been called Jurrasic Park IIIor whatever it would have been at the time. I have always loved Godzilla, and I mean the real Godzilla.

It was awsome.They are probably just jealous because it is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay betterthan that ( ) Armageddon.

This is, without a doubt, the best American film ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total rip off!! A SHAM","review":"This is an absurd production. Calling this creature Godzilla. Is like having Michael Myers appear without the Captain Kirk Mask. Or having Jason wear a catchers mask or Freddy wear a boxing glove. Its like having Batman with no utility belt, Spiderman with no web shooters or Superman in a purple tutu. Its like cuttung the space ships out of Star wars and replacing them with computer generated ones. Its like casting Samuel L. Jackson as James Bond. ITS A SHAM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical summer action movie, but with Godzilla","review":"\\"Godzilla\\" is basically your average summer action film, like \\"Armagedon\\", \\"Independence Day\\", and \\"Jurassic Park.\\" It plays like a tribute to monster movies of the 1950's. It's combines the awe of \\"Jurassic Park\\" with the intensity of \\"Aliens.\\" However opinions of this movie are often mixed, typical viewers will like it, but fussier viewers may have trouble accepting it's simple plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emmerich should have done community service for making this","review":"He flat-out admitted he didn't like the original Japanese Godzilla, so why did he even bother making this? Why didn't Hollywood give the project to someone who was actually a fan of the series? Why did Toho give the OK to Emmerich in the first place? Oh yeah...money.This movie could have been passable on a superficial level if it was maybe 30 minutes shorter and didn't turn into a Jurassic Park rip-off half-way through. The effects are good and the action sequences are exciting enough, but it takes a while to get going, and most of the human characters are incredibly obnoxious. Do yourself a favor and stick with the decent Japanese Godzilla films like Gojira, Mothra vs. Godzilla, Godzilla vs. Biollante, or Godzilla vs. Destroyer (the latter two have yet to see decent DVD releases in the US)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and Bland","review":"Godzilla is just one more sad product of a film industry more interested in lining its pockets than creating quality entertainment. The film is unimaginative, predictable, and entirely forgettable. The fact that the name of a beloved classic was besmirched in the process only adds insult to injury.Stay away from this mess and check out Jurassic Park, or even Cloverfield, instead. If you see Mathew Broderick give him a nice kick in the groin for signing on to this vapid and derogatory piece of trash. You can try to do the same to Jean Reno, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap.","review":"I often enjoy big, brainless action-fests (I even liked Double Team). I'm a fan of many (but not all) of the old Godzilla movies. However, neither of the mitigating factors above could keep me from detesting this \\"film\\". It just sucked. The filmmakers apparently saw The Lost World about thirty times, and copied all of it in a New York setting (along with rip-offs from King Kong and other classics). Tell me, just how does a 400 foot lizard stay hidden in the middle of a city? And did you notice that, every time Godzilla MIGHT have been wounded by something, everyone thought he was dead and started cheering? (And the monster is constantly referred to as \\"he\\", but with anything that big it shouldn't be hard to tell what gender it is.) By the way, even the special effects were bad. It was always obvious that Godzilla never existed anywhere except inside a computer. And the movie was an hour too long. And it didn't even look like Godzilla. And... sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing Counts! It takes more than killer FX to make a movie","review":"I feel bad for the wonderful Digital FX crew at Centropolis who put in the hours and the talent only to be let down by Director Roland Emerich and whoever wrote this totally flawed script. This was NOT written by a real screenwriter as every stupid mistake possible was made. Worst is the outright disrespect for the viewer's intelligence. For example in one scene an old man drops a fishing line off a dock into the east river and suddenly he hooks Godzilla who is at least a mile out to sea. Also this massive Creature simply disappears in midtown manhattan -- give me a break. This movie was annoying beyond belief. The DVD is worth getting only for the visual FX supervisor's comentary as the movie progresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DVD to avoid","review":"This DVD has good sound but has a huge shortage of plot. If you like the original Godzilla don't go near this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stinks","review":"Whatever you do, don't buy this movie. Broderick is terrible and there is no plot, just some big monster trashing New York. The special effects are mediocre, and anything else isn't worth mentioning.

But as far as visual effects and sound quality goes, there are plenty of movies out there with much better visual effects, and sound, that also have a decent story, and decent acting.

There was hardly anything surprising in this film, the special effects were horribly done.

They erased godzilla's(the real godzilla)little respect he had in the states. the new design for \\"godzilla\\" looked too dinosaue like, raptor to be exact. plus, a majority of the destruction in the film was caused by the helicopters trying to destroy godzilla(and everytime i am forced to endure this films horribleness, i wish they do). also, in the original, godzilla was a metaphor for the atom bomb dropped in hiroshima, and had value, character construction and a good message, this film has none of the qualities of that film or the series that followed. i urge you not to waste your money on this film, instead go by a real godzilla movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what happens when people try to use special effects to compensate for actual quality","review":"The reason this is rated two stars is because one is the minimum, and I thought I should at least give it something for the effort.

There are only three reasons to buy this, which are as follows:1) If you found it as part of a G Movie box and buying the box is cheaper than buying the other G Movies individually.2) If you're extremely bored and want a movie that's over two hours because you believe that watching it has to at least be better than doing nothing3) If you want a perfect example of how 21st millenium movie directors (mostly in America, but occasionally in countries like England and Korea) prioritise special effects, the least important part of any movie, above anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Squandered Opportunity","review":"You turned Godzilla into a pregnant iguana.You had her running--RUNNING--from the military.You cast Ferris Bueller as a scientist with some long Greek name.You then ripped off JURASSIC PARK by having a climax in Madison Square Garden with hundreds of mini-Godzillas, which might have been really cool--if we hadn't seen the Raptors in JURASSIC PARK I, II, and III.How could Hollywood screw up a Godzilla movie?It's not like it was very high bar to jump to begin with, but all the money and special effects and resources of American cinema can't buy imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jurassic park 4 ,not godzilla","review":"Not godzilla at all.Godzilla was very big and didn't hide in sewers.He knocked buildings down,didnt run around them.He was smart,not just a big iguana.This was more like an escapee from jurassic park.I liked Jean Reno ,hated Mathew broderick .I really disliked this film first time i saw it but later revisited it (this yr) and didnt find it quite so objectionable but still shouldn't have been called godzilla."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its all about the lizzard","review":"I can remember as a kid,always loving Godzilla.I loved watching the old 1950&1960's Japanese films.This one however,is a far cry from any of the classics,and sets itself up in history as one of the \\"Big Block Buster Boobs\\" of the summer.Kids will love the movie for the moster,because it does look impressive on screen,and the special effrects are fantastic.The story is ok,but infentile at best.It was very predictacble,but I think the story itself was engineered that way.All in all,I would'nt pay a red cent to own it,it really is'nt worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla or Jurassic Park?","review":"People who rate this as 5 star i mean what in movie you thought was cool.I thoguth it was interesting until they showed godzillaI was like Tyranosarus Rex with Spikes what the hell happen to Godzilla.Then from then on the movie sucked.People rate this as 5 stating that its better then a moth showing up and better then those cheesy flicks???

Any more than trying to do a remake of A CHRISTMAS CAROL and leaving out Tiny Tim and the Ghosts. MAYBE a potential sequel could be saved IF we find out the newly-hatched baby has mutated yet more and turns out being more like the Japanese version. Oh, and hire the guy who orchestrated the Japanese version's soundtrack, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of my life","review":"This movie that I refere to as G.I.N.O is terrible. The directors were trying to make a Godzilla movie and they failed. That thing was not Godzilla. The only similarity was that they called it Godzilla. The monster could run up to 200 mph but only used its speed to run away from helicopters! The real Godzilla wouldn't have done that. Plus, its head was real differant and its spikes were all weird looking. Also, I could easily tell that Gino was a CGI creature. In other words, poor CGI. The main story was really dumb. Gino lays a nest and all the babies hatch. It should have been more like battle another monster in order to be a Godzilla movieSPOILER: In the end the stupid iguana died because six missiles hit him! Then the heart beating scene was a terrible rip-off from King Kong.Overall this movie BOMBED! The DVD was okay, the special features were just not very good accept for the Featurett. If you're looking for a Godzilla movie then this is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD of a modern Godzilla","review":"Godzilla is the best movie in the series. Our hemisphere has really turned it into a great feature. This is the closest to a great gargantuan movie anybody can get to. The film explains that they thought Godzilla was a dinosaur, but that theory is quickly tossed out as the protagonist explains the effect of radiation. This movie is a classic with great CGI. Anybody who doesn't like this, and suggests the Japanese versions, is merely afraid of progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla in name ONLY ...","review":"This is Godzilla in name only. The giant lizard is here, but his spirit is completely gone. The filmmakers are cashing in on the name.Matthew Broderick is totally miscast.

AND NOW THEY'RE MAKING A SEQUEL?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good movie with good actors.","review":"It was a good movie and I liked all the actors. My favorite is Hank Azaria and he plays \\"Animal.\\" All it's about is a giant lizard comes to nest (lay eggs) in New York. And the good guys have to stop it. My best friends brother fell in love with it and he said you can ask anybody and they'll say it was a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, I don't know what to say","review":"I mean it. I really don't know what to say. This movie had so much potential to be the best Godzilla movie ever made, but Devlin and Emmerich screwed around with it and made it into one of the worst G movies. The special effects are incredible, but that's it. Matt Broderick just doesn't look fascinated enough by the monster to make his reaction believable. And this is some of the worst acting and lamest one-liners I've ever seen in an action movie. And they used the classic Godzilla's roar!!! It just doesn't sound right coming out of a giant iguana. And the blowing up of Madison Square Garden looks like it was done last minute. But, just the fact that this movie had so much potential, but the that's all it was. Potential. The end effect is a bad movie with good special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla was okay in this movie!","review":"this was not what I expected. I mean my mom and I love the Japanese movies with Godzilla fighting different monsters. But in this one he just running around desroying everything in Manhattan,New York. The movie would have been better if Godzilla was fighting a monster. I added this movie one star because I like the effects on Godzilla and there are only three scenes on this movie I like. The one when Godzilla was just entering the city. Near the end when Godzilla's eggs were hatching and the babies were roaming the building chasing the four main characters.Godzilla got trapped on the Brooklyn bridge and he got shot four times(I think). This movie had only a couple of good scenes but overall it wasn't that good throughout the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla 1998 (US)","review":"First of all, let me just say... this new \\"godzilla\\" doesn't cut it. I mean, he is nothing but a big giant wussy thing. He gets caught up in a suspension bridge, gets hit with about 6 to 10 missiles (I don't have an exact count) and THAT kills him? COME ON! What's up with that? He's nothing compared to the old godzilla.I grew up watching old godzilla movies where the people were dubbed in, and those really entertained me. That godzilla is cool because he is unstoppable! Out of all the hundreds and hundreds of missiles and rockets and bullets and bombs that have hit him, none have really killed him!The reason that I gave the movie 2 stars is because it has a really cool nuclear test in the beginning.In conclusion, I don't believe that this thing deserves to be called \\"godzilla\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Disaster, but it Comes VERY Close.","review":"\\"Godzilla\\" is just like the creature after which it's named: big, loud, and without direction. The plot only serves as an excuse for the movie, and the special effects are PlayStation silly. Matthew Broderick looks blank and does little to spice things up, and the dialogue is choppy. Oh, the soundtrack has a single from P. Diddy, who annoys me to no end. I can't say \\"Godzilla\\" is a complete disaster, but for an effects-heavy summer popcorn flick, you can do way better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"This had some of the elements for a great movie: Godzilla and a big budget. But the bad elements, bad acting and no plot, ruined the film.What we got was a boring, stupid, overblown mess. I assume the makers of this dreck got bored too since that had to throw in that terrible \\"love story\\" subplot and the \\"baby Godzillas\\". Even feeding Matthew Broderick to Godzilla at the film's start would not have saved this awful, awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"SILLY anyway.","review":"I don't care if this huge reptile is Godzilla or not. I admit some ideas - like missile dodging agility - were not bad. But the plot is incredibly unconvincing and could not keep suspense. For example, an army loads tons of fish to lure the lizard from subway tunnel. The lizard appears as they have planned and nobody reacts! No attack, no panic, just watching the iguana groaning. Maybe good laughing stuff for cynical audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but it ain't Godzilla.","review":"Yeah, okay, this is a good, thrilling movie with cool special effects and a scary monster, but it is not Godzilla! At least, it's not to me. It doesn't even look like Godzilla, it looks like a giant iguana! If you want real Godzilla action, check out the old Japanese movies. They may be corny, but they're way better than this. Even \\"Godzilla 1985\\" is better. As a movie, it's not too bad, but as a Godzilla movie, it's nothing. It probably wouldn't hurt to skip this, or at least go in not expecting greatness.

We were hyped into thinking it'd be a psychotic pyros-laden joyride, and it turned out to be a rain-soaked hunt for a pregnant iguana who's never shown totally in one shot! The acting isn't a huge improvement over the Japanese dubs, the plot is the same as all the radioactive monster on the loose films, and the monster itself is never seen clearly because of all the rain (clever trick since the monster looks so dumb, with its gangly arms and Leno-size chin.) The monster itself is a wimp compared to the old Godzilla, who would have eaten NYC for breakfast and shrugged off the volley of missiles that ended up doing the iguanasaurus in. The FX were pretty good, although you could tell they were CG. Not as good as the Japanese outings."},{"rating":"2","title":"GIVES END AWAY-movie was alright","review":"this movie was pretty good, descent amount of action and all, but i don't get the motto, SIZE DOES MATTER. well if that's true, what size are they talking about? because the humans killed godzilla, (even though one of his babies survives, that's not the point.)

These sheets are ridiculously expensive - especially considering how low the thread count feels on them. I appreciate that they have velcro in all the right spots and are designed with the cosleeper specifically in mind. But considering that this is an item that you'll need more than one of due to the occasional night-time diaper leak or spit-up, it pains me to pay full price for them. The washing label requests that these sheets be air-dryed (possibly b/c of all the velcro?). I've accidentally put mine in the dryer a few times with out shrinkage.

I also love the micro screw driver and the ability to change out bits for allen keys and square drive. It is the best multi-tool I've ever owned. My only problem is that when you squeeze it together there is a pinch point and I've gotten two blood blisters from it in the 9 months I've been using it. I also wish it had a spring return for the jaws. I have a wingman that has this feature and I love it. The wingman is a very great multi-tool as well. Much lighter than the wave, but far fewer tools. They are both great. This is a heavy tool so if you are looking for something lighter the wingman is a great option, but if you want it all this is the one for you. I definitely noticed the weight on my belt so I ended up going to a BDU style belt to hold this and my mini mag light.

That being said, it was still a good book and usually, but not always, I could not guess how the mystery occurred. Violet Strange is a young woman from the upper class who works as a detective in mysterious events when the police are having trouble figuring out how the event happened. She has one boss who wonders why she continues to work in this uncommon job for a woman when she comes from a wealthy family. She is successful in all of her endeavors and at the end of the book you find out why it is so important that she earn her own money instead of accepting money from her father for certain things. It's a good book but I prefer some of her other works like the Forsaken Inn or the House in the Mist. I would recommend this book to teenagers or to people who enjoy Anna Katharine Green's work but would like to read something a little different from her usual pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good 'gateway read' for more Green","review":"I came across detective Violet Strange in a free collection of mystery stories, and liked her enough to also read this entire collection. They are interesting and well written; of course, the sensibilities of the period really must be accepted and understood, as they often hold together the plot devices. I enjoyed them enough to read other books by the same author and am currently absolutely thoroughy enjoying an Amelia Butterworth mystery. I'm really glad I found this author! Green's writing is amusing, her characters can easily become old favorites and her mysteries are well woven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for understanding","review":"So many stories and it gives the reader an understanding into the lives of older adopted children. I am looking forward to seeing Jane Ryan's movie, The Boarder, which I heard about after researching the author of this book. Pay no attention to those who call her a quack or belittle Attachment therapy. Do your research...there is good attachment therapy and then there are always those that give it a bad name. Those who want to throw it all out have never lived with a RAD kid. This book will not give much practical advice but It will make RAD parents understood. It is somewhat of a repetitious book so I did skim read some of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demonizing Children","review":"The author clearly is a proponent of a fringe practice called \\"Attachment Therapy\\" which has been condemned by the mental health professions as abusive (see the journal *Child Maltreatment* Feb 2006).Such proponents do not use the official definition of Reactive Attachment Disorder in the DSM-IV, which is characterized by either being very withdrawn or overly friendly with unfamiliar people. There are no aggressive features (although a child may react against someone their age or smaller if food or a possession is taken from him).Attachment Therapy proponents use a bogus, catch-all diagnosis called \\"Attachment Disorder,\\" and they like to conflate it with RAD. It is disturbing to see how the AD diagnosis demonizes these vulnerable children."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind, interesting look at World's Fair 1933","review":"This is the story of a child who was brought in a hatbox to the World's Fair. One of the exhibits at the fair was an \\"infantorium\\" a display of premature infants. I loved all the characters in this book. A half dwarf, a stripper, the doctor, and his ugly nurse, the wet nurse Louise. The only complaint I have is the ambiguous ending. The characterizations reminded me of T.C. Boyle's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, the ending...","review":"The title was intriguing enough to make me pick up this book and I read it just a few hours because it held my interest so. I do love that in a book. But I too was sorely disappointed in the non-ending. I guess it just depends on if you want to really think and come up with your own ending or if like me, you don't have time to read much fiction and really just like to be entertained. Though I enjoyed reading it, I always feel like I've wasted time when it doesn't end \\"right.\\" For that reason, I likely will not read any more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending is missing...","review":"The book is interesting, especially the part about the babies and their nurses...but the ending just isn't there. It's as if she got to that point and couldn't come up with any good resolutions.The book starts slow, lots of background info that seems to drag on and on.Guess I have to say I was really disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't get into it!","review":"I love books about neonatology, so I thought that I would really like this book. Boy was I wrong. I only got to page 30, and ended up returning the brand-new book. Perhaps I didn't get far enough into the story, but I didn't like the writing at all, so I decided to stop. Just to let you know, I am a very avid reader, and enjoy almost every book I read. This just wasn't a keeper. My advice: before you buy this book, read all of the reviews, or borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Religious music for even Metaphysical beliefs","review":"This CD has some of the most beautiful songs and words.

I've recommended this recording to many of my friends, Christian and nonChristian, musical and nonmusical, because it is exquisitely lovely, spiritual without commercialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful release!","review":"I've had this cd for a number of years now and I really enjoy this for those relaxing moods I get into once in a while. This cd is mostly laid back with no real song that picks up and moves or pulses much. That's okay, because this is what this cd is supposed to be like! It's soothing and comforting and angelic sounding without trying to sound too much like her younger sister Enya. I actually enjoy Maire Brennan's next relese even moreso \\"Whisper to the wild water\\" as that one has all the same elements this one has but also picks up and moves a little more and seems a bit more thought out than this one does overall. But that does not mean it replaces this cd as this one has it's own unique quality.Nothing on here will surprise or really impress you but this cd is more about bringing a consistent listen to your ears that will make any stressful day dissapear.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Celtic and spiritual music","review":"My, this music was wonderful! I loved the Celtic sound in her music. I also loved it's spirituality. There were some songs that I thought were too short, but I loved the whole CD. I especially liked \\"The Big Rock\\" and \\"Heal This Land\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Maire has closed the Circle","review":"Ever the fan of Enya, Celtic music, and serious about my Christian faith, I found what most are looking for in a Christian CD: Something that reminds us that music is heavenly and lyrics that raise us from the earthly to hear of His Grace and honor the Lord. Maire is not Enya, and while the roots and influences are there, she is clearly worthy of being admired on her own merit. Maire has read her Bible and has stayed away from Christian cliches. That alone places this work above the normal offerings of formula, profit driven Christian music offerings. The title cut \\"Perfect Time\\" reminds me that part of the struggle of this life is learning patience in the face of rushing around. God is in control and He will bring us to His will. Her harmony and lyrics remind us what the song is about. It only remains for Maire and John Michael Talbot to do a CD together. Maybe \\"Sister and Brother!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect time...indeed!","review":"My first exposure to Maire Brennan was through Clannad 2 which was released 25 or so years ago, and I have been a fan ever since. This is the first MB album I have, and it carries on the same beautiful mix of acoustical Irish instumentation with her lush, haunting voice. Whether or not you understand Gaelic (I don't) is not not an issue for the songs in that language - the poetry of each piece comes through just fine.A wonderful addition to any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but...","review":"This CD is Ok...but, don't listen to those who say the Christan message is not to imposing, because it is! All she sings about is Jesus, Jesus and, yes, Jesus. Not that that is nessicarily a bad thing but...And all the songs seem to have the same tune...Well, if all this is Ok with you, then, by all means,go ahead and buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her singing is gorgeous, but . . .","review":"Maire Brennan's singing and artistry is breathtakingly beautiful, and for most this can be rated a fabulous album. You need to understand, however, that this is a decidedly, in your face, unavoidably christian album. For those, like me, who are recovering from christianity, it was an unpleasant surprise, but not one for which I will fault or judge Maire Brennan. I just wish I had realized it before I had bought the album. It would be better listed or sold under christian music than under any other category."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"I own several Enya albums but had never heard of Marie Brennan untill one day when I walked into a store and heard her album playing over the sound system there.

Except for Jack Warden's cuckolded Republican tycoon, the characterizations are rather dreary. Warren Beatty goes through the motions as the carnally charged hairdresser.

A gutsy guy who wasn't afraid of going against the norm by quitting a well paying corporate job and persuing/realizing his dreams. Pretty amazing stuff.However, I did not care for the book. The author did not inspire me or educate me like, say, a Jon Krakauer does (author of similar types of \\"adventure\\" books like Into Thin Air and Into the Wild) or a Sebastian Junger (Perfect Storm).

All one has to do is speak with the numerous teammates he's left angry, frustrated and disgusted in his wake to learn the truth of Dugard's adventures. To imply that he actually completed a Raid is both a disservice to the readers and a slap in the face of adventure racers who have persevered enough to truly finish -- completing all sections of the course with their team. While Mr. Dugard might lay claim to being an adventurer, he is no adventure racer and in no way can he lay claim to that term -- Mr. Fusil is the founder and ultimate father of the term and the concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quicksand!","review":"A dandy movie, really. Now I know Mickey Rooney is not widely known for drama but he did do them, and although he's no James Garfield in this film he's no amateur neither.You wouldn't think so but this movie should appeal to old car enthusiasts. The auto dealership where a certain amount of this takes place had to have been a Studebaker dealership as the vehicles in the lot are mostly Studebakers and in one scene Mickey Rooney is talking to his girlfriend and there are 2 brand new 1950 Studebaker trucks behind him. Also, the lawyer has a very nice 1950 Packard sedan.If you are into old cars, old street scenes or just plain old movie nostalgia then you cannot and will not go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inexpensive Surprise","review":"Mickey Rooney stars in Quicksand, a great film about how a small unnoticeable crime can turn into something large and out of control if one isn't careful. After needing money for a date with a beautiful woman in town (Jeanne Cagney), Dan turns to his cash register at the auto shop where he works for a twenty that he can easily replace later. However, when the accountant comes early to check up on the place, he's in need of cash faster than he planned, so he buys a watch on the installment plan and pawns it for the cash. When he learns this is a crime, he has to come up with $100 in a day, leading to even more problems down the line.Rooney is wonderful in the leading role of this gripping film. His innocent face does not hinder him in this serious part. His kisses are passionate and reason to support why he was such a ladies man.Although this is a bargain DVD, the picture is crisp and clear and the sound quality is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I caught this movie on a local Catholic channel that has a classic movie every Saturday night. I didn't know what to expect since I'm really not a big Mickey Rooney fan but I was surprised. I really liked this film! Everytime something else went sideways with Dan I was on the edge of my seat. I have a new appreciation for Mickey as an adult actor. The black and white moodiness, characters, narration and the location (I love Santa Monica Pier) made this a pleasant Saturday evening in. Peter Lorre is creepy arcade manager, Jean Cagney plays the perfect femme fatale and Mickey Rooney is believable as any guy in a tough circumstance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the VHS - not the DVD","review":"Good story and acting. But the DVD of it - this black-&-white film was really washed out. It's watchable - but you will always notice the dullness of black and white contrast. A stupid way to manufacture it.

Then see Underworld: Evolution, to keep the story straight. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of its genre","review":"This is absolutely the best Goth movie ever made. Everything in it - the acting, the sets, the costumes - is as good as it gets. Kate Beckinsale kicks ass, and Scott Speedman is just glorious. Best film since The Crow, light years ahead of Van Helsing (ugh).I don't know how I'm going to be able to wait until December for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but no cigar! This movie bites...ina bad way!","review":"The concept was great and the initial visuals, although not new still set a nice tone. The vampires jump off a tower and land as if they just stood up off of a couch. Sharp teeth everywhere, glowing eyes, and guns a blazing...all else is downhill!The vampires show NO SUPERNATURAL ABILITIES other than the jumping and only the head lead vampire (not Kate Beckinsales character) show any strength or ability to do anything but shoot guns!It tries so hard to be The Matrix meets the occult but ends up being the bondage vampires with no powers against the really big hairy werewolves! At least those guys fought fair and had cool transformations! As was previusly mentioned ian another review the vampires even have reflections! I wouldn't be surprised if they even walked outside by day!Stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I bought the movie thinking it was going to be a great action movie, YEP, it isn't. The wolfmen are ridiculous, it's always night in the movie, it's claustophobic. And the plot is involved. The script it's very weak and Kate Beckinsale doesn't look like a vampire, in fact, the vampires are the less resemblance to a vampire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underworld Is One Of The Worst EVER!!!","review":"I bought this movie last night, BIG MISTAKE, I had never seen it but i read the online reviews and it seemed to get good reviews so i decided to get it. I only gave this movie one star because i had too, It was some of the worst acting i have ever seen, The Werewolves looked stupid/retarted. Kate Beckinsale was the only good thing about this movie and not because of her acting.

It was a stupid movie...there really was no point and definitely no hook to make me care about what happens or what didn't happen to these characters. The story was just stupid. It was too much fighting going on everytime you wake up from your sleep they're fighting...as a matter of fact that was what kept me awake...soon as they start fighting it gets loud waking me up from my slumber. The movie was also too long...if it was shorter maybe I would have liked it more. The mood is always dark, gloomy, and shadowy. The things didn't smile or laugh too often and the actors were second rate barely holding my attention on screen. Apparently this movie comes out tomorrow on DVD so i hope you don't get gypped into seeing it as I did. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"Save your money, this one wasnt worth it.

I saw this movie when it came out. Now I barely remember any of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, 3 stars.","review":"Though the story here is a fun new twist on an old tale (Romeo and Juliet), as a fan of the vampire movies and books i found the way they were portraied a bit offsetting. In addition, the movie seemed to have too many sub-plots that weren't developed enough or simply forgotten. Exciting overall, after Time the movie grows on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why repackage a horrible film?","review":"This is just another plot to make money. I don't know why they would even bother to repackage such a horrible film. I fell asleep trying to watch this at least three times. It was a huge disappointment for me. The extras on the DVD aren't going to save this. It wasn't worth watching then and it still isn't worth watching now. Don't buy this, there are better films in this category that are actually worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I've seen since Glitter","review":"This is the worst movie I've seen since Glitter. And at least Glitter was good for a few laughs. I really enjoy horror movies (The Howling, Evil Dead, etc), and I enjoy a good bit of entertaining action (Blade), but this movie was neither scary nor entertaining. I've never written a review before, but seeing this piece of garbage pop up on my screen as a \\"Top Seller\\" really inspired me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect example of a Bad movie making its way up the Boffice","review":"Extremely boring, i felt like leaving the hall half-way through. I really don't understand what people liked about this movie, i dont understand why it was such a success. The acting was horrible, average special effects and the storyline was obviously a rip-off from blade. The action scenes were badly executed, and look extremely fake.This movie basically tries very very hard to hide the fact that they copied nearly every aspect (including camera angles,costumes) from blade. And what's with the sound effects? The gun Kate Beck uses sounds like a toy gun.There is nothing good about this movie, the main reason IMO ppl thought this movie rocked was because there was nothing else to watch when it came out.So in conclusion, Bad movie with cool looking ppl in black to attract the juvenile crowd+ released at the right time = Success ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underworld","review":"Would not recommend buying from this company. I got the movie and it wouldn't play at all, and they have not responded to any of my e-mails to resolve the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than remembered.","review":"So I vaguely remembered seeing Underworld, possibly even in the theaters when it first came out, yet didn't quite recall my final judgement of the film. Then came the glorious Blu-Ray release of the film, well HD viewers, don't waste your time or money. The film itself comes out still appearing too grainy in spots while in others is too dark. I remembered this about my original viewing of the movie and I will say that the HD quality improved it slightly. Foremost in my mind is the overall terrible movie that this is. Bad acting, bad scripting and convoluted plot don't help matters at all. Overall just skip this movie, it will not stand the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I don't understand how people can say this is such a great movie. Maybe I am a traditional vampire fan but when have guns been used to kill them. I was so upset when I say the first five minutes of the movie and continued to grow even angrier. This movie should be at dead last. How dare people put this movie before Bram Stoker's Dracula!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't. It is AWFUL.","review":"While it is true that my awful may be your guilty pleasure, you will probably be saving yourself some time and loot by not buying this movie. The story doesn't hold up. You won't care about the characters and their struggles. Werewolves fighting vampires? Great concept! But like so many Hollywood concepts, the story just doesn't make it sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best vampire/werewolf movies","review":"What I absolutely love about this movie is that there is so much gore and blood, there's no room for much cussing and sexual crap! The effects are very well done, the werewolf scenes are computer graphics at it's best. The plot wasn't that great (then again, I never pay much attention to plots,) but the effects and bloodshed is what caught my eye. Any vampire/werewolf lover MUST see this movie! ^__^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a Dull Moment!","review":"When I first heard about this movie, I have to admit it intrigued me, however I was really skeptical that another Vampire could possibly keep my attention, however, I was dead wrong! Never during this movie was I bored. The action was surprising entertaining, and the film was shot beautifully (I LOVE the lighting!). The theme is also something I've never seen dealt with prior to this movie. 'Underworld' is by far my new favorite movie, & I have absolutely no regrets of purchasing this film without viewing it first in theatres. I anticipate a sequel, although I hope it doesn't follow the cliche and make a sequel that totally does the original no justice. If your having trouble choosing a movie that'll keep your attention, then this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I am a death dealer...\\" Blu-ray review.","review":"Vampires? Check! Werewolves? Check! Awesome Movie? Check! UNDERWORLD is original and entertaining. The movie revolves around vampire Selene, a death dealer. She basically seeks out and hunts werewolves. While on the hunt she uncovers a powerful plot that will destroy the vampire elders and shift the balance of power. The movie isn't a dumb blood and gore horror flick. It's intelligent with a strong plot and some new twists. Finally a vampire/werewolf flick that delivers. Oh, Kate Beckinsale in leather? CHECK!NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful transfer. Looks and sounds great. Blu-ray really shines with a movie like this that is filmed with dark lighting schemes. All special features are transferred from the DVD. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for those who aren't vamp purists...","review":"I don't get the negative reviews to this movie. I thought it was a great \\"dark action\\" movie. Not as bloody as most horror films but a bit more violent than most action films.I thought the premise was enjoyable, the sets apropros' to the film-dark and moody. The fight scenes are great-I think it's wonderful to see a female lead that kicks butt and takes no prisoners. I was also glad to see a Vamp movie where they're not all weeping and wailing-\\"poor-me-I'm-a-cursed-vampire\\". Interesting that you never know who to root for, the vamps or the werewolves-so the ending is satisying.Finally, face it, there are never enough cool werewolf movies! That's a major selling point right there:) AND Bill Nighy (Love Actually) as the head Vamp? So bad it's good!As with any fantasy film-if you're willing to sit back, suspend disbelief, and enjoy a \\"thrill ride\\"-then buy this film. If you're a classical vampire purist then you probably want to skip it.4.5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best . . .","review":"One of the best new movies in quite a while. This film takes a new angle on the world of vampires and werewolves. It's refreshingly different from both all other modern films and from the classic horror style vampire movies.I wont give away any of the plot here but there are several twists and it can be a little confusing on the first viewing. But stick with it and watch it a second time if you must. It's worth the effort. While it's an action film at its heart, there is enough thought put into this to be intelligent. Don't expect every second to be explosions but expect enough gun battles and special effects to keep that crowd interested.Really worth the time to see it at least once. My wife and I both loved it and enjoyed the sequel (which features one of the hottest love scenes ever)."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay...i guess","review":"This movie is mostly an effects and popcorn driven thriller , much like van helsing, only it tries to be serious.It's got a good solid premise, a war between supernaturals, which could be far more interesting than most movies where one supernatural wins out, but it never goes anywhere with it.The script, the plot, etc...are all pretty boring and mediocre. The action is also disappointing , as you almost never see vampires and werewolves sparring with their powers, just using guns like regular henchmen.I give it two stars out of generosity.One for visual style--it's got a nicely dark, moody and gothic atmosphere and sets, good for setting mood.And one for kate beckinsale in leather--always a nice addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this movie, it is so awesome and I love how the first and second work off each so well.

If I had to waste more words I'd say there was never a story here. The amount of time spent viewing this was excruciating - I stayed because of a friend. The plot isn't worth mentioning. The actors do nothing. My favorite scene was when some vampire jumps on top of a car and sticks a knife inbetween the driver and passenger side seats, like he thought someone might be there. This isn't Horror, this isn't smart, this isn't gothic, this doesn't deserve a sequel. I hated when 'Viktor' is revealed to be the badguy behind Selene's parents death, like it's a big revelation and we're all supposed to feel betrayed by this character or like anyone gave a damn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Went to see it in the theaters and I loved it! Best movie I have seen this year! And one of my favorites of all time now! Loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst vampire movie ever.","review":"There are certain genre conventions with vampires and werewolves. Like the fact that they are hard to kill. At one point in this movie a vampire passes out from blood loss due to a stab wound from an ordinary knife. Please. While this is the most egregious disappointment, it is certainly not the only one. The movie plays more like a Hong Kong gunfest than a vamp or werewolf movie. Werewolves were only identifiable when they (rarely) chose to wolf-out. Vampires weren't really identifiable at all, except perhaps for the one occasion when a vamp bit someone. And why are werewolves running on walls and ceilings?! The only good things about this movie are the leather outfits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires feed on blood. This movie feeds on cheese.","review":"Words can't describe how lame this movie is. Some movies can pull off a low budget and still look good, but this isn't one of them. If you saw the commercial, you literally saw every special effects shot in the movie. The story makes no sense whatsoever. The concept of vampires and werewolves fighting each other with guns is pointless. Why have monsters at all if everyone's just going to shoot at each other?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vampire flick","review":"First of all I really enjoyed Underworld, and I think that the plot is a good. There's enough action to keep everyone interested but the movie involves more than just gruesome violence. There are twists in the plot and an interesting story line. Also, the performances by the actors/actresses are good. Another thing I enjoy about Underworld is that it's not disturbing or scary. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes the Blade movies, the Crow and Frailty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!","review":"Not my cup of tea, but my boyfriend loved it.

Get it under $18.00, I bet this price in here no one really going to buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been better...","review":"In the hands of truly imaginative people, this concept could've been a lot more fun. Think of it Vampires versus Werewolves. However, the biggest problem is that the filmmakers cared more about the look of the film than the story. Specifically, the only thing this film seems to want to do is imitate The Matrix: they copy the art direction, the wardrobe, the cinematography - there are some shots that are exact duplicates. Of all the Famous Monsters of Filmland, the werewolf is perhaps the most terrifying, but they keep getting ruined on film. These wolves are too CGI to be really scary - and why to they need to walk on walls?However, the movie is not a total train wreck. There is enough non-stop action to pass a rainy afternoon in front of the TV. It just could've been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass.","review":"I was a bit disappointed with the original release: major plot holes, choppy action sequences, lousy soundtrack, total waste of the picture-perfect setting of Budapest, cramped character development and a hokey ending. Still considering the budget they had to work with, it was impressive enough as a first film.So I picked up the extended cut. Blah. It didn't fix any of the problems. There is nothing on the disc (for the film) that isn't included in the novelization (which was, sad to say, poorly written). If you've read it, you don't need to see the extended cut. If you haven't read it...the book is cheaper.This disc makes for a better rental than a personal purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Flick","review":"I love good Vampire or Werewolf type movies and Underworld fits the bill nicely.

The movie doesnt give up the plot until the end. That is what I liked most about it. I would probably go and see an Underworld 2 if made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for a sequel","review":"I like monster movies. I watch alot of them. and underworld is a very good example of the genre.The Special effects were used very effectivly to support the plot not overwhem it. As I have seen the movie twice there are lots of little details that made the movie even more enjoyable the second time.PLEASE note this is an action movie not a romance. there is a very light undertone of attraction but rather than push it they stayed true to their characters and kept it low key. There maybe more love interest in the sequel. There is definatly enough depth to this world and enough loose threads to make it worthwhile.The only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5 is I want to see the extras on the dvd. there is more to this story and I can't wait to see it.Bottom line- Go see the movie but don't expect epic romance expect a heroine who's world is about to turn upsidedown"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this rip-off version","review":"If you're like me, you are really - really - getting tired of producers, film compaines, whomever there is to blame re-re-re-releasing the same DVD with different packaging, and calling it the \\"Ultimate\\" or \\"Supreme\\" or \\"this time it really is a Limted edition\\" special releases. The motivation? Raking it in from fans who expect and want more. You'd be better off spending your bucks elsewhere.There is NOTHING to make this DVD stand out from the original release. I was looking for extended fight scenes. Nope. OK, how about more history or plot? Nope. The extra footage really should have stayed on the cutting room floor. You WILL not be happy if you already own the original release and waste your money on this lame release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining flick","review":"There are reasons this movie was never nominated for an Academy Award.

I had high hopes but I was just let down. The vampires were too weak they had no powers at all its more like a bunch of english people fighting werewolves. Special effects is all this movie had. I guess there was so much of that they didnt have time for a plot or character development it only has one star because of the back story. I didnt rent or buy it i borrowed it from a friend but i think im gonna charge him for wasting my time. This makes a Jhon Grisham book sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed by Underworld","review":"I'm a big fan of vampire movies and special effects. Blade was an awesome movie, and from the previews Underworld certainly appeared to promise the same action and level of acting. Unfortunately once the first few minutes of action were over, the movie began to fall apart. The basic premise was great; an ancient war between vampires and werewolves. The story and its execution, however, did not live up to the possibilities. As much as I was looking forward to this movie I found that even I had a hard time sitting through the whole DVD. Very disappointing. My copy went straight to ebay..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Bonus Features","review":"I enjoyed it in the theatre, but the dvd is lacking.

Maybe it's my curiosity of that \\"culture.\\" Maybe it's just the beautiful makeup effects. However, I expected so much more with this movie.The whole love story that was built up between the two major characters was a major let down in being that for starters, Beckinsale and Speedman didn't come across as having any real chemistry. Also, the love story plot was barely touched upon when I felt they tried to sale the movie on that focal point.The music/score was tacky and somewhat cliched for this movie and while I'm tempted to say the same for the costuming and setting, I liked the lighting used for the movie.There was a twist at the end that was interesting, but predictable.

The plot and acting is completely predictable and contrived. I didn't check out the bonus material because watching this film was already too much of a waste of time. \\"Underworld\\" somewhat reminded me of(atleast as far as subject content) two great Japanese anime films called \\"Vampire Hunter D\\" and Vampire Hunter D-Bloodlust\\" which I highly recommend instead of this film.

As apposed to going the old route with cliched and tired hand-to-hand fighting scenes (Matrix Reloaded anyone?), they illustrate that the Vampires and Lycians have evolved to realize that they live in the 21st century and revealing themselves to the majority is a bad thing. Still holding true to the oldest forms of Vampires, they still require blood and are basically immortal. Truly an enjoying watch for a myth buff. On a final note, this movie is NOT a horror film like Vampire flicks of yesteryear, this is a more story driven, action film, similar to the recently released Van Helsing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than i expected","review":"This actually a great movie and it doesen't shy away from the gore and blood like i thought from the trailer.

Some action but few and far between. It was a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNDERWHELMING & BORING?","review":"How is it possible that a movie about vampires versus werewolves with a woman as hot as Kate Beckinsale in the mix can be dull? Somehow they managed to dull down the excitement that the trailer promised.

Rent or buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanting more.","review":"Yes we'll have to say that Underworld has a lot of faults. From the story line of the elders being really fuzzy to the vampires themselves being, lets face it, a little weak. And how many bullets does a handgun clip hold? Up to 13 for a .40. How come during some firing scenes with Selene I was reminded of the movie \\"Commando\\" where Arnold never seemed to run out of bullets in one clip? But I admired Danny McBride's vision of what it would be like to have an actual conflict between two great species. The only problem is that we need a bunch of holes filled within the story line to make things more interesting. That means we need a sequel that surpasses this one.

The acting was OK, but that's about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"Having a lame voiceover layout the overwrought and ludicrously worded backstory in the beginning starts off Underworld on a bad note and it dives even further down from there into a carnival of bad dialogue, Matrix rip-offs (visual and score), lame rubber suited werewolves, and crappy characters. Kate Beckinsale is beautiful but what a bad way to have to show it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is about the edition, not the Movie","review":"Okay first of all I would like to say that I have not been able to actually watch this edition since the copy I bought did not have the sound included. I have no idea wether the sound is better or not. The more general problem I have with this edition is the case and disc design. SUPERBIT decided to plaster their logo all over both the cardboard case and the DVD case as well as the disc itself. It seems to cheapen the overall package. The greatest injustice is the fact that the disc is bright RED, exactly the opposite of everything to do with the movie. If all that matters to you is the movie itself than feel free to ignore this. I plan to return my copy and get a better designed case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"I had high expectations for this movie, I mean come on, the eternal war between werewolves and vampires with a hot chick starring in it. However I found the movie to be unoriginal, poorly constucted and written, with some of the worst special effects this side of 1990. The filmmakers were too ambitious in my opinion, if they had worked with about $20 million more in the budget it might have been worth seeing. The only good thing about this movie was the cinematography, which was very cool, including some very nice use of filters creating a dark but polished look---think matrix. Otherwise the use of stop-motion was ugly and uninspired, and I found the dialogue to, rather than generate compassion or hatred for the characters, leave me unsimpathetic and uninterested. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...i've seen better","review":"well, this movie was ok, but you can't see anything because it's too dark and there is no lighting in it at all. i feel that movies.ign.com best implemented the problem with this film. it tries to include too many new concepts and ideas into one film about the supernatural or vampires(note: not a direct quote). maybe the reason other people that wrote reviews for this movie enjoyed it more than me was because they were capable of making sense of about 1/8 of it which is more than i could say for myself. you may think this is because of my intelligence or comprehension, some of that maybe true but most was in part of a way too complicated storyline. this movie could have been the second movie of a trilogy, seeing as how the producers and writers and everyone else invloved thought it wouldn't be necessary to explain why anything in the movie was happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly eye-candy","review":"If you are looking for a good movie, good storyline, or good scare--look elsewhere.

The story of vampires fighting werewolves was resonable enough, even though werewolves do seem to have the advantage of daylight. This is the first movie that I have seen that have made werewolves thinking creatures. In vampire mythology, they have no reflection, do not cast a shadow, have superior hearing and sight and incredible strength. Not in this version.It turned out to be a love story. Part one of a love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst vampire movie ever made","review":"How can I rate this movie when it is oneof the worst movie's I have ever seen.Do not spend your money and don't rent it.Don't waste your time to even try and seeif you like it or not.There are better vampire movie's to rentand to own,trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, pardon me, but was this supposed to have a plot?","review":"Well, sorry, chaps, but it didn't. A huge dissapointment from a very promising concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst vampire movie since dracula: dead or alive","review":"this movie was laughable at best. no one paid attention to any of the rules of vampires, except that they drink blood. none of the vampires were superhuman (the main character passed out after losing a little blood). the special effects were terrible. the only ability that the vampires had was jumping in slow motion. in one scene, a vampire actually looked at herself in the mirror, in the mirror! last i heard, vampires don't have reflections. like i said, laughable. i agree that the guns added to this horror-of-a-movie. the \\"lycans\\" were ok, but that was only because the vampires were so weak. don't waste your time or your money. people should be ashamed that a movie like this was actually made."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNDERWHELMED","review":"If I can think of one movie that I HATE, it is \\"Underworld\\". I was so excited to see the battle of the vampires & werewolves, and laughed through this whole movie. I HATED HATED HATED this movie. The costumes were apparently borrowed from the Warner Bros vault when \\"The Matrix\\" was through with them. I didn't know vampires suddenly have reflections in mirrors (one female is looking in a mirror deciding which dress to wear and has a reflection!). Who is paying for the online account and cellphones that the vamps use???? Do they send the bill to the LAIR BELOW THE STREETS!!!????? What's up with that????

Underworld is more like a try hard Matrix than anything else. I never want to hear this in the same sentence as Interview With a Vampire quite simply because Underworld has nothing to do with Vampires. It simply uses them to make a group oppose the warewolves. Kate or 'Selene' actually passes out from lack of blood (funny considering she's supposedly dead), when the light in the mansion goes out, the 'vampires' actually need to carry torches in order to see. And lastly, I've never met a vampire that can;t hear trains in a tunnel before. All in all, this is one of those movies that you watch if you're a fan of 'Dracula 2000'(yes, it;s THAT sad)."},{"rating":"2","title":"bloody well done","review":"Underworld is awesome and it will make you guess whats going to happen next so if you havent seen the movie you should go rent it when it comes out it is a really bloody movie and this is not for the kids.

The scenery was like the crow in that it was mostly dark. on the other hand it was like Blade because it had a lot of similar weaponry choices. i highly approve because it held stuck to most of the truths about vampires. all in all i thought it was an excently movie that will be added to my growing dvd collection and i highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Underworld' Delivers the Goods","review":"Somewhat lost in 2003's \\"sequel-o-rama\\" was this sci-fi/action masterpiece released Sept 19 of that year. Here we have great originality of script & ambience; the 'underworld' war raging between vampires & lychens (werewolves), complete with modern-day weaponry & very believeable scenarios makes this the thriller of the year. Beckinsale's character was a bit oversold, although she did perform well above my expectations as a \\"Master Death Dealer\\" of the vampire clan.The film's shining star is in fact, the screenwriting & directing; both lending to the always-night-time ambience & the subtle but convincing eerieness of the entire plot. The Script brings many sub-plots along with the main story, making this a 'see it again' classic.Yes, Matrix & Terminator sequels are great...but when is the last time we were graced with leather-clad vampires sporting full-auto 9mm. assault pistols?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"Nobody really does a vampire movie these days with a well written plot and good acting until now.

Blu Ray transfer looks great and the PCM sound is likewise, especially if you have a good surround system to give it extra life. IF you like this movie, go ahead and buy Underworld: Evolution NOW as it's just as good and a worthy sequel to this flick. And by the way, with Warner Studios going over to Blu Ray exclusively, say GOODBYE to the inferior and now lifeless HD DVD format...finally. Anyone on the fence over the format war can now go ahead and get a Blu Ray player as the war is OVER!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked the movie.....","review":"This is an other great port over into the Blu-Ray realm. Excellent sound as is mostly usual and expected on this format. The resolution and flow of the movie technically is very good. If you liked the movie on regular DVD then you will love it on Blu-Ray. The effects and action sequences really pop out at you creating an emersing suspension of dis-belief. That allows you to get past the whole vampires versus were-wolves aspect. I would definately recommended it for any fan of action/sci fi/horror type movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underworld Evolution (Unrated Extended Cut)","review":"The Underworld movies are one my favorite vampire and werewolf related series. The movies are well made and very enjoyable. I bought this particular movie because I had misplaced my original video. My son and myself really enjoyed watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ummm","review":"First off this was a good film. Second, it wasn't scary; and it definitely could have been better. A Vampire verses Werewolf film should be action intensive; and although it did have action none of it was ever in slow motion. (So the watcher never got those cool \\"matrix\\" shots.) And most of the action just felt like those old westerns. Draw a gun bang, bang, bang. \\"Oh, one guy went down and the other's running.\\" \\"He got shot in the back.\\" \\"Okay the good guys win.\\" Not really what should be created in our modern world; but! If you can get over that it had a vary good story line, and some cool morphs between humanoid and wolfish. Plot was a Five Star. Acting Five Star. Photography, Five Star. Action, about two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on the movie, not the DVD","review":"I saw this movie at the theater and was pretty disappointed. It looked interesting, lots of action, maybe some romance. Instead, it was a gorgeously shot boring movie. My husband, a former comic book geek, absolutely hated it and almost fell asleep during the predictable, often nonsensical story. Also, some of the myths about vampires are blatantly disregarded without explanation, like why these vampires can see their reflections in mirrors. The costumes, set, and cinematography were great, but I would never buy this movie, or even tape it off cable TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a RIPOFF!","review":"This is a fun action movie - this review is not of the movie itself, but the \\"unrated\\" DVD version. There is nothing in this film that would change the rating anyway - it's just schlocky marketing of the worst sort.The extras are a joke, but the commentary is pretty decent. The extra film footage is just some gratuitous sexual footage (and precious little of that) about a sub plot we already knew existed in the theatrical version of the film! The ending of the extended cut of the film also allows for a sequel, something that just ISN'T going to happen. I think they knew that, which is why they made the ending of the theatrical release different.THERE IS NOTHING NEW IN THE FILM THAT WARRANTED A SPECIAL RELEASE!Again, I liked the film, but this product is a complete ripoff at the price they're charging.Buy the much less expensive theatrical release.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but..","review":"It was a pretty good movie but even for having prime it cost far too much to rent :( Maybe we could consider prime members getting an even better discount?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underworld 2 disc unrate extended cut","review":"It was a gift for a very particular friend. He really liked it and said it was good! That is a huge endorsement from my friend.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"has quality but no plot","review":"I am not sure why I saw this movie, its not usually the kind of movie I like. I probably just was in a bad mood and wanted to see loads of pale people in dark clothes, blood, full moon and rainy streets. So far, so good. It is a well made story, though I am not sure what the story is. It is entertaining and it makes some effort with creating an appropriate atmosphere including the way it is told by a narrator. The movie has some highlights (I esp. like the scene where half of his head slips off) but it lacks from the absence of a \\"hero(ine)\\" or whatever central character to identify with. It would make a good pc-game without much alteration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiffy effects, but boring movie","review":"Not much originality in this film. Mostly it tries to emulate the look, feel, sound, and mood of some better films (\\"The Matrix\\", \\"The Crow\\", etc).Special effects are very good, but even that can't save a dull script and the slow pacing.There's an old maxim in the theatre that goes, \\"If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.\\" If the script isn't compelling to read, no amount of spiffy set dressing, effects, etc will elevate it to a higher level. Same here with \\"Underworld\\". It looks good, but the script anchors it down to sub-par level.A friend loaned me this DVD to watch, so at least I didn't have to shell out any $$ for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't people talk anymore?","review":"Obviously modern day vampires have lost the art of conversation. Paint on a malevolent scowl, grunt a few choice phrases and maintain only 2 different facial expressions and you're a vampire!I remember the old style vampire movies where they were the most charming of creatures, relying on smooth talking to lure the pretty damsels into their bedrooms for some quick neck nibbling action.Now they own guns, are appallingly inept shots at target and apparently their images now reflect on mirrors and cctv monitors.Werewolves walk on walls too apparently!If only we could take the collective wooden performances, mould them into a stake and drive it through the heart of this garbage.The vampires in this movie don't suck - they blow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and boring","review":"besides of the good special effects of the werewolves aka lycans, this movie was very dull and boring. some good fight scenes. very slow and is a great movie for getting your parents to fall asleep so you can sneak out of the house"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-lease......","review":"I waited in anticipation for this film, only to be let down.You've read the reviews.

Yet , as one reviewer had said \\"they didn\`t have enough time for the story \\". I am in full agreement with that . Despite being two hours this movie felt like it should have been longer. It\`s goal was the action , but it had such a great story that more attention to it would have been nice. I agree about the whole character development as well. There wasn\`t much . But through out the entire movie I couldn\`t help but think that this was just some ploit of things to come .I do hope a 2nd movie will appear in the future . Maybe it will have what the first one was missing (think X-men.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Mind Blowing!!!","review":"This movie is first off, one of the best vampire movies I have watched recently. This is leaving out the point which the plot is about vampires hunting down the remainder of the Lycans(werewolves). Kate Beckinsale is an absolutly amazing actress. This was the first movie which I have seen that she was in. Her part in this movie is as a Death Dealer is an extremely serious role. I do not believe she smiles even once. That takes a great skill. Back to the movie. It is about a vampire who falls in love with a human. This human, Michael, is bitten by a werewolf and begins to see flashbacks of memories of the strongest Lycan. This werewolf's name was Lucian. As Selene(Kate Beckinsale) tries to help Michael....Just buy the movie already. No dissappointment guaranteed.(For a good laugh, look at Lucian's face when Michael has his flashback at the Lycan's dwelling!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Matrix\\" meets \\"Blade\\" -- and goes home","review":"This was definitely on my list of the worst films of 2003. A boring monster flick starring Kate Beckinsale (who really is a good actress and should have known better), this movie is ostensibly about an age-old conflict between vampires and werewolves. Instead, it's a remarkably tired and predictable plot that exists mainly as an excuse to show Beckinsale in tight leather. The dialogue is awful, the storyline (ooooh, what a big mystery) was obvious from the first frame, and the climactic battle scene relied on one of those movie moments that's so ridiculous you feel compelled to shout out, \\"Oh, COME ON!\\" in the middle of the movie theater. To be fair, Bill Nighy did make a suitably creepy villain, but he deserved a better movie to do it in. Pass on this flick and rent one of the movies it tried to rip off -- \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Blade.\\" Both of them are far more worthy of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beckinsale in latex rules - flick sucks","review":"Kate Beckinsale looks smoking in this movie in her latex outfit but there is no other reason to watch the flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"Okay, the premise was interesting, Vampires versus Werewolves (Lycans). But who wants to see them duke it out with GUNS??? Adding to the stupidity, the Vampires shoot silver nitrate bullets, and the Lycans shoot (I'm not joking here, folks) daylight bullets! The acting is rather hammy. The dialogue is such a waste, many times it really seems as though it is simply there to fill time. I will admit that the movie got better as it went on, and in the end, I would call it midly entertaining. Really, though, nothing more than a hybrid of The Matrix and The Crow movies. Unless you are a serious comic book geek or insatiable g*th cow, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underworld ROCKS","review":"Just watched this movie last night. It is definitely a cross between Blade and the Matrix. Great costumes, cinematography, action and special effects were wonderful. It was a good idea to have vampires and werewolves going at it. The casting was also good, but would have preferred Bruce Payne playing the part of Victor. The ending leaves it open for a sequel and I certainly can't wait for part II. As far as image quality of the disc, it is outstanding along w/the sound. Do yourself a favor if you are a horror fan and watch it. Don't listen to the other bad reviews, if you like movies like, Blade, Kindred-The Embraced,Ultraviolet and Forever Knight, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth","review":"Wading through the reviews of Underworld, it's easy to get a mixed feeling of how good or bad this movie is. Here is the simple truth: if you know what the plot is (ware wolfs vs. vampires), and aren't completely tuned off by the idea, go ahead and give the movie a spin. For what it is, and what it has to work with, it is a very good title that will, for the most part, keep you entertained from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastical !!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie was excellent because it was very similar with the Matrix series because instead of having robots and agents chasing Neo, we have werewolves and vampires chasing a guy who is believed to carry something very powerful.

So much so that I bought \\"Underworld: Evolution\\" sight unseen.Beckinsale is wonderful, not just another pretty face, she actually has talent. The rest of the cast is well cast and believable.Sticking to the \\"Rules\\" governing Likens and Vampires, \\"Underworld\\" will pull you in for an exciting ride as these two sides race to end war that has been going on for centuries, but to what end?Definately worth seeing if not owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie is horrible","review":"One of the worst movies ever, its better when u watch it in spanish cause then u at least dont have to hear the stupid dialoge.

The only good thing I could say about Underworld is that the special effects were good and the action scenes were well done. Now for the bad parts; the story was boring and confusing, the characters were uninteresting because they had weak dialog. I didn't like any of the characters and couldn't care less who lived or died. Kate Beckinsale's performance was very sterile. The whole movie takes place in nighttime and is terribly dark. All the scenes are so dark, even the action sequences were almost ruined by the darkness. They also kept showing very annoying flashbacks (that made no sense at all). Underworld also has a bad ending!

The move does have some gore--but no fear factor. Avoid if at all possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spongecake.","review":"Did you know there has been a war going on for hundreds of years? And it all started because the upper class and lower class dared to fall in love and have an abomination for a baby? Master vs. Servant! Father vs. Daughter! Oh, the drama!

But there is plenty of fun action to distract you from remembering you don't give a lick about the leading characters (what was Kate Beckinsale thinking?). It's like eating Twinkie.

Given that I believe, as I do with many movies, that it is best not know too much about the story so as not to build up any expectations. Even with that I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't too much of a love story (thankfully!) and the plot had a few little surprises (but don't look for any big twists). There was just a slight shift in my perception towards the end, which was one of the nice little surprises. I like horror/vampire movies, strong female characters and I won't usually admit this, but I'm beginning to believe that I am a closet goth.

Selene is a 'death dealer', a vampire trained to kill werewolves. Vampires and werewolves have been at bitter war for centuries, each determined to drive the other to extinction. Now, the werewolves may have an edge as they discovered a way to combine the genes of both species to create a half-vampire, half-werewolf breed with strengths of both and none of their weaknesses. It all hinges on a human doctor, to whom Selene feels forbidden attraction, especially since he'll soon turn into a werewolf himself. The storyline was very tight, gradually revealing how the war began and not everyone is as he/she seems. The action sequences were amazing. The movie seems to have focused on building to story, perhaps leaving the personal drama and romance to the sequel which is in works. I'm looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.","review":"This movie has some great special effects and not the cheap ones you see in so many movies.

In fact, it is nothing like that. Kate Beckinsale's acting is amazing and her clothes, I must say, simply gorgeous. Scott Speedman plays his part well, the only debatable part of his character being that he turns into a strange erm... green were-vampire. The special effects are excellent. The storyline is good, though there are parts of the movie which are questionable, judge for yourself. I think that you have to watch the movie yourself and see what you think, but it is a story of immortals that rises to the top alongside Queen Of The Damned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Franchise!","review":"Underworld is a fantastic movie and I absolutely love the DVD.Kate Beckinsale's character Selen is the new Ripley, she is taking over where Sigorney Weaver left off in the Alien series with a tough, beautiful, strong character. The incredible storyline of intertwining Vampires and Werewolfs is incredibly well done. This movie was beautifully shot in a dark tone with a gothic city as its backdrop. I have watched it about 4 times now and everytime I pick up something new.The special features on the dvd bring a lot of interesting things to mind as well. I totally agree with director Len Wiseman, CGI has become too un-realistic, and way over used in movies. Using real people as the creatures make them that much scarier.

It reminded me of Blade, The Matrix, The Crow, Queen of the Damned, and a few other movies I can't remember right now. If the dialoge was lame, so what!

Gore and moody lighting alone do not make a movie worth seeing. The effects were anything but special. It also completely ripped off the Matrix in sound and visual effects. Poorly, too, I might add. Do not waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Blunderworld\\"","review":"Wow, a Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves... \\"Underworld\\" looked like it was going to be great, but it was a huge disappointment. The story has been overkilled so many times. The action lacks style. The special effects weren't very special. A kindergartner can draw better werewolves with his or her foot. I'm sorry, but do not watch this waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen","review":"My sister rented this a few weeks ago telling me I would really like it, (she had seen it before.) She was definatly wrong. When everyone is not killing each other there is a plot that makes hardly any sense. My dad, who usually likes movies like this wasn't able to sit through it. For the most part it's just a lot of violence with no meaning. I'd never watch it again, and I definatly suggest not to buy it because there are so many other, better, movies out there. Anything is better then this. I really like Kate Beckansile, but I don't know why she would waste her acting abilities in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurell K.

The animosities of the characters and the story itself strongly remind me of the first time I read \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" and while it isn't her story, I believe Ms. Hamilton would be proud to be able to call these characters her own.

Vampire vs. Werewolf; its actually quite simple and they screwed it up. The writers apparently thought that Werewolves needed a nerdy name, Lycans and Vampires needed redeemable qualities; they don't eat humans. The point of all this resides in one bad vampire king. I think it would have been much more interesting if neither the Vampires or Werewolfs would have had redeemable qualities. Making monsters act human for the sake drudging along an unoriginal love story with no payoff is just stupid. The only reason I gave it Two Stars is the background scenery, costuming, and some of the special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Sets! Weak Movie...","review":"The nicest thing I can say about UW is, \\"Hey, this would look great as a Goth/Industrial club!\\" Unfortunately there's not much else positive. Maybe the problem lies with the fact that the premise is so promising... a centuries old blood-feud between lycanthropes and vampires. Had the underlying concept been weaker maybe it wouldn't be so disapointing. But alas, when you make big promises you have to follow through with a big delivery... something this film just could not do.The fact that these unique, legendary creatures would have to resort to a non-stop gun battle is a trite cop-out and it just never lets up. UW never fully takes advantage of the inherent abilities of the monsters themselves and makes them just glorified mortal humans. The plot twists provide nothing to get excited about. Like a few others I had to try for several weeks before I actually made it all the way through. Just boring really and unoriginal while it could have been so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Style and substance","review":"Great film. Although there has to be a suspension of disbelief in all of these sci-fi/thriller movies, \\"Underworld\\" tries to tie in a little science with the lore. The plot is somewhat predictable, but the action is pretty good....and Kate Beckinsale-she looks incredible in all her movies, but she's especially gorgeous in this one. She speaks with her native English accent as well...quite nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"underworld is very different from twilight, in many ways...","review":"I watched this last summer, it was a roller coster ride!

The lyrics are muffled and the background musicians are barely audible. Nowhere on the webpage for this CD does it say that it is a live concert.

But you can't fail to learn SOMETHING!","review":"Bad: 1. Uses Golden Dawn set-up of the elements, something that does not correspond with Enochiana. 2. Uses wrong hexagrams in rituals. 3. Uses unicursal hexagrams, and claims them to be an old, but unused GD-creation.Good: It has all the elemental tablets in the beginning of the book, so when i was going through some studies of mine, I didn't have to flip so many pages to find them. My thumbs are so happy.Although: If you believe that the Golden Dawn tradition has the Complete And Only Anwsers To Everything, this might be a book for you.

In fact I would be surprised if it did well with a still camera. It supposedly has a \\"3-Way Fluid Pan Head\\", but it is not smooth in pan and sticks. The mechanism to loch the plate in is also inadequate and loose.I do like the tripod portion (not the head). It is light and the legs are easy to adjust.This is not a prosumer product."},{"rating":"2","title":"mucho macho mucho fun","review":"I bought the original Tropico when it first came out and later the expansion. I sold them in order to buy a gamepad. I regret doing that and was pleased to see the \\"Mucho Macho Edition\\" which has both. I purchased it just the other day after seeing it in the stores for quite some time. It contains Tropico, the Paradise Island expansion and is patched to the latest version. It also includes an updated manual and a strategy guide (altho I was a tad bit disappointed to discover the guide is contained on one of the two CDs as I prefer printed manuals).

It is a book rich with photos of installations and details of tile and stone that will suggest to the reader (and viewer) many possibilities for the functional and decorative use of these materials.Contrary to what another reviewer of this book says, it contains far more information than a brochure of the Ann Sacks line of products would. (In fact, many of the materials and tiles illustrated are *not* from the Ann Sacks line at all?unless Ann Sacks somehow managed to install her work in ancient French farmhouses, at Middle Eastern religious sites, and in Roman baths!)This well-produced book is a visual feast, and an inspiration for designers, decorators, and homeowners. It's well worth the price and the graphics are splendid. Anyone who works with, or who is thinking of working with tile and stone will want to own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A customer's honest opinion of this book","review":"I was very disappointed in Ann Sacks' \\"Tile and Stone\\". Rather than an overview of tile with all it's possibilities, this book presents mostly the line of tile carried by Ann Sacks stores. It is a biased book. A brochure from one of her stores would serve the same purpose and be much cheaper. Additionally annoying is the fact that every picture is accompanied by the words \\"stunning\\", \\"lovely\\" or \\"striking\\". There are MUCH better, more informative tile books out on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful but lofty","review":"The photos are beautiful as promised. But if you're really looking for a sourcebook of ideas for your home, as this one claims to be, you may be disappointed. This book treats stone and tile with nearly religious reverence; all I wanted was something nice for the kitchen! Some of the treatments are absurdly elaborate, and the text even analyzes the provenance of many of the stones. More creative people might find inspiration here, but for me it was much ado about nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly detailed","review":"I have collected many clowns in the past but this one takes the cake. The detail is so perfect it captures the very essence of a clown. The dogs sitting beside the clown have exceptional detail and they all have their individual character. This is a great gift for clown collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful \\"Lum and Abner\\" movie","review":"Two Weeks to Live is a delightful Lum and Abner romp, one of the seven full length movies that they made in the 1940s. This one takes them to Chicago when Abner inherits a railroad. Things go awry in dizzying fashion after that. The print of this Alpha video is decent (perhaps not as good as the print for The Bashful Batchelor, but better than Dreaming Out Loud), and the price is right. Fans of cornpone humor shouldn't hesitate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Collector's Guide! Very Valuable Resource!","review":"This guide is a must for any bank collector.

It's such a shame as I've got every reason to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had passed this on by","review":"I found this book to be an utter diappointment. The characters never seemed to be fully developed nor did the plot ever seem to be a fully developed idea. The cat seemed to be the most developed character in the book. I felt like I had missed part of the story even though I had read each and every page. The ending seemed like the cliffhanging ending for a Saturday morning cartoon \\"tune in next week for the dramatic conclusion of Here Kitty Kitty\\". I think that this would have appealed to the young adult market more that the adult market. The time travelling cat and the prehistoric theme would appeal to that age group more appropriately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time - Don't bother.","review":"Flat one-dimensional characters. Unbelievable, unrealistic dialogue. \\"Big\\" words, pretentious, silly metaphors. Ending completely disappointing and unsatisfying. Many loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid and uninvolving.","review":"Despite some tantalising glimpses of Leavitt's descriptive prowess (the final paragraph is a ripper), I found this book a real disappointment. The relationships- between Paul and Richard; Richard and Joseph etc were unconvincing, the plot weak and meandering and the denoument (if one can call it that) whimpered, rather than roared. Even the familial relationship (which Leavitt usually explores with panache and compassion), between Paul and his mother, was forced and flat. As another reviewer stated, this book is very 'white bread' and after the wry, sly and poignant 'Arkansas',a great disappointment to me. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library and saved myself some money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very light reading","review":"I wanted very badly to like this book. Set in the world of classical music with all the grandeur and pomp that implies, this story fell flat. A younger man falls for an older, famous man. Not a very original concept to begin with but it gets worse. The mother falls for the older man, the older man's agent/lover falls for the younger man, etc. It's just a mess. There are no truly likeable characters here and even the beautiful imagery of Rome, San Francisco and New York does little to spruce it up.OK -- here's the real reason I wasn't thrilled with it. Not one good sex scene. Nothing titilating, nothing disgusting or revolting, nothing scary or dangerous. It was so white bread middle of the road it was boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"After graduating from high school and before starting classes at Juilliard, 18-year-old Paul takes a trip to Rome with his recently-separated mother. There he meets Richard, a famous pianist who happens to be his idol, with whom he starts a secret and doomed affair. Back in New York, Paul will discover that neither his relationship with Richard nor his own talent are what he imagined or hoped for. The Page Turner is a lovely novel about growing up and growing into your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are we going with this?","review":"Leavitt breaks new ground in a story of middle-aged lust and teenage infatuation. While his writing is still in brilliant form (albeit inconsistently so) and he succeeds in the poignant observations of dilemma and resignation inherent in many homosexual relationships, there isn't much in the plot and characters to care about. The book is essentially a series of sub-plots that aren't sufficiently developed and the abrupt ending can only be described as a plunge into inconsequence and emptiness. Leavitt has been sharper and more elegant in his early novels and short stories. As a follow-up to \\"While England Sleeps\\" which I consider his best novel, this outing is a puzzling dissatisfying disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I continually read Leavitt's books and am continually disappointed. This time, even more so.There's barely even a book here, just an outline and a few funny passages. The characters are one-dimensional and the ending is just plain ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring junk","review":"David Leavitt proves once again that he doesn't have anything interesting to write about, and writes about it in an appropriately uninteresting way."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, boring, boring","review":"After having read this extremely boring book, I realy wanted to know why David Leavitt wrote it. Just to show us that he knows some facts about pianos and classical music? Normally, one develops a certain feeling for the characters, (well, that's what novel writing should be all about) but in this case, I could not care less what happens to this teenager who is absorbed in his own problems and the other main characters. There are better books around."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is deceiving.","review":"The idea was good, but I thought the execution of the story was a bit weak. I kept thinking that something \\"more\\" would happen with Paul, but was let down when I got to the final page of the novel. The novel ended abruptly, which left me upset that I had spent the weekend reading the novel. I liked Leavitt's collection of short stories, ARKANSAS, and thought this novel would be similar read. Unfortunately, it just left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page Turner? - more like Pot Boiler!","review":"All of David Leavitt's writing to date has shown a sensitivity and lightness of touch that is rarely encountered. Sadly the current work is crass, clumsy with wince-making tinges of arrogance. The characters are one-dimensional, unsympathetic and implausible. This is much like too many other gay novels that purport to describe the rarified lives of the New York 'A-Queen' set, and are only likely to be of interest to those in that set. I am no literary critic, but I know that David Leavitt is a great writer who is capable of much better than this. As one who has derived great enjoyment from his writing I hope 'The Page Turner' will prove to be a temporary aberration. Avoid - and keep your former impressions unsullied."},{"rating":"1","title":"contrived and silly - a big yawn","review":"What's happened to David Leavitt, who was so good in Cranes?? This short novel is a painful 230 pages long. From the start, you'll wince: after a 20 year marraige, our hero (Paul)'s mom and dad separate. It's as easy for Paul and Pamela (his mom) as running off to Rome to get their hair done and charge new clothes on daddy's charge cards. Dad does write a note to Paul suggesting he take care of Pamela, of course. No angst, no problem, he's gone! Just when Paul just turns of age, he bags his life-long idol? The two of them just happen to be in the same square in Rome? Then he happens to bag the idol's lover, and no connections are made until the end? And the most cliched scene: Pauls' first sexual encounter starts with this line from his much older friend \\"You must need a backrub after your long flight...\\" Skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leavitt's weakest to date","review":"Imagine a book, half set in Italy, about a younger man's relationship with a (famous) older man, with a silly mother figure who weeps constantly and finds out her son is gay when she looks under the bed...Sound good so far? Thought not. It seemed to me that Leavitt thought he'd better write a book called The Page Turner before anybody else did, then pretended to himself that any old story would do.Very nearly a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brush makes a dandy potatoe scrubber","review":"Bought this to clean inner chamber and grill of my Infrared Charbroil 'BigEasy SRG.'Char Broil Big Easy Infrared Smoker, Roaster, and Grill.

She is shown to be dogmatic and narrow minded - and the mud sticks. Gilmour relentlessly chips away at the lies and half-truths of the Thatcher years - leaving the bare bones of failed policies and missed chances. Thatcherism is exposed as a historical anomaly - with no basis in the Conservative party of the UK but more in common with the US republican party. History has shown this book to be correct in a lot of it's assertions, particulary where it states that Thatcherism in fact never had a hold on the hearts of the majority of the British public - a fact born out by the speedy marginalisation of her since then. This book is one to make British right wingers squirm - and quite justifiably so. It is time to set the record straight, without the help of the Murdoch press."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Liberal whining","review":"If you are a member of the Labour Party, this book is for you.

I consider myself a good cook, but these recipes are too much work for me.In the last section of the book, the author notes that her son \\"lived on 'take-out' for 6 months\\" and said, \\"Mom, I know your food is good.

Her tomato dishes have taken me on a Journey far beyond the boredom of salads. Now when I see plum tomatoes in the grocery, I'm eager to roast or smoke them.

I guess at the time it was considered gritty but now it seems a very stylized, almost phony, grittiness. Brando does his Method acting thing and he's brilliant of course but the dialogue he's given is for the most part, horrendous. Brando doesn't have the benefit of Tennessee Williams' talents here as he did in Streetcar Named Desire. The dialogue creaks along with a lot of embarassingly bad speeches that seem unlikely to occur on the docks. Both Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint give wooden performances.

It was so powerful, so real - it went straight to my heart. The emotions it evoked then have never left me. Reading the other reviews was helpful as far as how others enjoy this film today.

There are many scenes in this film which are classics and will stay with the viewer. The story is fast paced and climactic scene on the dock is one of the best endings ever.

I'll buy this DVD as soon as a widescreen version is released.In reply to the person who said that the studios should release it in color: the filmmakers made an artistic decision. Releasing this in color would obscure the striking contrasts, make the dark lighter, etc. It's okay to release goofy, fun b&w; musicals in color, but I don't think it would be okay for On the Waterfront.Marlon Brando is very intense in OtW, definitely among the top 3 acting performances I've ever seen.

If you have a huge room - go for it, but if the room you put it in is small - think twice - this thing is relatively huge.Pump - if you don't have an air pump in your house- you should buy one. Manual is OK, but it will take you 20+ minutes to blow all of the different sections of this thing. Manual pumps go for 5-7 bucks in your local drug store.In summary - the toy is OK if you have a enough space, can ventilate the smell, and buy a pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and fun","review":"After reviewing several ball pits, we chose the Sesame Street Ball Pit for our 19 month old; mainly because it had Elmo, was a decent size (although it's rather large once it's set up), and was under $40 with shipping. My son loves the ball pit. He jumps through the back doorway and side opening. He plays with the basketball hoop and push-through hole, and buries himself in the balls. There is not a slide which was listed on Amazon's description. Although we have a lot of fun with the pit, there are some drawbacks. Namely: it comes with only 75 balls (200-300 more fills it nicely), it is constructed of cheaper plastic, and the blow-up rails bend down so our son can jump in or out where he's not supposed to (he loves it...I have to correct him).

I reccomend getting a ball tent we had it for 3 years prior to buying this one and after alot of company and 3 kids in and out of it it broke but it is worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for playdates!","review":"My son is 10 mos and he loves it. However, this one is wayyyy over-priced and I don't know why. It is 100$ cheaper where I bought it! We love it b/c now we can entertain kids up to 4 yo. It is very nice. It doesn't keep the air in for more than a week, but for the price, it has to be expected (I mean not 140$ though). We did have to buy another 200 balls to make it even better. The bottom is hard but he doesn't mind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy this item","review":"I purchased this item fo my 14 month old who loves balls. After nearly an hour of blowing to get it inflated the back portion of the structure began to deflate. This product did come with a patch kit so I assume that this is very common. I did not expect it to deflate or spring a leak before my son could even play with it. The structure is so big that it is very difficult to locate an air leak. The leak was so small that I could not find it. I just took it down. Waste of money if you want a well crafted and non problematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun","review":"My Son liked the sesame ball pit, I think its a very fun toy for him to play in.He has a lot of fun, the only 2 down falls is that it needs to come with more balls, It doesnt come with enough,also the other thing is that you would need a pump to inflate it. It does take forever by mouth.But other than that its a great gift for kids who like jumping in balls,Like my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"I agree with a previous review, this ball pit will NOT STAY INFLATED! My kids had barely played with it and it started tearing and getting small, unrepairable holes in it. This is also a very small ball pit.

This was a very disappointing purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"We recieved this as a gift for our 4yr and 18 month old.

I was annoyed the bootom was only attached at the front and back so the balls kept spilling out the bottom sides,but he loved it so oh well. 2 weeks later it deflated in one of the front chambers and was all lopsided and would fall on him. We tried every night for a week to find the hole. We patched two areas at the seams where it was the potential culprit but it did no good. It was put in the trash while he was sleeping. So it was a huge waste of money and a heartbreaker"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I was looking for a bouncer/ball pit which I can fill up with balls and have my daughter and if possible a couple of friends play in it. After I inflated, I saw that it is much much smaller then the pictures show. If you have a 2-3 year old and if you put her/him in...the whole thing gets filled up and there is not much playing or jumping or anything can be done. This unit is also very unstable and it can easily tip over. There are just 3 characters of Sesame street on it and nothing more. This seems like as waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"My daughter loves Elmo so I had to get this for her!We got it, blew it up(that took for ever) and she was so excited to see it. First off there is NO slide, why call it a slide? Next after playing in it for an hour I noticed that the front was collapsing. I inflated it again, an hour later it was deflated again.

It took forever to inflate and then we realized it had a hole it it, the repair patch it came with did not work. I called and had a replacement sent only to receive it to find upon inflating that it had a hole in it almost in the exact same place as the first one.

It was one of the largest I had seen, came with the accessory balls and was adorable with the Sesame Street theme. It turned out to be the biggest disappointment! Not only was it very poorly constructed, it seemed that once the ball pit was inflated (which was a job in itself) it just as quickly deflated. Also, the seams literally fell apart (and this was supposed to handle a 2-3 year old?). And while the picture featured this ball pit full of balls - the 75 it came with didn't even come close to covering the bottom! The ball pit only lasted 1 day - I would think twice before considering this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upset Grandma","review":"I sent this item to my grandson for the holidays although very cute, it was a waste of time and money to order this.

The 75 ball that comes with this toy didn't even cover the bottom of the ball pit, I bought an extra 100 balls and didn't to make any difference. It takes at least 300-400 balls to make it fun.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"A stylish, quiet and intense thriller which ends up, quite surprisingly, being about the duplicity we will undertake to protect our families. Full-time mother, Margaret Hall (Tilda Swinton) finds herself disposing of a body and frantically trying to raise $50,000 in 24 hours to protect her son, Beau, whom she suspects not only of murder but also of hiding his homosexual relationship with the victim. Tilda Swinton gives a superb performance of controlled panic and motherly angst, Goran Visnjic is perfectly ambiguous as the morally-fraught blackmailer, and Jonathan Tucker is hugely convincing as the son concealing his sexuality despite the awful tension this lie creates. My only reservation is that the lack of a final \\"coming out\\" scene in which that tension is broken and the family unified might suggest, to some viewers, that Beau's dishonesty is justified - like his mother's concealment, it successfully holds the family together."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Deep End","review":"The movie had a great foundation but was lost in stupidity. I ended up hating the stupid control freak mother, vapid grandfather, puny hit henchman...; What little scenery I saw was great. All through the movie, I wanted to slap most of the characters, especially the mother and tell her to wake up and get real. The only real characters were the son's lover, the little kids, and the money-grubbing really bad guy. She hadn't the guts to tell the naval operator that her call was an emergency just to get through to her husband so he could help her do his job in raising the kids (no wonder he was on a destroyer). I could have done a better job in writing this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow - What an awful movie.","review":"I honestly couldn;t believe how bad this movie was. Based entirely on bad coincidences. My favorite was when the grandfather has a heart attack exactly when the blackmail guy walks in . . . he of course saves the day. Naturally, she falls in love with him. What's a girl to do . . . I know I love a guy who threatens my family and extorts money from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and well acted movie.","review":"This movie is for anyone looking for excellent acting and a compelling story about an ordinary, yet extraordinary, mother. This is not for those who need car chases and explosions to enjoy a movie. That is not to say that this movie is without violence. It depicts violence and physical tension, but inflicted upon a normal family rather than upon members of a gang or the mob or any other group that violence usually follows. The movie compells the viewer ask, \\"What would I do if this happened to me?\\"One thing to watch out for is the character development of the supporting actors. The movie mainly involves a mother, her son and a blackmailer. But, the writer and/or director take full advantage of the limited periods of the film depicting the other characters to give a full, believable picture of the family involved.All in all, an enjoyable and quality movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in the Water","review":"This is a rare occasion where I disagree with Roger Ebert.

Frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Thrill-less Thriller","review":"After the much heralded positive reiviews of \\"The Deep End\\" I was expecting a taut, suspenseful thriller with academy-award worthy performances. Instead I found a slowly-paced, contrived potboiler that plodded along until it thankfully finished. Tilda Swinton's \\"subtle\\" performance is so stoic and wooden, that it is difficult to feel compassion for her character - a trait which is necessary for you to empathize with her plight throughout the film. Instead she comes across as a woman hopelessly disconnected with her family, unable to communicate with them even in times of emergency, and remarkably stupid. This is not a woman you feel sorry for as she creates as many problems for her family than resolves them. I am sure the original film, directed by Max Ophuls and starring Joan Bennet and James Mason is far superior to this poorly-executed retread."},{"rating":"2","title":"SERIOUS DRAMA","review":"I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED, ESPECIALLY WITH THE ENDING.

BUT I FELT THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH TO BACK UP THE PLOT. THE HIGHLIGHT IN THE FILM FOR ME WAS WHEN \\"TILDA, EXPLAINS HOW IT'S LIKE TO BE A MOTHER WITH RESPONSIBILITIES, HOW HARD IT IS TO COLLECT $50.000.

First of all it is absolutely beautiful to look at. Tahoe and water water everywhere - all sumptuously photographed.The story is an emotionally intense rollercoaster of the lengths a mother will go to protect her children. Intense, often suspensful and sometimes creepy, this is a keeper.Swinton is amazing here - like one raw jangling nerve. SHe is amazing to watch. The rest of the cast is fine their roles, whether shady, clueless or sympathetic.Well worth a view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swinton's character [stunk]","review":"This plot didn't seem at all believeable and wasn't very interesting. Both the mother and son are idiots and -- if you actually watch the entire film (an unwelcome chore) -- you become infuriated at their inane and completely unsympathetic behavior as a family that specializes in NONcommunication. Swinton's character should be brought up on charges, not because she hid a body, but because any child who lived in a household with such an illogical and fragmented woman would either limp through life or cast off the family altogether.When I think \\"film noir,\\" I usually think \\"interesting characters\\" or \\"interesting plot,\\" not \\"mind-numbingly stupid characters who should be shot.\\" This movie attempts to cast the \\"stupid\\" definition on the entire genre, much like a sequel can occasionally be so bad that it taints your experience of the great movie that preceded it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible: Bad Acting and Awful Script","review":"I expected this to be an exciting mystery thriller.

The acting was terrible. The actors seemed to be reading their one liners from the cue cards. If I didn't know better I would say they all neede to go back to acting school. They made a bad decision making this film it stinks. They had no inflection of charcter in any of the lines they read.

Runelore provides a much more historically based arguement for the cultic use of runes than any other work currently available. There is ample historical backing to his other arguements, and they are concise and clearly presented. Thorsson is well beyond the \\"Blank Rune\\" or \\"Celtic Rune\\" level that other \\"Runesters\\" wallow in, though his Ogham book perhaps stretched it a bit. In this book, Thorsson may have carried his Odhinn centered tendencies a bit too far, even going contrary to the evidence in declaring Loki, Baldr, and Heimdal to be hypostases of Odhinn. However, Runelore should be interesting even to Teutonic Historians, as Thorsson can safely speculate beyond the limits of scholarly propriety, and therefore show us how the ancient Germans may have actually percieved the Universe"},{"rating":"2","title":"A indepth reader","review":"This book is not for the light hearted, it is very detailed in the mystery of the runa and the gods that made and worked them. Some think this work is satanic and if your not used to the myths of the old gods or if your biased in belief of religion you may think that.Edred is a scholar in the ancient ways of the germanic tribes and although this book is PACKED with information he can be long winded sometimes.Covers everything from the origins of the runes to creating your own runes and spells.So if you want to do some serious reading and thinking this is the book, if you want a light over view youl be better off passing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beat Me!!!","review":"Excellent mixes, soul-stirring deep beats, a certain elegance to it all - but the song selections aren't 5 star...The CD starts off beautifully with \\"Set Me Free\\" and \\"Feel You\\" then wanders off a bit.

I am a long time fan and will admit that I had to work at the last album, but I have to say that he finally may have come to the end of his career. His voice even sounds a bit strained on this album and the songs are way too fluffy and trite. I went intothe purchase knowing that I was losing out, but aside from a few numbers (Union Jack) this album is not worth much.

If you're already a fan, then I guess there are 1 or 2 half decent tracks. If you found Billy by accident by hearing the Mermaid Ave records, then buy any other of his great CDs, especially Don't Try This At Home. If you get a chance to see him live, then do so--he is a great performer. Also check out the web site Billy Bragg.com for tour dates, record releases and chat about Billy.

Sir More felt strongly enough about his convictions to leave his office and the power that went along with it so that he could remain loyal to his God. This version of the story does it great justice, showing Henry VIII for the tyrant he really was (although one who could be charming when he wanted to be) and the characters he surrounded himself with.

I felt that the whole plot was boring. The actors who portrayed the characters did a wonderful job. However, the movie was relevant to what I just learned in Morality, which was conscience. The movie shows how courageous Thomas More was to refuse the oath of the King, and not go against his conscience. If I had to choose a favorite character it would be Thomas More. He was an honest, moral man who stayed with what he believed was right. He depicts a good example of how people should act.

You get a story that plainly spells out a specific moral dilemma and shows how it plays out among the characters, and the tragedy that ensues.

The performances are so astonishing, you completely forget that you have seen most of the performers many other times, because it is impossible to disassociate them from these characters and this time period. The cinematography, the set design, the score, the lighting, the costume design, all are absolutely extraordinary.Granted, this film is not for everyone.

When Richard Rich decides to betray More to Cromwell, Cromwell says, \\"That wasn't so hard, was it? And it will be easier next time.\\" How true. The first step to sin is the hardest - each one after that gets easeir. After viewing the movie I am inspired to first consider God's view of my actions instead of just taking the easiest course. All that said, I think it would take a very righteous person to hold to their convictions to the extent that More did. The movie was not only inspiring, it was well acted (it wouldn't have been inspiring otherwise), and the costumes were well done. It is definitely not a 'Die Hard' action movie, but it does move along and is not preachy. It tells the story of a man and how he lived and died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"A classic. I could watch it over and over again. Period dramas are one of my favorites.

Thomas More in fact hated and betrayed many, putting his prejudices to evil work, ordering the torture and burning alive of men whose only crimes were disagreeing with his theology. One victim was tortured in More's garden with leather straps tied around his head and tightened until blood came from his eyes, then tortured further on the rack before being burned alive. Rather than Thomas More, his victims deserve praise, for their courage and sacrifice for the sake of simple faith and truth. For some real history (not Hollywood!) consider reading David Daniell's life of Tyndale, the courageous and brilliant scholar and translator of the Bible into English, for a fascinating picture of the greatness of one man whom More chose to hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but a caution...","review":"Excellent acting.

The actors performance in this film was believable and made it visible for me to see what a moral man, and a loyal servent to God More was, and how he really lived. The staging of the film was very well done and the actors really played their parts well. After seeing this movie, I have more of an understanding on what a strong person Thomas More was, and how much faith he had in God"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film - a true classic","review":"This is an old film (1966) - I recall seeing it in theaters back then.The film won 6 Academy Awards, and it is well worth viewing today. Thomas More is depicted as a man of integrity, good-judgment and wit. The serious nature of the film is balanced with scenes of humor.Video quality is excellent - well-done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Integrity For All Seasons","review":"A Man For All Seasons is a marvelous period film driven by Robert Bolt's trenchant script and superb acting by Paul Scofield playing Sir Thomas Moore who must by conscience oppose the desires of King Henry the VIII (played by Robert Shaw). It is the only film in my memory that depicts the virtue of integrity with such poigancy that you'll take a look at yourself and wonder how firmly you would hold on to your beliefs when faced with dire consequences if they were asserted. You'll want to see the film repeatedly to savor its intelliegence, crisp direction by Fred Zinneman, and authentic looking sets and costumes. Among the film's gems is the music (I don't think it was ever released on cd). Undoubtedly the film is not entirely historically accurate but it does make it eminently clear what a man of integrity can be. A Man For All Seasons richly deserved the 6 Oscars it captured including best film of 1966."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic tale of a man doing the right thing, and getting screwed in the end","review":"Sir Thomas More, the lead character does exactly as his conscience demands, and does so with integrity and political caution, yet ends up being executed at the hands of King Henry VIII.The performances are Oscar worthy, and Robert Bolt's collaboration on the film ensures that the film stays true to the intent of the play he wrote.I use this film in my High School English course, both as an example of literature on screen, and to help students understand the political culture of the 16th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot hear a sample, therefore will never purchase,","review":"Impossible to rate because I cannot hear samples.

Canon's tech support responded quickly, but the suggestions do not solve the problem. Canon's final advice: take it in to be serviced.

I recently started using an off brand ink carts and had good results until the black stopped working. I deep cleaned and aligned the heads, tried everything to clean the clog, but no luck. I thought the non-Canon inks caused the problem but reading from these posts it looks like a weak print head design was the cause.

It also flashes a red lit up time screen when it is beeping. It's like having an emergency vehicle in your bedroom. I also used to have a travel alarm clock where you could set the minutes between the snooze alarms, but this only gives you a two minutes maybe before it starts loudly beeping and flashing red again.

The unit keeps time very well, and doesn't get slow or fast at any point. Batteries last forever in this thing, despite me replacing them time and time again. Why would I do that, you ask?The digits on the clock face are illegibly soft and faded. You have to tilt the unit at an almost 90 degree angle to get the numbers to show up visibly enough for you to discern which numbers they actually ARE. Considering I can't reach it sometimes (y'know, because I'm in bed, or across the room), this is a bit of a flaw.

Then the batteries died, so I replaced them, but after two days the backlight stopped working, the numbers faded to the point where I could barely see them, and the volume became so low I could barely hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarm Flashes Red!","review":"I bought this alarm a few months ago. Since then i've gone back and read more reviews to see if i missed something somewhere. But nowhere, not in the description, not in the reviews, did i read that when the alarm goes off the display flashes RED. I have to say, it's quite disconcerting at \\"oh goodness-thirty\\" in the morning! Because of this, my search for a new alarm continues.On the plus side, i had no other issues with it and i didn't waste too much money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big, not loud enough","review":"The controls are good and I like the way the display lights up when you press the snooze light. But this is not really a good travel alarm, it is too big and clunky. And the alarm is not very loud. I bought this clock because some of the other reviews said that the alarm was loud, but it is not. It might work as a regular bedside alarm if you are a light sleeper. I ended up buying a little Casio travel alarm, it is so much better, much smaller size and loud alarm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light does not work","review":"I had read the reviews about this Elgin Travel Alarm Clock, but it was cheap enough I thought I would give it a try inspite of the reviews. Plus it was cheap enough that if it didn't work, I would have spent more time and money to send it back so I had decided in advance to live with it and chalk it up to a lesson learned. Besides, I had a similar model made by Timex that lasted a long time. Question: Where has Timex gone?So now, I will live with it but I will warn others!As soon as I put the batteries in, I found out the light doesn't work. I bought this model specifically for the light! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only snoozes 4 times","review":"It only snoozes 4 times. After that, it just doesn't wake up again.

Seems like it will last for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex travel alarm clock...","review":"...sold at Walmart for about nine bucks is identical to this watch except for a more squarish shaped case and snooze button. Funny that they rebadged it as \\"Elgin\\" and sell it here, maybe the \\"Timex\\" version is a Walmart exclusive?Anyways, I quite like it...folds up easily, and best of all the alarm starts out gentle then gets more insistent. I was used to a much shriller and louder alarm, on my Casio analog travel clock which I've gotten rid of because of its loud ticking. Am glad that it uses an easily replaceable AAA battery.My only reservation about this clock is the slider switch for setting the time, alarm time and alarm on/off seems too flimsy...hope it holds up! Also when you press the Snooze/Light button there is a slight humming noise while the light is on...no biggy, just kind of tacky."},{"rating":"1","title":"It nice, but","review":"For the most part, I like the alarm clock. It's easily programed, doesn't have odd battery requirements. Alarm noise is annoying enough to get me moving. The 2 things I don't care for; 1 - the Indiglo feature is fine for seeing the time, but it felects badly off the not lit face plate & makes it difficult to see those details (ie, I want to change the alarm time without turning the light on and waking up my husband); 2 - the cover for the batteries comes off with very little effort, so when I'm fumbling to turn of the alarm (I'm half blind w/o my glasses) I knock the battery cover off & have to reset the whole thing. Duct Tape does seem to have served it's purpose once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed...","review":"This little clock was exactly what I expected and seems to work fine, so far. The blue backlight is nice. One small complaint - I don't think QA is tops on the list with the maufacturer - on mine, the snooze button is upside down! It still works, just looks a bit odd. But what can you expect for the price?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Good Alarm","review":"A good, simple alarm, easy to set and read.

It does tell time though and the alarm seems to work ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elgin Travel Clock","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for in a travel clock. Easy to use and with the tap of the snooze button the time lights up just long enough to get the time. The alarm is efficient. Light weight and easy to pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Travel Alarm","review":"I wanted a simple travel alarm that would be SURE to wake me up and is reasonably priced. This is EXACTLY what I wanted! I odered two. I especially like the cover; it covers the control buttons but leaves the display visible. The slider switch is a bit flimsy, but it works just fine. The 4 minute snooze is not adjustable, but it is good for traveling - you really do need to get up when the alarm goes off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this alarm clock. The alarm does not work...no sound. This was the entire reason I made the purchase. So, now I just have a clock. The light doesn't work either.

This is a piece of junk. I am surprised Amazon would sell this clock it is such poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Junk","review":"It worked only once when received it. Next day took it on trip and did not work since then. The LED light did not work (can't read time in the dark) and the alarm did not work either.

I was desperately looking for something NOT made in China, which is pretty impossible. The first time I let it go... but because the first one i ordered is not reliable, because some times it doesn't go off, and I desperately need to wake up very early in the AM for training, as I am an athlete, So i bought this crappy one as back up. It doesn;t work. I have tried 8 sets of brand new batteries, i can BARELY read the time on it, it doesn't lit up, the alarm doesn't go off... don't buy this garbage!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor snoozing resulted in return","review":"This little alarm clock is OK but there are 2 main flaws with it. First and foremost I sleep deeply and snooze a lot before finally waking. This clock only allows 4 snoozes, 4 minutes apart, before the alarm just stops going off. Also, when you have a travel alarm clock with a fold over cover like this please put a gap and a slight hole so the snooze button can be hit immediately without opening the cover. My girlfriend has an alarm clock almost identical to this from Timex that has long since been discontinued and it handles all these feature perfectly. You'd think something so simple would be easy to find. Hopefully they improve this one someday. In all other ways the clock was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China has caught up to us!","review":"My Timex Indiglow travel alarm finally died, so I bought this Elgin clockSPECIFICALLY because it had the blue light feature. I need to be able to hit the sleep-button and see the time at night. Right out of the box, everything worked EXCEPT the blue light.I will be returning it for a refund. Amazon is great! Crap made in China isn't!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Received this as a Christmas gift. It worked fine, but 10 months later there was no backlight and the alarm didn't work.

Would not order again."},{"rating":"1","title":"mine broke day two","review":"mine broke day two. on day one, it didn't keep time for a while but later on in the day, after resetting time, it kept time okay. on day two, it only backlit a slight amount and i could not see the display (time numbers). using brand new out of the pack batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Plastic","review":"I purchased this because I wanted an alarm that did not need to be plugged into the wall, but I was disappointed with how cheap the plastic is. Looks and feels junky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will wake only the lightest sleeper","review":"Hve not tried it at wakeup but can tell by testing I would sleep right through it.

Does flash red during the wakeup sound but if your asleep I don't think that is a big deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good light","review":"Doesn't blind you in the middle of the night.

I've read most of the previous reviews and I agree whole-heartedly with generally all of them. Except, that I actually do have a VHS copy of this movie. I believe my mother bought it for me many years ago as an x-mas present and I've treasured it ever since. I think I have memorized every line, but have NEVER tired of it. I didn't realize it was so hard to find. But I am looking for the soundtrack! Let me know if anyone out there can locate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Woody!","review":"Most reviewers have already done a great job critiquing one of Allen's best. I have to add this movie has one of my favorite lines in a movie...it is actually profound. Michael Caine is contemplating what in the world to do about his marriage and his affair with his wife's sister...He states, roughly:(not exact quote)\\"With all my education, with all my success, I can't fathom my own heart.\\"That pretty much sums up the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to know Woody","review":"My wife is the real Woody Allen fan, but about the 4th time I watched this movie I REALLY enjoyed it.

I really thought that it was going to be a great movie, but it wasn't for me. I really wish I could get those two hours I spent watching this train wreck back. I say if your interested in purchasing a Woody Allen film rented it first, then buy it if you like it. Just because it's a Woody Allen movie doesn't mean it's a great movie not all of his movies are gems.

No widescreen, sub-standard pan-and-scan print, lack of any quality extras (and this was a 2nd release of this film!) sounds like a VHS review---perhaps these reviews are for that. DVD means widescreen---period! With the exception of the older movies that were filmed in fullscreen (i.e. \\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"On The Water Front\\" -- two well-made DVDs btw) no movie, not a one, should be released if there isn't a widescreen version on it---certainly a movie shouldn't ever be released TWICE with both versions fullscreen.... Rumor has it that they have been unable to find a useable widescreen version of this film (hard to believe isn't it?) to use for a DVD, but in that case be up front about it and quit releasing this POS version on DVD---do it a third time and heads will roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie !","review":"One of my all time favorites!

Not the same as watching it when you were 10 years old but still a great flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"to be re-released as a box set?","review":"Now that none of the K2's are available, I can only assume the studio that has distributor rights to the series (Columbia/Tristar) will probably re-release all three or four films as a box set. Is that a good thing? Considering the first two are of any relevance, its a good way for the studios to recover any money for the last two. This is simlar to how 'Back to the Future' and the 'Pink Panthers' have been re-released. Let's hope the studio releases K-Kid I in widescreen and with additional content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat really deserved his 'Oscar'!","review":"'Karate Kid' is not just an entertaining classic for the young at hearts, it's a lesson for a lifetime, this touching, funny and dramatic movie is a portait of a shy newcomer boy, who must face the big bullies from his school in a karate tournament, with help from his master, the scene-stealing Mr. Miyagi, and they become friends of a lifetime.This is one of the classic feel good movies you will stand up and cheer for."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected","review":"If you were born around the 77-80's then you'll remember this movie for sure. Nice recopilation of interviews, you will know some facts that you never imagined. Do you know who was the first option for Miyagi San?? Who trainned the actors? How do you hate John Kreese?

I'm biased. I love this film. To me, it's a bit like Jaws, in that, it created or expanded on a genre so much, that it became a sort of cultural icon. As a consequence, people have forgotten just how powerful the film is as a stand-alone film. Everyone thinks of this movie in terms of cliches, but it really is an exceptionally-well done piece of work. I still fell that Pat Morita was robbed of the Best Supporting Actor award in '84. The \\"drunk\\" scene is exceptional. Those familiar with the film will agree. Do yourself a favor and rent or buy this terrific little movie. Oh, Bill Conti's score is surprisingly effective, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Karate Kid is great.","review":"Ir's true, the Karate Kid is great. this movie really puts it all into perspective. yo yo yo uh uh um uh"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!","review":"This is another all time favorite.

After not have seen the movie since my younger days , it brought back the memories of how my friends and I would play kung-fu and one of us would use that infamous kick stance that never was effective . Anyways, this movie struck the days of innocents for me and reminded me of patience and it's virtues. Definitely an must-have to add to your karate flick collection !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun For All Ages","review":"This is a film that anyone from 5 to 55 can watch. Macchio plays Daniel LaRusso, a teen who moves from the streets of Newark to the sunny streets of Southern California. He encounters fun at first, the beach, ball games, and a girl, but then bullies. He is beat up multiple times by lead bad guy Johnny (William Zabka-Just One of the Guys) and his band of Cobra Kai's. Mr. Miyage played well by Pat Morita comes to Daniel's aid and Daniel begs him to teach him karate. The drama climaxes with a karate tournament where Daniel faces just about all the guys who beat him up earlier in the film. The ending is predictable but the movie is still a lot of fun. When it came out, i was about 8 and it is still fun to watch to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing, Exciting Movie!","review":"I LOVE this movie!

Gotta carefully look at all of them. You'll be surprised!!This is such a great movie!! Whoever says that it follows the same storyline as Rocky... well not really! The only similar event would be the big showdown at the end. Besides that... most of the movies are way different.I always get goosbumps when lil' Daniel beats Ali in a game of Hockey. You can see the pure look of joy when he scores the goal!!Das my boy!!!!Hieu <with a 'U'> Nguyen"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. I really mean that. It's a perfect masterpiece. The acting is immeasurably good. The score is also beatiful with the use of the pan flute. The Karate Kid II is probably the only other movie that has affected me this much. I hope they release Karate Kid II on DVD soon. I'll definitely buy it. BTW, does anyone when and where I can get the score music to the karate kid? Also, what is that piece that is playing when Daniel is practicing his balance in the ocean. It sounds like a famous classical piece, but it's not listed in the credits. It's possible that it was scored for the film, but I'm not sure about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transfer quality","review":"Please note...this review is for the quality of the transfer of the original film to DVD. It is awful! It almost seems they used a low resolution camcorder and recorded it from a movie theater screen. The thousands of black specks in the blue sky at the very beginning of the movie were very obtrusive. If you have a high resolution television it will only make the inferior quality of this DVD more noticeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No widescreen?!?!?!","review":"What's the deal releasing this movie on full screen? It's a classic film that I've seen about 100 times but I will not be buying this DVD, until it gets what it deserves. Widescreen, commentaries, deleted scenes? Come on, I expect so much more. Until then I'll stick with my VHS copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Karate Kid","review":"This was a gift for a grandson. He is happy with the movie as I thought he would be.

Second major disappointment is that there are NO special features at all (I know, we're getting spoiled). Audio selection is also limited. I might has well have purchased the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be Widescreen!!","review":"This is a great movie and is well deserving of a widescreen presentation, fully restored and with commentary. It is what I believe one of the best movies of the 1980's and it is a shame that in a time when so many mediocre movies are given the star treatment in the DVD world, this one is so unbelievably substandard. I will not buy this movie until it is on widescreen at the very least. Give this movie and its' fans a break! Do it right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Dvd Quality","review":"Great movie. However the dvd transfer is poorly done. Only has dolby surround. And only available in fullscreen.

What a relief it was to be able to sit down and watch a movie with my grandson and not have to put my hands over his eyes because of scenes not appropriate for his viewing.

It was a nice family afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I'm a big fan of Mike Allred's work, particularly his early Graphic Muzik stuff, which is where the G-Men From Hell first debuted. That said, I didn't really love this movie, and if you're not previously familiar with the G-Men in comic form, I can't imagine you'd like this movie at all. Despite its low budget, it really had some recognizable actors, I'll give it that. But the plot seemed muddled and the film and sound quality, or lack thereof, didn't help either. Plus, what the heck was the point of Cheetah Man? He did nothing in the film. Listening to Mike Allred's commentary was odd because he's apparently completely oblivious to the movie's problems, apparently loving every frame of the film. Perhaps it's because it's a movie of his characters. I suppose that would make me like it more, too. But alas, they aren't my characters and I didn't. Just read Madman comics instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for the garden","review":"I purchased this as a replacement for a broken pair of pruners, and I am glad I made this choice.

Here we have the Duke Ellington Orchestra at its peak. Ray Nance had just joined the band and immediately made his presence felt on trumpet and violin. Jimmie Blanton was the first great bassist and Ellington uses him to great advantage. All the Ellington stars shine here including Lawrence Brown, Barney Bigard, Ben Webster, Johnny Hodges and Harry Carney to name a few. Of course, the sound is only fair but the greatness of the band comes through. A must for Ellington fans and recommended for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak contemporary gospel album...","review":"I was around 8 years old when I first heard this album. It's a really bad album technically, William Becton cannot sing, the contemporary gospel attempts are half hearted at best...but it's still nostalgic listening to this at 20 years old now. It's so bad it's good (or at least it brings back memories for me). Nobody's probably going to buy this album at this point for reasons other than the fact that they heard it way back when and want to hear it again just to remember how bad it was. I mean, he tried to do a Be Encouraged Remix! Epic fail!

The musicianship is excellent, except for the fact that the bass is buried in the mix. (That seems to be the way John Myung likes it!) There is a lot of variety here: some instrumentals, some pop songs, and Willie Brown - a song that starts off with a killer 9/8 riff! Highly recommended. This CD practically camped out in my CD player when it first came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Of all the albums I bought in 2000, this is the one I keep coming back to. It has it all: monster rock grooves, awesome vocal harmonies, tight songwriting, cool themes, and complex Dregs-like instrumentals. As such, it is wildly inconsistent: the vocal songs are VERY hooky and melodic and awesome; but the long, proggy instrumentals are excellent in a different way. This makes for tough going if you are not used to listening to different styles of music. But if you are enlightened, and like the Dregs and/or King's X (not much Dream Theater influence apparent), you'll dig this one. By the way, this disc contains what may possibly be the best rock song ever recorded: Standing in Line. It's a short little number that takes no prisoners, has an incredible hook, and it absolutely KICKS. Check out the snippet online and see for yourself. Too bad the follow-up album didn't have anything like Standing in Line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers Beware","review":"This fridge was bought at toysrus. You CAN NOT, have this unit plugged in for more than 10 hours. The reason I know this now, is because we bought this fridge for our office to store milk for our coffee station, and it started to leak. So we took out the instructions, and it specifically says you can not run this fridge for more than 10 hours or you will cause damage and breakage.

I kept comparing Whitney to Rasheed Clark's Sista in his book. With that book, you felt like you knew the people involved. At times, I kept thinking who acts like this when reading about Charisse. I want to say this book is good but that's like listening to Luther Vandross and then hearing somebody try that same song. You like the remake but having had something more original, I felt that way about this book. I suggest you pick up a copy of \\"Stories I Wouldn't Tell Nobody But God.\\" You will be glad you did.

Follow Whitney, Taylor, and Charisse as they muddle through life as an overweight sister in search of love, an upwardly mobile sister in pursuit of a husband, and an abusive wife/mother in the grips of instability.The story was predictable; nothing ground-breaking here. The writing style made this one very easy to read. I guess if you're looking for some lightweight fluff to get wrapped in, then this is for you.I'd actually give it 2.5 stars.

The actors are mediocre at best. Roles like Hilda miscast. Nothing against the actress in this role but she seems old enough to be Connie's mother rather than sister.

This man couldn't direct a scene to save his life. Many scenes seem uneven and look like they only took one take. All the scenes look dark, dirty, and cloudy.The second problem is the acting. Jodie Foster gives a southern accent a good try, but lets not fool ourselves. Then there is everyone's favorite, Hannibal Lector. When he talks to Jodie, he stares at her with INTENSE EYES.

I'm sure he wouldn't have taken the role had it not shown promise of an academy award nomination.

This is a five star movie and my two star rating applies only to the Blu-ray transfer. I have the Criterion Collection Edition of this movie. In comparing the Blu-ray edition and the Criterion DVD edition, I found the Blu-ray edition to have a less appealing color palette. It is somewhat bluish, less saturated, and sometimes looks magenta. The Criterion edition has an overall warmer tone. The movie itself also does not seem to benefit all that much from the higher resolution transfer either. I don't know if it's the definition of the film or if the transfer wasn't well done.

Anthony Hopkins is unbeleivably perfect for his part, and a great actor. He plays Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist cannibal. He has been caught though, and FBI agent Clarice Starling needs his genius criminal mind to catch one. It will suprise you with unbeleivably creative things.

From the moment the disc is read by your DVD player, you will be captivated by the start-up menu, with the fluttering of moth wings that move about your surround system, to the cries of Catherine in the background, begging for help from the bottom of the well. I had goosebumps all over again. The FBI reference files were a nice touch, showing Thomas Harris' in-depth research into actuall case files, stemming back to his days as a crime reporter before becoming a successful novelist. If you're looking forward to the sequel based on the latest Harris installation, \\"Hannibal\\", then you might want to brush up with this \\"monster\\" in the mean time. It's worth the slightly higher price of it's predecessor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Silence of the Lambs - Criterion Collection - DVD","review":"I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater but the Criterion Collection DVD was very disappointing. The so-called deleted scenes in the DVD were very poorly done and were in fact not deleted in the original theatrical release, but left out of all the home versions. The commentary track, recorded 3 years after the movie came out, was overly analytical. None of the extras in the Criterion DVD make it worth the extra money. The cheaper Image Entertainment DVD has closed captioning and keeps the original, thought-provoking cover art. Of the 3 versions I've seen, the VHS tape is the best value for money.

It really makes you think. Anthony Hopkins is superb! He relishes in playing his memorable crazy yet softspoken British villain. Jodie Foster is brilliant as Agent Starling, and the rest of the cast is marvelous too. I especially enjoyed the scenes with Hannibal and Claric Starling. There is a chemistry between Hopkins and Foster, and they are perfect together on screen. I liked the scene where Hannibal escapes. It's violent, it's gory, and it's startling. The whole film has this essence of evil and gloom that makes it all the more memorable. Wonderful and well written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of the 90's","review":"This thriller proves to be a fully satisfying expierience. The actors are great, especially Anthony Hopkins as the chilling Dr. Lector, who may be the best murderer of this genre since pyscho. It is much better than your other run of the mill thrillers of the 90's. Namely, films like the Bone Collector, thanks to the Lector charachter. Because this film is top notch production.

The image suffers from waxy skin tones, excessive DNR noise reduction, excessive sharpening, black crush in near black ranges of the image and generally mediocre tone and detail. Of course it's \\"better\\" than a DVD, if only because what appears to be the same transfer used for the DVD benefits from the added bandwidth and resolution of Blu-Ray. But it appears to be the same mediocre source as originally made for the DVD, hardly up to the standards of new 2k and 4k masters mastered into AVC or VC-1 codec.

Ask any one who was in WWII or any off the other wars, and they'll tell you. That just proves that \\"reality\\" horror buff reviews aren't reliable, they are posers trying to sound intelligent, but to us real horror fans who don't care what kind of horror film it is, you sound stupid! This isn't scary, and that is the final word!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lambs' silence is interrupted only by audience's snores","review":"Anthony Hopkins is brilliant in his role as Dr. Hannibal \\"the cannibal\\" Lecter, the psychotic serial killer with a serious appetite. Unfortunately, the so-called thriller is one of the most overrated films of all time, scoring rave reviews and an Oscar to boot, and fails to live up to Hopkins' performance. Foster overacts like a good soap opera queen, and director Demme does not understand that pace is essential for a thriller. Although some shots are beautiful and grotesque at the same time (Lecter turns a bunch of police into angels by using their flesh as wings and such and hanging them), the plot is predictable, and worse yet-- slow-moving. Skip this one. Instead check out \\"Halloween\\", \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"Psycho\\", or \\"The Shining\\". Even \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" or \\"Scream\\" is more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick.","review":"When your blind friend, God rest his soul, advises you not to see a movie, listen to him! I sure wish I had. This movie did not give me as many night mares as Knight Moves did, but it lacked a good plot.There are cannibals in this world, but I do not see how following a psycho killer who also eats his victims is entertainment. In my opinion, there is nothing redeeming about this movie.My advice is to avoid it at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well made, well acted.","review":"But why glorify such subject matter?

I thought Jodie Foster did a great job playing Clarice Starling, and the film wouldn't be complete without one of the greatest actors of all time, Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. I've always been a fan of action/horror films of this kind that involve solving cases and almost real-life police work. You would be doing yourself a personal favor by owning this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, Scary, & Horrific!","review":"Jonathan Demme's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is simply put, one of the scariest movies of all time. The sequel to MANHUNTER, SILENCE...features top-notch acting, suspenseful moments, disturbing themes, & the horrific subject matter of serial killers.With a serial killer named \\"Buffalo Bill\\" on the loose, The FBI sends rookie agent Clarice Starling (played superbly by Jodie Foster) to ask convicted serial killer Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter (played with frightening intensity by Anthony Hopkins) for some insights on how to capture \\"Buffalo Bill\\" (Ted Levine in a disturbing performance). However, Hannibal plays a deadly cat & mouse game with Starling & eventually gets inside her head. With Hannibal inside her consciousness, Starling's world will never be the same.By all means, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a movie that deserves the praise it has recieved. Go get this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"The Silence of the Lambs is the scariest movie I have ever seen (although I have NOT seen \\"The Exorcist\\"). It is one of those stories that sucks you in from the very beginning. The imagery is very strong throughout the picture. The violence is intense, but definately not gratuitous. The final confrontation will shock you. This psychological thriller won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1991, and I can see why. Not to be missed! Bon Appetit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthony Hopkins' best performance since Psycho!","review":"I never thought he'd get any better than he was as Norman Bates in Psycho, but Hopkins is even better as Hannibal Lecter.Jodie Foster is great in this, too.

Young FBI trainee Clarice Starling(played by Jodi Foster) goes to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (played by Anthony Hopkins) to learn more about the serial killer Buffalo Bull. I think we all know the story, we have all seen the movie, but never has a movie had such an effect upon my mind.There were scenes of gore, but the psychlogical effect of this movie runs deep, perhaps it is because we know that there are people out there like Dr. Lecter who prey upon our loved ones.That is a scary thought! One that is always lingering in our minds even if we do not let it surface.The acting was excellent, the story line chilling and the conclusion outstanding! A great nail bitting movie right to the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"WOW!What an awesome movie!

Deleted scenes are always welcome in my book, and the FBI files and statements from actual serial killers are not something you see everyday.Of course, the movie is mindblowing! With superb performances by Hopkins and Foster leading the pack, and brilliant direction from Demme, this had to be one of the best films of the '90sWorth spending the extra money to get the DVD features!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Film of All Time","review":"I've always considered Anthony Hopkins to the best actor I have seen...until I saw how incredible Jodie Foster was in this film. She was always in close running with Hopkins, but I must say she has actually surpassed him a bit, in my humble opinion. The direction here is pitch perfect, the script is exciting, clever and undeniably heart-breaking. Hopkins and Ted Levine are chilling in very different and important ways. Foster, however, makes this entire film MEAN something. I can't imagine anyone else doing this role. I hope this movie is NEVER re-made. What could possibly be the point? Everyone involved with this film should be proud. I LOVE the sounds and the sets/costumes of the film, too. I know it's quite obvious that after this film there were a lot of serial killer themed films made, but check out how influential the look of this film has been on female \\"FBI Agent\\" types in movies.

One of the things that really stood out for me the first time I saw it was the acting job done by Ms. Foster in the basement, in the dark.

Although not for the faint of heart, this movie was not as gory as I had braced myself for. Most of the scares stem from Hannibal Lector's mannerisms and Buffalo Bill's creepy behavior between kills. The most shocking violence occurs near the end, which I will not spoil for anyone intending to see the film. Just don't say you were not warned.\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" is very easy to get caught up in, but must be seen from beginnig to end in order to get the full impact of Jodi Foster's and Anthony Hopkin's performances. It may also be prudent to have a bottle of lotion handy...or else it gets the hose again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"The first film to sweep all the major Oscars since One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975; Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs is more than just the most unnerving mainstream serial killer film of all time (the only other movie that comes close to rivaling it is Seven), it is a masterpiece of modern day cinema. The story, as we all know by now, revolves around haunted FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) trying to get information out of imprisoned cannibalistic killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) on a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). The amazing interplay between Foster and Hopkins is the film's main highlight, but the laced with suspense prison break will have you jolting out of your seat. Those who have never seen this film should definitely pick up this generously priced extra laced DVD, but the long out of print Criterion Collection DVD is more than worth tracking down as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertisement!!!!

If you want to conquer shyness, watching his unsmiled face and listening to every word he breathes will make you a fine psychotic killer. Should, for example, a nasty son of yours be so punchy with his fists on his little brother, then you should become Hannibal and speak every word so clearly he can hear every consonant and every word you say. Hannibal acts like he was descended from a vampire generation. Sometimes I wonder if the moth shown in the movie stuck it's coiled tongue in his mouth when he was a baby, injecting vampire blood. As a Christian, the cross of Jesus or the Bible should avoid me from becoming like him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Average HD transfer","review":"I love this movie, one of the greatest... gore, suspense, thriller, horror, detective etc...

Honestly I don't know what goes into the transfer process, but this seems grainy, so maybe that's the source material they are working with? the original camera work and cinematographic style? etc. Certain movies simply look amazing on Blu-ray others are eh, nothing too eye popping and unfortunately this is just ok.

I thought these books were great and so I set out to find more of his books. This is the book I stumbled upon and found is just as fascinating as the other two. This book outlines the plight of poverty in urban settings; from the long ours as a plongeure in Paris, to the rowdiness of late night pubs in London. Through out the novel he describes the terrible inconvenience and burdon having no money places upon a poor person. He also tells of great adventures he shares with his friends in trying to acquire money and fun. I highly recommend this book to any reader but especially to Orwell fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A journey to experience poverty","review":"Down and Out in Paris and London by George Orwell is not as good as Animal Farm or 1984 but it is an informative, realistic look at homeless life in Paris and London.

I didn't look at it until I got off the airplane in Heathrow, and I had to buy another guide in London (which, thanks to the exchange rate, was quite expensive). I read the book anyway and discovered that I quite liked it. It's description of poverty is unsparing, and should serve as a reminder to those who want to scale back the welfare state. I recommend it as an outstanding work of literature, but not, alas, as a travel guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Orwell","review":"Great Read! This book follows the aimless journeys of an unemployed journalist in Paris and London. Orwell presents a clear and honest view into the 'underworld' of these great metropolises.In traditional Orwellian style, this book flows; the writing style makes reading the book effortless. The anecdotes are entertaining and keep you reading for more. I think some of his longer expostulations into the evils of urban poverty were a bit overwrought, but it wouldn't have been Orwell without them. This book is heartily recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dire book by an english snob","review":"That Orwell believes in the nobility of poverty is evidence of his complete lack of understanding of the state. His class and eaton education blinds his sensibilities. His comments on being \\"down and out\\" are those of a man who can escape at any time he chooses.

While his personal deprivation cuts to the very core of physical existence his vivid descriptions avoid the blame game of cursing society for his destitute circumstances. While others would be ground down from such impoverished situations, Orwell simply gets polished up, proving (at least to this reader) that the neo-classics are the best reflection for the contemporary human soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"An early Orwell","review":"Orwell describes his struggle to survive in Paris during the Depression in succinct and moving language. In London he again explains the way he, along with many other homeless men, were able to keep body and soul together in difficult times. His failure to explain why a young man educated at Eton and from a well-off family would put himself through these horrors is, I think, a weakness and makes one wonder how much of his story is fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"uplifting","review":"This quite uplifting for Orwell. The book is series of tales of a time he was a dishwasher in Paris restaurants and a tramp in London.I am presuming he endured this as some sort of social experiment rather than of necessity, which appears proven as he always has someone to give him the cash to survive or travel.We are introduced to the filth and appalling conditions endured by many, some through choice, some through life just being harsh.How the book was uplifting for me was that many having no other choice just got on with it and did quite amazing things to survive. What was really apparent is that just because there was poverty there was no automatic drift into crime - which seems to contradict much of what today's social engineers would have us believe.A interesting read from the early 20th century.

As such the passages on slang end up containing a lot of \\"-----\\" which is interesting from the perspective of censorship in the 1930s, but is clearly contrary to the authors intent.

This was all until Sellers came on board and lost control. However, nobody told Slim Pickens (the bronco bomber) this, so he is allegedly playing the film straight. This, of course, makes his performance sixteen times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the ages","review":"The stirring gallantry and enterprise shown by Major Kong (brilliantly played by Slim Pickens) and his B-52 crew is what makes this movie such an inspiring classic.

It's always fun showing this to the younger folks who have never seen it. This anniversary edition includes some cool extras: interviews with reporter Bob Woodward (Watergate) & director Spike Lee offers unique perspectives & insights into this phenomenal piece of work.

The acting is superb, with Peter Sellers' three character \\"tour de force\\" & George C. Scott's performances ranking up there with the very best, the cinematography is brilliant, generating real tension through clever cutting and the use of hand-held sequences, and the essentially horrific storyline is tight, believable & wholly effective. The verbal and visual gags flow thick and fast and the last scene's chillingly languid marriage of Vera Lynn's nostalgic wartime anthem \\"We'll Meet Again\\" with repeated nuclear explosions perfectly reflects what has gone before: satirical black comedy at its most inspired. And... to cap it all, the theatre trailer on this DVD version is a small, perfectly formed cinematic gem in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!!!","review":"Dr.Strangelove is one of the best films ever made! For it's time it was racy and had lots of innuendos and (at the time) social satire.George C.

Leave it to Kubrick to take a serious subject and make it a black comedy classic!!He has made some truely wonderful films! Too bad he ended on a sour note like \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\".But please do yourself a favor and check this one out.

The inspired lunacy of Dr. Strangelove makes it accessible to all ages and times, since we all deal with nutty leaders at one point or another. So many of the moments have passed into pop culture: Major Kong's ride on a nuclear warhead, the President's phone call (all improv'd), Gen. Ripper's protestations of purity of bodily fluids.

Scott.Buy and watch this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Perfect Trade","review":"Dr. Strangelove is a kick to watch if the style suits you. Littered with black humor and satire dated to the early cold war days, this movie will provide as much comedy as it will history.Do not expect the flashy humor in todays comedies but a more subtle poke at the dark aspects of society and humanity.The only problem I had with any aspect of the purchase was a small crack in the clear protective plastic which protects the cover.A good buy for movie know-it-alls and aficionados."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Strangelove","review":"A Kubrick MASTERPIECE!!

Although the subject matter is nothing to laugh about, it manages to get a laugh in every scene. Peter Sellers gives one of the best comedy performances of the century playing 3 different roles (Kubrick and Sellers had originally planned for him to play 4 roles). George C. Scott is extremely funny as the eccentric general, Sterling Hayden is also great as the general who is obsessed with bodily fluids. Great craftsmanship courtesy of Kubrick. One of the all-time greats, extremely entertaining and grows funnier with each viewing. Extras: spot James Earl Jones (the voice of Darth Vader).

Its the stupidity of the carachters and the entire world-political system that makes me smile.Imagine this. Both the presidents in the movie can destroy the whole world. But they only have a bad phone line to communicate with to each other.. Hehe...And of course, we have the \\"ragnarok\\" expert Dr. Strangelove. An imported German scientist, that of course is raving mad, and has the right solutions for the situation that occures at the end of the movie.I challenge you all: Is there any better way to deal with a worldwide nuclear catastrophy then the solutions Dr. Strangelove got????But remember, if you\`re wong, you got to answer to the coca-cola company!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really good older movie","review":"I stayed away from Dr Strangelove over the years because I had the impression, coming from the 60's & being basically a farce about war it might be some stupid hippy-dippy type film. I was totally off the mark. I happened to catch A&E's bio of George C Scott & a clip of his performance in this film was shown. It was brief but funny enough to spark an interest. So I purchased a copy , it was worth it , this is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling conversion of a classic","review":"Columbia Tristar should be ashamed of themselves. They have managed to tarnish a classic movie by giving the most lacklustre, threadbare, and just plain lousy DVD conversions I have yet to see.I therefore do not concure with other reviewers who have given this DVD 5 stars and here are my reasons why:1. The box says \\"deluxe widescreen edition\\" when in fact it is 4:3 most of the time.2. Image quality starts off quite well but plummets about 30 minutes into the movie, most noticeably in the scenes between Mandrake and Ripper. The image becomes so badly pixelated that it becomes almost unwatchable.3. Zero special features. That's right _nothing_, unless you count a chapter list as a feature.4. A promotional advert is tacked onto the front of the movie.5. No English or French subtitles - only Spanish!In short, the movie is great but the conversion is rotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A crazy classic","review":"Kubrick must have had some fun making this little masterpiece. For one, he surrounded himself with brilliant acting talent such as Peter Sellers, Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott. The research was obviously something that Kubrick must have loved too - there is so much detail in regard to the way that nuclear assaults and processes are followed that it sometimes leaves you wondering if this is more of a detailed documentary than a madcap comedy.That is what makes this film so special. I am really looking forward to buying this once I purchase a blu-ray player, but I think I will be keeping the collector's edition DVD, as from what I understand some of the extras have been removed."},{"rating":"2","title":"No seriously, they really are like this.","review":"The best example of why we all should move to New Zealand. Or Switzerland. Or the moon. This is foreign policy at its dumbest, which seems to be the status quo. George C.

It was filled with interesting tidbits of information and was very much worth watching.Anyone with a DVD player should own this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stanley Kubrick does it again!","review":"Awesome!

I've seen so many comments complaining about a film lacking the widescreen format, such as this film. The fact is it was filmed in a multi-aspect ratio which changes throughout the film. I'd assume that movie fanatics would rather see a film as the director intended rather than a particular format."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEIN FURHER I CAN WALK!!!","review":"Peter Sellers: One messed up individual. a man with a personality so erratic it could be Michael Bay's movie career. and yet, when this personality is put in front of a camera, or in the case of Dr. Strangelove, several personalities, he shines like a needle full of Novocaine.The great man's performance in three key roles in the movie is fantastic, and above all, hilarious. slim pickens and sterling hayden provide some nice support and the famous bomb riding scene is more than enough reason for watching this movie. but, as with peter sellers' personality, it is not the only one.There is a subtext in Kubricks comedy that reflects the current political situation, especially in the country it is set in. between gun happy, commie hating senators and covered up pie fighting scenes, this movie could be held up to a current CNN bulletin and almost be the same: accurate, relevant, and laugh out loud hilarious. watch this, stop worrying, and learn to love the Peter Sellers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Sarcasm","review":"I've been told that this movie is good mixture between sarcasm and comedy. When I bought it and I got a chance to watch I really loved it. It is a movie that can stay in the collection just because you can watch it many times and it is interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Well boys I guess this is it\\"","review":"The iconic image of Slim Pickens riding that nuclear bomb like a rodeo bull is one of the most trenchant scenes in movie history. It perfectly captures both the madness of the Cold War and the essence of the film. This is the defenitive black comedy with quirky dialouge, bizaree characters, and classic characters. Kubrick had a vision for this work and he was able to capture it nicely. Defenitely in my Top 20 all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the movie that made Slim Pickens Famous!","review":"I used to be his neighbor up near Columbia, CA, and he was a customer in my store as well. More than once he reflected on this fateful movie that he did after several westerns. On those movies he was \\"Hey You!\\", after after Dr. Strangelove, he said that he became \\"Mr. Pickens\\" with a dressing room of his own. Interesting twist of fate. I met him right about the time he was in Blazing Saddles, another \\"classic\\", as this one is....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Wild Ride","review":"I'm not sure how Kubrick could have made such a strange movie without somehow demonstrating his own strangeness.

I was shocked that she wanted me to see this, because both of us know that movies made before 1990 are horrible. I was hesitant to watch this because it's so old but I decided to give it a shot. What a mistake!! People who pass this off as a \\"comedy\\" are ridiculous, as this movie was VERY unfunny. It wasn't even in colour, the characters were boring and there was way too much dialogue.For a REAL black comedy watch \\"Soul Plane\\" or \\"White Chicks\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't Laugh Once.","review":"I asked for a bunch of comedies from the 60s & somehow this war satire landed in the pile.

Hey kids, let's make fun of the military by depicting them as morons! The \\"genious\\" overacting and unoriginal characters portrayed by Peter Sellers were pathetic. Occasionally, I heard forced laughter from one or two people in the otherwise silent audience.

My father (a film teacher) always told me to watch it, but being a teenager, I didn't think a black and white film could keep my attention, Kubrick or not. However, this film blew my mind. What a powerful statement Kubrick makes about the Cold War! Only Stanley could open our eyes to the how silly the arms race was, and the serious effects it would have on humanity were we to continue it. It was easy for Americans to sit back and watch the government handle the Cold War, but it wasn't easy for them to see the truth. All I have to say is, \\"You can't fight in here!

I have probably seen it 20 times since then (I'm a big kid now) and it never gets old. Peter Sellers' acting is just great, along with the all star cast (when they were young). The movie begins a little slowly but picks up. One of the best things I like about it are all the small funny innuendos throughout the film. A must see film (video)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Strangelove","review":"I never realized that this cold war classic was a Stanley Kubrick film, and I never knew Peter Sellers played multiple roles in it, but most importantly, I heard that George C. Scott was told by Kubrick to just mess around and be silly in order to prepare for the role and get into the spirit of it while planning all along on using that actual footage for the final takes. I also heard that though they both went on to have very successful careers, George C. Scott never forgave him for this trick, and refused to ever work with him again. Finally, I reckognized an african american in the flight crew under Slim Pickens command, but did not know at first that this was James Earl Jones.

This is his epitomy and finest masterpiece of this philosophy. And he used the ideals of war, insanity and ignorance to exemplify these as the product of man. And the tools of sardonism and irony are what produce the humor within the dialogue, yet we are only laughing at either ourselves or our lives. Kubrick was clearly anti-war because he knew that war was solely a result of man's instinctive competitiveness and desire to win, and this man left it the burden of innocent, impartial people to fight his battles. And all whom are pro-was bear the same instinct as those who begin wars. Watch the film for its symbolic greatness or watch it for its cinematic and visual powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Rent it, buy it..

Possibly it was made in a time I don't understand as well (6 years before my birth) with its fear of mass destruction and communist plots. Today communism is not such a great fear and mass destruction isn't either but individual terrorism is. I did not find the scenes to be funny with the exception of the hotline scenes and Dr. Strangelove's overacting in his final scene. Some excellent acting by both Peter Sellers and George C. Scott which almost makes me want to keep this in my collection. The DVD video transfer is not very good making the film look a bit like a poorly shot documentary (intentional?). No extras, not even English subtitles, although it is subtitled in Spanish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't funny at all","review":"This movie is lame. There isn't one good laugh in it. It is tiresome. The only good thing about it is that it warns us against right wing lunatics who might start a nuclear war because they are crazy. Fine. It is politically correct. But that doesn't mean that the movie is any good, and it isn't. I have hated almost every Stanley Kubrick film I have ever seen. His work is terrible. The best of the sorry lot is Barry Lyndon, which is too long, too slow paced, has no characters who aren't annoying and despicable, but is worth three stars, which is more than I can say for the rest of his garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's kind of like Catch-22, except not funny","review":"There is nothing worse, when it comes to comedy, than blatant satire; YOU CAN'T FIGHT IN HERE, THIS IS THE WAR ROOM.Wow, hilarious, because it's a room where they talk about wars, where fighting goes on.Kubrick made a few masterpieces, and a few mediocre films, this is his one complete and total bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love","review":"I have no idea why people say this is the funniest movie ever made.

The holes are NEVER punched all the way, leaving me with the job of pulling off the little donut hole pieces, which also tend to scatter on the floor instead of collecting inside the punch reservoir.

A mere 20 minutes ago the DVD stopped spinning in my player, and I am left with a burning question: \\"Why did I like this movie so much?\\" I am not exactly sure, but I think it had something to do with there being a cyclops and a giant throwing-star-like weapon called the \\"Glave.\\" It certainly wasn't for the plot, special effects, or character development... which I find suprisingly mediocre now that I'm in my 20's. So, Krull hasn't held up for me like some other 80's flicks, but those who still get their kicks from it will find a nice picture and good DD sound. The disc has two commentary tracks which I probably won't listen to, but it's nice to see \\"B-films\\" like Krull get a nice DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie.","review":"Its one of my favourite teenage movies, though I know some people may not like it. It was one of the first fantasy movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"We want DVD!","review":"Like so many others, I grew up loving this movie. Whenever my mom and I would go to the video store to rent some movies, my choice was a choice of two, ghostbusters and krull (both of which i saw a million times before). It's fairly obvious that a successful movie like ghostbusters would be on DVD, but Krull is one of those cult classics like evil dead that deserve to be on DVD. All I can say is thankfully they've already given us Evil Dead on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"lifetimes memory","review":"i first saw this when i was 3. the film stuck in my mind ever since. i've only seen it 3 times (i can't get it in a pal version and the bbc havent shown it to my knollage since 1992). its a classic case of 'save the princess'. it also has one or two suprise actors currently in soaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a world of their own....","review":"It seems as if this movie is the victim of mediocre reviewing. Yes, it is not your top listed science fiction movie ever made but then again, you can regress to that time when a fantasy movie got in to your head and made you think....what if?This movie showed some nice scenery and better than average action scenes and well done music. If you have an imagination and a youthful spirit and are willing to let some fantasy enter your life just for the time it takes to watch this movie, you may just be pleasantly surprised.It was nice to see a lot of nice reviews here too because I agree with those reviews. This may never be in your top 10 list of sci-fi but then again, for what is in it and what it offers, it is enjoyable and worth watching and is not your run of the mill sci-fi movie either. And finally, it is now on DVD with a very large amount of special features. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Boring","review":"Bad story, poorly executed. If you like making fun of old movies this is for you. For others sear clear. Liam Neeson is barely in this movie, so if you are purchasing it because he is in it DON'T."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite fantasy movies!","review":"I have seen this movie numerous times. And even though it is a little cheesy in certain plot scenarios and special effects, it was incredible for its time. It has every thing a person could want in a fantasy. Monsters, mystery, and magic. This one is a must see for any fantasy lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood memories","review":"I remember as a child watching this movie for the first time and being totally entertained by it.

If anyone is looking for a moving story, and an entertaining movie, please pick up a copy of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Pleasing cheese!","review":"Krull is one of those movies that you just can't help but like. Its over the top acting and ridiculus costuming just leads viewers to smile. For anyone who loves the cheesy fantasy flicks of the 80's and early 90's Krull is a must have. Viewers will be treated to a corn ball quest to save a princess from a dark lord, a giant evil spider, and a final battle with an oversized ninja star. Krull definitely is a must have for any lover of this genre!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundtrack was the only redeeming quality","review":"I have to say that this was one of the biggest Sci-fi disappointments that I have seen recently. I don't mind a low budget movie, or a bit of cheese, but I could hardly endure sitting through this entire movie. Bad characters, acting, effects, plot, etc. The only redeeming factor about this movie was James Horner's soundtrack (the only reason that I gave this two stars instead of one), except he recycled much of it in or from ST2:Wrath of Kahn. My advice is, get the soundtrack, and don't waste two hours watching the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel like I'm being taken for granted","review":"Although, I have many purchases from this seller, and most times the conditions of the items have been acceptable, I feel that now I am being taken for granted.

There was a another movie that didn't play at all. And the movies that did play well, were in widescreen. (I hate widescreen). So, I definately feel cheated, but its cool because I will just never spend another dollar at gohastings again. Thanks for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"We've been invaded!","review":"It frightens me that so many people are writing glowing reviews for this film. Is there a conspiracy? Have we been invaded by Krull-loving Amazonians? I remember seeing this movie in the theater and laughing at scenes that were obviously not meant to be funny.Krull was a film which had its heart in the right place but was plain clumsy at execution. If it's medieval heroics you're after, by all means Excalibur is the film for you. Even Willow seems to exude depth when compared to Krull."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sci-Fi movie that does'nt follow its own rules","review":"First we see the evil villian's fortress flying through space, then we see it beaming itself all over this alien(?) world where the story takes place. People fighting armored, blaster-wielding soldiers with swords. A 20 foot tall monster that gets seriously wounded with something akin to a pen knife. Top it all off with some some bad acting and lackluster characters and you wind up with \\"Krull\\".Its one of those films that is \\"almost good\\", if only the producers put a little more work into the movie and less into product placement and merchandising strategies. This movie also goes in 4 directions at the same time and all the paths lead nowhere. Its a classic example of creating a movie that was supposed to please everyone but has the opposite effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm the only person who dislikes this movie?","review":"Wow, i'm confused. When my friends and i make lists of the worst movies of all time, Krull is always at the top of the list. The sci-fi/fantasy group here in Minneapolis has a monthly movie night at a local theatre where we watch horrible movies and laugh at them. Krull's one of the favorites for being so bad it's funny.When i was a kid, i had low standards. Really low. i loved movies back then that, when i watch them now, i wonder what i was thinking. How could i have liked Gymkata? How did Beastmaster make it on my top 10 list? But even back then, i thought Krull was one of the worst films i had ever seen, second only to treasure of the four crowns. It's not simply poorly done for now - it was bad decades ago when i was just a kid"},{"rating":"1","title":"The title of this movie should have been Kroll","review":"This movie had the potential of being right up there with Titanic, Star Wars, Jaws and From Justin to Kelly in terms of blockbuster hits but they missed out big time. J-Abs and Nooks partner Kroll was the lead character in this movie and right before the release they decided to rename the movie Krull b/c they wanted the auidence to focus on the film making rather than the Star of the movie Kroll. Don't think this kept Kroll down however. Kroll goes to the movie studio collects his 7 figure check then procedes to super impose Liam Neelson into all the scenes he was in b/c if you change the name that is the justice due you. Needless to say this movie was a flop but Kroll gots paid and is still better than any of you. You would have been so lucky to see this James Dean style actor at work but you won't cause Kroll took his money and is stiing on an island in Cabo with the ladies and laughing all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fond Memories","review":"I saw this when I was a kid.

But, I suspect they won't be disappointed for long because this is one of the best (if not the best) crafted mysteries Day has written so far. The twists of the plot are much more compelling and I liked the way in which the book brought the Boston period of Fremont's life to a sad conclusion..Despite its Boston setting the book does include Michael Archer, Fremont's partner and lover, but he appears infrequently in this book as Fremont Jones reconnects with her father, loses him tragically, and solves the mystery of his death. Fans of Day's earlier works will like this one, too, but if you are new to the series I suggest you begin at the beginning (The Strange Files of Fremont Jones) to fully understand the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"First, I've enjoyed the prior Fremont Jones books. But her \\"independence,\\" coupled with her pride in her own abilities (which of course is never misplaced) is, quite frankly, becoming quite tiresome. I was also extremely disappointed with the plot -- wouldn't it have been far more fascinating (and maybe better for our heroine's ego)if Fremont had been WRONG about her stepmother? I often compare Fremont Jones to Amelia Peabody -- increasingly, Fremont is paling in comparison!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This What American Literature Has Come To?","review":"First off, I'm not on any publisher or bookseller's payroll. I'll keep my fingers crossed this gets posted.Secondly, I read \\"Beacon Street Mourning\\" after two books by P.D. James, a serious mystery writer. It is really beyond me how the apparent scriblings of a bright fifteen-year-old could sell for millions. Marketing in these United States is something to behold. Dianne Day, if such a person really exists, has no command of the English language. Her sense of history is limited to lists of street and building names. She draws her characters from a limited list of 1980-90s personalities. I'm sure that makes her readers feel at home, but history and good literature it is not. I give two stars because I was able to follow the plot and Day put in a good week-end of work.It makes me angry that such low-quality fare is offered the public. There are good writers out there.

For one thing, this is suppposed to be Beyblade V-Force, and the characters all have their old Blades from the first season. The sound effects are awfull, the \\"bit-beast attacks\\" are plain and boring, and the graphics look like a mediocre Gameboy Color game. Most of all though, the gameplay isn't even fun, it's not even good for passing a couple of minutes. I feel Atari totally missed the whole concept of Beyblade, instead of it being a battling game, it's more like a boring version of Super Monkey Ball. If you want a real Beyblade game, try Beyblade GRevolution. It's pretty short, but it still has the same feel as the show, a lot of nice customization options too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply excellent","review":"Chasing Amy is a worthy successor to Clerks, the greatest movie ever made.

So it's not the subject matter that turns me off; it's the clumsy execution.I must confess, I haven't seen the entire movie. I turned it off a minute or two into the pivotal scene in which he and she discuss sexual histories. It was just too lame to watch. I'm suprised that Ben Affleck (or Joey Lauren Adams, for that matter) hasn't bought up all the copies just to prevent that supreme moment of Bad Acting from being revealed. This is the opposite of \\"selling\\" a scene. To be fair, it wasn't just bad acting - they were delivering some of the most wooden lines I've heard from a supposedly hip writer/director. The entire script is gimmick-laden, permeated with an urge to explore these intricate relationships, but never getting beyond two-dimensional portrayals. Could have been very good, but it's just a bad joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best timed lines of all time","review":"\\"because the other 3 are f**king figments of your imagination\\"watch it and enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good movie, if you don't mind crude language","review":"I like how Chasing Amy borrows from other movies such as The Graduate and Jaws (the scene at the booth, at the Meow Mix). The main thing CA does for the audience, IMO, is to make us think about how we feel about gay/lesbian lifestyles, and if we can accept someone, knowing what they've done in the past.Of course, your standards and definition of 'crude language' may differ from mine. I thought it was excessive here. But then, maybe this movie is showing us a particular group. Actually, I think a large part of our society talks this way. It's reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick Flick","review":"I loved Dogma, Clerks and even dug Mallrats. Unfortunately, Chasing Amy didn't live up to my expectations. The rapid fire dialogue is similar to that in Smith's other films, but here most of the verbal exchanges fall flat - or go on far too long. The only decent scene was the one with Jay and Silent Bob in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Rules","review":"All of Kevin Smiths movies rules. this movie is a muse be for every guy in a relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you may think","review":"I'm somewhat surprised how many reviewers are missing, what I think is the entire point of this movie. It isn't about being gay -- that's a tricky sub plot to keep you off base before Smith lowers the bomb. This movie dares to ask the politically incorrect question; \\"How much of a womans past sexual experiences are acceptable.\\" This is the subject matter than Hollywood, and most of the general public hate to address because it forces the viewer to ask a question (of themselves) that he or she would rather ignore. and that's the reason why this film failed. But on a cultural and artistic basis it's a bold and profound statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rarity--an honest and real view of life","review":"This film is a masterwork. Smith is a wonderful talent (heck, I even like Mallrats) and this is his best work yet. I have so rarely seen a film so honest about love and jealousy. The lines are sharp, the performances are great, and the movie just hums. Silent Bob (smith himself)'s Chasing Amy story remains one of my most favorite film sequences from the '90s.The DVD may be one of the best I own. Packed with extras you won't believe. Did you know that this film, like Affleck's comic book (called Chasing Amy) is sort of an apology to Joey Lauren Adams? The facts, commentary, and extra scenes are great. If you are a Smith fan, this is a must. The picture and sound are excellent as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kweel,indeed recomend to ani 1!","review":"This film is totally kool,a great film to follow up mallrats not as good as mallrats mind, but still ace.Jason Lee just as good in this as mallrats and still nice lookin with the beard!I recomend this to ani one with a stupid sense of humour,and loves kevin smith films."},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS the best Kevin Smith movie","review":"I'll be brief. This is the best work that any of those involved have performed in their whole career. It is Joey Lauren Adams' standout performance, it is the best work Ben Affleck has done (that fabulously realistic accent he used in Pearl Harbor nonwithstanding), it is Jason Lee's funniest work, and it is Kevin Smith's best screenplay and direction. Couple that with some great brief work from Jay and Silent Bob, and you have a fantastic small film that deserves all accolades it received."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun \\"Non-Traditional\\" American Movie","review":"For those of you out there who are looking for the traditional poor boy falls in love with rich girl, this isn't your movie.

Anywho, the reason I say this film is a instant classic is because its one of those rare movies that you can watch over and over and still get a kick out of. And I for one plan to show this film to my daughter whene she asks that dreaded question \\"Dad, what's a lesbian?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Smith's Best Work Ever?!","review":"And that is saying something. This is a masterfully written, superbly-acted film that is as genuine as anything I've ever seen. Life doesn't always work out as we'd planned, and Smith demonstrates this beautifully in this true-to-life story, which shows that love, like life itself, isn't always fair. Holden's confession to Alyssa in the rain is the most moving scene I have ever witnessed in film, at least partially because I know I can relate to it entirely, and I know I am not the only one. The scene with Jay and Silent Bob summing up the entire film in one cameo, and the ending sequence are both also tremendous. This is an emotional and triumphant work, arguably Smith's best ever. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of the century.","review":"It's funny and excuilerating. One minute your laugh the next your mad at the actors.

Boring, hackneyed, homophobism-athon. Kevin Smith gets my respect, but not for this muck. The only character I didn't want to kick off a ledge was Jason Lee's sidekicky role as the inker.... sour, mean, and fundamentally committed.... any stars this gets is due to his acerbity, though Joey Lauren Adams is lovely (must confess I've never been able to stand Ben Affleck, loved the fact that he was a maroon in Mallrats, he was perfect as the evil, abusive, rebound grabber).Don't waste your time, see Clerks first if you haven't already, see Mallrats if you haven't, and wait on this one until it's the only tape in the videostore.Better than \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\", but ALSO more schmaltzy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Smith at his WORST!","review":"It starts off great \\"BLACK RAGE! BLACK RAGE!\\" and theappearance of Jason Lee comforts us, while Ben Affleck discomfortsus. However, after the usual shennanigins, CA is a very sub-par, BADmovie. All we see is Ben Affleck moping about stupid lesbian JoeyLauren Adams for a whole hour and a half. Jason Lee is funny though,and the very brilliant scene with Jay and Silent Bob is great. (onescene? come on!) And the finger cuffs scene is hilarious, it had merolling. But, the rest of the movie is boring and uninspired.

While the performances were believable and the direction great, the story line and ending were unrealistic and ugly. I felt sad and lacking closure at the end of this mean movie which relied on stereo-types and male fantasies to give us a picture of a woman questioning her sexuality. This is a movie I truly wish I had never seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST GET~!!","review":"This movie I truly have to say is one of the best movies ever to be filmed. It has great acting, humor, and what most men like the most two women kissing. Ben Affleck did a fantasic job. The guy that did Binky had me cracking up laughing the first time I saw it. Hooper, the gay black man is also hillarious. The girl in the movie did her roles well, and put a lot of expression into her part. This movie does sort of remind me of a real- life situation, cause this girl in the movie is a freak. There's a lot of those around. Chasing Amy seems like the beginning for Dogma because of the production. But anywho, Chasing Amy is a movie that you should get. And I guarantee you that you will enjoy this flick. This is a \\"MUST GET\\"~!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Smith's brilliant stab at a romance movie","review":"Chasing Amy is a 90s love romance in the eyes of Kevin Smith. Only he could com up w/a plot so hilarious and clever. The story is about this guy Holden (Ben Affleck), and his friend Banky who create comic books together. Holden falls in love w/ a girl, Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams), but there's one problem... she's a lesbian. So throughout the entire movie, Holden tries to win her over, despite the jealously/resentment of his best friend, her wild sex life of her past, and any other unpredictable things that come his way. The cameo by Jay & Silent Bob, a regular in all of Kevin Smith's movies, gave the film a humorous break from the romantic drama in the movie. It's a must see movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best script Smith has written to date!","review":"Though Clerks is my personal favorite of Kevin Smith's works, Chasing Amy is the most exceptional, creative, and inventive of any of his stories.

Only you can decide whether the movie is too Hollywood, but this movie is really great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying not to be trite","review":"I was swayed by the reviews. Heterosexual chases lesbian is usually something I'd avoid. I should have trusted my tried and true instincts. There are certain themes that have been done and done again. The only way someone else can do them is to come from a totally new perspective. Because this has the \\"aura\\" of comic books, I imagine a number of people feel they see that new perspective. I don't. It's the same old same old. Different clothes, but nothing new. No insight. The photography isn't exceptional. The direction isn't exceptional. The acting is almost acting. I respect Criterion. If this hadn't been a Criterion release I probably wouldn't have purchased it. I'll still consider Criterion a cut above, but this really doesn't deserve the attention it has gotten. Well I guess it really did. Cause it didn't make a bunch of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a True Lesbian","review":"This movie if far from being what I would call a good Lesbian flick.

Her voice sounds like a strained harp (especially during the emotional scenes) and I found myself nodding off when she talked.There was one good thing about this film; it made me appreiate jay and silent bob more than ever, even if they did have a small part. if you have to watch this movie, just fast forward to where they come in and skip the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crude, but very funny","review":"My brother got me turned onto the world of Jay and Silent Bob when he made me watch \\"Dogma\\" one day. I'll be the first to admit that I really only watched it because I love Ben Affleck. But I liked the movie too.A week later he threw \\"Chasing Amy\\" at me and told me I would love it more. He was so right. There's not too much exposition at the beginning of the story, you're pretty much just thrown into the lives of Holden (Affleck) and his best friend Banky (Jason Lee) who are comic book writers in Northern Jersey. At a comic book conference, the duo meet Alyssa (the very talented Joey Lauren Adams) and Holden falls in love with her... only to discover that she is a lesbian.Amist the crude language and high-charged sexual overtones, the heart of the story is friendship and whether or not Holden and Banky can pull it together and stay friends with a woman placed in between them. It's a great movie with great one-liners and of course, Jay and Silent Bob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay and Silent Bob","review":"I like this movie, but not as much as Mall Rats or Clercks. This movie is funny in its portrayal of the pursuit of the unattainable. Which, once it is attained, of course it is not fully appreciated. There is a lot of crude humor in this film, so it is definitely not appropriate for children. I enjoyed watching the cut scenes and the outtakes. A must see for Jay and \\"Silent\\" Bob fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I agree with most, this is a very personal look at what could possibly be from Kevin Smith's past. There's no need to write a huge novel on how good this film is. But I will say that in it, Kevin Smith (as Silent Bob) speaks more than he ever has in his films and in this one Jay and Bob are barely in it. His words this time speak very well for themselves. In fact you find out why its called Chasing Amy. And that is why I believe it is an account from his past. very good film. It looses one star because of the ending. I didn't enjoy the ending very much.but overall its a good film"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy moral piece","review":"This movie is so pat. Boring, not romantic, not much comedy.

That is the amount of obscene words you would never want your kids to hear that I counted in this film. 241. That averages out to over two a minute. I am an adult, this is R rated, but come on. The potential screwball situation would have been hilarious if Smith did not keep dishing out one awkward scene for every funny one.

I lovedthis long verbal fights... well because you need to gothrough all this to love it on the screen. And I think theend is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just simply a great movie!!!","review":"Just a good twist on the old love story. Kevin Smith made a true movie that touches the heart. Exploring the deeper longings of emotions and the need to be accepted and loved even in todays rigid \\"rule\\" and \\"accepted codes\\", this shows two people who try to rise above their past, even if one can't rise above the other's. Classic \\"tis better to have loved and have lost...\\" story. The twist and acting is excellent. Even Ben Affleck, who I can't stand as a rule, I found cheering and even sad for at the end. The moral is simple...and it's explained better than I could ever say at the end of the movie. Easily my favorite movie, and in my opinion, the best Kevin Smith movie ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Smith's most mature work","review":"While being the least cartoonish of Smith's movies (that could be good or bad depending on which fan boy you speak to), Smith's third flick is his most fully realized and mature film to date.The film centers on two friends, Holden and Banky, who are both roomies and write and illustrate their own cult comic book, \\"Bluntman And Chronic\\". Their relationship is threatened, however, when the very beautiful, sexually confused Alyssa comes into the mix and starts to date Holden. It all sounds quite formulaic on paper, but this is definitely a movie that doesn't follow your typical romantic comedy cliches. This is Smith's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"A healthy and new twist on the sideshow Bob series, this movie's excellent use of sexual innuendo and wittiness add to the powerful drama of a cult classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"KEVIN U DID GOOD ON THIS 1.....","review":"HAPPY V DAYGreat mature movie about love and sexual orientationKevin Smith is one of my favourite directors, but this time he has reached the greatest depth and maturity in his career. It's not who you love, but how. That's a truth many people should bear in mind when considering own or other people relationships and choices. Here we can see how sexual orientation is only a preference -as if you preffer chocolate or coffe -although with greater consequences for life, of course-, because when that person who enters your life and puts everything upside down and takes you to heaven appears, what matters if it is male, female, or hermaphrodite? And who cares about his/her past? A film for a new generation of people liberated from ancient prejudices. Sadly, Holden can't see that simple truth. If he could have, he would still be with Alyssa.Also Recommended: Clerks, Mallrats, Jay & Silent Bob Strike Again, Dogma"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor follow up to Clerks","review":"I came to this film with high expectations after watching the foul-mouthed but funny Clerks, but I was sorely disappointed. This film is not in the same class. While the substandard black and white photography in Clerks added to the endearing ad hoc nature of that film, in this (although in colour) it just appears cheap and nasty.A lot of the dialogue is rather stilted and inaudible, and the script, although subtler than Clerks, is nowhere near as funny. Why Criterion chose to give this film their fine treatment is something of a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one for the ages...","review":"I have a vague memory of having seen this film in the theater after it came out and having left it feeling like Kevin Smith had touched my soul. Perhaps it was because I too had been \\"Involved\\" with a couple of \\"Lesbians\\" in my college years and felt the film somehow spoke to me. Some years later I rented this one again, having just seen Clerks again recently. Let it be known that I belive Clerks is pure genius. Chasing Amy was painfull to watch. The dialogue comes off as though it were written by a high-school sophomore and made me wince on at least one occasion: during the Coming Out seen when Amy is sitting on the tire swing and describing how her friends pleasure each other. It has a few moments, but Chasing Amy will not make it in to my DVD collection next tomy copy of Clerks. I find it somehow fitting then that I have found out that the \\"Lesbians\\" I knew in college are now married (to Men) and having kids and going to being wifey."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked this movie when it came out, but I've grown up.","review":"This film is a shameful commentary on homosexuality-- suggesting that men and women can just \\"turn it off\\" when they want to.

His characters are nothing more than one dimensional caricatures and his dialogue stinks. His \\"comedy' is crude and often insulting. He has made a living off making films for insecure young men who live in their parents' basements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting, worse script","review":"Chasing Amy has plot holes to spare. The characters are a predictable mix-and-match assemblage of Issues (e.g., He's homophobic and angry. Hmm. Must be gay.) with which each of their friends and lovers must dutifully cope in their best psychobabble. It has all the drama of watching someone taking batting practice with a pitching machine.

I would not recommend this movie to may other unless your into that is she or isnt she a lesbian thing with Ben Affleck turning her back and forth. Go with any of the other movies.

It started out great, with the first 10 minutes putting me on the floor in hysterics. I didn't laugh through the rest of the film. While the movie is interesting as a kind of tragic love story, and very well written, it was almost devoid of any sort of humor, which was what I was looking for.

Escaped from the crudeness, hostility, shallowness, insensitivity, provincialism and faux-hipness that that part of the country represents to me, among other things. Never mind the seriously flawed-&-full-of holes plot; these characters have some severe anger & hatred issues, especially the \\"Banky\\" person, (not to mention the twisted \\"Jay\\" creature).I pity anyone for whom the ambience of \\"Chasing Amy\\" reflects reality as they know it and live it."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh please!!","review":"How this movie could have made it to anyones top anything list is a mystery to me!

Mallrats the most, clerks second, dogma third, and then this. This movie has some of my favorite lines and funniest moments, but Adams performance is painful. The overall story is good, and if it weren't for her singing and crying in the rain, I could take it, but both are forced and terrible. Everything else seems typical of Smith's movies. And that I like. The extras on the DVD are nice but I'd recommend clerks or mallrats if you are really a fan of Smith's style of writing. As always, there is an underlying point... Figure it out for yourself. And remember, all of his movies are good, they just may not be for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie","review":"I've watched most of Kevin Smith's movies. \\"Although I turned off Mall Rats after about 20 minutes\\" This one was one of the first movies where I nearly fell off my chair with surprise.

They end up becoming good friends until Ben's Character cannot refrain from telling her that he is in love with her. The supporting cast in this comedy are phenominal. Bens Jealous best friend Banky and an African American nelly queen who pretends to be a militant white hating black activist to sell his comic books about a black super hero provide wonderful editions to the movie. \\"Don't miss the scene with Bens friend and Alyssa comparing oral sex dissasters\\" A wonderful film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chasing Amy is always great BUT...","review":"...if you're like me, looking to upgrade your favorite movies to Blu Ray, you can wait until this gets a proper domestic release.

It is one of the only movies to truthfully look ot love. It is not all flowers and candy, and it does not always resolve itslef in a perfect, go and make your 1.4 kids type of way. The ending is truly cathartic, and a true payoff. The movie is very funny, and at times very frank and even painful. My only complain in this movie is it has less of Jay and Silent Bob than the other movies. If you enjoyed Clerks, Mallrats, and/or Dogma, you'll love this movie.

Much of the lines said by the main & supporting characters are comic gold. Murray's lines are especially memorable (who could forget \\"He SLIMED me?\\"). But it's not only the characters and dialogue that are brilliant: the special effects, the ghosts, the famous song by Ray Parker Jr. However, if there's one thing that's wrong with the movie, then I have to say that Murray seems to steal the show a bit too much. He has the meatiest dialogue, and I just wished the other characters had an equal amount of witty dialogue. But that's only one of my very few gripes with this movie (the others being more trivial).

And someone remind me to change my settings back to normal so other movies will still have outlines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap DVD gift set but terrible transfer!","review":"I enjoy the Ghostbusters movies but I bought the Ghostbusters gift pack and it's a great set but the transfer is horrible. It is in widescreen. They do have two animated episodes from the Real Ghostbusters cartoon on Ghostbusters 2 features but it's about the same from the original Ghostbusters DVD nothing really new just a new Ghostbusters cover and it comes with a great movie scrapbook but the set is a lot better than the original Ghostbusters DVD cover. I would recommend to get this set to collect both Ghostbusters movies. Only if your a Ghostbusters fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Blu-ray I've seen and barely heard. Stick to the DVD","review":"The audio level on the film is almost inaudible with an air-conditioner running.The same is not true for for the commentary track and some if not all of the special features. As others have pointed out the image is no better and possibly even worse than the DVD release"},{"rating":"1","title":"No difference between Blu-ray and upconverted DVD","review":"I had Ghostbusters on regular DVD, but not on Blu-ray, so I bought this. It is the grainiest Blu-ray that I own. Since I had the regular DVD, I ran the regular DVD in my PS3 and swapped in the Blu-ray to compare. No difference whatsoever. People giving this Blu-ray a good review love Ghostbusters, not the Blu-ray version particularly. I challenge you to get a regular DVD version of this and compare with the Blu-ray version. No difference whatsoever. You could even make this a double blind study if you covered the labels;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest comedies of all time","review":"How can you not like this film? Ghostbusters was the first film to team Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ivan Reitman (the director) on one film. It went on to become one of the most successful films of all time. No other movie combined special effects, a cool story, funny characters, and action so well. This film captivated me as a kid and I love it today. This DVD has finally done justice to Ghostbusters, though a two disc version might have been even better. The two featurettes, one from 1984 and one from 1999, are a lot of fun. The deleted scenes are fun, thought it's obvious why they were taken out. The film is also much better in a widescreen version. Finally, the \\"visual\\" commentary is very funny too. Once you see this film, you'll never forget it for lines like \\"He slimed me.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest, and most quoteable, movies ever","review":"Ivan Reitman's greatest triumph, Ghostbusters, is really at it's core fun. It never takes itself way too seriously and even is it might scare kids at first (I know the big dog scared me as a kid), it is something that can grow on anyone, especially line wise. It is goofy in it's approach to the supernatural, and it is really helped along the way by Murray (funny as always), Aykroyd, and Ramis (the two also wrote the movie). A gas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody can relax, I found a car.","review":"The list of car repairs that Ray gives is priceless!!(That's a big Twinkie) This is the movie to buy a DVD player for.(They hate this, I like to torture them) The added scenes are great, and the extra promo stuff is very cool! (What is, the MAGIC word?)The one liners in this movie are endless.(That would have worked if you hadn't stopped me)If you saw this movie 5 years ago, or if you just removed it from your VCR, run out and get this on DVD.(We can cause more damage that way)If it were in the theaters today, you would spend twenty bucks to see it once.(Everybody has three mortgages nowadays) Plus you would not have all the neat behind the scenes stuff.(Is it a Star?)

It's about these ghostbusters, who go around the streets of NY hunting and keeping ghosts in a box.The movie is funny; especially, if you are interested in sci-fi and mythological ghosts.The end is a riot with a huge \\"stay puft\\" marshmallow man, who walks the streets of NY, no doubt, they got the idea to have him walking down the streets of NY from \\"Godzilla,\\" but in lieu of a dinosaur, he's a gigantic marshmallow.*(Suitable for children ages 10-adult).*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of laughs","review":"The guys from Saturday Night Live made a great comedy here. Lots of fun and laughs in both Ghostbusters 1 & 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who you gonna call?","review":"This is the best thing ever. The movie is wonderful, a great script, great pace, great dialog. One of the golden gems of cinema. And now that is on blu-ray a great way to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bill Murray's Best (or his best)","review":"I'd have to say, Ghostbusters I is still an old favorite. Bill Murray was/is terrific in this; this is his funniest comedy to date. The script was original, the music had good beats, and dialogue snappy. The story actually made sense (unlike GB II) and the suspense of Gozer made me feel like New York City, the world, the Ghostbusters themselves were in big time trouble.Quite an excellent movie and is a timeless classic. they should NOT make another GB sequel, please, Harold Ramis, Ivan Reitman, do us a favor and yourselves a favor--DON't do another Ghostbusters movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the VHS version","review":"Okay, first off, the 2 stars are for the *video itself*, not the movie. The movie is hilarious and very well done -- 4.5 stars. Unfortunately, the VHS version is terrible. The screen reformatting is horrendous -- the \\"pan and scan\\" isn't smooth at all, and the coloring is obviously off at some points. Get the DVD instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great edition (printing errors corrected)","review":"This is a great edition of Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters 2. When first released there were some mistakes in the aspect ratio information on the cover and inserts (this lead to some confusion about the aspect ratios of these DVDs), but those errors have all been corrected. These DVDs are widescreen and the cover and insert info is all correct now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with others on the poor transfer to blu-ray","review":"I have to agree with that others that the transfer to blu-ray was very poorly done! Actually, my VHS tape displays more clearly than this blu-ray. Of course, the movie is fantastic, but on this media, it's not worth the money. I'm going to have to get the DVD version, if I can find one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this Blu-Ray?","review":"Great movie, lousy picture. The picture quality was so grainy that I couldn't tell the difference between this and a DVD version of the movie. 1080p should mean something. Oh well, not the end of the world. Classic '80s movie...never gets old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Transfer Ever For a Blu-Ray","review":"Don't waste your money on this Blu-Ray. There is nothing hi-def about this disc at all. The film grain on the transfer is so intense that you'll actually find yourself paying attention to the poor picture quality rather than the movie. And yes, I have a 1080p television and no I am not a videophile. The 1999 DVD that I own looks 1000 times better when upscaled to 1080p. Luckily I only payed $15 for this disc. I was actually planning on returning it thinking that I got a defective disc, but I have seen a lot of complaints on the net about the poor picture quality so I guess I'm out of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest movie ever!","review":"Ghostbusters was the first movie I had ever seen.I feel in love with it.It is a perfect movie.Has great visual effects,zany charecters and some of the best laughs of the 1980s.You can get some good laughs out of Bill Murray.It is a very simple story.It can make you laugh no matter how many times you have seen it.Happy 15th Ghostbusters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Blu Ray movie","review":"First off, I love this movie, HOWEVER, it looks terrible on blu-ray. Tons of artifacts everywhere and all around very grainy picture. If you have this on DVD, keep it. DO NOT BUY THIS BLU-RAY. So not worth it. And they can't use the \\"well it's from 1984\\" as I have Blazing Saddles on Blu Ray and it's amazingly crisp and it looks like a new movie. GhostBusters sadly looks like you're watching it on normal TV (or roughly so). sad panda..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG PROBLEM, you have to purchase THREE ITEMS!!!","review":"The problem with this set is that is uses the \\"pan and scan\\" version of the films, instead of the \\"WIDESCREEN\\". So if you are a real fan you have to buy this set for the booklet, then buy the individual movies (the only way to get them in WIDESCREEN). Why can't they make a \\"Special Edition\\", that has the WIDESCREEN versions of the film? This was the same problem with the Shrek boxed set, some of the films were widescreen, but some were pan-and-scan. If this was in WIDESCREEN, I would have given it four or five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movies!","review":"I've loved these movies for years! I was so excited when I found out that they got put on DVD with EXTRA FEATURES like Deleted Scenes and Commentary which I love! I just wish that there were Deleted Scenes for both movies instead of just the first one, so that's why I gave it four stars instead of five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghostbuster box set review","review":"This was actually part of my sons Easter basket so I had not opened it. When we did on Sunday night, it had two of the Ghostbuster 2 movies in it and it was suppose to have Ghostbusters 1 & 2. I am trying to get this fixed right now but I am not having the best luck with customer service. I will call later today."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst DVD menu I have seen so far. Totally confusing.","review":"A terrible menu, and a so-called \\"Video Commentary\\" which is nothing more than a lot of unnecessary and often silly sub-titles. It could have been a great DVD, but the extras spoil it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have the guts to say it...","review":"Since no one else will, I'll point out what the problem with this movie is: it has aged poorly. The first half is still pretty funny, but it peters out into a bunch of badly dated special effects.The DVD was highly touted when it first came out as being \\"loaded\\" with \\"goodies.\\" Well, I have come to pretty much ignore extras on dvds at this point, but I will point out that compared to the extravaganzas being released these days, this dvd is nothing to write home about.This movie will always be noteworthy for becoming such a huge hit, but time has not been kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible pan and scan ruins classic","review":"This is a review for the VHS version of the film, which is why I gave it only 1 star. I love this movie, being turned on to it as a small kid and always making sure it was in my collection somehow. I bought this tape version before I got a DVD player, and was horrified at the way it was produced. The biggest problem is the pan and scan. Usually in a film it isnt that apparant where the scanning took place, but here the entire movie shifts as the tape struggles to show you everything on film. It's a jarring effect and takes away from the film completely. If you need this great movie, either by the original release or get the DVD. The DVD is the only way to relieve this awesome film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghostbusters","review":"Shipping and seller was great, but the game cannot be played by more than one player which causes conflict if you have more than one child. It is a disappointment considering my 9 yr old would rather watch the movie than play the game"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THE DVD !","review":"I saw the DVD-Version of the film yesterday. There is abolutely no discussion, that this picture is a cult-film and a masterpiece. But even better than the film itself, are the extra features on the DVD! You must have this version! Video-Documentary, 2 featurettes, Storyboard Comparison, Making Of, Trailers and more... This is by now the best DVD I've seen. Other great examples are: Boogie Night, Alien, Matrix"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghostbusters [Blu-ray]","review":"This is a review of the Ghostbusters [Blu-ray] release, not the movie itself.First let me state I am not a true technophile. I really don't know a great deal about the differences between resolutions, other than know that one resolution looks better than another. I have seen a lot of things in high definition and while I sometimes think it can be too much for some movies, I've rarely seen anything that looked bad... until now.The transfer on this version is complete garbage. It looks so bad that the DVD versionGhostbusters Double Feature Gift Set (Ghostbusters / Ghostbusters 2 + Commemorative Book), which I already have, looks BETTER. Even if they GAVE this Blu-ray away for FREE, it still wouldn't be worth owning. It saddens me to think that a beloved movie can be treated like utter trash by the movie studios who clearly rushed this version out just to make a quick buck.Take my advice: save your money and wait until Sony releases a restored version."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality","review":"the picture quality was blurry some time for paying 5 bucks but the over all movie was great love bill murry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny classic movie!","review":"We love this movie it is so funny. Great vaule and shipping was fast. Its a must have for your collection. Family movie night for older kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Comedy, Truly a Collector Series DVD","review":"Very good DVD with lots of extras. Let me start by saying the picture quality on this disc is excellent. The sound is good, but not as good as I thought the 5.1 mix would be. I'm sure you know or have heard what the movie is about, so I won't go into it. I will tell you it's a funny comedy that still holds it's own till this day. Aside from liking the movie, what really made me want to purchase this disc was the extras which is enough for any Ghostbuster enthusiast. Compared to other DVD's out there, this is a good title, but if you want to get picky, two minor flaws keep it from being perfect. The audio, and somewhat clunky menu system."},{"rating":"2","title":"holds up well, I think","review":"With the advent of streaming, easy-to-get video, it's never been simpler to get your hands on old comedies from the 70s and 80s that you enjoyed when you were a kid.Tragically, most of them don't hold up well: a lot of the comedies that you rewatch this way (e.g., \\"Caddyshack\\"!) don't have a single laugh anymore.But I say the first GHOSTBUSTERS is an exception: thanks largely to Bill Murray's usual sarcastic demeanor, it doesn't seem to have aged much. Still a watchable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not play","review":"I think I received a defective DVD. It will not play on any of my players, Blu ray or regular player. Very disappointed and too expensive to return. I wish sellers would check out DVD's before shipping them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghostbuster (UMD for PSP)","review":"Ghostbuster (UMD for PSP) was a game I bought accidently while looking for the DVD disc. I found I couldn't use it, and contacted the seller right away. They handled the situation excellently. I was able to sent it back with no problem and have the credit taken off my card. I would rate the seller as a five star company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Transfer is HORRIBLE!","review":"The one star I gave this is due to the poor Blu-Ray transfer, not the movie which is great. I cannot believe Sony would release something this horrid. The upscaled DVD version is so much better. I am only running a 42\\" 720P TV. I would hate to imagine how much worse it would look scaled up to a 1080P resolution. I am very disappointed having wasted my money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic '80's Comedy...","review":"They don't make them like this anymore. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson bring \\"Ghostbusters\\" to paranormal comedic heights. The movie starts with an ominous tone, but travels straight into comedy with one of the best comedy scenes ever with Bill Murray testing two university students for \\"the effects of negative reenforcement on ESP ability\\". The comedy (and the supernatural suprises) grow from there.It's a fine example of comedy with a heart, with a soul. The kinds of comedy I wish was still around in movies today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"Great movie, great quality! Just like I remember from the older tapes, it's got a lot of fun features and overall, updated Blu Ray quality only adds to the film's fantastic reworking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghostbusters Original Movie","review":"DVD set arrived in a most timely manner. Movie was as entertaining now as when I saw it in the 80s. A good price for opportunity to re-live some great memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"some of the best lines...","review":"You know a comedy film like this is a classic when you can walk up to people and essentially quote it's most esoteric errata, such as:\\"Would you like some coffee?\\"\\"Would I\\"\\"Yes, have some.\\"\\"Yes, have some!!\\"Without even knowing which characters are speaking which line, it's still silly and funny as hell... and the lines from \\"Ghostbusters\\" (an especially well written script) create many bonding moments between those in the know... much like \\"Stripes\\" and \\"Caddyshack\\" this one's a comedy classic that remains as funny as the day it was released.Oh, and the special effects still work... before cgi jaded our senses, it took good ol' foam latex to make many of these creatures come alive (with a dose of good ol' rotoscoping). The entire tech team for this film were masters of their craft.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BLU RAY TRANSFER","review":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND HATE TO GIVE IT A 1 BUT THIS IS NOT BLU RAY QUALITY, THERE IS NO WAY THEY HAVE DONE ONE UPGRADE TO THIS FILM VERY GRAINY.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like comfort food.","review":"Ghostbusters is still a silly, feel-good film I can watch over and over again. I must admit this supernatural movie used to creep me out when I was little but I like the energy the cast brings to the film. Bill Murray sure cracks me up, love his sarcasm and body language. Dan Aykroyd and Sigourney Weaver also bring great strength to the film.

Overall, there are too few enjoyable scenes in 90 minutes.Fans of the cartoon series will certainly love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree - Transfer was awful!","review":"I completely agree with the rest of the one-star reviewers. My blu-ray collection is up to about 100 discs, and this one is one of the bottom 3 in terms of most atrocious transfer to blu ray. The graininess is annoying almost all the way through, but the place in the movie where it's the worst is in the library scenes, whenever there is wood work in the backdrop. Eventhough the price is right for this blu-ray, save your pennies. Transfers of other classics from the 70's/80's (2001, Omega Man, Trading Places, Towering Inferno, etc.) are WAY better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghostbusters dvd","review":"This is still a very funny and original movie. You can watch it over and over and still laugh. This is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the \\"entire family\\"","review":"Since my younger boys had watched the Star Wars series with us, we thought a PG rating from the mid-80s was probably going to be fine. The littlest one wanted to see the \\"ghosts\\"!. Not a high number of \\"ghosts\\". They were disappointed. And the end is just too scary for most under at least 8. My entire set of boys (8 and under) hid under the covers. \\"possessed\\" people are hard to explain.

The book focuses on healing via tarot, runes, crystals, I Ching, astrology, numerology, synchronicities, dreams, guided imagery, chanting, prayer,ritual and even channeling. If these are the methods you are interested in, then this is the book for you. If, however, this is not something you believe in or want to dabble in then this book is a waste of time.

Mr. Leonard should leave these things to the likes of Cormac McCarthy and truly great writers. I'll admit that this was the first walk with Leonard I've taken and it won't be my last, but for an author to have written as many novels as Leonard has you would think story mattered a bit more. In Maximum Bob, Leonard relies too heavily on thin characters that are put into a bare bones story. I will give a cheer to the dark humor that pervades (although it could have run a bit darker for my tastes) throughout, but still the thin story has its characters little more than walking/passing through places, page to page. Perhaps age and leveling energy levels had started catching up to Mr. Leonard about the time of this novel. Contractual obligations are what they are I suppose...obligations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly a spellbinder; more of a snoozer","review":"I found Leonard's book to be uninspired and unsurprising.

Despite how firmly I secure the carrier to my 5 gallon bucket and how few tools I insert in the pockets, the carrier slides off after a short period of time. Very ittitating to have it and the tool end up on the ground. This happens with only one ot two tools or none. Spend too much time having to reattach several times only to have it slip off again. Totally defeats the purpose of its use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"I should have listened to other consumers alerts. It looked so handy.

Once set down in the yard and forgotten for a few minutes, or left for an hour's lunch break, I'll need a dog to find it again-- it blends right into the greenery. Nobody buys a green garden tool more than once.And a former reviewer is right-- there's too much velcro around the (important) bucket strap, and this tool will be useless in a few months, as the velcro clogs with dirt and twigs. Further, if the bucket isn't exactly the size the manufacturer had in mind, the velcro wrap won't hold.Phooey."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"for the price i paid i thought i could get the tools with it but when i opened it there wasnt even a bucke i was so disapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Send this one back to R&D...","review":"It doesn't come with a bucket to wrap it around, so no big deal, eh? I've been to SEVEN stores looking for the right sized bucket...they're either too little or too big. The buckets I have looked at: 10 qt., 2 1/2 gallons, 3 gallons, and 5 gallons. All but the 5 gallon bucket are too small, and the 5 gallon bucket makes the belt loop S_T_R_E_T_C_H to barely meet the velcro attachment . And the hanging hoop lock is positioned right in the middle of nowhere, so it will attach to absolutely nothing, except the handle, which renders the belt loop/velcro enclosure useless.

It couldn't be easier, just strap it on to a 5 gallon bucket and you're on your way. No more running back and forth to the garage for tools because I have everything I need right at hand, and more importantly, no more lost tools. I have lost more weeders and hand pruners than I care to admit to, but now they go right back in thier pocket. I use mine for light pruning, weeding, and planting, tossing the weeds and cuttings in the bucket. It also saves me a lot of time when planting flats of flowers. I just pop the flowers out of their cells and stack them up inside the bucket and plant away. I plan on buying another one so my husband and I can both be working in different areas at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bucket Organizer","review":"This is a simple and functional product.

The only way to comment them is to expound the full mening of each one of them, or at least write longer treatments on all of the themes. The reader wants to know fully that the single proverb implies. Any commentary achieving less that this can hardly be called good. Most commentaries do fail in this way (often due to the series' format), and are thus deficient. This goes for Murphy's commentary too.

Mr. Hill gives an excellent breakdown of the development of the ironclad battleship from the early broadside ships and monitors of the 1860's to the pre-dreadnaughts of the early 20th century. Included are sections dedicated to the very active birthplace of the ironclad battleship, the American Civil War, and a later section with highlighted battles of later years where the new weapons played a role. Although obviously written from a British perspective, the details help bring the reader into the painful early days of evolution, and explain the changes that helped bring about a classic weapon of war. While not having a great deal of data on individual ships, it is a very good broad inspection of the topic itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy, gluten free snack","review":"This is a yummy gluten free snack that has a short ingredient list for those of us with multiple food allergies.

But Bob Hoskins and Robert Loggia are unbelievably awful and the rest of the cast are not much better.The concept was fairly original or at least the most extreme take on an unoriginal concept, but at the last minute it gutlessly pulls back for a lame moralistic ending.The directing, production design, and editing are all about as bad as you will find in a mainstream production. Bad enough that the movie would be a useful bad example for students in film school.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie with something missing.","review":"You have a movie called American Virgin - it stars Mena Suvari and has the comical Bob Hoskins - why was I bored?It has a really good concept and the cast sounds really appealing but it was not as I expected it.Mena Suvari plays the Live Virgin who will lose her virginity on air when she hits 18. I felt that her character was dense and was not brought out enough.Bob Hoskins plays the director of Live Virgin. He has some great humour and his character is great...but there was something missing.I think there is something missing from the movie as a whole. Although there are some funny moments I felt a little uninterested as the film progressed. And then you have the big finale which is exactly as I expected...happy ever after.

When I bought this cd, I listened to it once, admired it without much liking it, and put it away for about a year. When I listened to it again, I discovered I had missed out on a few brilliant tunes.Favorites: \\"Lullaby,\\" one of the most beautiful and depressing tunes I have ever heard. \\"Another Man's Vine,\\" a great bluesy vocal on a song of infidelity. \\"Coney Island Baby,\\" just a great Waits love song.Again, a good album, but not for beginners. If you're just getting into Tom Waits, buy Closing Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD was in great condition and I love it","review":"This is my second Tom Waits album, and I must say: I am impressed.

A middling Tom Waits is still pretty damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing lycrical and musical originality","review":"This album is a stone cold gas. I wish I had discovered it long ago. It is reminiscent of Zappa in its antisocial disregard for musical and subjective conformity with srange time signitures, harmonics and odd, mostly acoutic instrumentation, with it feet in a refurbished version of american music rowdys side of blues/jazz and folk balad.

It should be a remarkable production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic, poignant, and darkly funny.","review":"Unless 1999's *Mule Variations* is the single best Tom Waits album, this one gets my vote.

Cookie Monster has swallowed Tom Waits and is singing on his new album!Lyrically, Tom Waits is a master. Vocally, he has offerred up one of the most unique voices in the history of rock & roll. But seriously, on Blood Money, Tracks 1 and 5 could serve as soundtracks for Sesame Street with Waits offering up the voice for Cookie Monster!Anyone who has purchsed this CD, do yourself a favor and listen to most ANY track on this record, and you'll be swept back to a childhood memory of one of Jim Neson's finest creations! It's a guaranteed laugh!Tom - There's no way you can expect music consumers to take you seriously here, and I suggest that you put a little more effort into future efforts- or dial up PBS and the Children's Television Workshop for your next release.I can't recommend this CD at all because the vocals are laughably bad...but maybe that's the intent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Compared to other Waits classics like Rain Dogs, Swordfishtrombones, and Bone Machine, this new album is honestly terrible. The fine craftmanship of Waits' best albums is not evident at all in Blood Money. Instead, the music just seems trite, boring, and even irritating at times. In my opinion, Blood Money isn't even good by non-Waits standards. I was greatly looking foreward to this release, and after hearing it once, I sold it immediately. I would rather stick to Waits' previous (and far superior) past releases, because there is just no comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondering in the darkness","review":"This is one of the two new albums by Tom that have been released (\\"Alice\\" being the other). This album is dark, dank and macabre when it comes to all aspects of the music (music, lyrics, feel, presentation, etc.) The music is like circus music that only Satan himself could write. Mix his \\"Bone Machine\\" and \\"The Black Rider\\" albums, and you get the sounds you'll be often hearing with this album. The difference with \\"Blood Money\\" though is that this album uses very little electric insturments, and the tempo is overall much slower to boot. His lyrics are still top notch. His wicked wit is evident on \\"God's Away on Business\\" and his sweetness still surfaces occassionally on songs like \\"Coney Island Baby\\". Overall I can't give it a five star rating, but it's damn close. I'm not sure this album reaches the overall greatness of \\"Mule Variations\\", \\"Heart of Saturday Night\\" or \\"Swordfishtrombones\\", but it comes pretty darn close. A mandatory purchase for all Tom Waits' fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in the Harbour","review":"This CD is the yang to Alice's Yin. Kathleen and Tom are suchunique song writers. This one really reminds me of SWORDFISHTROMBONES. The poetry ever unfolds no matter how many timesyou hear it, it never seems to repeat. Tom's voice finds a placein your soul that is not necessarily a safe place. There is com-fort though, much like a shoulder to cry on in the face ofcertain death. And yet he always does such a great job atremaining a stranger, sort of like a homeless person.We love you Tom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still can't find the mold they made him from","review":"I discovered Tom Waits back when I was in college, which I shudder to think is now twenty-five years ago. Same gravelly voice playing instruments he seems to have found in some foreign junkyard and sounding like they came from an old dream about an old movie about a time long ago. Mind you, all of this these are meant to be complimentary. I just love they guy, and find it amazing that he still keeps on doing what he seems to want to do year after year. There's nobody that sounds remotely like him.So we have another album by him, and the only fault I can find is that I like other albums of him better. Of course, I've been listening to those for years, and they have an unfair advantage, and perhaps I'll edit this review as time goes by. But this is a quality work by someone who is no where near the end of the trail. I have a feeling that more familiarity over time is going to have this one grow on me.

AWFUL TRANSFER! The sound quality is pretty good but the picture quality is deplorable. The colors and shading actually pulse!

This was a vaunted Superbit transfer carried out by Sony. This ripping yarn deserved much, MUCH better treatment. The clarity is not there and at the least, the images should have been stabilized.

It's always fun to go back in time to some of the blockbusters of the era. \\"Guns\\" was nominated as a best picture in 1961 losing to \\"West Side Story.\\" I thought David Niven as explosive expert Miller was really good here and Gregory Peck leaps into stardom as well. A fine script moves the action along although there are certainly some parts that could have been cut. As were most of the movies of the time, the film was shot for a broad audience (PG) which unfortunately holds it back in terms of viceral brutality.

It's not only the fact that there's no sense of urgency in the entire situation, there's also immensely fake scenes featuring a soldier mowing down an entire German platoon with one burst of machine gun fire. Add to that about two other platoons with a grenade for each and you've solidified the film's camp value.I don't have anything against 60's films. As a matter of fact, I love a lot of films from that era (Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur) and there are some very exciting action films from that decade such as Where Eagles Dare and the entertaining The Dirty Dozen. Guns of Navarone is just never as tense as the premise could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still fun to watch!","review":"Although not the best movie set in World War II, this might be the most fun.

It's one of those songs that glues itself to one's mind. Take The Work Song and its lovely lyrics...soothing, and peace inspiring.The Nick Cave comparison doesn't really strike me as appropriate. WGC's vocalist sounds a lot like Nick, but the music is also a lot different. It might appeal to Cave's fans though.

Superman's Song from CTD's 1st album would fit right into Mojave -- almost. Mojave feels less contrived, less hook oriented. Its soul is truer. Its dark and ominous storm clouds weighted with rain. Each song is superbly crafted. This would be the perfect album for driving along country roads at dusk. Its a puzzle why WGC chose to inlude Go Jimmy Go. On its own it's not a bad song but a rocker like that is a definite mood ruiner when listening to the whole album.Why only 1 star? I didn't like them.

This was Lou Diamond Phillips' debut film and he puts on a solid performance throughout. It shows how Valens rose from being a migrant fruit picker, to performing with an amateur band, before getting signed and finding stardom with such hits as 'Donna' and 'La Bamba'. This also looks at his fraught home life and stressful relationship with is alcoholic brother. This film has some great music and tells the story of Ritchie's short life in a rich and engaging way. It feels a little dated now, but still makes for just under two hours entertaining viewing and it makes you appreciate Valens' music all over again.

Maybe it's just the fact that it is so real, based on a true story, on a real person's life... and a real person's tragedy.The film is a journey through all possible emotions - right from the hope, then the dream that has come true, and to the end of it all. Which is, when one considers it, maybe not purely tragic. 'Cause like the ancient Greeks believed: There is no greater happiness than to die when you are most happy.It is left unsaid how much of La Bamba that is actually not based on real happenings. But the makers of the film have, unlike so many others who base films on 'true' stories, succeeded in eliminating the less-credible details, and they have made everything seem very real and very relevant.A heartfelt, warm, and cathing film.

Noone captures the spirit of the person better than he does. The way he makes Alice Adams come alive makes me want to be there and meet this wonderful young lady. If an author can make me want to do that, he is excellent in my book.The movie ending is the opposite of the book ending, which disappointed me, because I wanted it to be true to the book. Nevertheless, I also wanted Alice to have her dreams come true. If you really absorb yourself in the book, however, you will see that her dream DOES come true, just not necessarily the way you want it to.There is also the beautiful way he paints the whole family into the book. I won't give it away, but you will see the intricacies woven in.I found myself totally absorbed in the story and couldn't stop reading it.Please read this book!

When you send something to the printer you cannot do anything with your computer until the printer starts printing...VERY annoying. I didn't see any printing as fast as the specs suggested. If you print on cheap bond the wet ink soaks into it and the type is blurry. You can't use a yellow highlighter pen or the ink smudges. Pick up the prints before they dry and it will smudge.

Needless to say I am looking for other options. Sure it seemed like a great deal...the price was low and the reviews were good...but beware.

Problems with the auto power-offWorst, after a period of about one month without use, I found that the black ink printer head had clogged. The cartridges were not run dry, nor did I use anything but original Canon ink. New cartridges did nothing, nor did repeated deep cleaning. I even used alcohol and Q-tips without success.

The pages skipped and got all out of order- and in a three-hundred page book, that little error will kill you. Enter the Canon S520. What a marvelous piece of equipment. It is fast and accurate and allowed me to print an entire 290 page book, on two-sided paper in a little over an hour! I'm not kidding. As for the photos printed on the Canon, their special paper really brings out the depth of color and resolution. I also have the Canon EOS Rebel Ti camera (bought from Amazon last Christmas) and I couldn't be happier if you pinched me! Canon is a fantastic electronics company.

It features individual ink tanks for each color so that you only have to replace the tank that's empty but the ink runs out at warp speed. The last black cartridge I bought only lasted 12 days--a real shock considering the printer is for my personal use and only used occasionally. Printing on my old Lexmark printer was never a problem--the cartridges lasted a good six months at least. You'll spent a lot of time browsing the Troubleshooting portion of the manual-everything from why the printer isn't responding to why it tries to print but there's no ink on the paper.

It is a print head failure and the print head costs as much or more than the original price of the printer. I have always been a fan of Canon printers, but now I must rethink my loyalty, because it is unacceptable for Canon to behave as if the performance of this product is acceptable.

Hah!. They sure were accurate about the lifetime. But the cost!. More like USD150!. This is ridiculous. I have now bought an Epson C86 and I am furious with Canon for deceiving me. I am also angry that all the environmental pollution that resulted from making this printer was in vain; its not economically repairable, so it will have to be dumped; more pollution.

The data being sent to the printer stops the computer from working and if it's many pages be prepared to wait for your computer work again (My Epson doesn't do this). The print heads constantly clean themselves...wasting ink...after 100 copies of something my black ink is almost out!

However, they do not protect the fingers enough and I stopped using them due to this (I was coming out of class with my hands torn and bleeding). Also the palms gave out fairly quick with little bits of material falling off all through class which I found annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a woman","review":"Reading the description makes it very clear these are good gloves, however nowhere does it specify they are for a woman. It wasn't until i realized they also sell them in pink that they are girls gloves, and naturally did not fit when they arrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received","review":"I never received these. I'm sure they are great but between the company that sold these to me, and Amazon, I got nowhere with any of them. It was like throwing $20 away just because of the frustration of not getting anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting to receive my order","review":"I ordered the black version on Jan. 8th; it's Jan. 21st and when I called they said the order was lost in the mail, they couldn't track it. Amazon said they would replace it, sending it via 1-day service.Then I get an e-mail saying 1-day service doesn't apply to PO Boxes ... the customer service rep couldn't have said that on the phone and given me the chance to give a different address? Now we have to wait another week ... if it doesn't get \\"lost\\" again.Not happy with Amazon right now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for punching bags","review":"I bought these gloves to be used in my new punching bag, trying to improve my strength, but after 15 minutes of hard use, I had both hands with injures. I don't know if these gloves can be useful for other kind of use, but to be used with punching bags, NEVER !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Knuckles take damage","review":"We got both these and a pair of more traditional boxing gloves to work out on our new freestanding heavy punching bag. My son tried these wraps first and got large pieces of skin scraped off his knuckles after a few minutes. He's still soaking one knuckle in epsom salts and using a topical anti-biotic because it became infected. Thinking he maybe didn't use them correctly, I tried them myself and stopped after only a short time when I noticed I was starting to lose skin on my knuckles as well. We both switched to the traditional gloves and found them just right for bag work. I suppose these wraps are good for some other purposes, or perhaps after you've developed tougher skin or calluses from use. If you ain't already experienced and toughened up, I wouldn't use these. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"My boy loves them","review":"The gloves are exactly what my boy wanted and he loves them, he uses them every day. They keep his hands protected when he workes out with his heavy bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too small","review":"They look like they would work nice for my needs but they are way too small. I got them for me to use but they won't even fit my wife who has much smaller hands than I do. For the price I paid for them it is not worth paying return shipping to get my purchase price back so I will give them to a child that can use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"These hand wraps are really nice. The hand wraps include Ever Gel which is the yellow part on the wraps that are yellow/black. Compress-X strap gives maximum support for the wrist. Ever Cool simply keeps the hand cooler than regular hand wraps. In my opinion, get these if you don't feel like wrapping a wrap around your hand every time you want to go hit the bag. I have these and i take them on and off all day because I am constantly at the boxing gym or at my house hitting the bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"careful - they smell bad!","review":"I use these as gloves (I know they are not) for a kickboxing class and they are very comfortable - so that is not my problem. The problem is that after a month they stink so bad that I can't get the stink out! Washing doesn't even help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I wish I had read the reviews here before I bought these wraps this week. I've used them three times for moderate work on a heavy bag and they are already coming apart along the knuckles. I figure they may last another 2-3 weeks before I have to toss them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product ever","review":"Cut of the circulation in a couple fingers (no, they were not too small), and came apart at the seams almost immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terri le Quality","review":"Used these once with Torso Bob and the sewing around the knuckles started coming apart. The gel inside started falling out. I would not buy these, horrible quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"tear away my heart","review":"I was so excited to receive this item. I paid for 2 day shipping. I got it and the first time I tried to put them on the mesh on the top of the glove tore at the seam. My hands are large, but not huge and these are the XL size. They don't have a larger size. The gel was nice when I was hitting the bag with them so if your hands are smaller and you won't have to work hard to put them on, it might be a nice purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really protect your knuckles","review":"If using these as stand-alone MMA gloves: My knuckles would still bleed using these (and I don't punch hard at all). There's just not enough cushion with these gloves. IMO, don't waste your money with these, get the Harbingers, they cost more but they protect a lot better. I actually prefer punching without gloves or with just regular hand wraps than using these gloves.I don't understand how you can use these as wraps under boxing gloves because they're too big to fit inside gloves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No support and already falling apart.","review":"I bought these to wear under my heavy gloves as a replacement for my regular wraps to make transitioning from my class's warm-up (which often includes playing catch with a medicine ball so wraps get in the way) to our heavy bag work easier. These don't hold a candle to plain old wraps that cost a heck of a lot less. They give absolutely no support to my wrists or the small bones of my hands. Just not enough material. The gel seems to me to be more \\"cute\\" than anything. A couple of wraps around my knuckles with my old wraps seem to offer as much if not more protection. To top it off I've been using them two or three times a week for a month and the mesh next to both thumbs has already ripped through. I guess I just need to get more efficient at wrapping my hands with traditional wraps during transitions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"Used these one time, and silicone gel beads were leaking out of the gloves. they fit well, and provided good cushion for your hands, but I don't know how long that will last if it is leaking after the first use."},{"rating":"2","title":"gel gloves","review":"I bought theses for my daughter and she loves them...They fit great and are very comfortable and they were the best price we found.We received them within days of ordering them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item different than picture/description","review":"The item I received was a different model then the one I thought I was getting. Which resulted in the gloves not fitting because they were too small in that particular model, while the model I ordered would have fit me perfectly (because I tried them on at a store)Other than that, the package arrived on time, and the return was easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for an easy on and off glove.","review":"If you need an easy on wrap for some quick or light bag work, these work just fine. Remember they are to be snug. And yes, they are tight to get off after they get sweaty. If you train daily, these take a while to air dry, so get two pairs. I'm a little old school, so learn how to wrap your hands with wrap. It's boxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality","review":"Being an avid amateur boxer, I was constantly plagued with sore knuckles and hands for constantly hitting the heavy bag day in and day out until I got these EverGel Hand wraps. The cushioning for the delicate bones of the hand is phenomenal. They don't offer much in the way of wrist support though, but simply wrapping the hand wraps with traditional boxing gauze fixed that problem easily. As stated in another review, these wraps are designed to be worn inside boxing gloves, not by themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"smalls are extremely small","review":"I wish I could say that these are awesome but I couldn't even get them on. I have small hands. I am 5 4 and my pinky barley comes out of my mma gloves. I was hopng smalls would be perfect. Well these things were tiny. For a very young adult at best. O well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Were great for a while...until they fell apart!","review":"I purchased these because they seemed like a good alternative to wrapping my hands. And they actually worked very well for a few weeks. But then, they started falling apart! The EverGel is still on the glove, but all of the black fabric has fallen of revealing a thin mesh. If you intend to use them every once in a while, they'd be fine, but I certainly can't recommend these if you intend to use them on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to Go","review":"I use these WRAPS under 16oz gloves, all the time and have no issues. The problem is people are reviewing them as a replacement for bag gloves or getting the wrong size for their hands. Your best bet as I saw in another review is to try some on in the store to find out what size is good to go. These are wraps NOT gloves. If the wrist strap is not covering above your wrist it's because you have the wrong size. These are great and are easy to get on and off. The only gripe is the cross straps should have a longer piece of pile material to secured them better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Teach a cardio kick class and they work perfect.They aren't super heavy and not to bulky. Much easier than using wraps"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a case of mistaken identity","review":"These in fact are intended to be used as bag gloves. If it was only a quick \\"wrap\\", there wouldn't be any gel in the knuckles. Once your hand is in this glove, it cannot fit into a standard boxing glove.This glove has half fingers which have elastic at the ends. The elastic is so tight that it cuts off your circulation in each finger and is useless. Otherwise, this is a good glove and provides good wrist support, but will wear out quickly.I've used the Harbinger brand gloves for years, with absolutely no problems or injuries. Although Harbinger WristWrap Bag Gloves are twice the cost, the Harbinger are far superior.Harbinger 320 Bag Glove WristWrap (Black)Since these are one of the most important pieces of equipment that you will have, don't compromise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't protect your hands, quality issues.","review":"My wife if fed up washing my wraps because they tangle into everything in the wash and dryer, so I looked for alternatives and really these might be the only legitimite possibilities. I really wanted for these to work and so, despite the mediocre reviews I bought them. They look cool but really don't work:They are hard to squeeze under the glovesThey don't protect your knuckles - I've never had such damage when using regular wraps.\\"Gel\\" beads started to find their way out of the padding after one use.I was too lazy to take pictures of my knuckles after use but I should have. That alone should tell anyone who actually hits the bag with any force, not to use them. Regular wraps aren't perfect but they do provide superior protection and better wrist stability. I'm returning these."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good either way","review":"these are meant to use as hand wraps but they suck when using with gloves over them. the fingers curl back and they dont function anywhere near as good as taking the time to wrap the tried and true way. as bag gloves they will tear very quickly. i wish someone had told me this info before i had purchased..they are pretty comfortable i will give them that but i have decided through my own experience this a fad item or a trend...i went back to wraps .once you get into a habit you can wrap good in a short time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the alternatives","review":"Before purchasing this item, I used a hand pad and regular handwraps to work out on my heavy bag; Now, I almost can't bear to use the traditional handwraps! They cushion and support my hands perfectly, allowing me to switch from traditional boxing to open-hand bag strikes without worrying about hurting my wrist from a lack of support. Two notes of caution, however: 1. They don't cover the finger knuckles very well, so it is probably a good idea to invest in some tape to cover these spots, and 2. If you are hard on these gloves, they will tear open at the seams. But hey, for $20, you wouldn't expect to have them last forever, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"Almost a good product. I had the same problem with seems coming apart.

She was unable to get them on her hands since they were so small - they were painful to her. I cannot comment on their utility since she was never able to use them!
