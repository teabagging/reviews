Except for a few decent action scenes, I would have rated it one star. I had fairly high expectations of this movie based on the opinions of some friends, but ended up falling asleep a couple times during the latter part of the film due to sheer boredom and finally just stopped it about fifteen minutes from the end. By that time I had no interest in how it ended and just watched something else instead. Good thing I only wasted $5 on this turkey, but lost over an hour of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Terrible, boring, waste of time. My husband and I both thought it was awful.

MANHATTAN character,the film failed to impress me and entertain me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No fan of Graphic Novels or their films.","review":"Watchmen was chosen for being uniquely different from the standard \\"Super hero\\" formula. These characters were in fact, totally new to my eyes. (Never have read the titular graphic novel) I did appreciate the opening title scenes, as they gave the viewer a quick primer of the Watchmen origins/mythos. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see it through. The story could not keep my attention or interest. Knowing this thing runs 2 1/2 hours, I bailed even before all the characters made it to the screen.

It just is NOT a good movie for non watchmen fans and I wonder about folks, even if fans, that thought this horribly boring movie was actually good. The first 15 minutes is all I could say was even the least bit entertaining. The rest is horrible. I wish i didnt rent this garbage movie. Ir really does SUCK bad and I had to turn it off half way.

Of course, this should not stop you to watch it. I would wait for the obligatory \\"extended\\" cut, but it is your money. It has its pleasures, such as the (violent) story of one of the vigilant heroes (Rorschach) and some slick visuals. The rest is a tired saga of puppets saying supposedly profound stuff, ala \\"Dark Knight\\". The good thing is that, unless we get \\"Maus\\" on screen, Hollywood must now get their ideas from other sources other than comics (and I am relieved by that).Note: I did not read the comic. As with any medium, comics can also contain masterpieces that can shape our understanding of ourselves and be tools for a better future. I simply do not trust the way by which Hollywood can handle the best works of this genre, being this film a proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long","review":"great special effects with a good storyline and good ending. Problem is that most of the super hereos were average at best. It was way,way too long! I could cut out 30 minutes of this movie and miss nothing. Too much blue junk. Cover that up!

I left the theater saying that I could never sit through that again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is too graphically violent.","review":"I went to see Watchmen with high hopes.

If this is why Alan Moore took his name off the movie, I can understand why he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie is a Joke","review":"This is easily the worst high-profile movie I saw in 2009.Here is what you get:- a lethargic action thriller riddled with dialogue exchanges that could put an insomniac to sleep,- some dark and psychotic scenes full of perverted violence,- a pathetic sex scene with latex-clad superheroes, and- an absurd ending which the director and screen writer may have considered quite wise, but is in fact complete and utter nonsense.The whole movie is a joke, so stupid at times, that I laughed helplessly at my own misfortune, having paid to watch it.By the time it ended most other people had left the cinema.UPDATE: Wow, what a backlash! It seems that even if one makes a meaningless, long, overly violent (at times) and otherwise profoundly boring movie with an absurd ending, there will still be people out there who would feel passionate about it.For an artist this should be a depressing thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow & Long","review":"Loved the CGI but the drama was taking for ever, plus too long.

There is never any indication that a story is unfolding. Other than the skull hatcheting piece by bloody bandage head guy and the arm sawing through the jailhouse bars scene, there's little to discuss or keep you interested except maybe well-hung blu guy Dr. Manhatten driving girl to glowing blue extacy. A freaking, jigsawing, nightmare. Intended strictly for comic book advocates who enjoy speed viewing tales of their super heroes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Snooze Fest","review":"I have nothing against noir, but that seemed to be the focus of this movie to the point where I lost interest in the first ten minutes, which seemed to be one big dragged out scene showing the blood on the street trickling onto the smiley face button. Outside of that, I can't remember a whole lot about the movie as I fell asleep within the first half hour. I woke up, watched a bit more, fell asleep again. We finally turned it off and never finished it. It was that good!I'll give the director points for noir, but as for pacing and plot and just keeping it interesting, this is one of the worst I've seen in a while.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from a non comic book fan","review":"Let me start by saying that I'm not a comic book fan. I didn't even know the Watchmen exist before I went see this movie. So excuse me if I offend any of the hardcore fans.To me this movie is good and bad at the same time. The actions scenes are just superb... but those are too few and too far apart to make this movie good. For me 2:40 minutes siting in the theater is too long unless you care to provide a really interesting movie. I got so bored between the action scenes that almost leave the theater. They should just cut this movie to be 1:30 minutes tops... and then release the 2:40 minute extended version for the fans or make it a two part movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish! Rubbish! Rubbish!","review":"I could not understand what on earth this movie was about! I gave up after one hour(the longest hour of my LIFE!!)

I managed past halfway.I don't understand why they make this sort of stuff. Who is the target audience? It can't be 10 year-olds, cos the action is not fast enough. And it can't be adults, cos it's utter nonsense.I can take a bit of superjunkism. Like I thoroughly enjoyed The Incredibles. But that one was funny with likeable characters. I even liked District 9, for some reason I could relate to the personal story, however farcical the setting. But this one is ridiculous without being funny. It takes itself way too seriously to be enjoyed by adults. And there is no personal story to relate to. The only remotely likeable character is Rorschach, but he's too one-dimensional to keep my interest for the whole movie.I wonder if I can get a refund from the video store. 3 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've tried to watch in years","review":"Terrible movie, I can't believe people are rating this garbage so high. Glad I only wasted $[...] renting this one, I tried to watch it, but after about an hour and half of absolute agony I ended up fast forwarding through the last hour just to scan and see if anything at all of interest EVER happened....it doesn't! The characters were dull and just seemed to be alcoholics that love to curse for not reason (and these were the good guys). I think about 3 of the heroes superpowers amounted to mega-pottymouth! Lamest movie I've tried to watch in years. Just when I thought it couldn't possibly get any slower and boring, the movie picks up the action by having one of the 'good' superheroes try and rape another one....when that happend that was it for me with this one, these are no kind of superheroes I want to know anything more about, or being 'watchmen' of anything of mine! Definitely not one for the kiddies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T DO IT !","review":"I rented this movie for $4 and I overpaid by $3. It is horrible from the beginning to end. It always looks like it's gonna turn around and become worth watching but it never does.....NEVER!I gave it 1 star and that's only because some of the \\"special fx\\" were good [not great].

Only liberals could hate this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to sit through","review":"I, my wife and my 16-year-old daughter watched this Blu-ray together. We are all sci-fi fans, but we found it very hard to sit through this movie. My daughter in fact went back to her own room mid-way. The special effects and cinematography are top-notch no doubt, but the movie just starts and stops, starts and stops too often. If you are a teenager, you would feel like you are starting to play a video game for 2 minutes, and then your mother comes in and tells you to do your homework for 30 minutes, and you have to obey. And the cycle keeps repeating. The dialogues are long and hard to fathom. Sorry, but the protagonist (Dan) has more the look and presence of a second supporting actor. Overall, what a waste of all that production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too long","review":"Though some think they were cheated by the Theatrical release, the best version this is not. It is too long, disjointed, annoying, and prone to itchy fingers on the ffwd button. The intermediate Director's Cut seems to be the best version. Enough of the cut scenes to fill in the gaps, and extraneous material thoughtfully excised.I am not a fan of G. Butler, and the animated inserts did nothing but kill the momentum of the story, leaving the audience searching for \\"meaning\\" in the garbled diction and blurry vocalizations. (I found myself searching for the transitions, jumping too far past the boring animated sections and the newsstand banter.)\\"Watchmen\\" is a complex, convoluted and well textured movie, and it often requires multiple viewings to grasp it all. Slogging repeatedly through 3 plus hours becomes more a chore than entertainment. Ultimate cut in length, but not ultimate in entertainment.This is definitely a case of \\"Goldilocks\\" where the middle version is just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it.","review":"While the effects are great...it gets bogged down. It maybe somewhat faithfull to the comic but it just lacks. It had all the makings to be a great movie..budget..the dark feel. Yet as for myself I really do not care for the sex scene..okay so he went to pound town on her? Do I really need to see...no.It is visually stunning but other than that...it is best as a rental. Due to the fact that it drags itself forward it has little replay value to me.Yet if you can get it for 8 dollars it's a solid deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans will enjoy","review":"My friends and family hate this movie. It may be an acquired taste. I enjoyed repeat viewing of this film. Great PQ & AQ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"It took long enough, but this is the definitive Watchmen movie experience. A must-watch for fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watchmen Cometh!","review":"This film was a near-revolution in movie-making, based on a novel tough to make into a movie. The two-disk DVD added a great deal to the entertainment value, explained how the movie was made, and the extended version DVD helped make the story more understandable and entertaining visa vie the theatrical release. One can only hope that other attempts at making movies of leading graphic novel will follow this successful release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick sex, vivid violence","review":"This has got to be one of the longest films I've ever watched but I wished it would never end. It's hard to organise my thoughts into a coherent whole but here are a few pointers:- Jackie Earle Haley deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of hard-as-nails Eastwoodesque vigilante Rorschach- Billy Crudup deserves an Oscar for Best Actor in a Nude Role- you get to see superheroes making love- the music blows your mind: Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, 99 Red Balloons (in German)- there are more ideas in the first five minutes than in the whole of most Hollywood releasesThis movie made me wish I had read the original comic strip in the 1980s. In fact I've never read comics seriously but I understood (I think) and loved every minute of The Watchmen."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"This movie is the human condition. Director's Cut is definately worth it; the original movie is missing some very good material."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Commentary","review":"I bought this version after watching the extended version and not being overly impressed with the additional content. I liked the flow of the Theatrical Cut better and figured that I would not miss the added scenes. What I did miss was director commentary. There is none on this version only on the extended cut. I found this really annoying and hope the huge box set coming out this winter will fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"Great movie but I have two problems. 1: The motion comic discs are obviously recycled and they didnt bother being careful unwrapping it and shoving it in this edition. 2: When trying to remove the cardboard card, the stickers holding it on tore the front"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too big for the small screen.","review":"I was captivated by this movie in the theatre and it does lose something on the small screen. Since the look and overall tone of this movie is quite dark, even on my plasma I had a hard time seeing the beauty and detail I remembered from my first impression. It could be that I was dazzled by a new story or just the fact that movies are best enjoyed in a huge cineplex, but I did feel myself squinting a lot. The additional content was enjoyable and added more to the story from my perspective. Plus I like the fact that I got a digital copy. I don't think I'll buy any more movie unless they come with the digital version. Maybe the studios will get the hint if we all do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Action","review":"5 Stars!!! A must buy for Blu-ray owners, noir fans, comic fans and detective stories... Great extras to..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watchmen in a confined space.","review":"Formost, I read the Watchmen as they appeared in comic book form. When I heard there was going to be a movie, I immediately said it should be done like Lord of the Rings; that is a long movie released in 3 parts. I was actually pleased the movie was done as well as it was in a shortened format. Spoiler alert! The only deviation, and part I didn't like was making Dr.Manhattan the fall guy for a sinister plot instead of creating the alien form that was transported to New York to fool the world into thinking they needed to unite to defeat an alien attack. Other than that, I feel the script/novel was followed close enough, the actors were perfectly chosen for their parts, and the overall movie was excellent. I did miss Captain Metroplis who actually chaired the first, and only, meeting of the Crimebusters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Watchmen review","review":"This movie is great for people who like the action of the super hero genre but are tired of the cheesy plot lines. For once a super hero movie carries depth and offers critical thinking to its audience. The blu ray special features are definitely a nice touch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a little more than the usual stop the bad guy with your super powers cliché."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!...But Still Getting Screwed Over","review":"The movie is great and it is loaded with a ton of extras. Unfortunately they completely screw you over by putting in a $[...] off coupon for the \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition.\\" What a bunch of crap. This is a great movie, full of extras, and should have gotten a five out of five, but since they decided to screw you over with this \\"Special Deal,\\" it will only get four out of five.Sad Day...but I'm still getting the Collector's Edition..."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-Star for Double Dipping:","review":"The movie was fine, I'm sure the directors cut will be good too... what isn't cool is packing in an advertisement for $10 off the Ultimate 5 disc Collectors Edition which will be available at Christmas. They're not only double dipping you, they're telling you after you buy the product that you're being double dipped.It's really not cool to slam fans like this... The 5 disc version will include the Tales of the Black Freighter intercut with the rest of the film. It will also have the Hollis Mason \\"Under the Hood\\" documentary and the motion comic.So if you already bought those discs and you buy the movie you're pretty much SOL. You're getting triple dipped at that point.Tell the movie companies that you aren't going to play their game. Pass on this preliminary edition, rent it if you want, and then buy the real 5 disc version when it comes out at Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Ultimate Cut Bundle","review":"I hear complaints of movies being \\"double-dipped\\" as a re-release and I must say: so what. The contents are those of the previously available Ultimate Cut Blu-ray but with noticeable cover art changes. Plus it is also lacking the obnoxious scalper price of $180 or more for the previos version. Hard cover Absolute Watchmen also included. Keep in mind that the graphic novel included retails for $40 or more. You are certainly getting the best value for the ultimate watchmen experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition","review":"The set is great for a fan, with the hardcover book and extended cut of the film. The ultraviolet version included seems more of a pain than anything, and having the director's cut on DVD would be frustrating if you don't already have that blu ray. Not having the film be a branching version where you could choose the \\"ultimate\\", \\"director's\\", or original theatrical cut is a glaring oversight, especially as there is no way to get the theatrical version on blu ray, at all.For what's presented, it's quite good. Just don't consider it for a casual viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Way To Watch The Watchmen","review":"If you've not seen \\"The Ultimate Cut: Watchmen\\" then you've not seen the film as it should truly be seen. This is the definitive version of one of the greatest comic book film adaptations of all time, containing all deleted footage plus incorporating the animated \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" for the best possible page-to-screen adaptation possible for one of the finest comic books ever produced. The box and artwork in the packaging is also impressive, making for a wonderful box set that I personally now consider the only way to really watch this film. The Director's Cut was great, make no mistake, but once you've seen The Ultimate Cut you won't want to watch it any other way. Even if you didn't like the theatrical version of the film, give this one a try, because the difference is like night and day."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Watchmen fan waited for this version.","review":"If this movie inspires the viewer to read the original comic series, then it has done it's job. I think it did it's job very well!;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Amazing","review":"This movie is pure amazing now I'm not going to lie the theatrical version was a great movie but it didn't capture a lot of the important points the book made. But this ultimate cut was amazing. When they mean ultimate they mean it. I love the way the beautifully edited tales of the black freighter in the movie. The ultimate cut of the movie is worth the price already but they give you much more, they give you commentary with the directer and over 3hours of special features. And it comes with the motion comic that is a page by page of the comic book but its in motion and it has voice acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Ultimate Cut","review":"If you waited like I did, then this is what you were waiting for. Excellent edition of fantastic movie. Integrating Tales of Black Freighter is something that brings more to the film. Even though it's longer with it, but I have no problem with that.

But the truth and price that was too high for some of the other heroes to stomach. This was science fiction at its best. I wouldn't recommend this for younger or teenage adults because the violence and sex scenes are too graphic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great comic movie for the older crowd.","review":"My family got this movie yesterday, and I have to say, this isn't a movie you want to show your underage comic fan. I'm not saying that cause it didn't stay true to the ending; I'm saying this that like the title says, this is the shot in the arm that the superhero genre needs in the film industry.I really like this extended cut of this film. I didn't get to see this in theaters , but I can tell when a movie had added scenes. AS a fan of comics and animation, the Watchmen graphic novel really set the standard in graphic storytelling, and like the book counterpart, this is what superhero movies should be. I know there are a lot of this film that didn't stay true to Alan Moore's vision, but I think that this is a great movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"UK DVD Customers' Choice","review":"Why aren't Warner Bros releasing this two-disc Director's Cut (+ Digital Copy) here in the UK?

This is another shot in the foot for Warner execs."},{"rating":"1","title":"watchmen dvd","review":"I'm a fan of comics and comic movies, but I didn't like this one. Too slow and not for the younger fans. Too adult oriented and not a very good movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"high budget self indulgence","review":"Unfortunately, Zak Snyder (perhaps proving Alan Moore right that the book is not translatable to film) brought the same flash-over-substance ethic that he displayed in \\"300\\". At least in general terms, the adaptation was fairly spot on, as was the casting. In my opinion, this movie fails because the flash, in the form of gratuitously violent fight scenes, obnoxious stop-motion work and painfully long closeups, crippled the complex and otherwise thought provoking story. Add a horrifyingly bad soundtrack and you have 3 hours of movie that inspires *headdesk* at the high points and suicidal tendencies during the rest of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walked out of the theatre","review":"Horrible movie. Boring, and certainly was a waste of my money. It was very hard to sit through. The commercials threw me off, of course I should have realized that part of marketing strategy is to fool consumers and show the best parts of the movies. There was no action like I expected, way too much talking, and the plot sucked. And for the kids? Yeah right, there was a soft porn scene in it, with kids in the theatre. But then again, the film was rated R. But if thats the case then the Spice channel which shows soft porn should be available for everyone to watch, it was literally the same thing. That probably was the highlight for many people in the cinema, but it did not help the movie. Sometimes I wonder why producers and directors go on with movies if its clearly a horrible project. Horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave this 1 star but not even worth that!","review":"HORRIBLE movie!!

We are subjected to 2 1/2 hours, almost all of it exibiting the lowest behaviors known to man... rape, mutilation, murder, baby killing, and corrupt government leaders (in this hell, nixon is still president!).

At any rate, the soundtrack sucks with over political overtones of the lost 60s, and believe me, if the soundtrack sucks (I would exit a bar that played any of this), the movie does too, cause there is no movie classic with soundtrack that sucks. Even Thank God It's Friday disco movie had an award winning song in Last Dance. Now that was a real exit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal piece of work.","review":"Only time will tell, but the Watchmen will probably turn out to be one of thefinest films ever made, up there with Citizen kane.When I first saw the Watchmen at the theater, although I enjoyed it, I just didn't get it, finally when I read the trade paperback, and then watched the directors cut of the movie, it all came together.The watchmen isn't a Super Hero story in the traditional sense, its essentially a science fiction murder mystery based in a parallel Universe. with some Super heroes thrown into the mix.If you are looking for the usual Super hero fare, then the Watchmen isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love this movie. Lots of eye candy visuals.Kept me interested the whole way.The ending made a lot of sense, but pay close attention throughout the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watchmen-Collectors Edition","review":"I felt the theatrical version of the film was outstanding and was very interested in this version when it was announced. There was almost nothing about that version that I did not like. I will not try to itemize the many differences in this version. About 25 minutes of extra film enlarges the parts of many of the main characters and includes the death of the original Night Owl with flashbacks of his own days as a hero. Overall the longer version does have some excellent material.However, one of the parts of Watchman I was not as happy about was the very graphic violence which in the theatrical version was right at the edge of snuff film quality. This version adds extra gore and horrorific violence to almost every seen that was already almost too much. Unless you have a very strong stomach this is not the version for you.Disk 2, the extra's disc is also a disappointment with very little to make it worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Good, Audio/Subtitles could be better","review":"I watched this through a Tivo HD to a 1080p Sharp (2-Ch audio). The video quality was terrific!!! However, it seems that there is an issue with the audio down-mix for Tivo devices. The audio remastry effort should be done to THX standards, so you can hear the dialog!!!! Even more frustrating, there were no subtitles with this movie, so I was forced to turn up the volume to hear the dialog, but when explosions happened - I had to rush to turn down the volume again. It's REALLY terrible if you have to mess with the volume during the entire movie, it takes you out of the \\"illusion\\" of the movie and makes you focus on the playback hardware in a bad way. Tivo if you're reading this, put some foot-to-*** with the content provider, since this affects your customers!!Lack of subtitles meant I had no backup for getting dialog, had to suffer through it instead. Good movie though, I'll be buying it on Blu-Ray where it's done right."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Movie for the Fans not the Masses","review":"I know the fans of the Watchman series of illustrated novels appreciated the movie. I am not familiar with the series but excited to watch the movie version. Well I was disappointed. The movie seemed to rely too much on prior story lines that so often I had no idea why characters were acting the way they did. I am not a prude but the romantic scenes were more distracting than helpful to advancing the movie. I felt the parts mostly came together at the end but I felt underwhelmed. Sure I could watch it again and get a lot more out of it, but frankly I don't want to bother - it just isn't worth it for the rest of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Directors Cut not worth it","review":"This is a rip off. I at least expected the Director commentary on the Director's Cut, but Oh No....you have to wait for the Christmas release.I'll be renting that and not buying another version.

I've never heard of the Watchmen before this movie so I had no idea what it was about. I thought the movie had an interesting story about super heroes being killed off but all the side stories with them covering their origins bored me to tears. That's my biggest problem with the movie. Most of it is boring. It's very long and very boring. I didn't care about any of the characters. They're all depressing. The movie didn't pick up until the last 20min and by then I was already half asleep.Watchmen fans probably enjoyed it more than I did. I'm a huge fan of super hero comic movies. But this one did nothing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"\\"Director's Cut\\" versions of movies like this one are evidence why movie studios are generally wise to not give final cut to most directors. I did not see this movie in the theatre, but at three hours it was at least 90 minutes too long.And even then, it left me bored and baffled. I never got to know any of the characters, so it was a lot of special effects and kung fu action (which is why 2 stars instead of one).Doubt I'll be pulling this off the shelf again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying.","review":"Who watches the watchmen? Watchmen (2008) is supposed to be a film adaptation of a graphic novel by Alan Moore. The film takes place in an alternate 1985 where Nixon has been elected for three terms and where Russia and the USA are about to engage in a massive nuclear war. The \\"doomsday clock\\" is set at 5 until midnight. Unfortunately that's all the movie offers. The superhero characters are rather pathetic. The only character that is even moderately interesting is the disturbed hero Rorschach. The Dr. Manhattan character which everyone raves about is particularly stupid. The film is disconnected, goes nowhere, and is utterly boring. The ending with \\"The Smartest Man in the World\\" falls completely flat. And, the homosexual undertones, rape scene, male nudity, and gratuitous sex scenes certainly aren't helping it any. Ugh. Ultimately I feel that it was pretty boring and not worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptional Story - Unecessary Gore and Violence","review":"The story line is exceptional. Movie stays true to the comic and has flashes of greatness that COULD have been enjoyed by the whole family had the director not felt the need to include large amounts of gratuitous, unecessary, and ultra-gruesome violence. I think it would have actually been MORE effective to have left much of the violence to the viewers imagination. Without the graphic violence, this would easily have been a five star review. Love the movie, but cant stand to watch it. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"This city is afraid of me","review":"In \\"Watchmen -the ultimate cut\\" it's the actual film & it flows so much more appropriately than did the theatrical cut. Even some of the dialogue & references are much more cohesive especially to the non Watchmen fan. With the inclusion of the animated short, \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" woven into the film, its absolutely one of the best, ambitious, & original films of 2009. It's better than perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosphical Treat!","review":"Even if you aren't familiar with this as the \\"graphic comic\\" (I was not), you WILL enjoy the philosophical ponderings of this movie.The authors had fun tweaking history and the super-hero theme, and made a great story. NONE of it is predictable and MUCH of it addresses Thomas Sowell's \\"unconstrained vs. constrained\\" model of the 2 human visions. If you are curious, see A Conflict of Visions.the plot is complex (at least, that is how the details of the story unfold) and requires your undivided attention. This story is long in ideas (and length, too) and short in \\"emotion.\\" It's not, imho, intended to illicit emotion but thought.And it is fun! It has a genuine HERO character who's vastly entertaining and has a Top 10 hero quote!It's also a little rough around the edges (see \\"graphic\\") and still a treat to watch. Make sure you set aside plenty of time and few distractions to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you could ask for...","review":"While I won't waste time reiterating what countless others have said, I will simply state that Watchmen the movie completely lived up to the bar set by Watchmen the comic. That's not to say one is better than the other, but simply, as a film, it worked. There are slight differences between the source material, but that's because their are differences between film and literature.Fans of the comic will not be disappointed, and the same goes for fans of great cinema. This movie climbs my list of all-time favorites, competing with the likes of Fight Club and The Prestige.Don't listen to the incessant yammering of people saying it was boring or stupid. Watchmen is a lot of things, but neither of those. If you feel it's the latter, do yourself a favor and watch X-Men Origins: Wolverine. If you want a real story, full of realistic and flawed characters, all beautifully crafted and put together with genuine love and affection for the source material, then look no further than here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"Loved the book, loved the movie.

My only regret is that I have yet to read the graphic novel, but it is on my list for the very near future. Fantastic movie.

I've seen it two times and both times, it didn't feel that long. Apparently a lot of people thought it was though. A lot of people found it boring or stupid... well they're wrong. That's my honest opinion.This film has a ending that will make you think and I guess people just didn't want to watch a movie that made you think. Well, whatever screw them, what do they know? They were probably the ones who wanted a 3 hour action film. Well that's not what this is. There are a few action scenes, but that's it. Just a few.And yes, there is a lot of CGI in this film, but that doesn't take away from what its really about; the characters. It's over 3 hours long but as I said, it didn't feel that long to me.

A fantastic bore where character's voices become a drone of redundant expression. Blah blah blah, after the first 3 hours (yes its that long) it really doesn't matter what the script is, it all sounds the same. So much visual emotion is expressed in the first 15 minutes that the rest leaves the viewer numb and in a state of sheer bordom. This goes for everything, the sound track, the graphics, the gore, the script... its so dramatic and intense that it cancels itself out.Imagine if the great Star Wars trilogy was originally 3 years long. You'd want to murder the Ewoks by the first 12 hours and Ja Ja Binks the next (if not sooner)... now you've got 1094 days left to fill watching the same not-so-dramatic dialog repeat itself for the next 1094 days.

It was at least 2 hours too long, had very few decent scenes, and was crappy, cliche and over stylized. Most of the acting was horrible, wooden and hammy. There was not one character that was not a complete $h17 bag. This movie was grim, dreary and depressing for the sake of it. The action scenes were brought about by completely manufactured scenarios and the violence and gore was way over the top and completely campy and corny. Many parts of it were so dreadfully boring too. Oh and Mr Inkblot..... That voice drives you up the wall after a while, it sounds like he has laryngitis and severe constipation at the same time.

It's got everything a film like this really needs: surrealistic superhero action, fairly sharp social commentary, discomforting but thought-provoking moral and ethical ambiguity, awesome ninja moves, some disturbing gore, and a smattering of gratuitous sex. Unfortunately the acting is spotty, some of the dialogue is puzzling and a few characters seem a bit wooden. And yes it suffers from cliches and some of the score selections are questionable. (Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" in the Nite Owl II/Silk Spectre II sex scene? What an oddball, distracting song choice.) But taken as a whole, it's a real epic and great fun to watch.

This film is the next best thing. Although it doesn't capture all of the graphic novel in its entirety - how could it? - it does a great job with those bits that it does. The ending has been changed somewhat, but I thought this had been done in a way that was actually a bit better than the graphic novel in parts (the disaster at the end of the graphic novel does come off as a bit absurd), although Dr Manhattan's decision at the end is ultimately not satisfying (and a bit similar to the Batman's decision at the end of The Dark Knight, come to think of it...). The characters are all very well cast, with the exception perhaps of Dr Manhattan, who is just a bit too CG-ized for my liking. Oh well, why be a scrooge when the framing was so masterful, and Rorsach so superbly crafted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait for the deluxe edition","review":"Great movie!

In my opinion, it's not as great as I had hoped. The only good things about this are the fantastic action and visuals. The fascinating character of Rorschach is also a welcome addition. But sadly, everything else doesn't add up. The characters aren't fully fleshed out (even the flashbacks aren't enough). The script needed some improvements (there were some silly dialogue here and there). Malin Akerman and Matthew Goode were horrible in this movie (couldn't they have at least tried?). Of course, it's just my opinion. It's fine my me if you love Watchmen. But to me, this didn't keep me interested. I give it a D instead of an F, mainly because of Rorschach and the special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, but a very boring movie","review":"First of all, I want to say that I looooove the graphic novel and I would recommend the book to anyone. The movie on the other hand was a bit on the boring side. I don't know quite how to explain my disappointment, but I will say this. I love Batman and I love Ironman, I know their stories from the comic books and I love the way they were portrayed on film in the last couple of years. Watchmen let me down because it was EXACTLY like the novel and there was really no reason why I should have watched it; thus, making the movie really boring because there was nothing new for me to enjoy.The Blu ray is jam packed with features that are really enjoyable and I could only recommend watching it if someone already owns this or if you're a die hard fan.I can recommend the graphic novel, but I wouldn't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dang It !","review":"I'm sorry, but this movie just wasn't that good.

I have no idea what the hell the plot of this movie was Perhaps my brain blacked it out to protect my conscious self from realizing that movie was actually worse than I remembered it. Do not watch, do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted 2 hours of my life","review":"This movie was by far the worst movie I have ever seen in the theaters. It is not my cup of tea as it is unlike the other superhero movies that were produced. There is no plot nor direction and way too much dialogue where sometimes the dialogue was excruciating slow. At times, I did not understand what was going on and I was paying attention. Also, Dr. Manhattan has to be one of the worst superheros imagined. He had all the power to do basically anything he wanted and he ends up killing one of the main characters for no reason.Can't comment on the Blu-ray because I do not plan on buying this bad movie; I'm sure the video quality and sound are excellent as well as the special features."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero stars I would","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed other \\"superhero\\" movies like the first two xmen, the second and third spiderman, and the dark knight, and being mildy amused by the third xmen and first spiderman, I'd have to say this movie was an utter disappointment. Unoriginal, predictable characters that you can't even love to hate, minimal action, and an utterly depressing plot (if you can call it a plot)that drags on and on and on and on... this movie stinks on so many levels. Even MST3K wouldn't have been able to do anything with this stinkeroo! If 2 1/2 hours of complete torture is what you desire, then I completely recommend this movie. Otherwise run... don't walk... run away and pick up ANYTHING else! Even the Fantastic Four outshines this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!","review":"VIOLENT, boring, endless, a waste of time.

They spent way too much time building the characters. The story line was slow and couldn't end fast enough. I kept thinking the story would improve but it just kept getting darker and darker. When it ended we were left extremely drained and very depressed. I felt sorry for the actors for having to work with such a horrible script. I hope they find better scripts and directors to work with.

I'm a huge sci-fi / fantasy buff, serenity, buckaroo banzai, sin city, lotr, you name it. Love em. Some camp or poor effects but a great story? I can easily handle that, but this movie...was awful. It's far to long, the back stories are painfully boring for the most part, the thrown in for no reason sex scenes were gratuitous the action scenes were bland. It was just bad. The really sad part is the actual underlying story if done well has huge potential, but someone obviously worked very very hard to make this movie awful. It would be a toss up between having a tooth pulled or being forced to watch this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and borning","review":"I do not read the comics as most people who watch comic movies. This movie very little back story and even a hour into the movie I could not figure out what the purpose of the movie was. Super heros who rape and murder?

I vote this a skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after all the hype","review":"This action movie sins in the worst possible way - it's boring! There's no sense of fun anywhere (see 'Iron Man'), and the action sequences are dull and predictable (has no one seen the 'Kill Bill' movies? They came out years ago!). Even the acting was pretty stilted - I thought Rorschach was pretty decent, but everyone else was bland, bland, bland.I dunno - maybe it doesn't help that I never read the comic book (excuse me, \\"graphic novel\\"). I wonder if this is what it was like for outsiders to watch 'Lord of the Rings'? In which, for me, it was ultra-cool to all my favorite characters come to life, and I loved every entrance and how faithful it was to the book; I was just overwhelmed. Maybe this movie does that for 'Watchmen' fans, I dunno. But for me, I couldn't wait for the end.(The disparity between die-hard fans and everyone else might also explain why the IMDB rating is a very high 7.9, but metacritic is significantly lower at 56)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abortive at best...","review":"Rubbish.

Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoyed 300 or enjoys a good mix of humour, violence and plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and decent","review":"This is more or less a straight adaptation (down to the dialogue, even) of the comic, with the big exception being the ending. And to be perfectly honest, I prefer this adaptations ending over the original - it makes more sense. I'm not going to pretend to be a film critic and try to act pretentious either. I'd just simply recommend this more for those who HAVEN'T read the comics, or just huge fans of Watchmen (who have probably already seen this a dozen times.)By the way, the Directors cut literally adds nothing much beyond lengthening the intimate sex scenes and exposes Manhattan's penis a bit more. That's it really."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like dark movies you'll like this one","review":"Just a bit silly at times and you'll likely have to watch it more then once....But , all in all I enjoyed it. some times too much detail and background history, and other times you wonder whats going on.I like the old \\"graphic novels\\" and movies that are made from them , like Sin City. While this one is not as good in my opinion as Sin City, its still entertaining and well worth the 3 hours to watch.A bit gory and violent so not really sutible for young ones, but if your looking for something a little different... Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't rent from this item listing","review":"Just a tip not to rent from this Director's Cut listing... you'll wind up renting the theatrical version instead.

This movie covers some pretty intense subject matter. I suppose if I would have known that I never would have viewed the film.

I rented it, and didn't think it was all that great! There were some sweet bloody scenes, and some cool special effects, but the rest was very boring. When a superhero called The Comedian is killed, Doctor Manhattan, Rorschach, Silk Spectre II, and Night Owl II try to figure out why. Rorscach was my favorite character because of his attitude. I really didn't like the way the movie ended. I wouldn't recommend WATCHMEN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH","review":"I had great hopes for this movie when I purchased it, but was sadly disappointed.

I finally bought the movie because it was on sale and was excited to finally get to see it. It was a bit of a disappointment, however. The first hour nearly had me ready to turn it off, it was so boring. I managed to make it to the ninety minute mark before giving up and honestly, I am unsure if I will try it again. Life is too short. Maybe fans of the comic will appreciate it more but it just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The version that SHOULD have been in theaters","review":"Once you see the footage previously cut from the theatrical release, you'll never understand why any of it was cut. Hollywood's allergy to long movies is complete nonsense. Do not buy the theatrical release--it is missing too much good stuff.However, the bonus disc is crap, plain and simple. The featurettes are, for the most part, too short and overlapping. The longer featurettes brow-beat the viewer with what an amazing, revolutionary comic book The Watchmen is, and never venture far beyond that singular idea. The film is better than the comic, but the film is never explored in any meaningful way.If there were a way to buy the Director's cut sans the worthless bonus material, that would be the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Awesome","review":"This is a fun little thrill ride. What I liked most about the movie was how true to the comic the storylines were and the outfits. All in all, the only thing I didn't really like about the film was how it felt like all the other comic action movies like 300 and Sin City as of late with this forced noir feel about it. That aside, great movie I highly recommend.

REALLY BAD MOVIE","review":"I'll second the other reviewers here... but first let me say I have been a Full Moon fan for years... this is not only one of their worst films, but one of the worst films by any large video production company I have seen. Zero redeeming qualities... bad acting, inane script, crap directing, and heck, even bad background music. DON\\"T WASTE YOUR TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bargain or waste of money?","review":"I saw this DVD cheap in a shop and was expecting to take home a modern day 'IT', made in the year 2000- relatively new. However, I should not have wasted my money. It is a low budget film, with a script written by a high-school student who obviously has NO talent. The costumes and storyline are awful and there isn't a scary bit in the entire film. Music is cheaply made by those that produced the film and even if it isn't supposed to be taken seriously- it's definately not funny! It is described as an 'ethnic' film in the making of it, meaning you feel as though its exclusive to black people with the jokes and dialect. I cannot believe they made a sequel!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YO CLOWN! WE KNOW YOU IN HERE.","review":"This is a low budget African-American horror film that develops into a better franchise. Michael (Jamal Grimes) has a crush on Jada (Vera Yell), who in turn is the girlfriend of bad boy Lorenzo (William L. Johnson). Lorenzo and his gang are bullies and thugs. Michael attempts to use black magic to conjure up something called \\"Killjoy\\" which we know nothing about, or him as there is no character introduction.Things don't go well for Michael and we jump to a year later where the remaining cast must combat Killjoy, a magical killer clown with an ice cream truck transporter. The acting and lines were fairly bad. There is a magical homeless guy that really isn't explained. The clown was rather repulsive, and that was by design...I think.Parental guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Napiera Groves, Miss District of Columbia 1997)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...Lemme explain this film","review":"No, this film will not under any circumstances be nominated for an Oscar. It is incredibly low-budget, as if it is a senior class project for a TV productions class. But it's entertaining. You can pick out all of the horrible acting moments, or the non-existant special effects, cliches, etc.My boyfriend works at Blockbuster so I didn't have to pay to see this, which is good. But I'm still glad I saw it. It's always nice to see how some people actually have pride in the horrible job they do.Do not buy this movie unless you are like, Oprah Winfrey rich. Get something better. Something that actually had a snowball's chance in hell of being released in the movie theaters. Just take everyone's word for it--it's not good.

OK the story was horrible, come on a kid accidently gets shot, but luckily he summoned his doll clown before he died, to kill people of course. So to sum it up, even if your a big horror movie buff like I am, you can pass this one up, just not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corney, stupid, and plotless.","review":"Killjoy is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. None of these actors could act their way out of a paper bag. The only one with any talent is the clown. I have to agree that he is a combonation of Tim Curey and Jim Carey. Yes he does get rather annoying, but so does all the useless cursing and the pointless nudity. The little nurd boy bringing a killer demon into the world to avenge him is so cliche, along with the being consumed by flames and run over with a truck. The gangster in love with the good girl made sense, but I believe a gang consists of more than three people. I think this is the worst Full Moon Pictures can do and I hope if they make any sequels for it, which they left it wide open for them, that they are better than the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say...","review":"That hasn't already been said? This movie manages to take what seems like a simple yet intriguing plot and turn it into a 90 minute festering pile of dog s**t (sorry to be so descriptive). The acting is extremely poor. Be sure to emphasize the extremely. The characters are moronic. A lot of the film does not make sense, for instance, towards the end of the \\"movie\\" when the three main stars of the film are in some sort of Satanic-Killjoy circle, one of the kids tells the others that they can't leave the circle. How the hell does he know this? It's stupid. This is horrible. And not so horrible it's good.

But now they have vanished, with no explanation whatsoever from the label or the band. What gives? Is Eric Carmen so insecure that he refused to release something that wasn't polished and perfect? The tracks DID appear on the hits collection that never came out (except very briefly via a record club). In place of that carrot that was dangled in front of fans of the band, another collection of previously released tracks is issued again. I guess fans are expected to buy this for the cover art.

Furthermore, rumors of the inclusion of unreleased demos (e.g. \\"I Saw The Light;\\" \\"Overnight Sensation\\") on THIS particular release proved false. Damned if I can find a BMG copy of the 2000 compilation with the four demos; thanks again, Capitol!

Normally I can overlook the bad parts of a child-oriented movie, but this one has SO MANY! I think the reason is has struck such a bad cord with me is that the other Thomas videos are so GOOD! I really have to say that Peter Fonda's performance in this move was just plain HORRIBLE! I mean, really, just BAD! The plot was terrible, and the cast (other than Baldwin, who tried really hard) held all the charm of manequins.For a 2-year-old child, this movie is fine.

The original books were carefully credible. That is, the trucks \\"hold back\\" always on uphill and yell \\"on - on\\" going down. All equipment was based on reality. Awdry was indeed a railfan after all. The best of the Thomas videos are the earlier ones based on the original stories. The later ones are progressively more fantastic, with an engine floating on a collapsed bridge or a manevolent boulder and a steady sucession of new engines seemingly needed only to sell more toys.

Clearly not like the cheerful TV shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Scary, But My Kids Love It","review":"There are some parts of this movie that might be a little scary for little ones, such as Diesel 10 threatening Mr. Conductor with his \\"Pinchy\\" claw attached to the top of his cab. But I have a 4-year-old boy and a 2-year-old girl, and they both keep requesting to watch it again. Some parts of it go really slowly, and my kids lost interest easily the first time they watched it. However, they liked it enough that they requested it over and over. Not sure how much enjoyment adults will get out of it; I thought it moved slowly as well. Overall, a decent movie appropriate for *almost* the youngest Thomas fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"The voices are the best actors","review":"The acting in this movie is horrible! The best parts are played by the trains them selves. My son loves the movie but is only 3 and only sees Thomas. The story is okay and I like that they use the original look of Thomas but that's the only good points of the entire movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is unwatchable ...","review":"except, apparently, if you are a 3-year-old boy. But my son's taste has always been a little suspect. He also likes the My Little Pony book his grandmother was suckered into buying him at the drug store. Ick. However, I'm giving the movie two stars because it got us through several plane trips (along with Babe, which is a fabulous movie) on a portable DVD player. Gotta love technology. I haven't gotten through the whole film yet, so I suppose I should reserve judgment. But what I have seen borders on absurdist theater. It makes little sense and appears to be one non sequitur after another. I love that Alec Baldwin and Peter Fonda signed up for this one. Though, it might be Peter Fonda's best work yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even for kids it is horrible!!!","review":"My 2 year old (who loves Thomas) doesn't have the patience for this VERY silly and poorly acted, directed, and written movie.

MY 4 YEAR OLD SON LOVES IT! His hero Thomas plays the role of, well, the hero. He meets a new enchanting character, Lady, whose chugging spins out the railroad's magical energy, gold-dust. There's a villainous train, Diesel 10, who is just scary enough for a youngster.The movie is great for young kids, so why are all the adults critiquing it from our adult expectations of entertainment? Yeah, Peter Fonda is so flat that I wish he'd go drop some acid. And the child actors are horrible--and given preposterous lines to say. It looks like there was all of a $50 budget for the movie. But in spite of that, Thomas is just plain magical for kids. They will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"if it makes them happy","review":"my sons, who are 2 1/2, have just recently become interested in trains so i thought this would be great for them. we have plenty of kids videos that i can easily tolerate. all i can say is that if my sons didn't love this movie the way they do, it'd be in the trash. it's so bad i feel like it's almost an insult to my kids intelligence. the only redeeming thing about it is that there are trains in it. i feel very sorry for the people who made it, it's horrible. still, if it makes the kids happy, we just have to suffer through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents: Watch at Your Own Risk!","review":"Sure, my three year old son loved this as much as he loves all the Thomas stories, but my wife and I were horrified by how much the moviemakers decided to forget about any adult viewers. Fonda looks like he just viewed every film he made after Easy Rider and then was called to the set, and Wilson is much too old for this kind of little girl part anymore. I hope Britt Allcroft can improve on this, she owes Thomas fans, young and old, much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mara wilson. 4th may 2004.","review":"By looking on the advertisements, it looked fairly good. Mostly wanted it cos mara wilson was in it, i like her films, she is a good actress.

Not just for those who just like thomas the tank engine, it is kind of an adventure too. People who don't like thomas might absolutely hate this film, for me there is too much talking trains and it is great for an ill kid,especcially young ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad","review":"I hate this movie. I really do. My kids love it though, so that's why it gets two stars.This movie makes absolutely no sense to any thinking adult. There are so many errors it's annoying. And the acting...oh, my gosh. If it weren't for Alec Baldwin and the man who plays his nephew, there would be noone in the movie who could act.It's just an all around bad movie that should have gone straight to video. It's not even good enough to be a made for tv movie.But, of course, you kids will love it. And, if you buy it, you will be forced to endure it.s"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Magic Railroad","review":"My son is a train fanatic. He used to watch Thomas on TV all the time. I bought this video for him and he loves it. We have had it for two days and he has probably watched it 6 times (he is watching it now). His sister, who is 4years old also loves it. I have watched it with them. It was nice to finally explain how Shining Time Station fits in with The Island of Sodor. The special effects were age appropriate. The story was suspenseful, a little scary (kid sized), and also quite comedic at times. Alec Baldwin led a fine group of actors who took this children story seriously enough to make it enjoyable for the adults too. I did not care for the performance of Peter Fonda, but he is easy to ignore. I would recommend this video to any parent with a child who loves Thomas. The Magic is There!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas and the Magic Railroad","review":"This movie is just awful. The story is lame, the acting worse. I think that the Rev. Awdry would hate this movie. My kids and I are train buffs and huge fans of Thomas and His Friends. However, if this movie were our introduction to Thomas and the Island of Sodor we would not look beyond this. Alec Baldwin should retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Originals Are Better","review":"If your children have never seen a Thomas video before, this movie might be a cute choice for them, especially if they're preschoolers who play with Thomas trains.HOWEVER, if your children already enjoy watching the older DVDs, the original productions that don't feature Alec Baldwin as Mr. Conductor OR any people who aren't wooden, then I'd skip this movie. It confused my younger children and irritated my older ones. As a parent, I expected a \\"new and improved\\" version of our older Thomas movies but, honestly, the only thing Thomas And The Magic Railroad managed was the \\"new\\" part."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is horrible!","review":"We got this for our first child, and I wish we had \\"magically\\" lost this DVD after he was old enough to retire it. Having watched the TV series, this is so far \\"off the rails\\" with respect to the plot and characters, it's unbelievable. The story and acting is pretty abysmal on all levels. Alec Baldwin at least appears to be trying as Mr. Conductor, but Peter Fonda is PAINFUL to watch here. Did he get suckered into making this movie and then just deliver the most deadpan performance possible?Like a terrible plot line in a cheesy soap opera, I just wish it was all a dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - Save your money!","review":"Worst Thomas movie we have seen. My kids were yawning after 5 minutes and did not even make it through the first half. And of course communist Alec Baldwin is horrible, what a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"bizarre","review":"I agree with a lot of the negative reviews here. This movie is so unlike any other Thomas movie. My husband and I laugh at the acting and the storyline...it's horrible. However, my son loves it. So be prepared. If you want something your kid will like to watch...get it...but beware, you will want to poke your own eyes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"I did not receive this move when i was supposed to, which was before Christmas, but it was a good buy and my son absolutly loves it! Disappointed that i didnt get it before Christmas as i had paid for, but my son does enjoy watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kids movie!","review":"My son was constantly borrowing this movie from my dad, so I decided to order the movie. It arrived by mail three days after I ordered it, so service was prompt. I knew my son would love it, since we watch this movie ofter. A great movie that kids will love. Great for older kids who love Thomas, or for parents who remember when Thomas was first on PBS as Shining Time Station."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremendous disappointment for Thomas fans","review":"My 3-year-old daughter adores Thomas, as do her mother and I. We looked forward to this movie for months, but were all tremendously disappointed. Instead of seeing an entertaining Thomas adventure, we saw a film with a confused plot involving a parallel world in which a very depressing Peter Fonda was featured. Even in the Island of Sodor scenes, the Thomas action took a back seat to miniature conductors and magic gold dust.This may have been entertaining to some, but was grossly out of touch with the elegance of the original stories. The Thomas mania is due to the charm of Thomas and his friends, not the bizarre magical Shining Time Station. The makers of this film forgot what made millions of children adore the Thomas stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was Thomas DUPED?","review":"I saw this movie four years ago and I loved it. My sister was afraid of it, but not long ago she watched it with me and she loved it as well. But then I thought about it... the movie has more human scenes than train ones. So, was Thomas, that adorable, loveable tank engine, duped? Well, what I think you do not understand is that Thomas and his friends were created in 1945 by the Reverend W. Awdrey. He created the wonderful Sodor, with bright stuff. But putting in an evil diesel does not seem to make any sense. Because of all this junk, this product has lost a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the original--at ALL!!!!!!","review":"Although I understand the story all right, it looks like it would be confusing to very young children considering that it needs gold dust to get into the Island of Sodor. Compared to the original Thomas, this is a horrible movie. If you are considering getting it, I recommend that you get one of the original Thomas videos because I believe your child will enjoy that much more. Although some kids may like it, I personally don't like it at all. It takes ideas away from the original Thomases and it has real people which makes them become the stars and not the trains. The Diesel 10 guy wants to bite up all the steams engines with his pincher claw--and that would be scary to little kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alec Flips the Bird!! No one ever noticed before?","review":"Alec baldwin, while in the jaws of the diesel bully, in a close up of his hand grapping for his cutters, very clearly flips everyone the bird. He extends his middle finger in reaching for the tool, and pauses a second. I'd go so far as to call it flagrant. Of course, my two year old has no idea what it means, but I had a good laugh. I wonder though, what older kids (and their parents) might think?Anyway, my son loves Thomas, and loved the movie. I thought there were so many holes in the plot that you could drive several steam engines through them side by side. I actually found the plot difficult to follow at times. There are many better kids movies than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be zero stars","review":"Honest - I think this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I agree with the previous reviewer: kids who are young enough to be interested in Thomas won't sit still for the live-action scenes. And an adult who doesn't mind watching a typical Thomas video with a child will find this movie just excruciating. The \\"plot\\" is extremely tedious, and the acting is just plain awful. I have no idea why Alec Baldwin and Peter Fonda took these roles unless (1) they never read the script or (2) somebody backed a truckload of money up to their door. I would have rated it a zero if I could. Just plain bad. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very scarey","review":"I bought this for my son cause I heard it was good and he loves Thomas. I also wanted to introduce him to new trains. Well, as soon as Diesel 10 came on the screen, my son was screaming and crying cause he was so scared of him. That night he wouldn't go to sleep by himself either. I have put it away for now. I'm getting him the trains, including diesel 10 so maybe he won't be so scared of him when he see him next. He was enjoying the movie until he was scared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for the family of Thomas lovers","review":"My son was a die hard Thomas fan before seeing the movie. He loved the movie, and Thomas always has interesting stories and wonderful lessons for the kids. He will watch it over and over at home. The only negative I can think of are the names that Diesel-10 calls the other tank engines - nothing too bad - but does call them names. Also, Diesel-10 is a bad character who wants to get rid of all the steam engines, so there is an element of \\"bad\\". I thought it was just fine for my 3 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very scary compared to the other videos","review":"I have a two year old and rented this video when I saw it at our local store. Our son was generally puzzled and bothered by the live action sequences when he just wanted to see the trains. Additionally it had several scary sequences including the Diesel Engine grabbing and suspending the conductor in his construction claw over a chasm. I had to sit close to him during the entire video to reassure him that things would get better. Possibly a better video when he is older, but at 26 months it wasn't the best video for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE do not buy! It might encourage them...","review":"Painful. That is the word to describe it. My toddler LOVES Thomas and I and my wife with him. But this movie is an abomination, regardless if you know the other Thomas films or not. Alec Baldwin is halfway cute, but Peter Fonda gives the worst acting of his career (and I like Peter Fonda). The story is painfully puzzled together. It seems like the producers took words like gold.dust.dog.railroad.friends.magic.grandpa.horse because they knew that those words were popular with viewers and mixed them randomly into a story and hoped for the best.They also deviated from the concept in the Thomas films that there is some not-so-nice-behaviour involved but nothing more drastic. Diesel is not \\"Not-so-nice\\", he is downright evil and destructive. This garbage is not for young kids.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM!!! IT MIGHT ENCOURAGE THEm TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE!!! WHO KNOWS WHAT GOOD ACTORS GET WASTED THE NEXT TIME AROUND!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just really bad despite Alec Baldwin's best efforts","review":"Alec Baldwin is the only bright spot in this dog. Well, okay, the trains are good, too, but there are far too little of them in the movie. Peter Fonda is just awful, and the plot is truly befuddling. Of course, my 3-year-old loves this movie so I'm forced to watch it a couple of times a month. It took several viewings for me to figure out that the Conductor and his cousin were Lilliputian unless they were on Sodor. What happened to Tasha? And what about that little bluebird? Why not make it turn into a real bird at the end? Don't let your kids watch this--they might like it and then you'll be stuck with it. The Best of Thomas is a much better choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids used to the TV series","review":"This movie is quite a departure from the TV series.

Stick with the TV series........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coma-Inducing!","review":"Our two boys love this film; they love Thomas, trains, etc. No matter that the film does not make sense and is poorly made. We took them to see this in the theater and thought the misery would never end.The purpose of this video would be solely to entertain your little ones; and indeed it will. However, be prepared to suffer the agony of watching it over and over again. The writing is poor, the acting is terrible (including Peter Fonda, who seems to be sleep-walking through this role, and Alec Baldwin, who is capable of much better), and the story is impossible to follow and veers off into imponderable riddles. There is something to be said for mindless entertainment, but I would much rather my children watch something of quality which makes sense.If you can possibly avoid buying this for your children, do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love this movie. I've seen it six times. I think it is really cute and fun for the younger ones (I put it on when I babysit). Even though my 5-yr.-old brother liked it, I even liked it and I'm a teen. They have a great cast, Alec Baldwin (Mr. Conductor) was funny, and Michael E. Rodgers (Junior) was great playing the adorable carefree cousin. Mara Wilson (Lily) was OK, but I thought they could have gotten someone else to play her part. The \\"Gold Dust\\" was never in the Thomas the Tank Engine Series, but I'm glad they added that to the story line to make it magical.

Peter Fonda gives an abysmal performance, Mara Wilson is insolent, and the entire film is unbearably confusing. We saw this film three times in the Theatre until I revolted and refused to sit through it again unless I could bring along a book and a booklight. It is unabashadly horrible and I would avoid it at all costs. Do not allow it into your homes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definition of tedious","review":"The print version of the story hardly makes sense and this film even less so.

Misery in a box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the original Thomas videos","review":"My son received this for Christmas and I was so sad to see what Hollywood did to Thomas. The acting was atrocious. The voices for the trains were not the originals, nor were they anything even close, and they used \\"stupid\\" and \\"shut-up\\" more than once. My advice is to stick with the videos that have Michael Brandon as the storyteller."},{"rating":"1","title":"The trains were cute but this movie's awful","review":"For some reason I can't fathom my daughters love this movie, but sitting through it is painful. The little boy in the movie should consider another career, and Peter Fonda is more wooden than the trains (although if you're in the right mood his performance is almost funny, but mostly it's just painful). Alex Baldwin tried, but the script and the direction kept this movie from being anything more than dismal. The Thomas series is much more entertaining and well-written. Do yourself a favor and don't spend money on this dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 year old loves it. Adults disappointed and confused.","review":"Our 3yr old boy loves Thomas. We have all the videos and trains, etc. He wants to watch this thing every day. He repeats lines from the movie and acts them out all day. It was great for him. We took him to the movies to see it together. He loved that, too. For him, we would do it all again in a minute.As parents, we could have done without the \\"mean-ness\\" of Diesel #10 and the fact that he wants to \\"dominate and destroy\\". He also uses the word \\"stupid\\" several times. Not nice.As adult movie critics, we saw laughably poor acting (with the exception of \\"Mr. Conductor\\" and \\"Junior\\". (Notice that even some of the 5-star reviewers agree.) Britt Alcroft directed and wrote it, and it is obvious that she should have asked for help from someone who knew what they were doing. If you pay attention, expect to be confused. We expected more because we actually enjoy watching all of the other videos, and they are really well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific","review":"How they got Alec Baldwin to do this movie is beyond me. From the terrible, overly complicated, disjointed script to the high school film class direction to the wooden acting this is a dog from start to finish. That said, my three year old loves it. No accounting for the tastes of a toddler.Peter Fonda appears heavily sedated throughout the film. The character Junior (who for no apparent reason seems to be an Aussie surfer dude) is energetic but lost to the pathetic script and direction. Alec Baldwin plays the conductor with a wide eyed exuberence that nearly rivals Barney the purple dinosaur for sheer annoyance.I actually enjoy many of my three year old's favorite films (Monsters, Inc., The Wizard of Oz, Stuart Little) but this film is unbareable from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just awful","review":"If only I had known how truly terrible this is! Of course, my 3 year old adores it, so I have seen it many times. I finally had to hide it, because I couldn't bear to watch it again. What is the point of the stupid BIRD? What is wrong with Peter Fonda? Did NO ONE involved with this actually WATCH it?Worse yet, my husband bought him the STORY BOOK that goes along with it. So now we can even READ this ridiculous non-story on a regular basis. When my son's not looking, I skip pages hoping he won't notice.Stick to the short Thomas videos, which have some humor and spark. Avoid this depressingly bad movie like the plague!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Live Up to Thomas the Tank Engine Reputation!","review":"I had not heard much about this movie. I just know my two sons 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 are Thomas the Tank Engine Fans. (For that matter they love any train). So I was anxious to let them see it, we have other Thomas Videos. Not to mention how un-entertaining the movie was for my 4 1/2 year old (who begs to watch and watch his other train videos) he did not care if he saw this one entirely or not. What was worse was how frightened our 2 1/2 year old was by Diesel. I would have given this 0 stars if that option were available.

Forget that it doesn't fit logically let alone ideologically with the Thomas series. It is just a really horrible movie. Disjointed, blues cluesy at points, but not consistently anything but bad.In Sodor all the trains learn life lessons by making mistakes. They all have their flaws, but none are evil. They always have a chance to make it right. What's up with one evil engine? Scary, and pointless- no moral lesson here. And magic gold dust?

Although he didn't seem to be that frightened when he watched it, 6 months later he still (on a daily basis) talks about how Diesel 10 (the villain) scares him. While he only watched it twice, he still thinks about and has dreams about Diesel 10. Each night asks me to make sure Diesel 10 won't \\"get him\\" (he's very aggressive in the movie). He's never reacted like this with any other movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad movie for Thomas fans","review":"My (bright) 6-year old thought the new Thomas movie was confusing-- he was right. The traditional Thomas videos are simple, straight-forward stories about the well-known trains who try to be useful and suffer from various amounts of pride and other foibles.The new Thomas movie has an evil diesel engine as a main character. \\"Why is he so bad?\\" Both my 6 and 9-year-olds asked me. I could only answer, \\"Just to make a story, because the writers couldn't think of a real story.\\"It's true. They added some interesting magic and the human characters are nice, but it doesn't make sense. Plus it doesn't fit with the rest of the Thomas stories.This video will teach your young kids that some (people) are evil for no reason and should be destroyed. Unless you want to train your young kids to like pointless violence, avoid this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for a 2-year-old (but that's it)","review":"First, the positives: my two-year-old son who is a major Thomas fan absolutely LOVES this film! It's a cute little film for little kids. If you're an adult, however, get ready to be confused and disappointed. The plot is virtually non-existant and the direction is poor. Conductor (Alec Baldwin) is far too over-the-top in his role, while Grandpa Stone (Peter Fonda) is so depressed I don't think even prozac could help. Most of the numerous other \\"live\\" characters that pop up (Billy, Patch, Stacy Jones, etc.) serve only to confuse the story. Thomas and the other trains actually seem to take a second-hand role, being supplanted by all the \\"sparkle\\". This film is definitely NOT in the same class as the Thomas Videos which are gems- So why did I give it two stars and not one? Because my son likes it and that must count for something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie","review":"This movie makes no sense and is not consistent with the Thomas storyline at all. It is also a lot more violent any other Thomas episodes I've seen (engines running around trying to destroy other engines and hurt people).But mainly it makes no sense at all.

Of course we had to see it, my son has been a huge Thomas fan for 12 years. Both he and my 10-year-old daughter loved the film, though we were all disappointed that the familiar music themes had been abandoned for this movie. I wasn't particularly disappointed with the film, as I had expected it wouldn't prove to be as magical as the \\"real\\" Thomas videos are. I was amazed at what a poor actor Peter Fonda showed to be in this role. Oh my! He and the young boy both seemed to be so stilted.

Peter Fonda looks as if he took Valium the whole time. Perhaps he did - it might have made it more bearable for him.I will say this - my son loves watching this, but I am convinced his taste is suspended in order to enjoy the temporary \\"demise\\" of Diesel 10.

That's why I'm buying the DVD now that our VHS tape has worn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"We bought this for my 3 year old who is a Thomas fanatic. He can't even sit through this boring embarrassment of a movie. Apparently the writers took two different (bad) scripts, shuffled them together randomly and made a film from the results. I would have to use that same adjective: embarrassing, to describe the acting job of Alec Baldwin & Peter Fonda. The storyline is hard to follow, even for my older kids and the adults who have suffered through it.Thank the gods it wasn't JUST a mediocre film; then I'd have to sit through it over and over with my son. But since he didn't even like it the first time I doubt I'll be asked to \\"play Thomas again.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, there are better Thomas DVD's than this","review":"I found this in the five dollar bin at Walmart, and figured it wouldn't be such a waste if I picked it up. I have two boys and they both love Thomas.This movie is mostly \\"live\\" adult actors, with Thomas and the other trains mixed in. I find there are way too many actors in this movie that do not add anything but make the storyline harder to follow for little ones. Diesel 10 is quite scary for my 2 year old. The acting is terrible and the storyline is just awful from an adult's point of view. However, my 5 year old does like to watch this from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any Thomas fan will LOVE this movie","review":"My 3 year old son LOVES this movie. We were frequently renting it from the library so I finally bought it (at a good price). He loves Thomas toys but I think he loves this movie even more! He doesn't like the other Thomas shows as much. He likes this because it has real people and life-size trains in it! No, the acting isn't too hot, but kids don't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"People, it's a KIDS movie!!","review":"Most of you are taking this movie way too seriously, and judging it by \\"artistic\\" standards. Give me a break. It's a Thomas the Tank Engine movie...for kids!!Anyway, we got this DVD out of a bargain bin, and both my 8 year old and 3 year old love it. I was surprised to see a big name like Alec Baldwin in it, but hey, they didn't force him to do it. I thought he did a great job. He put a lot of effort into playing Mr. C., whereas a less talented actor would have just seemed silly. He did much with what he was given, and he deserves some credit.The kids in the movie are extremely dull and should have been left out. Less kids, more trains. Same could be said for Peter Fonda's role.All in all it's still a great Thomas movie. Just take it for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack!","review":"The worst Thomas movie ever. Even my Thomas-fanatic son will not watch this one. Alec Baldwin is enjoyable but Peter Fonda is horrible. Storyline is confusing and illogical beyond belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MOVIE!!!!! MAKE ME GAG A LITTLE","review":"I use to watch this show every Sunday morning ever since I was very little now I'm 14 and when I watched this movie it was very disapointing the person who did Frenchy on Grease on this hasn't changed a bit since I watched this on t.v. when I was little Mara Wilson is one of my favorite actors but I don't like her in this I liked her in Miracle on 34th Street,Matilda, Balloon Farm and a Simple Wish this one is just disapointing it may be okay if you were 6 or 1 but not for teenagers like me. you can get this for your 6 or 1 yr old but not for teens like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank and honest style. For those searching for the truth.","review":"Must read, especially for 2nd generation Christians, or youngsters searching for God for themselves. The style is frank and easy.

This book is about a runaway child of God who comes back to Him and is being used by the grace of God in a wonderfull way. What spoke most to my heart was the power of prayer which leaded to succes to reach people by God's Word and Spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zero Stone","review":"I appreciated receiving the book. I hadn't realized it didn't have a cover, but when I went back over the information I received, it did say that. I have already read the book. It was book one of a two book set and I had had book two for quite a while, but didn't want to read it until I had read book one. thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Efficient, fast-paced, and well written","review":"Norton weaves another fine adventure, with gem specialist Murdoc Jern and mutant Eet at the center. They are brought together by chance, and work together to survive when Murdoc is pursued by the Thieves' Guild and the Patrol. Murdoc possesses a mysterious gem stone, called the Zero Stone by his murdered father, so named because of what is known about the stone - virtually nothing. The source of the stone is sought by the Guild and the Patrol, who suspect Murdoc has information to assist them. The adventure is well told and imaginative, and the story is a fast and very enjoyable read. This is another example of competent science fiction by Norton, who can turn almost any story material into something special."},{"rating":"2","title":"approaching free energy","review":"great book ,lots of info, and ideas.

By Sunday they were working on staying alive.A group of high-school friends arrive at a seaside mansion in Mexico for a weekend of fun. Beyond friendship, they all have something in common - nearly a year before classmate Robin was poisoned at a party, and now slowly wastes away from kidney failure. None want to believe this act was intentional, but someone does. Is it Robin's sister Lena, who arranged the weekend? The mysterious Flynn? Or is someone desperate to keep a secret buried?Weekend is a great thriller that hauls the reader through a nicely crafted maze to an excellent finish. The epilogue, which is a bit sappy, could have been left out. But in a young adult novel perhaps it was necessary to mollify any complaints about realistic portrayals of what teens do when left to their own devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful what your kids are reading","review":"We would give this zero stars if we could. Our 12 year old checked this out of the library because he likes reading scary stories. My wife and I decided to read it also, and we were shocked. Don't let your children read this book if you are concerned about teaching them good moral values. The characters in the book are not well developed and are not realistic. They promote casual sexual relations, and are obsessed with sex. We certainly don't want our child being deceived by the garbage being pushed by Christopher Pike and Scholastic Books, which we previously trusted to publish good childrens literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plot","review":"This book was really good, but I'd have to say that the beginning started out a bit slow. You really have to stick with it to enjoy the book, but once you get past a certain point, it's all up hill from there. The plot was so creative, and definately the end surprising! You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Found it!","review":"I used to have this book when I was younger. I like the suspence and the mystery of the book. Also the whodoneit feel that it has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"Great as a second (or third, if lost) charger. Works on 230 volts in Europe and South America. At one point, when pulled from a tight plug, the connection inside broke. I was able to solder it back and epoxy the case shut. It worked fine, but eventually, the phone-side connector somehow deteriorated and on occasion (while traveling) the phone did not charge over night. All in all, for the price, I got fair bit of service out of this unit. It became obsolete when I retired my Nokia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment :0(","review":"This is not for every Nokia phone!

This collection representing 20+ years of Brazilian pop/jazz has an amazing array of talented contributors, both as writers & performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest musical groups ever!","review":"I just recently discovered Brasil '66 when I heard \\"Pretty World\\" on a jazzy oldies type station. I knew instantly that the singer was someone special & a master singer. Now I'm listening to many of their songs and I never get tired of them. Their music is just pure, clean, good, real music! It is free from technical gimmicks or anything heavy or unnecessary. Their music is so happy, innocent, and fun. I LOVE IT. I can't get enough of it! They're definitely my favorite right now. The best thing about Brasil '66 is Lani Hall. What a great singer she is. Also the jazzy bossanova instrumentals are refreshingly different from anything I've listened to before. I'm looking forward to getting better hi-fi equipment so I can hear them in all their glory. I bet they sound really great on a tube stereo system."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for Eiseley fans","review":"This is a lovely book - if you are an Eisely fan. I agree with the previous reviewer that this should not be the first book you select if you've never read Eiseley. (Start with The Immense Journey or The Star Thrower.) However, if you are a fan, this is a nice book to add to your collection. This book contains snippits of things from Eiseley's notes, presented as a collection. It doesn't flow like his other books, but there are things here that would be difficult to find outside of library archives."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best 80's compilation yet","review":"The Sedated in the 80's series truly captures the spirit of the era for me. It sends me back to the nights at CBGB's or Max's Kansas City in New York when I intentionally sat in front of the speakers so I could feel my internal organs shake (by the way...it didn't damage my hearing...your mother was wrong!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Like Gerhard Weinberger and Wolfgang Rubsam, Andrea Marcon has a quite austere, severe style. If you can't handle heavy Bach, this isn't for you. I prefer this myself. On Bach's less severe works, Marcon has a tender touch, so no need to worry there. The Thomas Schott Organ at Muri Klosterkirche is one of the best sounding instruments, I've ever heard. It simply has to be heard to be believed. On BWV 570, Marcon brings tears to my eyes, the playing is just so HEARTWRETCHING. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saw - Curious Pricing","review":"I had been waiting to purchase this saw from Amazon for about two years. The saw is wonderful (I have used a friend's LS1212 several times because my chop saw is an 8\\" and cutting crown molding on a small saw is a real pain). Just before Christmas I priced this saw again from Amazon ($579.00 on December 23, 2004) which was comparable to the prices from all of the other discount tool sources.Today the price for the LS1212 had risen to $699.95 on the Amazon web site - that is a $121 increase in one week! Needless to say I went to another discounters web site and purchased the saw for last week's price of $579.00.I don't understand a 10% price increase (in one week) on this saw (from the largest tool discounter in the world) but I suggest that if you are looking to purchase the LS1212 you might want to shop around."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE - RECONDITIONED UNITS not new !!","review":"For a used, reconditioned unit, it's a mighty fine saw. Too bad it was advertised as new, and too bad there is no mentioned of \\"reconditioned\\" except when it arrives on the doorstep in a box marked \\"reconditioned\\" and you see the wear & tear on the unit.So, BUYER BEWARE ! Amazon is not selling a new unit. These are old, used, good condition reconditioned saws, which are fine, but worth $$$ less than Amazon is selling them for....USED ..... RECONDITIONED ..... NOT NEW !!!POORLY SHIPPED ! The very heavy saw was just thrown into a big box with a bunch of air filled packing cushions.

It is a nice when it works right but you need a back up saw for when it breaks. Makita has disapointed me. I will never buy another Makita tool.Their products and service are first rate GARBAGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a used saw that was suppose to be new!","review":"Ordered this saw from Amazon.com UPS showed up and unloaded the box. Box had clearly been opened, and retaped. I looked in the box and the saw was there and looked new, but upon inspection later it was clearly a used saw. The blade had small wood chips in it and the plastic guides on the table had tooth marks in them, as well as the channel below in the base had tooth marks. There was fine sawdust in the oil of the dual glide rods as well. The accessories were just laying on the bottom of the box along with the factory staples that were originally used to staple the box shut. There was no parts-list which is typical there and there was no plastic bag that usually covers new products. I am not sure why amazon is sending used equipment, but buyer should beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makita LS-1212","review":"I received my saw yesterday, so I've not yet given it a rating. It does appear to be a very nice saw. I was forced to give a rating of 1 in order to post this warning.Warning, the picture on Amazon is deceiving. This saw does not come with the extentions shown. This info is hidden in the \\"see more technical details\\" link. It really should be clearly stated in the copy.

As an adult I purchased this book, not only because I loved it so much as child, but because of the fond memories of holding my father's hand as we would up the local public library's steps. My father was special and I miss him. He worked two jobs, but was never too tired to spend quality time with me.When Corduroy Bear was not available, I would pick out a Jack Ezra Keats book (e.g., Hi, Cat, Peter's Chair, The Snowy Day, Whistle for Willie etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another children's classic","review":"This book is a classic and should definitely be part of your home library.

I read it when I was young and I still enjoy it now. It teaches kids that things and people don't have to be perfect for a person to love and care for them. Also, this book helps one to explore his or her imagination through Corduroy's adventures. I especially like the ending when it shows that the girl cares so much about the bear that she comes back and gets him the next day with the money she has saved at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, Gentle Tale","review":"My 2 1/2-year-old son loves this sweet, gentle story -- as do I. It's great in that the characters aren't all cookie-cutter children's characters.

Unconditional love, how can that be more endearing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect gift for my little girl!","review":"This book is a wonderful story that I read as a child and loved, so I wanted to carry on the tradition to my little girl. She is 18 months old and is currently going through a phase where she loves books and bears, so this made the perfect match.The book is hardback so it is great quality and the bear is just too cute! Both of these items are just the right size for her, but not too small for her to enjoy later. I loved the fact that the bear was small enough for her to carry around. Also, I loved that the book was not too big to take with us when we are in the car.I couldn't have been happier with these two items. I would highly recommend this set to others. I got a great deal on this set. The price is great and you can't find items of this quality at this price anywhere else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Students always enjoy","review":"This is always one of my first graders favorites.

That way, figuring out how and where to store it is their problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware - you'll soon know it by heart","review":"This is one of those books that adults, in desperation, soon need to hide.

Well, I was wrong. He totally gets it every bit as much as the bored stay at home moms I know. If you don't laugh at the chapter entitled \\"Pussy\\" you probably don't have a pulse which means you have bigger problems than what book to buy. I definitely recommend this book to all dads who want to see that other dads know what you're going through. Good luck out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this before having kids","review":"As an author (50 Things Every Guy Should Know How To Do) and a parent (Joshua, 2 1/2) I was pleasantly surprised by this book. Mr. Wilder not only has an entertaining, engaging writing style, but he is the rare person willing to admit that parenting has its downside. \\"Daddy Needs a Drink\\" was honest and refreshing. I highly reccomend it to anyone thinking of having kids or those who already have them because its nice to know that other people feel like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daddy Needs a Drink and You Need to Buy This Book","review":"Daddy needs a drink is by turns sarcastic, endearing, and true-to-life. Not being a parent myself (maybe in a few years...) I don't quite relate to the situations, but my mother assures me she can see herself in many of Wilder's anecdotes. Whether you're a parent or not, this is a sweet and funny account of living in Santa Fe and being a dad. It's witty and quick enough for those of us who read often, but is also a good choice for those who don't, because it IS quick, and keeps things moving for readers with short attention spans.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilder - I want my money back!!!!!!","review":"Reimbursment for my time wasted on this trash as well. All statments on this book are false, it was not funny at all. Seems as though book reviewers do not know a bad book when they read one. They will praise anything now a days. I only continued to read it so I could write this review. It is apparently written by a man, but I have my doubts on that claim. Maybe we in the Eastern US, do not understand West Coast humor, or the lack there of.This book is not even worthy of being left in the outhouse at camp, except for uses that I cannot express, which again, I do not think it worthy enough for that purpose.Do yourself a favor, wait for the movie - which I am sure will never debut, as there is nothing there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing","review":"Despite the positive reviews, this book is pornography and should have a warning of explicit language and imagery.

I bought this book for my husband for Father's Day. I read some of it - more than enough to get a good idea of its bent - then passed it to my husband with an apology and another gift to outweigh this disastrous purchase. After he checked the book out, we both agreed the proper place for it was the trash can. If you want a decent and truly funny book to read or to give your husband for Father's Day next year, you need to look for another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"This book is stupid.

I wish someone had warned me that it is full of vulgar language. I DO use lots of humor in raising my children, and was looking forward to reading this, but I don't need profanity in a book on parenting! I was raised by a brilliant teacher, who always taught me that \\"an intelligent person can express what they need to without offending anyone.\\" My copy went into the recycle bin. I don't need foul launguage filling my thoughts and possibly slipping out of my mouth as I work with my children, whom I love. If you don't enjoy vulgar language, don't read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas gift from one frazzled parent to another.","review":"I got this for my brother, who's a single father to a very \\"spirited\\" 17-month old. He loved it, because it provides proof that all children drive their daddies crazy at some point or another, and that it's okay to need to step back and enjoy the humor of the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but needs editing","review":"This is a genuinely funny book - and my no means \\"pornography\\" as someone else's review claims. It was created from a compilation of the author's newspaper columns, and unfortunately that shows. There is some repetition which is a bit distracting and could have been edited out. But a good read, ideal for vacations and dads on the beach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a fathers voice is heard","review":"I can't tell you how excited I was to get the book. It is exactly what I wanted it to be. I never thought that everything happening to me could happen to anyone else. Wilder should have a column in every parent magazine, \\"Dads Dirt\\" or something. Thanks for saying everything I have wanted to say. Hurray for dads everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"VIVA Milla!!!","review":"I have never heard Milla Jovovich sing. She is wonderful. Her music is different. Her voice is beautiful and The Gentleman Who Fell Before the Court is now one of my favorite songs. She is a gifted singer, song writer and poet. I first decided to get this cd after seeing her in The Messenger. I did not know what to expect and to be honest went into it a little leary. In this day and age of no talent images like Brittany Spears, I thought is this going to be some talentless twit who thinks because she is a model or a movie star that she is a great singer. Well VIVA Milla!!! She is awesome. She sings like and angel and writes like a poet."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's eclectic and that's about it.","review":"Okay. It's not what you would expect out of a beautiful model. In the pantheon of actress/model/singers, Milla is by far the best singer/songwriter. But I swear to god, if she looked like baboon's behind, she would no bet able to get away with putting out such mediocrity. Most of the songs are boring, although I did like \\"Ruby Lane\\". And that Russian song was just gimmicky. Okay, so she speaks Russian. Surprise, she IS Russian. Again, if she was an ugly woman, nobody would be praising a Russian woman for singing in Russian.Her songs are getting better. The new one, \\"Can you bend your back like this\\" is pretty good.

It is a travesty that she never received more critical and popular acclaim."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is a must have for any musician and listener.","review":"I cannot begin to tell you how relaxing and amazing this cd is. You have to listen to it. It has heavy slavic undertones with very heartfelt and meaningful lyrics.From a musicians perspective this CD has it all. There is so much going on in every song musically that you have to listen to the tracks over and over to pick it all up. It is one of the best put together albums I have ever heard.Definitely buy this if youre a fan of good music. Genre has nothing to do with it.

In truth, I downloaded this just to see if she can sing (the answer is yes) and was blown away by the depth of the record.

Truly precious.@}~~~~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected triumph.","review":"I grabbed this album when it was released in 1994 and have never grown tired of it. I recently bought the CD, since my cassette tape has long since worn thin. I was drawn to the album by \\"Gentlemen Who Fell,\\" which received enough airplay to capture my attentinon. I was pleasantly surprised, though, with the rest of the work. \\"In a Glade\\" became one of my favorites. Since her music is unique, I can only describe the work as a thoughtful, sometimes dark, but lyrically sound and musically engaging piece of art. As one of my favorite albums, I can't say anything negative about this album. Not a mainstream work to appeal to the masses, it is an excellent collection. No regrets, only pleasant surprises. Definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure aural pleasure...","review":"When \\"Gentlemen Who Fell\\" first got airplay (albeit meager) in 1994, I was intrigued. It was catchy, but had some other depth that I couldn't quite define. So, I headed out to buy the tape. It really did become a permanent part of my listening day for quite some time. I remember mowing the lawn, jogging, washing the car, walking the dog...all while having Milla's haunting, lush music going in and out of my ears and soul.Her lyrics, her music, even the choice of instrumentation, all lend to proof that she is truely gifted with some kind of musical magic...and I have pretty rigorous standards.A little over four years later, it's my pleasure, since I've now worn out the tape, to buy the CD version.Awaiting a second album, I can only hope Milla finds time during her busy acting and modeling career to do the thing which she surely also must love."},{"rating":"2","title":"play it until you hate it, then love it again.","review":"Haven't bought it, but downloaded the whole cd in mp3 format. I want to buy, but have no creditcard so can't order. I saw the 5th element and was impressed, actually moved, by milla's voice, as her voice asked Corben Dallas (Bruce Willis) to help her while she was in the back of the cab. I went looking for more voice samples and found a whole CD! after downloading the total sum about 100mb? well.. probably cost me more money than to buy it. but you see I can't. when I played it, I at first detested it, I had never heard this kind before. Now I love it, and play it over and over. at times I hate it but some weeks later I will play and love it once more. So, I want to thank Milla for making this album. My favorite songs: Clock (it's about anne frank right?) and In a glade (don't know what it means, I love that mystery.) if I can find the cd I will buy it, even if it's over 50 dollars..

From end to end it is a touching look into Milla's younger years, every song written and performed by her. The songs were written when she was 15 to 17 years old, but this isn't bubble gum for the mind. The underlying rhythm of this folk-rock album is relaxing and sensual. And, unlike many of the super-models who've tried at music only to sound like bullfrogs croaking inside of a log, Milla has a beautiful, soothingly smooth voice. She's an incredibly talented artist with all kinds of future potential. This is a must have disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly amazing!","review":"I bought this CD when it first came out years ago, and I still listen to it frequently.

Not only is she an acomplished model and actress but she is a great singer as well. Her album 'The Divine Comedy' is folky with a hint of divaness. \\"The Gentleman Who Fell\\" is a very beautiful song that showcases Milla's vocals, and \\"Bang Your Head\\" displays her rang.

Her vocals are amaturish at best -- they struck me as the kind of thing you'd hear at a Tuesday open-mike at the local cafe and think, hmmm, might sound good in a few years if she keeps it up. Her songwriting also shows her age, and are nothing special, either musically or lyrically. (Take a look at any teenage girl's poetry.) Best thing I can say about it is it's well-produced, if slightly derivative.I don't think this CD would have gotten pressed if it had been someone other than Milla.For contrast, consider Fiona Apple's debut. Fiona I would call a talented and creative vocalist, songwriter and musician; Milla is unfortunately just another (extremely) pretty face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't quit your day job","review":"This cd was not at all good enough to compare to Tori Amos!

The songs are poorly written, and the vocals are pretty iffy. The best song was the cover of an old folk tune. You can really tell she wrote some of this stuff when she was 15. I am amazed that people like it so much! The production quality is also really bad. (I have friends who make better albums in their closets.) I think that Milla has a pretty voice and is probably capable of making a great album, unfortunately this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Divine Tragedy is more like it.","review":"Hey, hang on just a sec....I love Milla Jovovich. I love her OK, but this CD that I ordered, bought and paid for because of the magnificent reviews on Amazon just flat out sucks. It sucks, sorry Milla but you know it does too.I give MJ credit for her wide body of work and variety of talents, and on this disc she demonstrates that she can play several instruments, she writes the songs, and she performs them but not with much passion. I dont like this disc, and rather than let it collect dust I just threw the thing away. I didnt figure there was anybody I knew that would want it. Sorry. 2 Mooltipass to get me as far away from this sound as I can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Model, actress, but best as a musician...","review":"I wouldn't dare throw criticisms at Milla for her lack of acting or beauty, as she has a vast amount of both. However, Milla's keen ability to introduce melodies which are hypnotic, beautifully written, and sensually bright and dark, simultaneously, promotes her music ability far beyond her physical appearance or stage performance. I own various female vocalists, including Dead Can Dance, Shelleyan Orphan, Tori, Sarah, and the mixes of This Mortal Coil. Milla's voice and variety in composing ideas and music makes her an equal to each of the previous bands if not superior for her initiation album. This album was thought to be a joke, and turned out to be the altar in which we can praise Milla for her mental beauty, instead of her physical characteristics."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite. also: trite.","review":"I have to admit that I haven't heard this album all the way through. I heard about the first 4 songs and simply couldn't stand to listen to the rest of it. Her voice is cloying, her lyrics are fluffy at times, and frankly I resent comparisons to such gifted musicians as Tori Amos and Kate Bush when Milla is only credited for vocals and lyrics on the album. If you are a fan of her folksy (and yet clearly studio-polished), almost Celtic sound, you'd be a lot happier with Sinead O'Connor and lesser-known but much more talented Katell Keinig. Please don't buy this album because it's surprising that a model-slash-actress could also having a singing career; leave music to musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so curious!","review":"I can't really rate this album cause I haven't heard it. But I think I'm going to go get this album. All thesse reviews sure make it sound worth checking out! I was just happily suprised to hear that she sounds like Kate Bush and Bojest and Tori Amos.

I went out and bought the CD again (determined that this time, I wasn't going to loan it to anybody), and found the music to be a little less perfect than I had remembered, but still definitely worth the cost.

I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WileyPlus Registration Code","review":"If you're trying to purchase this textbook used, and your instructor is using the online WileyPlus supplement, be sure to ask the seller if they're including a WileyPLus registration code. From what I've seen most either don't include it or don't even know about it. The textbook sells for around $120 brand new, and I think that comes with the code. If not, the code costs about $50 on the WileyPlus website. So if you're looking to pay $30 to $40 and thinking you're getting a great deal, you may be surprised by a hidden cost. Again, this all depends on if you're going to be using the online supplement, but just be warned. I wasn't happy with the surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead","review":"I knew that this wouldnt be the exact book, however I feel completely mislead once I recieved it.

You can stuff it in, but the velcro won't keep the bag closed...so I'm thinking if i buy the canvas, then sew new velcro on, & we'll be in business.I looked all over for a messenger style bag like this with a camera portion that might be a better fit for a Holga and a Diana Mini, but no found nothing else.I suggest you go canvas, or splurge for the leather version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning to play with a synthesizer 101","review":"This is a compilation of a lot of synthesized sounds. I can't call George's work on this recording music.

It does give your entertainment system a good workout.

You're tired of your guests, why not put ELECTRONIC SOUND and just pretend how Avant-Garde music is fascinating. Your mother-in-law's staying too long for your taste? Be sure to make a copy of it over her Celine Dion's cassette. Can't stand the last Garth Brooks Live, why not meditate on George's little essays on the mini Moog? In all fairness, this isn't a bad album either. But if you're expecting a follow-up to LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, better buy something else. On the other hand, if you really want to be in for an extravangant experience in sound, then you may find it challenging. It is simply pure noise coloured by the ghost of music.

Haven't listened to it close enough, or 2. Have no idea what experimental/avant garde music is all about. For anyone who ever bought Coil or Nurse With Wound albums, you will love this. I only give it a four star rating, because the 'art of noise' has come a long way since 1969. If you're just getting into this kind of music, I recommed starting with Nurse With Wound's \\"Thunder Perfect Mind,\\" or ELpH vs. Coil's \\"Worship The Glitch,\\" then move on to this. Sure, it's not like the rest of your George Harrison collection, but it is a wonderful LP and a lot of fun to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Interesting Curiosity","review":"If you are about to begin a collection of the solo output of the Beatles, this is not the place to start. This album was originally released in 1969 on the Zapple label (a subsidiary of Apple, which only released two albums) as an experiment in sound. It is George Harrison tinkering on a Moog synthesizer for three quarters of an hour. It does get old. I have this in my collection only for the sake of having a complete collection, and for that, it is essential. Understand, however, that I have listened to the CD once (the same is true for my original vinyl copy). If you want everything Beatles or George Harrison, buy it. If you want to listen to George Harrison's music, start with the absolutely brilliant ALL THINGS MUST PASS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit bigger than I expected but work superbly.","review":"When these arrived and I opened the box I was concerned about their overall size.

He's not afraid to make a song about lingerie, but this album by no means is consistent. It's really mixed up. How would you feel if DMX came out singing a ballad about tender love? I'm sure you'd feel how I feel listening to Sisqo try to be a thug. A thug with platinum hair. That's a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sisqo Is The Ultimate!","review":"When I first heard of Sisqo I thought what almost everyone did; ' yeah, another 1 hit wonder' or ' he won't make it' but when I heard \\" The Thong Song\\" and a couple more songs off of his album \\" Unleash The Dragon\\" I realized I was wrong. Sisqo really can go all the way. I suggest that everyone gets his album \\" Unleash The Dragon\\" because he really can make it and the album is one of the best I have seen or heard in a while. Sisqo really is that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"THIS ALBUM, I HIGHLY RECOMEND BECAUSE OF THE BEAT AND THE SONG WORDS. I WILL RATE THE BEST SONGS ON THIS CD. HERE THEY ARE:#1.

GOT TO GET IT: 4 1/2 STARS BECAUSE THE BEAT IS GOOD AND THE WORDS IF YOU READ THEM, THEY ARE PRETTY BAD [LIKE IN SWEARS] SO I RECOMEND THAT LITTLE KIDS SHOULD NOT LISTEN TO THIS SONG. THIS SONG HAS PRETTY GOOD STATISTICS SO LISTEN TO THIS SONG AND YOU WILL BE ROCKIN'. #8.

It does have it's few drawbacks like many albums, but nevertheless it is still good. It has plenty of smooth ballads like Incomplete and Is Love Enough and a few dance tracks like The Thong Song and Unleash The Dragon.

After being tricked into buying this cd because of the songs \\"Thong Song\\" and \\"Incomplete\\", I did not purchase Sisqo's last cd (millions of other people didn't neither). Why? Because there are only TWO good songs on this cd. Sisqo is over-rated. I mean, he has some style but its clear that he is not as talented as I thought he was. What Sisqo needs to do his leash his dragon and his group Dru Hill because they have nothing to offer but one or two good songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but too much sex","review":"I think the cd is great but it has too much sexually content in it.

The album has a mixture like there are songs you get up and dance too, like Got 2 Get IT and there are the soft ballads you can cuddle too with a loved one like Is Love Enough and Incomplete.

The cuts from the album exude nothig but sex. Yeah he can holla and yell with the best of them but where is the artist. It seems as though he is using sex to sell his album which does not for me make the artist. Take my advice buy \\"Back At One\\" Instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I can't believe all of these great reviews are from REAL people. Listen, I'm a die-hard Jodeci fan and I like Sisqo too - even though he ripped my boy K-Ci's style. But this latest joint \\"Unleash the whatever\\" is a joke. The songs have NO substance, the beats are played out and boring, Sisqo's still doing the same vocal runs that K-Ci played out YEARS AGO, and.... I could go on and on. This is a CLASSIC bubble-gum pop album with essentially no ROOTS and I would not recommend it to anyone who has any type of appreciation for music.With artists such as Erykah Badu, Maxwell, Lauryn Hill, Macy Gray, and D'Angelo delivering fresh, rootsy, art-driven SOUL FOOD for our brains, I can't find one single reason to support \\"Ride-the-pony\\" pop crooners like Sisqo and Ginuwine who can't find anything else to say other than, \\"I want my love deep inside of you tonight girl\\" on every other cut.Do yourself a favor and buy something thought-provoking and meaningful. This is JUNK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playa","review":"This album is hot. I am always jamming when it comes to The Thong Song, Unleash the Dragon, and Got to Get it. But he also has the slow jams for when it is time to turn the light down low like How can I Love U 2nite and So Sexual. This is a great CD for anyone who was and still is feeling Dru Hill.

This is Penile.","review":"Sisqo announced to the world a few weeks ago that the Dragon of title of is His Penis, and He is The Dragon. Consequently, one can deduce that he rates his Penis rather highly. This, I have heard, should not be the case. If this album is anything to go by, not only must he have trouble pleasuring The Ladies on a regular basis, but he probably has trouble urinating in front of other men as well. We're talking tiny, and flaccid. The album, that is. Read into that what you will. It's mediocre RNB, with a little bit of guitar, and some quasi- Wu Tang posturing involved, as well as a nice line in Natty White Threads. It's also not very good. Nevermind, eh? Next time you can name it after your buttocks, which I've heard, are quite pert and well - rounded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over r 'n'b, Sisqo's in town!","review":"When I first heard Thong Song I thought wow! I'd never heard of Sisqo or Dru Hill and I wasn't really into R 'n' B so this shocked me a bit! Sisqo then released 'Unleash the Dragon' and thats when I knew I had to get this album.As soon as i could i went to go and buy this album and practically ran ome to put it on. I never stopped listening to it.I will certaintly be keeping an eye out for more Sisqo and also LovHer his group.

You'll never stop listening to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sisqo = Squid Disco","review":"You should buy this CD only if you are a fan of hurting your own ears. This singer mumbles his way through boring, unrythmic songs that sound like regee meets disco meets Sigmund the Sea Monster. Unleash Sigmund! There's a good chance the only words you will be able to discern are swear words and \\"thong\\" (on \\"Thong Song\\"). This CD can be useful if you have other CDs that you want to feel better about. Listen to this one a few times and anything will sound good. Hey, this guy should get togeather with Pink and start a band called Mauve-isqo. For better dance music, get \\"The Best of Western Yodling,\\" \\"Barney and Friends,\\" or a sound effect CD.

You got songs about sex and stuff like that (besides thong song!) and you have songs just about love. He mixes it up with slow and fast songs on this. The best songs are #1,2,3,8,9,10,12,and 13. 13 is nice in which Nokio from Dru Hill and Ja Rule perform a 'You are everything' remix. Pick this one up if you dont have it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sisqo unleashs a awsome album","review":"Sisqo has a incredible voice and no one can deny that.

Yeah, the song is catchy but little more I like out of him. I give him credit because he co-writes his songs and for the success he got with this. Otherwise, he's not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of crap","review":"I'm afraid that Sisqo is one of the worst singers of all time. The only good song he has is \\"The Thong Song\\", which gives this CD two stars. I was going to buy it, but after listening to some of his songs on the radio, I found Sisqo really sucks. The only good songs he sang was the one with DMX and \\"The Thong Song\\". Otherwise, Sisqo really needs to work on being a better rapper/singer, or else he will plunge down the charts like Marilyn Manson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did U Break Up Dru Hill?","review":"Sisqo's album really bugs me. How can everyone think it is good? Only Thong Song is worthy of listening. Sisqo is not exceptionally talented, and his voice is just plain irritating. Dru Hill was a great group, and it is sad that Sisqo went on his own instead of sticking with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"he was better in dru hill","review":"The thong song is a great summer song but besides that the album is not worth buying. I loved Sisqo in Dru Hill, but I only listend to the album because I spent money on it. Some of the songs sound like Dru Hill remakes and his voice starts to bother you after a while. Not worth my 14 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Novelty Has Worn Thin","review":"Baltimore's Sisqo is really one of the most vocally talented bruthas out there, but who would guess from his choice of material? When Dru Hill hit its peak in 1998, he ditched the group in favor of this album, a borderline release that has only one memorable track, \\"Thong Song.\\" Even that jam has grown tired after a million listens and is now the only tune by which Sisqo is remembered. Never mind that his next song \\"Incomplete\\" shot straight to No. 1 on the charts because that song, like the rest of the album, is pretty forgettable. Like many other talented singers, Sisqo needs to quit the oversinging and get better, less flashy, material. After all, there is strength in modesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oooh this cd's so scandalously incredible","review":"Sisqo's debut album \\"Unleash the Dragon\\" is awesome. This album shows what a range of talent Sisqo really has. He's not just some flash in the pan artist because of his big hit - The Thong Song. Other songs (i.e. Unleash the Dragon and Incomplete) are so great because they show 2 sides of the same guy. A guy who wants to party and hang out with all these beautiful women and have tons of money; and a guy who has all those things, but only wants the love of a girl he turned away for loving him. The depth of this album wouldn't be apparent if you'd only heard The Thong Song, but if you listened to the whole cd, I think you'd find that this album goes further than any other R&B cd. Sisqo is a great performer (on the cd & live). This demonstrates his talent and ability. I look forward to his next album.[Side Note] - If you're getting the Explicit Lyrics version, then don't let the \\"little ones\\" listen to it. It does have a good deal of cussing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time!!!!!!","review":"Mantronik is the greatest electronic pioneer/engineer/producer of the last half of the 20th century.

It's about time that Mantronix is given the proper respect and place they deserve in electronic music history. Kurtis's sounds are some of the most widely sampled.

Do not expect all that same old garbage you hear in all the hip-hop/rap albums: violence, sex, hoes, and pimping.

There are plenty of Spanish-raps and a good mix of bilingual tracks. Tracks such as \\"Pilots del Humo\\", \\"La Fogata\\", and \\"Rumor en el Aire\\" will definetly keep the listener tuned in to the spanish language lyris that are amongst the best I've heard in a long time. The inclusion of songs composed by the live instruments is a plus. The audio quality is top notch, and the bonus music video is beautifully produced--although it is a \\"low-budget\\" production.On the low side, the graphics are not up to par with the music, and the music video is a bit difficult to access.

Yes this does run up the electric bill, especially if you leave it on all the time. The key is to manage the time it is on. I plug it into the outlet in the morning and may leave it on a few hours a day while our cattle are drinking water. it is always unplugged at night. cattle are sleeping at night. I break the ice in the morning on top of the tank and plug in the heater. Unplug it later in the day depending on the outdoor temperature. I minimize the time it is on by allowing the sun to thaw out the ice. If it is above freezing with no or little ice on the water then I unplug it. It is only on when needed, once the ice is melted it gets unplugged. This means a few extra trips out there a day but it keeps me and the dogs active and I love being out with the cows. :-) I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not fit \\"universally\\" in the rubber flat back bucket","review":"I bought this as a replacement for the Farm Innovators Rubber Flat Back 5 gallon bucket. This element does not fit in the bucket, it is too long. I have bought replacement elements in the past that fit just fine...but this one is made differently. The black part on the element is usually made so it slides through the bucket and just the element is left in the bucket. With this unit, the black part does not fit through the hole in the bucket, increasing the length of the element by nearly 2 inches which does not fit in the bottom of this bucket. It might be fine for a 50 or 100 gal stock tank, but it was advertised and sold as a 'universal' replacement for the 5 gal bucket.

I purchased this set on the basis of Rilling's reputation as a Bach scholar and on the strength of several of his cantata sets. After the first hearing, I moved it to the top of my collection. Now, after several more times listening to it, I am in awe of Rilling's accomplishment. His soloists and choir are top drawer, his orchestral support even more so. The brass section especially plays with a gusto and clarity that is unmatched anywhere. Rilling has achieved a grandeur that is clearer than Klemperer and a fuller, more reverential, sound than Gardiner. Although all three are five star recordings, even in, as noted in a prior review, Amazon's vastly inflated ratings, I now find that i am going to Rilling's set for both enjoyment and study.

Furthermore, an individual's compliancy and adaptibilty to social laws & norms does not necessarily define one's intellegence. Some of the smartest men in history were known to be social outcasts and were referred to as criminals in their time. I have to dismiss this book as nothing more than euro-elitist rubbish.

Moreover, it cites several anti-Semites in its bibliography, such as Hans Eysenck, who once admitted, \\"My hatred...was so overwhelming that no argument could counter it.\\" And what is more, Mr. Murray relies on data from racially biased tests, such as the Stanford-Bidet, Raven's Progressive Rock, and the Hardcock Johnson.\\"The Bell Curve\\" also advocates that New Jersey be turned into a \\"relocation camp\\" for \\"undesirables,\\" such as those with IQs below 100.

This book has, for years, been thoroughly debunked by authors ranging from Noam Chomsky and Mamadou Chinyelu, to Stephen J Gould and Richard Lewontin. Moreover, it fails to meet even the most basic academic criteria (read Gould's The Mismeasure of Man).

In many of their studies, the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), a knowledge based test, was used to test for IQ. In all the reviews of the book I have ever read, of all the people I have ever discussed this book with, not one person has ever had anything to say about the fact that many of the studies in this book were funded by a neo-nazi organization. Its very likely none of you out there will have anything to say about this either.

A Harvard professor as author, and enough statistical evidence to deter all but the most determined from subjecting the figures to much more than passing scrutiny.

Those who are already committed to the idea of white supremacy will find the book useful justification for their views, but I doubt that this book will win many new converts. It certainly didn't win me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can someone explain....","review":"Why do the authors posit with such vigor and length the statement that intelligence or IQ has high predictive ability for future outcomes when THEIR OWN STATISTICS demonstrate that IQ only accounts for 5-10% of the variability in income? Meaning that 90-95% of the variability in income IS NOT EXPLAINED by IQ, but by presumably a variety of other factors. And if we assume, as we should, that income has a lot to do with social standing...then social standing has nothing to do with IQ, and this book explains nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Science of the Worst Sort","review":"The Bell Curve is the worst form of junk science. This is what happens when social 'scientists', who wouldn't know a statistical test from a testicular cyst, are let loose with a computer. The Bell Curve starts by confusing statistical significance with practical or scientific importance (a first years stats student mistake) and piles on the errors from there. The positive editorial reviews only demonstrate an astronomical level of hubris on the part of some editors that have mistakenly confused the ability to write knowingly about something with actually knowing something.

Some of their views are downright outrageous, when they preach that the public systems of the United States (which as per them, is currently tailormade for the less intelligent) should become such that the genetically inferior should be naturally reduced, if not eliminated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Other Side of the Bell Curve","review":"In this day in age, it is amazing to witness the continued praise for the Bell Curve. This continues despite a mountain of empirical research which demonsrates unequivocally that the environment, socio-economic status, and social tier into which one is born deeply affects individual success. Most scholars hold that intelligence, however measured - and, indeed, many measures of intelligence have been created, is but a single variable in the complex make-up of human behavior. The explanations offered by the authors of The Bell Curve do not acknowledge entire fields of study which have long ago established the critical role of society in the development of human behavior. It is important to seek out explanations that do not rely on single and simplistic variables to establish causal relationships. This is especially true when discussing the complexities of social structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and thorough","review":"The book takes a detached perspective on what everyone else analyzes from a subjective standpoint. Books of this kind are rare and valuable to own/read for that reason. At some points in the book the authors slip and make policy advices based on correlation, rather than causation. For instance they say that people with lower IQs are overrepresented in prisons, however it could simply mean that they are more likely to get caught, rather than they are more prone to anti-social behaviour. If you can keep a sceptical mindset, this book will enrich you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It represents a human fallacy !","review":"I can only advice anyone not to be blinded by the jargon and falsely executed statistics. Anyone who is seriously interested in the ongoing debate \\"Does intelligence as an enitiy that is inherited and unalterable exist ?\\" should read \\"The Mismeasure of Man\\" by Stephen Jay Gould.

This is an essential liberal verses conservative debate. While most of the attention is on blacks, all groups are misrepresented. The modernization of Africa refutes it as does the fact that Asian countries often fall behind Europe and America. Is black jazz less intelligent than Frank Sinatra? People often denied a college education can excel at sports because of resourcefulness, not genes. How do you determine the need for IQ anyway? I don't have a college degree, but I know how to run a spell checker (unlike the people who praised this book). As a liberal I will admit that a dog can't compete with a person but racial differences have been proven false."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proven Racists","review":"Both of the authors of the Bell Curve are already proven racists. I've done some research at a website about the book and it's been proven that Murray (co-author of \\"The Bell Curve\\") had participated in Cross burnings in the past. Also, Herrnstein was picketed at Harvard University for lecturing his racist views. These are facts. The book is nothing more than ambiguous psuedoscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"This book is quite simple.

The problem isn't that their conclusions are racist; the errors they perpetuate are damaging to people of all ethnicities. Anyone reading The Bell Curve needs also to read Steven Jay Gould's The Mismeasure of Man. Gould's book was written 10 years before The Bell Curve (because Murray and Herrnstein didn't actually say anything new) and has been updated to include his critique of The Bell Curve.I give this book one star simply because the arguments are clearly and readably presented, even though the authors' plainly intend to dazzle the reader with numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book.","review":"Its theories and analyses seem very unconvincing.

Perhaps my artistic abilities will be of value to evolution; perhaps my sagacity or physical agility. Or how about my leadership qualities?

The key studies that the authors rely on almost all were conducted by a small group of fringe researchers funded by the Pioneer Fund, a group dedicated to the advancement of eugenics. The analysis relies heavily on statistical fallacies that were debunked decades ago, and the logic is utterly circular. People wanting an honest scientific analysis of the claims of racial superiority should read Stephen Jay Gould's The Mismeasure of Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKETCHY STATS MAKE FOR DUBIOUS SCIENCE","review":"To sum up this book in 25 words or less, I'd say that Herrenstein and Murray above all give readers the absolutely false impression of The Bell Curve as being real science. This is a good read for those who want to brush up on their logic skills--every other sentence seems to call for a handwritten question or criticism in the margin. The statistical conclusions in this book alone are enough to render the work questionable. But throw in tons of contradictory information, racist ideology, and misinterpretation of conventional intelligence tests, and you've got yoruself an 800-page work of purely unsubstantiated rhetoric."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somebody had the courage to turn on the light switch","review":"Forget about what you've heard about this book and read it, cover to cover, because almost nothing more important has been written on the development of a class system in America. That this class system is based on cognitive ability is an occurrence without historical parallel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mongoloids are only more intelligent than Caucasians ON AVERAGE, the Caucasians produce more GENIUSES and has creativity","review":"The AVERAGE IQ of Mongoloids are at 105 compared to the Caucasians' 100, but the Caucasian's bell curve has more deviation from the norm, in other words they produce MORE GENIUSES and probably more imbeciles, but they also have the gene for creativity...and since the Caucasian AVERAGE IQ is only slightly lower than that of Mongoloids to have any significant diffirence, that is the reason why Caucasian civilizations is OVER ALL more brilliant than Mongoloid civilizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Biology as Ideology by RIchard Lewontin (1991)","review":"Lewontin's book describes a case in which white and black adopted children's IQ scores are measured. What were the findings? Although there was not a significant difference in overall performance (between black and white), the children scored about 20 points higher than their biological parents, which means that CULTURE (their current adoptive parents and the parent's wealth/education), and not biology, has a overwhelming impact on the lives of adopted children. But if one were curious as to which race did do better, the answer is the Black kids. I suppose the point is to have a reasonable amount of skepticism about the claims that modern science makes about the differences in races, as opposed to the differences in opportunities and position of the parents in society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psuedoscience at its worst","review":"Everything in this book has been proven wrong time and again. The only value this title holds is as a demonstration of how bad science can become so popular when it justifies a belief many already hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malicious and racist","review":"There is simply no way the authors can have believed what they were writing. The 'research' is presented in academic style with copious footnotes. Problem is that the footnotes don't bear any resemblance to what is being said. There are elementary arithmentical mistakes in several of the tables, which curiously always seem to support the authors preconceived notions.If you are a racist goon looking for support for your views you will find much that reinforces your predjudices in this book. However you could save your money and read the output of the 'Institute for Historical Review' for free. If you are looking for an unbiased analysis of IQ testing a better place to start would be Gould's Mismeasure of Man which explains the origins of IQ testing as a means of measuring achievement of the mentally retarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bell Curve, Simplified","review":"The conclusions in this work are relatively simple:Black folks are way dumber than the rest of the world, and that explains why they arent very successful.Most of the rest of the world's ethnic groups are smarter than whites.Did I miss anything?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disfortune...","review":"The unfortunate thing about this book, and really about all the positive reviews posted here, is that they are all fundamentally flawed. That is, any philosophy or line of thought which points to biological determinism is impossible to truly justify and thus, should be considered inconsequential and irrelavent to intelligent discussion. The fact is, this book is only what it is because of its support from all these self-described \\"rationalists\\" who are really just racists and/or fascist-market capitalists. There is not a whole lot in this book that holds up under critical examination unless the examiner is not making any attempt at criticism in an attempt to justify the hate and destruction of systems and societies which they are afraid to leave behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage","review":"My dictionary defines racism as \\"the notion that one's own ethnic stock is superior\\". This book is quintessentially racist. It claims that the average white of European ancestry has an IQ of 100. The average Jewish person has an IQ of 115. The average for blacks and Amerindians is 85. A large percentage of blacks, Indians and Latinos are uneducable. This is determined by heredity, and there is nothing can be done about it. Education makes smart kids smarter, but it over-taxes dumb kids, and actually makes them dumber...

Do some research: most statistics quoted in this book are the fruit of racist \`scientists' w/ political agendas. this is mere propoganda my friends, nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a sad attempt at disguised racism.","review":"As an educator books like this and the postivie reviews endorsing this kind of garbage make me sick. America has abused the I.Q. test for years. Any small amount of research will reveal that the history of testing intelligence in America stems from racism. The reason other races other than rich white people do poorly on I.Q tests and standardized tests is cultural not due to genitics. The tests in America are written to exclude particular cultures, to claim otherwise is ignorant. The reviews praising this book and comparing it to Darwin, are pathetic. Bad science. Bad ideas. Drones following along. This is Hitler logic. Grow up. Think for your self. Morons. These people probably think George W.

(60% to 80% according to the authors.) Starting there, the authors show how society has evolved from a hunter/gatherer to an agricultural to an industrial to an information based culture. At each stage, except the last, intelligent people were evenly distributed throughout society at every level and every occupation. In this century, however, the educational system has selected out the most intelligent 10% and marked them for further training. The consequences are intriguing, to say the least. This is a profoundly unsettling book that should be read cover to cover.

The actors should have been ashamed to make something this horrible, but I guess money talks and integrity walks...Please don't buy this movie and promote this kind of idiocy, if Hollywood believes that we like and will watch this type of imbecilic nonsense they will only make more.

Pat Flynn has a cool, kind of unique style of guitar playing and has some nice, tasteful, yet flashy phrases as well. Sam Bush....well...what's to say?? He is always a grade 'A' mandolin player!!!

A rockin' boogie woogie treatment of an old classic. That said, I did not find the rest of the tracks remarkable, and a couple were downright painful to listen to. There was something \\"off\\" about Fats' rendition of Silent Night; it just wasn't right. For some reason, the title of this CD has been changed from the original \\"Christmas Gumbo\\" to \\"Christmas Is A Special Day.\\" I thought the gumbo title was better.

Yes, it could been a lovely story of a man overcoming a difficult time in his life, but please enough with the clever little literary devices. It became a trial to finish and I was very disappointed in what had started out as a clever idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading a term paper","review":"My book club chose this book as a companion piece for Madame Bovary. The conceit appeared interesting -- a riff on Flaubert scholarship, but the wit was negligible. Most of it read like a parody (but unfunny) of term-paper research. The narrator/\\"scholar\\", also a doctor with an unfaithful wife (like Madame Bovary) seemed tacked on to a compendium of factoids. I would not recommend this to anyone but die-hard Flaubert nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bok is very hard to read and enjoy.","review":"I don't see why this book gets high marks.

Too intellectual? A really strange fictional account of a doctor who is obsessed with Flaubert (and I mean obsessed!). While it is an interesting format in which to explore Art and Flaubert, it is too artificial and disjointed for me to enjoy. Maybe this book is meant to be savored and provoke deep thoughts. It did not work for me.I really did enjoy Madame Bovary and did not need to delve this deeply into the author's life.

The chapter consists of tables of paragraphs forming a chronology.

We read Madame Bovary, \\"A Simple Heart,\\" and then the Barnes. And this is how I recommend you read it too. (Knowing Sentimental Education probably helps too.) Barnes is right to choose Flaubert as his protagonist's obsession; other choices he (and Braithwaite) make are also felicitous. Best of all, when all the virtuoso pyrotechnics are finished, what remains is a profoundly moving human story. In many ways, this novel redeems so many of the empty puzzles passing themselves off as postmodern fiction these days.

Though this series has, in recent years, taken steps beyond fiction into pure fantasy, those in charge have not gone so far as to eradicate mortality. The fact is, that, though Wonder did indeed have to die, she did not have to do so in such a pointless and embarassing manner. Her death was contrived simply to pump some life into a faltering series, and was written by an anonymous author who had no right to be penning the last breaths of such a beloved character. And she died to give birth to a boring colt who would be loved and doted upon by his bratty rider, Christina.

Ever since the publisher made the awful decision to produce a book every couple months the series has gone downhill. In order to produce this many books you have to have many writers. With many writers you lose continuity. Joanna's writing produced well thought out characters and story plots. The other authors have created a royal mess with confusion, lost characters, and weak plots. I know that Joanna tried to get the publisher to understand this. I personally would like to know what happened to Sierra, Cindy, and Max. As for this book, I personally would have never foreseen the manner in which Ashleigh acts. If you want to talk about bratty, lets talk about an adult acting bratty. Yes I cried but what could have been a memorable book quickly turned into a truly weak effort.

Oh I have to say that thy shouldn't have ended the book #72 like they did. (It's a great book by the way.) Most of the books past this one have just gone downhill.

It's heart warming the way Star looked up to Christina and heart wrenching when you think of all the pain Star had to go through. You'll laugh, you'll cry (I did) but whatever you'll do you'll want to read this book over and over again. If I could, I would give this book way more than five stars, I'd give it ten out of ten!

The book doesn't even say a word about him. And hello, you can't just skip an entire year. All of a sudden Parker's driving? And Ashleigh couldv'e been a little more sympathetic towards Christina. And don't you think that a truck and horse trailer are a bit much for a birthday? Other than that, I thought it was great. Even though I'm not that big on racing, I think Christina is gonna turn towards it and \\"ride Star to victory.\\" And Christina liked Dylan and Parker, but who does she like the most? It certainly was intruiging. I read it twice in one day. I can't wait for \\"Star in Danger\\" to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, this is not a spin-off!","review":"I've heard people saying that this is a spinoff about Wonder's Legacy. If that were true, then why does it say 37 in the corner? This has Christina, and Melanie, and Ashleigh, and Star is Wonder's last foal. Star has a special bond with Christina, and Chris is trying to save him. The back says: Is history repeating itself? Christina Reese has heard the story many times- Wonder was a tiny, sickly foal no one thought was worth saving. No one but Christina's mother, Ashleigh. With Ashleigh's love and hard work, Wonder went on to win the Kentucky Derby. No, when Wonder's last foal is born under tragic surcumstances, there's little hope for her baby colt. Only Christina can see that the colt is special, just like his mother was. But will she get a chance to prove it?"},{"rating":"2","title":":c) :c) Smile! You'll love this sad story! :c) :%(","review":"I love this! Finally a new beginning! I was confused abput Wonder's Legacy on the top at first, but, I get it now. I have several theories about how come he was named Wonder's Star. 1) Wonder dies, brings a new star up there, and Star was named for it. 2) He was the star for a while and he was brave. I can't believe that Wonder has to die! I'd probably blame on Star if I was Ashleigh, be like her, can't bear to see Star. So, it was pretty funny too with that goat! :c) I really loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS WAS HEART TOUCHING < LET ME WIPE A TEAR!","review":"Who else cried when Wonder died?

Ta Ta for now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I CRIED MY EYES OUT IT WAS SO SAD!!!!!!!","review":"This has to be the saddest book in the Thoroughbred series. It was a big shame that Wonder died after giving birth to Star. And what made me even more mad is that Ashleigh decided to let Townsend Acres train Star and riun him. Of Wonder's last foal, how could Ashleigh do that to Star and Christina?!? And when ever Ashleigh walked in the broodmare barn, she never even noticed Star. She acted like it wasn't even there!! Until Christina found out what was wrong with her mom, it broke her heart looking as if she didn't even want him there. Even though Star looked exactly like Wonder, that doesn't give Ashleigh the right to ignore him. The end was probably the saddest part when Brad came up with his father, Mr. Townsend, to take Star away from Whitebrook and Ashleigh didn't even say goodbye to him. It is obvious that Brad is going to ruin the horse before he can even race."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, was that sad!","review":"Without Wonder was so sad! I felt as If I were with Ashleigh, all along, it was well written, but in #24 It said that Leagacy was Wonder's last foal,but in Without Wonder, It said that Ashleigh had decided to breed Wonder, one more time? Odd But, one thing, i'm from Australia, and I've got a bone to pick with the shipping. WHY IS WITHOUT WONDER IN AUSTRALIA, AND NOT ON THE TRACK AND DEAD HEAT NOT? nnnnaaaaa You mean old smellys.

I was disappointed. The travelogues are sketchy but useful. In every chapter, over and over again, we hear that industrilization is bad for rivers, dams stop the free flow of rivers, and that Ango settlers stole the land from native Americans. Yes, that's true and probably can be profitably discussed in a preface. Something like John Graves \\"Good Bye to a River\\" engenders sympathy and makes you care about the rivers.

The multiple dramatic angles overpass all the previous considerations in the French Cinema and with the glorious exception of The postman always rings twice of Tay Garnett in USA and the Italian version Ossesione of Luchino Visconti in 1943 based on James Cain \` s novel , this scary movie will show the scrupulous chess game for murder planned for two women .Simone Signoret will prove you once more why she was the most outstanding and prominent French actress through the XX Century , four years before her consecrated in USA with her more than deserved Academy Award by A room in the top.Vera Clouzot is fine too .

The audio in this particular version offered at $12.99 is often difficult to understand. The voices of some of the boys are too mature for their ages and the some of the other characters' voiceovers do not fit their physiques or personalities. The video quality couldn't be any worse in a six dollar version with white subtitles. KW, Melbourne, FL, USA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diabolique","review":"Snatched from Alfred Hitchcock, who lost the film rights to Clouzot, \\"Diabolique\\" is one of the finest thrillers ever made--in any language. Macabre, mysterious, and haunting, it keeps you on the edge of your chair with mind-bending plot twists, taut pacing, and an atmosphere of ghostly uncertainty. Signoret is icy yet resplendent, while director Clouzot's real-life wife Véra conveys just the right mix of fear and paranoia. This is chilling perfection from a criminally under-recognized French master of suspense. Beware the atrocious American remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding piece of film making.","review":"Parallels are always drawn with Psycho - but I think this brilliant movie had a much stronger influence on Vertigo. Also look for the similarity between Charles Vanel's detective and Peter Falk's Columbo! Criterion have a well deserved reputation for the quality of their DVD releases. It's a real tragedy that we don't have companies who care as much about film restoration on this side of the Atlantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Hitchcock Said","review":"In a press conference shortly after the release of Psycho, a journalist asked Hitchcock, \\"Mr. Hitchcock, my daughter saw Diabolique and refuses to take baths. Now she's seen Psycho and refuses to take showers. It's become a problem. What do suggest I do?\\" Hitchcock replied: \\"Send her to the dry cleaners.\\" It must have galled Hitch to have lost out to Henri Clouzot in making this film. It is right up his alley as a classic suspense film.Suffice to say Diabolique is a creepy little thriller that sticks with you long after you've seen it. In fact, it never actually leaves your mind. Decay and decadence permeates the boys' school grounds. You know in advance that no good will come of this.The acting is superb, and this film is rightfully remembered as one of Simone Signoret's best performances as the world weary hussy schoolmarm. Vera Clouzot is multi-layered as the put-upon, frazzled wife. Both women are riveting.Buy it. Turn down the lights. See if you don't jump."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent explanation of the process of justice","review":"The judicial process is often a maddeningly confusing one. Cardozo, one of the most well known and respected jurists in the history of American law, aims to give a relatively straightforward account of the judicial process.The book is a good introduction to law and its processes. It certainly is not an authoritative text, as certain of his discussions seem to be out of date. However, given the authority accorded Cardozo in the legal world one can hardly go wrong starting out with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Do not buy this edition!","review":"The General Books version is some kind of scanned/OCR copy of the original.

I am quite sure that most people will know almost every song on this album, which, seeing as it is not a greatest hits album, is astonishing. He does an excellent cover of Bobby Darins 'Dream Lover' and a few other covers, but it's the song 'Runaround Sue' and the two blues 'Kansas City' and 'The Wanderer' that really make this album such a hit.

It's been 5 years since its original release, but this holds up much better than his multi-platinum work with Asia; and his voice just keeps getting better with age. You're Not The Only One stands as one of his finest compositions. A clear standout. Everyone I know who has heard this has been blown away by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wetton at his solo best","review":"This is a tremendous release by John Wetton, and probably the best of his solo albums. Wetton consistently delivers some of the best vocals in rock and roll today, and in fact gets better with age. The song writing here is outstanding as well, especially on Battle Lines, You're Not The Only One, and Right Where I Wanted To Be. However, every song is great from beginning to end. I do beleive John does his best though when collaborating with Geoff Downes, Asia or other bands he has worked with, and probably the only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wetton scores again with solo effort","review":"Yet another great offering from a musician who is, regrettably, often overlooked by radio stations. It's too bad for them - the title track and \\"Right Where I Wanted to Be\\" would suit most formats, and the powerful ballads \\"Hold Me Now\\" and \\"You're Not the Only One\\" can hold their own against just about anything getting airplay today. A must for Wetton fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deffinitely the best I've heard in a long time...","review":"GREAT!!!! the album is simply awesome! Wetton is still THE MAN!. 'Hold me now' is quite simply unbelievable, and the rest of the songs are great, there's about everything you could dream, great guest musicians, and Wetton's unique voice... well, I've had a great time listening to it (time and time again), hope you have a great time too!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chasing Bears","review":"I purchased this book to read to my 9 yr son while vactioning in Voyageurs National Park.

Seeing that such monster players like Louis Johnson were on it made me all the more excited, but I must admit that this performance was not what I expected. I was hoping for more of the 70's style material: heavier jazz, fusion and straight-up funk, but this performance was mainly an excercise in 80's pop and disco. Don't get me wrong, the musicianship is killer. Duke performs an amazing, unaccompanied key-tar solo and Louis Johnson's bass higlights are no-joke, but overall the performance was just too 80's mainstream and lacking the serious funk that I was expecting. It was just too 80's cheese...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Human Resources professionals","review":"This is the best definition of the HRD role I have ever read.

Although some of the songs Thomas Dolby did are superwacky- Hyperactive, for example- the first ten songs on this album are so incredibly original and beautiful that it just blows my mind. Thomas Dolby has said that Michael Jackson is a fan, and I totally buy that- Screen Kiss, One of Our Submarines, Airwaves, they're so fearless and awesome, and share the electro-confidence of Jackson or Prince almost as much as the Brit pioneers he's always lumped with. He did NOT invent Dolby Stereo either. Buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Starting Point","review":"No one book can adequately cover all aspects of human sexuality.

Most of them were interesting, but none of them was really scary. A couple of them were thought-provoking and, in that way, a bit like an Alfred Hitchcock type of story.

Some of the later efforts should actually be called The John Lydon band, but that's up for debate. The BBC sessions are great, you get a different perspective on some of the songs you've been hearing for years. There's also \\"The Cowboy Song\\" a 12\\" remix and another B-Side. I'm sure there was more rarities that could be included here but the price was reasonable, so I can't really get too upset. The songs from HappY?\\" should have included \\"Fat Chance Hotel\\"-which is the closest they came to their original sound.

Having already read something about Shelly in a book (That I did not like much) titled \\"The spiritual science of kriya yoga\\" by Goswami Kriyananda, I had many expectations, which remained unfulfilled when I read this book by Cozzi. My humble opinion is that kriya yoga is a serious science and maybe it did not deserve a book like this. Obviously everybody is entitled to like or dislike this book and to believe or disbelieve the contents. My personal opinion is that the contents of this book are not suitable for people seriously interested in kriya yoga as a spiritual path, because it's very strange stuff. A few things reported in the book seem to come from horror movies and not from a kriya yoga master."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"Carmit Delman whines, whines, and whines some more about being too poor to afford a lavish party for her ninth birthday.

Why? because, it has songs that are more upbeated than ABBA Gold, most of the songs on here are from their first and last albums. It sort of give the average person a more excited point of view. The group mostly did these songs, hopefully for a good credit. With The Visitors LP, the group had the most failure because of the songs were to technical for the day. I believe that if ABBA were to do the reunion that more MORE ABBA GOLD cd's would top the charts. With the new realeases of their albums (including bonus tracks) I find it very hard to believe that most of the copies left are all The Visitors. I believe that The Visitors should get more credit as this cd was the most upbeat than any other. This CD is also great for people who are tired of listening to the hits like Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia, and Waterloo. I would rate this cd 4 stars out of 5 for the content. This cd is highly recomended as a great gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Abba Gold","review":"I have been an Abba fan for years, and have Abba Gold which I love to listen to and sing along with.

'A Nation Of Haircuts' attempts to replicate classic Taylor penned Queen tracks such as 'Drowse' and 'Tenement Funster' but this time around the social comment misses somehow and comes off as lecturing - and the repetition of the title too may times gives the impression of a lack of ideas lyrically.I really wanted to like this release but, like the cover art, it feels half baked - striving for past glories by being too serious and ultimately coming off as being a bit silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mediocre student","review":"So dull and well-groomed, one might think it is a mid-term music school exam.

I first bought him one when he was a (very energetic!) puppy, and only slightly bigger than the toy. I set it down on the floor and he pounced on it immediately and played with it until he was tired out. It can go outside just fine -- being latex, it washes up easily -- so it makes a good outdoor as well as indoor toy. It's fairly tough -- just don't let your dog use it as a chew toy too much. I made that mistake with the first one, and had to replace it about a year later. It's really made for chasing and playing.I've since bought several of the other toys in this series, and while he likes them, this is his favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing venture..","review":"If you're a fan of his previous cd's, you may be disappointed with this one. Far too Celtic for my taste, and it lacked the imagery intrinsic to his other works. AV takes background to vocals on most of the cuts. Although Eliza Gilkyson has a beautiful, lilting voice, I didn't buy this cd to listen to her. This should be a Gilkyson cd featuring Andreas Vollenweider.As big a fan as I am of AV, I am compelled to only give this 2 stars - one just because it's AV, and the other because it's tolerable for a celtic genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love It or Hate It","review":"This album is totally out of character with Vollenweider's previous releases, and unlike the other reviewers I didn't like it a bit. To me it's a weak attempt at \\"smooth jazz\\" with lots and lots of schmultzy vocals. Yuk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for your soul","review":"This album is one of Vollenweider's most underrated CD. Most people are turned off by the vocals, a sharp departure from the earlier styles of the masterful harpist. However, the vocals meshed perfectly with the sounds of Vollenweider's array of instruments.I consider Vollenweider's music to be program music. In other words, to understand its many sounds and melodies, one must imagine a magical place, a kinder place, a place that calms and soothes us, or any place that makes us forget our worldly troubles. Vollenweider's music is able to do just that. The vocal tracks in this CD have a mythical quality to it, enhancing the overall experience rather than dampening it.If you are unfamiliar with the music of Andreas Volenweider, I suggest picking up his Grammy-nomintated 'Down to the Moon' and 'Book of Roses.' Eolian Minstrel is definitely different that the earlier works, but is by no means inferior."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Time","review":"My 1st Vollenweider album, and now I'm traveling the majical journey with him.

I have to say that this book is in my top 2 for reading aloud to my students, or anyone who will listen. All it took was a thought to what little bear might sound like (little, scared, and a little bit mischevious). Once I got the voice down, this book became a frequently requested, and rerequested read aloud. My students, it seems could listen to it again and again. They enjoy the illustrations and watching Little Bear \\"try to go to sleep\\", while gradually revealing quite a fear of the dark, which some of them identify with. This is a great story to read out loud at bedtime or anytime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun bedtime book","review":"My daughter laughs at Little Bear as he tries all the different sleeping positions.

The story doesn't make that much sense. It talks about how big bear keeps bringing brighter lanterns in, but little bear is still playing games in teh background. The plot isn't that great, and doesn't make that much sense. Then to make things a lot more difficult, they go outside and look at the moon. Why would somebody do that when they are looking for a brighter light source. A large lantern is much brighter then a full moon. I guess he just must of wanted to show little bear the moon, since little bear hadn't seen it before.

It is an amateur undertaking, not much better than a home movie. The acting is lame, the dialogue is lamer, the overall script is ridiculous, and the plot is absurd. I rented it because of the seven \\"great\\" (4 and 5 star) reviews that were already posted on Amazon. However, I figured something out afterward. All seven reviewers are obviously friends of the guy who made the movie. How do I know? If you click on \\"See all my reviews\\" for all seven of the \\"reviewers,\\" you will find that this movie is the ONLY thing they have EVER rated on Amazon before. So, they aren't regular and objective customers who post reviews on a lot of things. They are friends of this guy, who were probably asked to go on Amazon and write great reviews. That strikes me as really deceptive, which makes me dislike this silly movie even more.Fortunately, I didn't buy this movie. I only rented it.

It weighs more than 15 lbs, with most of the weight high in the steel elevator shaft. On the way from the truck to the site, one of the cheap plastic clips on the carrying strap at the heavy end of the tripod broke. The top plate hit concrete sidewalk from about three feet. After that, the crank wouldn't raise or lower the elevator at all. It froze and then stripped. Save yourself fifty dollars and buy Stabila's standard tripod. We did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor representation of Stabila","review":"This tripod was attractive to me at first because of the price and features. I also own six Stabila levels of various sizes and love them. So, I bought one and used it. It is very cheaply built. I am a contractor, but take very good care of my tools. They cost a lot and help me make money. Why wouldn't I, right. The plastic clips on the carry strap broke day two. Luckily it fell and dinged me in the leg or I would have suffered the same fate as the other writers. I went to a hardware store and bought some make a strap parts. Wider strap, stronger clips. The following week one of the chains pulled out of the legs. This time I ran into a Stabila rep at my local hardware store. He gave me a number to call and said everything would be made right. Ha, I knew better, five calls over three months and no return call. Again, went to the hardware store and fixed it myself.

As usual he fleshes out the history of Russia with the the engaging stories of several families throughout their long historyl What could be boring turns into a long, adventurous tale. Rutherford has a talent for telling LONG stories so it takes a fair amount of fortitude to read his books but you will be better for it in the end. Not for the faint of heart, but for those that like a good big book with a great story to tell, this, along with all his other books, is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced & artificial","review":"While this book is well-written given the scope, many of the chance encounters characters have throughout the book with major historical figures feel artifically forced, and the constant foreshadowing of events to come becomes tiresome. I'm quite amenable to the historical fiction genre -- \\"War and Peace\\" is perhaps my favorite book -- but this work feels like it was trying to hit a checklist, squeezing in as many events as possible, regardless of narrative value. The plot lines all fit together way too conveniently, occasionally leading to shallow character development as well.The reader would benefit from a passing knowledge of Russian history, and there are a few buried allusions that are nuggets for those very familiar with the field, but the simplistic treatment of the topic will likely turn off readers in the latter category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"Rutherford's novels always take me to the time and place of each event.

It's about a convienence store in the middle of the Arizona desert that gets robbed by a couple of bumbling crooks that have no idea what they're doing. Foxx's character just so happened to be there when the store was \\"held up\\" and he needs to get to the airport to make up with his girlfriend (played by Nia Long) before she leaves, but he can't, because now the cops have surrounded the store and set the stage for some great humor.

It combines classical and heavy metal in a flawlessly dark fashion. It's very easy to put this CD in and let it play from start to finish without skipping a single track. Aside from one song, this album has a very laid back, dreamy feel to it. If you want speed, this isn't it. Everyone will have a different opinion of this album, but for me the melodies and notes they use bring back an adrenalin surge of good memories. I say it's almost perfect because a couple of songs, while still good, were not as good as the rest. Absolutely worthy of five stars. Enough talk. Buy the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concluding the 'Dragon'trilogy...","review":"Sweden's Therion comprise Christopher Johnsson on guitars,Kristian Niemann-guitars,Sami Karpinen-drums,and Johan Niemann on bass.Their approach to metal,even though follows the recent trend of mixing orchestral passages with standard metal fare is unique:they actually use full orchestras,choirs,and do away with traditional vocals creating intense mythical,romantic,and ultimately stunning sonic landscapes,as this 1997 effort testifies.'Vovin'is a very welcome breath of fresh air for the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's I have ever heard","review":"I knew Therion because of my best friend. He gave me a cassette and since then, I became a fan of them. This album, Vovin, it's not good. It's really excelent.

Was not a big fan at first because it is two half shells and not one solid shell. But they are right on point. only about 1 in 1000 will break on you in the barrel.

What I like about the cd is how he likes to break new ground with 'Cuetale' sounds like a hybrid of Bachata and Reggaeton. 'Predica' lets you know that William Landron also is a preacher man. 'Conteo' w/ Juelz Santana is straight up hip hop. 'Munecas De Porcelana' is a great story.

He should stop self-proclaiming himself \\"King of Kings\\", it just makes him seem insecure, trying to prove what does not need to be proven. I'm a big fan of Don Omar, he can sing (unlike Daddy Yankee,who only yells). He's my favorite reggaeton artist. Unfortunately, in this CD \\"Don, Don, Don Omar!!!\\" did not make a connection.\\"Angelito\\" is the best lyric in this CD, and there are a couple of other songs that I liked; however, this CD is much more different than the quality we're used to from Don Omar.

Don Omar wants to be a singer, but his limited style really grinds, and the incessant repeats of \\"King Of Kings\\" truly gets tired after the third \\"song\\". Real musicians were not harmed in the making of this album, apart from violinist Miri Ben-Ari, and it shows. No true producers are involved in the next stage of reggaeton, and this will truly drive the genre into the ground before it has really landed internationally. And don't expect much from Yankee's next release...he even has less depth than Omar."},{"rating":"1","title":"King of Kings?????","review":"King of Kings???, no me hagan reir....este cd es una basura.Con exepcion de unas cuantas las demas son basura...La cancion CONTEO, no se sabe si es para los niños de Kindergarden para que aprendan a contar...digo que clase de mongolada, estupidez, etc... es esa???"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Good :)","review":"This whole season is funny and full if drama.

This book brought about the introduction of the KGB killing machine Arkady Kurshin. Coupled with McGarvey's other nemesis Baranov this pair was extremely deadly. McGarvey stays in a dead run trying to prevent the Russians from launching first a Pershing missile and then a Tomahawk missile. This book gives you any type of action scenario that you could ask for. McGarvey and Kurshin battle each other in the sea and on dry land. Baranov is of couse trying to depose Gorbachev. This book is action packed with an excellent plot as well as outstanding characters. This is another great book from Hagberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Kirk McGarvey novels","review":"David Hagberg is always intriguing, especially his Kirk McGarvey series, and Countdown is one of the better books in the series. The story is consistently compelling, taking the action from one great location to another. The tension is superbly timed, and like any great spy story, the hero is not invincible so you always feel he really is in danger. His main adversary is dangerous and cunning, building to a strong mano-a-mano encounter. Hagberg's roots as a writer of submarine-based military fiction sees some application, but I thought the submarine scenes in the book could have been a little more dramatic. Still, that's not really a complaint, just an observation. This is an excellent spy thriller, with plenty of action throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirk McGarvey is the man!","review":"Hagberg has introduced us to a rich, interesting spy character, Kirk McGarvey, an assassin in retirement from the CIA. We learn about McGarvey and we also meet his Russian arch nemesis, who is an assassin. The book starts out a bit slow, but it picks up and is a great spy novel. Highly recommend the McGarvey series to readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, bad, and awful","review":"This book is without question the worst book I've ever read. The plot was stupid, the dialogue was totally laughable, and the characters' actions made no sense whatsoever. For a good technothriller, stick with someone who can write, like Clancy or Bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD was NOT functional.","review":"As a practicing physician, I was very pleased with the content of this Book. It was informative and very helpful. I have several OTHER clinical books by \\"Mosby\\" and was in NO WAY displeased with the Book's content. HOWEVER, this is where my evaluation of this \\"Book/CD combo\\" departs from an otherwise SATISFACTORY review. The accompanying \\"mini-disc\\" WAS FAULTY. I can say that with absolute certainty because.. the Introduction and First Section WOULD PLAY quite well. The remainder and vast majority of the material would only make an \\"indistinguishable mumbling noise.\\" The customer relations department at AMAZON obviously agreed with my assessment and quickly refunded my cost. What more could you ask of a company? Because of Amazon's \\"customer-friendly\\" policy concerning returns, I will continue to shop with them.. with Confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner For Shirley Bassey","review":"Though I must admit I am not a great fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber, I thoroughly enjoyed this disc. Miss Bassey brings her considerable vocal power and talent for dramatic interpretation to bear on what would otherwise be kitschy material, turning it into something resembling art.Songs such as The Last Man In My Life, As If We Never Said Goodbye and Tell Me On A Sunday are brought brilliantly to life, with every emotional nuance squeezed from the material. This is a disc to savour repeatedly. If you are a Bassey fan, you will enjoy it wothout reservation; if you are a Webber fan, you will appreciate the songs being sung with an intensity and realism not often heard before.All in all, a disc for the pleasure of almost everyone interested in quality singing and 20th century theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Could Have Been Better","review":"Shirley Bassey was voted the best female vocalist in the last 50 years, and most of her recordings reflect that. However, this CD is the exception. I don't know if she was just having a bad day, but every song seems to be a struggle for her, and knowing Bassey, there was no reason to struggle! The only song on this CD that she manages to give the \\"Bassey treatment\\" to is \\"As If We Never Said Goodbye\\", and even it could have been better. The rest are hard to listen to. I love the picture on the cover though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never, never, never!","review":"I was so excited to hear these interpretations of Andrew Lloyd Webber standards, but this is such a horrible attempt. Her belting is just so out of place in this particular recording. So sorry, Shirley. Terrific picture on the cover, though, and \\"Macavity\\" and \\"The Last Man in My Life\\" are the only cuts that are not that bad. I suggest for musical afficionados to definitely ignore this major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannon Photo Paper","review":"This was to be a rushed order for printing pictures for the holidays. I ordered off the internet since no stores that I found in the area seemed to stock double sided picture paper. I purchased the paper and paid the extra $$$$$$$$ to have it shipped immediately, so I would receive it in 3 to 4 days. On the day I expected the paper to land on my doorstep I received an email saying it was being shipped that day. Needless to say, I paid $25 (15 in shipping) for a few sheets of paper that never arrived on time so they were totally worthless to me. I wrote the company asking for an adjustment in the cost of the shipping but never received a response. If the ad would have been honest and more descriptive of the \\"rush delivery\\", I never would have taken the chance.

Ney is a great teacher because she has learned about faith through incredibly difficult times - such as barely surviving a horrific flood. Each journey in her life reveals God's faithfulness and His willingness to teach us how to live in faith. While I was reading this book, I felt like Ney was my older sister and we were just chatting together about the Lord and His ways. Awesome! Ney's style is really personable and she ends each chapter with a cliffhanger, so don't pick this book up unless you have time to read it all the way through. The most important thing I got out of this book is to trust not only God's promises, but also to trust the God that MADE those promises. His Word is true because HE is true. I can have faith because HE is faithful. Definitely a must read for anyone interested in learning more about faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor service.","review":"The Carper 318 will not open my gate.

This is undoubtedly some of Simon & Kirby's best work. Fast paced, these stories easily stand up with the best comics of any era. Marvel should really reprint this or at least put it out as a trade paperback. It you like westerns or boy adventure stories don't miss this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid presentation","review":"Gower's survey begins with Galileo and ends with Carnap. In between, he covers a number of prominent scientists - the ones you expect, like Bacon and Newton; and a few you don't, like John Maynard Keynes. He has grouped his subjects according to the nature of their contribution, which means that this reads as the series of essays that it is. Each essay is separately referenced.There are a few odd omissions, like Descartes (who is nonethless mentioned in passing). But the net result is that, instead of being presented with the historical panorama, one is confronted with a series of ideas - and how they fit into the overall understanding of contemporaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I bought this as a holiday gift for a friend in 2006.

Finally gave up and cut siding with a 4 1/2\\" grinder and diamond blade. Boy were the neighbors thrilled with us!

This cd is craziness, and it slays. It's weird to me that people keep comparing them to Vader, but seriously-Peter writes all the music for Vader, and I'm sorry I just don't hear it. Just because there are Vader members, doesn't make it Vader music. Sound (death metal), yes. Style (Mauser & Hiro have all their own), no. And Novy, he is probably one of the most entertaining dm bassists around. Doc-it's a shame about his accident and that he's not playing right now. If you want to compare this death metal wise, this is definitely up to par. And in no way is this meant to knock Vader, Vader OWNS. But this cd is proof Mauser is perfectly capable of standing on his own.

I've been a New Order Fan since Power Corruption and Lies, and I'm fascinated by the music that drove the creative juices in the early days and appealed to the band members throughout their evolution.

It was fairly easy to put together, it took about 90 minutes (no missing parts, but there were a few places the directions didn't match up perfectly with the parts we had, I think the directions were for a prior version). The quality is fine; it's sturdy enough and easy for kids to use.

But it's worth it in the end. B) the dishwasher, oven, and microwave are very shallow. You can't slide anything wider than about 12\\" deep.We got ours while this was on sale.

I can agree the author may have done a lot of reaching throughout the book , but it didn't take away from it being a great read. I actually felt a bit of a closeness to Brandi & Tanya.

Plus, I thought it would be cool to read a different storyline from all the similar ones saturating the market right now. I really don't mind if it seemed realistic or not as long as it's an interesting read. My first problem with it is it seemed to really drag on. Everytime I picked the book up I got sleepy. Now, don't get me wrong, the opening was an attention-grabber but the after the first few chapters it went downhill from there. I've read books in one day that really did make me not want to put them down and this wasn't one of them. Then, it was a bit choppy. The constant flashbacks, that were recalled in pieces - I assume to keep you guessing about what was to happen next, were a bit much.

This book is so different from anything I have read. It gives a lot of insight on relationships between husband and wife, father and son, mistresses, family, God, self-worth, incest, you name it.

He is one of our zestiest poets of things-as-they-are, happily allergic to obscurity, pretension, and gauzy abstraction. Every poem is *placed*: firmly located in time and space, naturally, but also placed with utmost care on the page. His sinewy free verse is given flexibility by his great control of syntax and his diction, as always, is capacious and thickly textured. Calling a poet \\"readable\\" these days might seem like damnation with faint praise, but to my mind we need a lot more poetry which combines accessibility, good humor, and intelligence as skillfully as Galvin always does.

Typically one reads sci-fi/fantasy as an escape from the general repetition/unpleasantness of life. I would've skipped this title had I known the author was going to use it as a platform for his apparent negative reservations against authority. Another thing I did not like was the total absence of thrilling & intense action which otherwise is so common throughout most 40k novels.

The book is mainly about the feelings of a new guardsmen. Starts from leaving his home through basic training and his first engagment. His fears, terrors, and the sheer hell of war are described. To me this is out of place in a work of science fiction as the main theme. Instead of this book you could and should read a non-ficition book about a real soilder and his experiences. You would get the same under lining themes and it would be real.The book did have some good points but they were few and far between.The reviewer who said \\"May get a bit draggy as the story keeps hinting at the meaning of '''fifteen hours''' but never quite getting to explaining it till the end.\\" made me laugh it says it right on the cover what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"15 tired cliches of war","review":"I love junkfood.

The instructions it came with are next to worthless. The packaging was horrible and it looked like it got thrown around and ripped multiple times prior to me receiving it. The reviews about the break setup, though somewhat exaggerated, are true in the fact that they take a while to calibrate. I was able to get the front break done, but for the rear, I will need to take it to a bike shop to have them do as the brake just does not grab enough.The scooter itself is decent and well built for the price.

The instructions that were included were inadequate to say the least. My grandson loves the scooter after I spent all day adjusting the rear brakes. It is quite a challenge, but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scooter!","review":"I bought this for my son on his sixth birthday and it was a big hit. Every kid in the neighborhood wanted to ride it when he got it and arguments still break out regarding who gets to ride it next (we've had it about a week). It is very well made and it appears as though it will last a long time. Both of my boys, 11 and 6, prefer this one over the Razor or Fuzion styles.Assembling it took about 50 minutes, 20 for the scooter frame/wheels/handle bar and another 30 for the brakes. Assembling and setting the brakes, as others have mentioned, will drive you bonkers. I still don't think they are set the way they are supposed to be, but they are as good as I was finally able to get them. The instructions are extremely handy for setting your drink on while doing the assembly so as not to make a ring on your furniture, but that's about it. Overall, though, I do recommend this scooter. Great price from Amazon, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"New version of an old favorite...","review":"This is a wonderful scooter. It is well thought out and well made.

The hand brakes are nice although he doesn't use them much right now...he is just learning to ride the scooter. I would have given this scooter 5 stars except the brakes are kind of tough to grip down on for my son...not a big deal as I said the brakes are there for when he goes too fast and needs help but he can also stop with his foot. Overall a GREAT scooter for the younger child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun for my son","review":"My son was not ready for his bicycle without training wheels so I bought him this scooter. He loves it and rides it almost every evening. His balance improved and with that his confidence. Soon he will try his bicycle again. It was money well spent.I put on the wheels very quickly myself. I tried the handbreaks and didn't get them working properly. I decided to ask for professional help and brought it to my bicycle store. Some reviewers complained about the spokes and they checked that as well. This adds to the total cost, but he now has a scooter that is safe.The only negative thing is the stand, which he hits often. He doesn't want me to remove it though so it must not be that bad.

The scooter is a good product for the price. The quality was in line with the price not great but adequate about like everything made in china these days. What I found online US made was hundreds more expensive. I can't believe that Toys R Us only gets ten dollars for assembling bikes.

(I am 5'9\\", 168#.) Personally, I had cross-trained on mine for an inline skating marathon. Of course I had to train on the skates too, but this scooter gave me some days for my back to take a break during the training. After four years, I moved up to the larger scooters with a bicycle (700c/28 inch) front wheel and trained for racing those exclusively. I race a Footbike Track now and have won some major races and set some records, so I think this small scooter gave me a good start. For racing and competing in the sport of footbiking, the wheels on the Kent scooter are too small and too slow, otherwise it's durable enough and the brakes make it safer than inline skating. It's great for around the neighborhood as well as around the park! NOTE: If you prefer not bending over so much while you scoot, or scooting faster with less effort, buy one of the big-wheeled scooters."},{"rating":"2","title":"My grandson's love these scooters!","review":"We purchased these scooters for Christmas for our 2 grandsons age 9 and 11.

It was much easier for him to figure out how to balance this scooter, and gave him an extra measure of confidence since all he has to do is step off of it. The larger inflatable tires make this scooter much safer than razor style scooters with their small inline skate wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, well built, good price and fun to ride","review":"I couldn't decide between the Razor Lux A5 and the Kent Super Scooter--so I bought them both :-)The Kent was easy to assemble and is very similar ride to the Sidewalker Micro at a fraction of the price. The only thing I got from the Micro is the fold-up feature. The Super Scooter has a choice of two wheel sizes, we opted for the larger. While it is a kid kickscooter, I'm 57 and ride it with my grand daughter. It is a blast. The capacity will easily accomodate an adult--you can easily adjust the handle bars between kid and adult. While my grand daughter prefers the Razor Lux A5, I really like them both and don't regret either purchase from Amazon (other than the steep shipping cost :-( .....

Helps with balance and steering, since the controls are almost exactly like a bicycle.

Handlebars don't go up very high, but I bought it for my 6 year old and had to put them at the lowest setting. Brakes can be tricky, but with a little patience not really hard at all.

The assembly is a nightmare, set aside a good hour and have an adjustable wrench and pliers ready! Like some of the other reviews have stated the brakes are almost impossible to dial in correctly. I had a friend come over who knows a lot about bikes, he was able to get the brakes working \\"ok\\" but said the dropout wasn't straight and causing some of the problems. I ended up sending it back out of frustration. Did some shopping and found the Diggler Dirt Doggy.

We tried every suggestion in the pamphlet. Also, at the end of the instructions it states \\"If you are unable to get the brakes to work take the scooter to a bike repair shop for professional repair.\\" The consumer should not have to go to these lengths to get something to work properly (although Amazon was very professional about it and willing to pay for the repair). The kick stand is so not necessary. It's too small and the scooter falls over easily. I did not like the fact that the foot plate where the child stands is made of sub-standard plastic.

Even though the audio isnt that great, I still watch the thing all the time. The best part of this package is the CD that comes along with it. This is worth buying this product alone. I suggest putting the CD on full blast and watching the DVD on mute. All in all I give the DVD 3 out of 5 and the CD 5 out of 5 which averages out to a decent 4.

The plot I had figured out in the first quarter, and you'd have to be an idiot to think the hero was going to kill her, so there went that bit of suspense.

Lily is just... eh. I agree with a below comment, I didn't care if either of them lived or died in the end. Most LH books contain a LOT of boring introspection, it's something I don't enjoy but I expect it and try to get past it and to the good parts.

At 60 years old, I've read a great many thrillers in my life, and I'm glad I took a chance on this one. Of course, I got my copy from the library.

I actually had my own doubts that I could be drawn into a story about a contract killer and become engrossed in the story. I was hooked after a few chapters and couldn't wait to finish the book. (You know a book is great when you lose sleep because you sit up through the late night, bleary, finishing chapter after chapter) I won't detail the events, the book description will suffice.

Lucas and Lily shared trust, understanding, and passion, that existed for a short time through their past relationships. Lucas had a life of being somewhat isolated and alone, and Lily had a life where she dealth with death practically on an everyday basis and was always looking over her shoulder.

The main characters are cold. I mean how warm or endearing can they be when they're assasins? The action seemed okay, but the romance lacked. It does seem, like someone else said, on the order of All the Queen's Men. I just don't care for the super spy stories when I'm wanting romantic suspense.

She is a super writer but this one lacked just about everthing. The sory line was weak and the people--I just could not relate to--it seemed like this book was just \\"pumped out because she had to get one out\\". Nothing about the book held my interest.

I had pleasant memories of the show. But, my memory deceived me. The show is slow paced, even for '70's fair and is often down right boring.

I listen to his music, and I really like it. And then I read reviews of the same music, and it seems no one else likes him. So I get on this kick that he's not really that good.But deep down inside, I love his music, forget the critics!!!! This is a great cd to have, although, I would recomend getting the original realeases these songs were on.And when you listen to these songs, forget about every critic you have ever heard.But down to business, this release kind of has a generic feel to it. Not really any notes or anything, just his big hits thrown together to make a buck or two. Wich they had included \\"We Just Disagree\\" which is Dean's best moment. But that's fine, don't include his best song on his Greatest Hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ecclesiastical thriller!","review":"I found the Red Hat to be a page turner about the alleged current struggle in the Catholic Church to define what Vatican II was really all about. The reason I say 'alleged' is that the average Catholic has no idea that the struggle is going on, what the issues are about, or who the players are. It's really a conflict that's being waged by intellectuals, pundits, and professionals. Still, the book is smart and a lot of fun. There's some over-the-top bad guys and many humorous observations that keep the story moving swiftly. On a serious note, there's some moving scenes of individuals trying to work out their personal conflicts with faith.By the way, did I miss something in real life? When did Notre Dame become a bastion of orthodoxy? Or is this, as a previous reviewer has noted, just Ralph McInerny having some fanciful fun?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent look into Fibonacci Trading","review":"There are some interesting fibonacci patterns and concepts in this book, but the examples were well chosen and looks great in hindsight. Problems with these types of \\"line\\" studies is that if enough lines are drawn on a chart, then sooner or later price will bounce from one of them.

However, for those fans who do not have the ultra rare \\"This House is Cold\\" and wonder if it is worth purchasing this remastered copy, let me assure you IT IS! This track is excellent. It is not an instrumental or filler track but a synth-driven rocker that stands well on its owns and also complements the sound of I, Assassin (it also would have fit well on Dance soundwise). The CD booklet also includes comments from Numan, himself, on this track and \\"Bridge? What Bridge?\\" along with a six-page article, photos of all the 12\\" single covers, and lyrics to all the tracks (even the B-sides). I recommend all the Beggars Banquet remasters, especially the last three (Dance-Warriors) as they each offer an excellent \\"lost\\" track, like \\"This House is Cold.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Numan B 4 the big change in style...","review":"He was so good and innovative.

I'm not planning on stealing their music, I just want to rip it to the device of my choosing and it appears that I can't do that. After the problems with Sony and their rootkit, I'm not letting anyone install software to my computer just to listen to music.

However, I would also like to have the freedom to listen to the tunes when I am working on my computer at home, at work, out on a jog, etc. I was hoping to use one of the songs in slide show I am compiling for a famliy function. All of these are legal, personal uses. But, no way! This is the most NON-user friendly album I have ever owned (I wish I could take it back). I will never buy another Ryan Shupe/Rubberband product.

But her book adds little truly useful and new information. So this book is better than nothing. I mean, so many think that Branwell influenced his sisters' writings. It's widely believed that the crazy wife locked inside a room in \\"Jane Eyre\\" was modeled after Branwell's fits and screams while drunk in his bedroom upstairs and also while later enduring the D.T.s upstairs in his father's room.

The songs range in style pretty widely, but there is a pervasive mood which holds the album together. It's got some dark themes, but these are dark times we live in, and overall it seems to be an album more about fighting back than despairing.

However, this album serves as a testament to Dark Star, which in my opinion is the greatest song of all time, at least I'd say it's my favorite song. The Dead being the greatest musical assemblage of musicians show how over 25 years they transformed this piece, and where they could go with it, and what it's potential was. It's a [good] tune, all around and is THE signature Grateful Dead song.

Instead, be prepared to be stupefied beyond comprehension. If this novel is to exemplify the tenets of the nouveau roman novel, it is abundantly clear why this particular form died at the starting gate.

This magazine is full of information that will appeal to the general reader as well as those whose life revolves around what's in the sky. For instance in one issue we have an article on how the Me-262 has been rebuilt and how the Joint Strike fighter was saved. Saved due to hundreds of individual contributions that made the fighter light enough to meet the military specs. There are also articles that appeal to those in the aerospace industry.And since it's by the Smithsonian the pictures are nothing short of superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Source of Information on the History of Aviation","review":"This magazine is an excellent source on aviation as well as space.

After I noticed this I didn't really inspect the thing further but it looks like the pre-drilled holes for the other back section were poorly done and pushed through the outside. It's a little tough to explain but basically it's a shoddy product that's built poorly.

It contains short and long versions of Eliot reading \\"The Waste Land\\" and Eliot reading \\"The Hollow Men.\\" However, when I recieved the disk, and put it into the car's CD player, I was shocked to hear what sounds like a 1980's drum machine and electronic \\"music\\" superimposed over the original recordings. The monotonous high-energy \\"music\\" is mixed over the reading in such a way as to dominate the recording. Although Eliot's reading is a bit monotonous in itself, I do not think that this interpretation was what he had in mind when he recorded it. This treatment makes these two poems seem frivolous and unimportant. My wife, no poetry buff, found the \\"music\\" irritating within seconds.Unless you like anachronistic misfits like _Moulon_Rouge_, you might want to let this one pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst i've ever heard!","review":"I have bought many things from Amazon and never felt compelled to write a review, good or bad, until now.

On the contrary, the NiCad batteries do not last as advertised and quickly develop \\"charge memory\\" rendering the whole system useless. In my case, I bought the base and three extra handsets with dual line and answering system.

It was what I thought was the perfect solution. A corded phone with matching cordless phones, (my system came with 2 cordless phones)& it was expandable, plus I didn't need to have a phone jack to plug in the cordless phones, just an electrical outlet for the chargers. About 4 months after purchase, the \\"Number 2\\" cordless phone wouldn't work. It wouldn't charge, I couldn't answer the phone using this handset & it keeps saying I have to move closer to the base, even when I am sitting right next to it. Now it doesn't work at all. The answering machine was okay & not to difficult to use, I also like the other features.

In this case, he has crafted an interweaving of his popular rock /song-smithing style with genuine Native American musical elements, both vocal and instrumental, that resonates deeply in the soul. This is truly beautiful, powerful fusion music. Robertsons' own Native American heritage takes him deeper in yet. After many listenings, it only looms larger in the Masterpiece category.

It is not only a great collection of songs, but also very informative in its lyrics and 16 page booklet. Some songs are sung in Native dialects, others in English, but all tell of the honour and history of North American peoples. \\"Words of fire, deeds of Blood\\" was inspired by the words of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce nation, and is so haunting, it puts chills down my spine, as do a number of other tracks.

Go figure!","review":"Easily the very worst of all the Pet Shop Boys material combined! Even the remixes for the then-new \\"Absolutely Fabulous\\" singles leave a bitter taste in my mouth. What happened to the good job well done from the first \\"Disco\\"? I think that the Boys could have probably chosen to recruit the same mix-masters to produce this mediocre, futile effort. There's also a mix of one of \\"Very\\"'s B-sides \\"We All Feel Better In The Dark\\", the much better version being found on the double collection \\"Alternative\\". This pitiful CD is for Rabid Dance-Remix song fans only, others (even tried and true PSB fans) beware at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO HARD....to listen to!","review":"The record opens with the PSB voice singing Absolutely Fabulous, then it's NOTHING even close to what the Pet Shop Boys would put out. There were other voices NON-PSB singing \\"Liberation, Liberation\\" in a rap sound and it just was horrible and annoying to listen to (upbeats, but BORING). I honestly can't even determine the song from the way the remix sounds. NOTHING like the original songs and in a bad way. I'm going to dump this copy out on the net so beware if you like PSBs and don't have a lot of money to waste on it. Too bad I can't give this item 0 stars. I'd be scared to buy any of the other Disco albums PSB has put out now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst PSB CD Ever!!","review":"Unfortunately, this CD was the low point from the band that provided creative, catchy pop and dance tunes.

Fortunately, PSB aren't guilty, this album was just made by their recording company to earn some extra money. I'm sorry that i've spent 14 US$ on that. If you want to buy something good, buy anything else from the pet shop boys (Nightlife is awesome !). If you don't buy this record, don't worry. Your PSB collection won't lack anything essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really... how can you expect to be taken seriously?","review":"All the other reviewers have said it... and I say it too! I am a big PSB fan and I think this is the worst thing they have ever released: a non-stop sequence of lousy remixes-extracts. It all keep repeating itself.

WASTE OF MONEY!!","review":"I have never left a negative review on Amazon before, but this is a terrible phone. Sound quality is miserable as it cuts in and out as described in other reviews. Also has echo and severe static at times. I've had the phone for 5 months and the battery is already to the point where it only lasts 15 to 20 minutes after a full charge. This appears to be a problem with MANY of the panasonic phone models - just read the other reviews. Best advice is to just stay away from this brand altogether. I thought Panasonic was a quality brand; however, they have proved me wrong. I will NEVER buy another Panasonic phone again. This has been a terrible experience - worst of all, I have come to learn from other reviews that this is typical of the brand and not just a fluke as I had originally thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"My children (age 4 and 3) received this game as a gift.

I have watched this movie many times, and always come away emotionally spent. Maybe it is just a woman's movie;maybe it is Berenger's sex appeal, but it is one of his better movies, I feel. He is also precious in the Varalux ad for bifocals;hey, he could do a commercial for ANYTHING and I would be hooked. Must lead a pretty private life, also since you never hear scandal about him.

For those unfamiliar with his music, the songs are in Austrian (i.e. Standard German) with some songs having a \\"The Cars\\" sound and others a same period \\"Bowie\\" sound to them just to give you an idea of his diversity.

Its only drawback is that it requires 120 v power and would not work in a power outage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks Caller ID KX-TS105B Panasonic","review":"Good quality, fast shipping.

I thought because it had a jack for headphones and also a headphone button that it would be ideal. What I didn't realize is that it just is a terrible phone for many reasons. First, the phone amplifies your voice so you hear an echo on the line, which is really distracting when you are speaking witha customer. Second, I didn't see on the specifications that it runs on batteries, not a plug for the wall. In this day and age, every phone should have the option of getting electrity from a socket and not by batteries. I needed the phone to last 40 hours a week for work and it only lasted one 8-hour day. I eventually had to buy another phone because this one was worthless to me. Well, maybe not. If we ever have a hurricane and there is no power but there is a phone line (like that would happen) this phone may come in handy. If you are looking to buy this phone for business, save your money. It isn't worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Month Death","review":"We have only had this phone 5 months and it quit working. It caused all the phones in the house not to work until we unplugged this phone. We thought maybe it just needed new batteries. The batteries in it still showed good but changed them anyway. A week later I tried to use the phone and again there was no dial tone. Went immediately to unplug this phone and again other phones in the house fine again. We were later told by friends they had been trying to get a hold of us for days.

Thanks to Amazon for the effortless return process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Features","review":"The phone is one of very few phones currently available for use by older people who need a SIMPLE type with easy to reach pre-set dial-ups.

Old people who may need urgent help will likely not remember to push that button first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves its purpose!","review":"This is a great phone with all the BASIC features.

This phone uses batteries instead of a outlet for its power. So, if your going to use it for work and you need the headset, you have to rely on the two AA batteries.

Apparently, this phone is no longer able to function that long without disconnecting at some point during my call shift. Very frustrating.

Too much trouble for a Headset.","review":"I am being asked to review a phone that came in on time. (Yay!) The phone is everything the seller said it was. I would have liked for the sp-phone button (that you could use for a headset)that you could just press the button and you could be on.

I work from home and must have a corded phone with a headphone jack. This phone works perfectly. One of the things I like about it is that when the headset is plugged in it isn't necessary to lift the receiver to answer the call. Just press the button in the lower right hand corner and you're connected (PLEASE NOTE that you must have batteries in the phone for it to work this way. You don't have to have batteries. You can pick up the receiver, press the button in the lower right hand corner, and then replace the receiver in the cradle).

Maybe have a defective phone, but when I answer and the call is for someone else, and they pick up on another telephone in the house, this one will not hang up.

Usually I end up having to just unplug the phone and plugging it back in when they hang up. No other phones have this problem, just this Panasonic. I have had the phone a little over a year and it started doing this about 8 months ago. It works fine when it is just me in the house and I like the headset plu.

In the office I'm used to Polycom speaker phones and more expensive wireless headsets. I'm not spending that kind of money for the home office. This unit fits the bill. The speakerphone quality (both incoming and outgoing) is good. The headset jack works great - I paired it with the Panny KX-TCA60. Great match. I get no complaints about voice volume. I've had problems with other phones and headsets but this seems to finally be the right combination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"The phone did not work, made strange clicking noises.

Recommended, but only appears to be sold online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality bad, refurbished replacements.","review":"The phone had the feature I needed for my work - the headset jack with the ability to switch back to handset when needed. Unfortunately after about three months, the sound quality went waaaay downhill and even switching to handset didn't help - the echo and horrible static remained. Plus sometimes the phone would \\"pick up\\" the line without me pressing the button - I would come up to the phone after not being near it for hours and hear a long \\"beeeeeep\\" through the headset.I contacted Panasonic and got a replacement phone, which they said had to be a refurbished one. The second phone had the exact same problem.I sent it back and (half a month after they received it) still am waiting for the replacement (after my very firm insisting they agreed to send a different model, alas, also refurbished). I'll most probably sell this phone and get another one instead. I don't think I trust Panasonic anymore. Not with phones, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speaker Phone doesn't work well","review":"I got this phone to replace an AT&T phone that has a very poor speaker phone. Unfortunately this one is not much better. You have to yell when only three feet away from the phone for the other person to hear you. Also, the max volume on the specker phone is not all that loud. Why can't they make a speaker phone that works that doesn't cost a hundred dollars? The speaker phone on cell phone work better (much better) than this one. Maybe they have to plug into an electrical socket to get enough power. This one runs on three AA cells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for use with Plantronics wireless headsets!","review":"I bought this SPECIFICALLY to use with a Plantronics wireless headset. Bought the lifter, attached it to this phone, and set everything up.Never did use the handset on the phone so I can't speak to that, but it worked perfect with the plantronics wireless headset & lifter!I really liked the ringer on it too. It wasn't an annoying ringer, but a pleasant sounding one. I know that sounds quirky, but when you sit in an office all day & have to listen to a phone ring, it's nice that the ring doesn't annoy the you-know-what out of you.I did notice that the speakerphone didn't work unless you picked up the handset, which I thought was odd, but I didn't have a need for that.Great phone for what I used it for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great business phone","review":"I bought this phone because I needed a corded telephone for my home business. I also use a headset with this phone. No complaints with sound and I have not had anyone tell me that they can't hear me. I have not used the speaker phone so I don't have a review for that. The only con I find for this phone is that it does not have caller ID which is frustrating when I want to see who is calling. Other than that, this is a great telephone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Usefulness","review":"I bought this phone because of its usefulness in taking service calls on the phone with the headset. The price was good enough and it was basically all I needed it for. Well, the headset works well, but the phone is to utilize the speakerphone button when using the headset, it does it sporadically, and of course that won't work when taking calls over the phone. For the phone quality, it's okay for using it for personal calls, but don't expect it to work for business calls, you may be better off looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love these...","review":"They are all a nice \\"golden\\" color as in all of them are bronzed instead of like many where the 1E-4G are bronze and 5b+6e aren't...

I know that there are many kinds of acoustic guitars but when I trim off over eight inches of string... Thats just to much for me I guess. Not to mention how hard the extra length makes it to wind...Also the packaging, be carefull when you take these out, they are in little envolpes three in all (1e+4D 2b+5A 3g+6E) however you can't pull out one without the other.How is that bad? Well they didn't \\"wind\\" them if you will so you now have three feet of wire unraveling itself where ever you pull them out of.

Due to its Confederate-centric focus I recommend reading it in conjunction with Edwin Coddington's excellent THE GETTYSBURG CAMPAIGN: A STUDY IN COMMAND in order to follow activity within the Army of the Potomac. The authors have crafted a well thought out defense of R.E.Lee with fairly damning looks at his principal lieutenants: Stuart, Ewell, Hill, Pendleton and Longstreet and their various failures--Anderson, Rodes and Mahone also receive a fair pounding as well. Lee emerges as the hero of the piece as the authors put forth a well-defended definition of the battle itself as more of a \\"close run thing.\\" I highly recommend this thought-provoking work for any student of the Army of Northern Virginia or of Gettysburg.

It's long (over 400 pages) and tends to plod meandering between Jury, Plant, Wiggins, the inimitable Cripse family, but to me never really goes anywhere to adding to the story or, importantly, its resolution - more little vignettes of peoples lives rather than mystery tale. Naturally, there's Jury's ongoing personal dilemma of being constantly without female companionship and far too much time wasted on his self-analysis of quitting smoking, while other characters bog down the story with equal non-relevant issues.The crimes are resolved over the final ten or so pages, with the previous text not really factoring into the story at all.

Instead we visit some ruins, the magical fires on Mt Olympos, Kapadokya (seeing lots of sites I hit on my latest Turkish trip) and some smaller eastern towns. It's great stuff: Justine stays in a treehouse, participates in a village wedding, and stumbles with the language.I had a problem with the rug lesson that she got. It looks like the dealer said that the only important factor in a rug is the tightness and number of knots, when that's not true at all. (I won't get into it here, but the most important factors are the quality of the wool and dyes.)Besides that, this was a fun, inspiring trip. I now badly want to get back to Turkey and at least visit Mount Olympos. Got to see that magic fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This is an awful video.

The problem with these printers as I said before is that this product has a defect. My 540 HP printer still works after 11 years. In that printer, I have used paper that is 20 years old, stapled, and used before without any problem. If it jams, I can always pull it out without permanently damaging this printer. Unlike the 1300n, I have seen melted rollers and it is very difficult to repair without spending more money on it than I have too. But my workplace has only these printers and they are the biggest waste of money unless your employers want you not to use less paper and print less. So think about and a laser jet cartridge costs about $150.00 too.

I do recommend it for Mr. Sinatra's closing song with Kenny G (One for My Baby.) It is really worth the cost of the whole album.But ... Duets II is not a worthy successor. There are some nice tracks, such as \\"Moonlight in Vermont\\" with the always amazing Linda Ronstadt. But overall you are better served going back to listen to some of the Chairman's masterpieces, such as 1955's \\"Wee Small Hours of the Morning.\\"Duets 1 really is worth a listen. I dare anyone not to be moved by the closing song. It's all about age, experience and having been down the road of life.

I am so sorry that I listened. Sinatra sounds like what he was when he recorded this, a man nearly 80 years old.

Frank and N. Diamond joining on \\"The House I Live In\\" is almost a caracature.

In this case, I was especially interested in listening as many times as I want to Come Fly With Me, duet recorded with my favorite singer: Luis Miguel. It is a fresh, clean, both with voices of this great song. It leaves me with a happy feeling. I recommend this CD to those persons who enjoy variety, it contains other songs sung with other artists and all of the interpretations are worth the money paid for it. I hope Luis Miguel soon decides to record in English and allow other people to enjoy of his great voice and interpretative talent. Thanks. A.

I have to echo the sentiment of the reviewer who wrote: \\"umm, vomit\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Karaoke With Sinatra","review":"If you thought \\"Duets\\" was embarrassing, wait until you hear this equally fraudulent 1994 sequel. Perhaps the concept might have worked if Frank Sinatra shared studio time with his fellow artists - instead of relying on electronic deception. Perhaps it was too late for the aging Voice to rise to the occasion. Perhaps if Sinatra were in his prime, he might have selected more compatible singing partners than Neil Diamond, Willie Nelson and Jimmy Buffett. (On the other hand, an entire album with Frank and Chrissie Hynde could have been a real blast.) Not surprisingly, the tone-deaf Grammy committee gave \\"Duets II\\" a 1995 award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance - the same organization that honored Alvin and the Chipmunks more than Elvis Presley!

Apparently, people eaither love it or hate it, and I most definitely hate it. The problem is even though its a nice tune, it doesnt go anywhere, and seems very lazy and uninspired. You cant deny that. I agree that she has lost some of her earlier spunk, but this new single really crosses the line and shows her to be talentless.

The CD cover is ugly too, as you can see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Sadder Saddest","review":"It just keeps getting worse, doesn't it. With one of the weakest releases of the year behind her ('Faith and Courage'), Sinead O'Connor had the nerve to go on releasing subsequent singles from that inexplicably tame CD.While 'No mans woman' was bearable, and confirmed that Sinead was indeed a woman who loved women, the new song 'Jealous' is startlingly mediocre, starting with the lyrics, the rendering, the instrumentation, and ultimately, an extremely ugly CD single cover.A thorough disappointment, this coming from a long-time Sinead fan.

A lot of the jokes and situations are from the original series, but that's good because it works.What doesn't work is the lack of attention paid to this transfer to DVD. The poor picture quality really hurts the watchability of this DVD. Unfortunately the customer will have to tweak their TV's colors and brightness to approximate the original broadcast image.

It's very easy going and mellow, but not bland either. Their use of instruments that I haven't heard before makes this album interesting as well. I have both this album and the \\"Atlantida\\" album and if you can get a hold of either, you should--this album is actually 2 CD's, but the information on them on this site is a little sketchy. Their excellent musicianship is evident; these are not just your run-of-the mill latin music performers, but rather obscure elite artists that don't tour much outside of the Canary Islands, it would appear. In raw talent I would equate these fellows with the Buena Vista Social club performers, but in style I think they are much mellower. Hey, take a risk on these guys, I'm really sure you'll like them--they stand out far and above the plethora of available latin music today. buena suerte!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed!","review":"This product fell apart after less than six an a half months of use.

I found the geographical setting an interesting idea and was totally up for being enthralled. Hoeg does write beautifully about snow and ice-clad settings, but a good novelist he is not, in my opinion. I found the pace of the plot turgid and dull, dull, dull. I was not particularly interested in any of the characters and didn't much care what happened to any of them. Although some of his descriptive narrative is extremely beautiful and different, much of it went on for far too long, and as a result, I forgot what I was supposed to be reading about.

It's really helpful when the handset isn't in your hand, and you can't see the Caller ID. You can still know or at least have some idea of who's calling.

However, the PANASONIC BATTREIES are horrible. At first I could use my phone for about 45 minutes before the battery went dead.

In short - dont get this phone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Echo, but battery and distance okay...now the phone is dead","review":"This was an okay phone, kind of annoying, but okay. The echo was very annoying for me, but the wife says it is okay and she doesn't mind. Really the only reason we kept this phone was because of the talking caller ID for the kids. The 2.4 mhz interferes with my local wireless network which is also annoying.

This phone has an echo when even 2 feet from the base. It completely cuts out down the hall (15 feet away). People keep asking if I'm on a cell phone. I really wanted to love this phone, but the basics just aren't there. Also, the digital answering machine quality is pathetic on the normal level an barely passable in the enhanced mode. Finally, why why why would Panasonic get rid of the one button quick dial feature they had for years. It now takes 5 button presses just to dial common numbers.Note I also tried the Uniden DCT 5285 and that also has a pronounced echo which makes it sound like you're on a cell phone.

Extremely annoying during a conversation when you loose 5-8 seconds worth and have to keep asking the person to repeat themselves.The phone also had no button to allow for manual channel rescans.

They should have designated this telephonic turdbox the \\"E3\\" because that seems to be the only number it can remember.I would recoomend this unit as a gift to annoying relatives, ex-spouses, or anyone else so long as you have no desire to speak to them. At the moment, this thing has been replaced by a 1934 Automatic Electric model 40, which at least remains functional when there is a forecast of an electrical storm within 100 miles.

Wanted to charge me $80 + tax and $10 shipping for a replacement or $95 for a repair.3 or 4 years isn't really that bad a lifespan, but I suspect that I would have had this problem a lot sooner if I moved the phone earlier.

I recently read \\"The Chelsea Girl Murders\\" and I think the series has lost some of its fun. Perhaps because Robin has \\"grown up\\", gaining responsibilities.

This was a period that also gave us such talented singer-songwriters as Kathy Mattea and Mary Chapin Carpenter. Unfortunately, all of these ladies were soon swept aside by the country-pop of much less talented singers as Faith Hill and Shania Twain.Suzy has a sweet, pleasant singing voice. She doesn't scream to the rafters. Some people may find this style of music boring. But if you are looking for soothing pleasant melodies and someone who sings with a rich voice, this CD is for you. My favorite cuts are \\"Someday Soon\\", \\"Outbound Plane\\", \\"Letting Go\\" and \\"Aces\\". If you like Anne Murray, Kathy Mattea or Mary Chapin Carpenter, then you should enjoy this disc as well.

There are a few good lines but I literally shut this movie off with about 10 minutes left on it.

No way, pal, this movie is a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE OF THE DECADE","review":"Ok, I really put myself through some abuse watching this movie. Whoever directed this movie, Chris McQuarry or whatever his name is, needs help. He REALLY needs help! This movie is a piece of garbage. You got Bencio Del Toro he's sleepwalking through the movie. You got Ryan Phillipe he's jumping on shards of glass for money. Worst of all you got a plot nobody can understand. Am I getting through to you! The best thing to do, if anyone asks you to watch this movie- RUN, RUN VERY FAST. If you really like action, check out Mission: Impossible 2. The special effects are brilliant. Everyone should see that movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pure garbage","review":"My friends and I stumbled on this movie at the video store last night.

First, there is Ryan Phillippe whose role in \\"Gosford Park\\" was tailor made for a bad actor of his caliber. Second there is Juliette Lewis who does nothing but scream throughout the entire film (she is probably still screaming after seeing this film). Third this movie feels as though it will never end. It goes on and on and on. It's redundant. It goes on and on and on. It's redundant.Seriously, if gun violence for the sake of gun violence appeals to you, you need to seriously evaluate your repressed emotions and stay away from this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"...and the award for Best Bad Movie of the Year goes to...","review":"OK, MI:2 it ain't. If you like hi-tech, gee-whiz, state-of-the-art action sequences with lots of slo-mo and people just generally defying gravity you'll be completely unimpressed by this movie. Plus, the plot is weak (and rather predictable) and the acting is, at best, just OK. On the other hand, if you're the sort that gets upset by technical inaccuracies such as continually racking the slide on a shotgun, 1911A1s that seem to hold 29 rounds, rifle scope sight pictures that seem to be rock-solid, and bullets that seem to have target seeker heads (based on a complete lack of aiming by the shooter), YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. Most of the characters observe Col. Coopers \\"Four Rules,\\" they miss their targets often as not, their guns run out of ammo necessitating a reload or switch to another weapon, and they employ realistic tactics. This WILL become part of my collection once the price comes down to an affordable level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film Noir Type Movie...!","review":"Christopher McQuarrie's directorial debut in this film which he also wrote. Of Chris is the winner of a Best Screenplay Academy Award for his script of \\"the Usual Suspects\\".While not as mind boggling as Suspects, Way of the Gun is a gritty feature with plot twists, superb dialog, and as the title suggests, some great shoot-outs.This is probably the best performance Ryan Phillippe has ever given. And of course as in everything he does, Benicio Del Toro is great. Even James Caan gives a good role as a bagman out to get the pair.Basically Phillippe and Del Toro are two end of the line thugs with expert gun skills with nothing to lose. They kidnap the surrogate mother of a baby for a rich couple, who are tied to organised crime.This is one of the best films of 2000!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you want redemption or don't you?","review":"Parker and Longbaugh (Ryan Phillippe and Benecio del Toro) are two small-time hoods looking to score big by kidnapping a woman carrying a mobster's child. For some strange reason they act against their natures and common sense and decide to first let the girl go, then help her escape the clutches of the mobster who supposedly impregnated her. The Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid rip-offs (excuse me, *homages*) are apparent at points throughout, but especially obvious at the end.What a thematic mess. Don't have the main character give us the phony voice-over telling us he's not interested in redemption, after protecting a pregnant mother from ruthless mobsters for no other possible reason than to try to redeem himself from a life of killing and grifting. Don't try to have your protagonists be both the heroes and anti-heroes at the same time. Be one or the other.This is the only time Benecio del Toro hasn't been able to carry a movie. Some burdens are just too great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few nice twists, but that's it.","review":"\\"The Way of the Gun\\" has a couple of unexpected twists, but for the most part, it's too little, too long. If you want a modern western with style, buy Antonio Banderas' \\"Desperado\\". Come to think of it, if Robert Rodriguez was at the helm, \\"The Way of the Gun\\" might have been a much better movie. As it is, this movie is hamstringed with a soap opera plot, unrealistic shootouts, and Ryan Phillippe mumbling through his \\"tries-too-hard-to-be-cool\\" dialog. You can't make a good movie if that's what you have to work with. And this isn't a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Acting, horrible movie.","review":"This movie was silly. Some great performances and great actors were wasted. James Caan was great, but with the story so disjointed and boring scenes of shootings, I just didn't like this movie. The scenes with the baby being born and the chick all messed up being pregnant and her silly walk. Juliette Lewis was doing the best she could, she's just not that great. I was trying to like this movie, but other than some interesting acting I hated this movie. 2 stars because the actors tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Don't waste your money even renting this video.

Taye Diggs, Benicio, James Caan, Juliette Lewis... all some of my top actors. But even so, McQuarrie manages to mess this one up. I blame the direction moreso than the storyline. I think the storyline could have been fixed with better direction. As presented, the story was very hard to follow not only in terms of cohesiveness but also in being able to keep my interest. I only watched it to the end out of sheer curiosity. I can't recall in recent memory seeing a movie with such potential fall on its face. Oh wait, there's Kill Bill 2 which actually is better than this one. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Instead do what I did and watch \\"Eight Heads in a Duffel Bag\\" which also was better than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can more than 100 people give this a 4 or 5 star rating?","review":"I'm not one to write reviews but after deciding to buy this movie because of the positive ratings I'm just blown away.

The guy who wrote \\"THE USUAL SUSPECTS\\" seems to have tried to copy Tarantino in his heyday ( because Tarantino is gonne for sure, he is a clever guy who copies everything, than mix it together in blood lust movies ). The result, of course, was catastrophic. Julliette Lewis plays the \\"crazy, desorientated, criminal\\" woman for the elventh time in her career (see \\"NATURAL BORN KILLERS\\", \\"KALIFORNIA\\" ). RYan Phillippe is bad as ever. The great failure in the director's idea was try to copy something that never was good (Tarantino)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Movie","review":"This movie was boring. The dialogue was unimaginative and stale. The language used was technical cold and uninspired. The plot had holes and too many entanglements to care about. Every person involved had some angle so no one was ever developed fully. The movie ointroduces the two main characters as \\"petty thieves\\" or \\"small time crooks\\", yet when the action begins they move and act as if they are ex-navy seals. Oh yeah, and apparently they are telepathic though that angle is never explored. Juliet Lewis did nothing but sceam throughout. I honestly can't think of one thing I liked about this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"Highly entertaining and extremely well written. The writing alone makes the movie worth seeing. It has a great western feel as well that keeps things interesting throughout. My favorite line is one Juliette Lewis and Ryan Phillipe have with each other: Lewis-\\"I like bacon.\\" Phillipe-\\"Its from a gas station.\\" Lewis-\\"Its still good.\\" Some well choreographed gunfights, witty banter, great acting, and a terrific score elevate this flick from generic crime caper/b-movie to classic cult film status."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit slow, but a fun ride","review":"This one seemed rather funny to me, but I liked it a lot.

I doubt I've ever seen a more convoluted mess than this, in fact. At first it looks like the movie is trying to be a comedy - and it succeeds VERY nicely for the first 20 minutes or so! But just when you're enjoying yourself it switches gears out of the blue like it can't make up its mind, so now you have this grim crime story that is as interesting as dirty dishwater. When the violence comes, it is over-the-top like all such movies, but UNLIKE all such movies, it adds nothing into the mix. Hm, honestly, everything about this movie is bad once the first 20 minutes go by."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Rotten Apple","review":"The title, the art work, Benicio Del Toro, same maker as Usual Suspects...I went into this movie with the greatest of expectations and walked out wondering if I could somehow get a refund. Overly dramatic acting and a completely mis-matched score makes this movie humorous to watch. Juliette Lewis delivers the only real performance, but it's still not enough to save this movie. Christopher McQuarrie tried using John Woo's gun scenes accompanied by a Shawshank Redemption-style score in the background. It just doesn't work. The marketing of this picture looks interesting, but the content is sub-par at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"a cold gun","review":"interminable, doom-laden saga of freelance badmen, mafia badmen and corporate badmen whom no one would want to know or care about. that's not such a bad thing but in the quest for simulacrum tarantino the one crucial ingredient is humor, and this film has none. for that i blame chris mcquarrie, who penned both the usual suspects and this but unfortunately took on the directing chores himself on this one. mcquarrie's sense of humor makes ben stein seem like bill hicks. the usual suspects, at least, had a kind of gallows sensiblity that distracted you from the plot. here that humor doesn't exist and so you're forced to pay attention to the story, which is about as barren as the morals of the characters. now that's not such a bad thing either, but without all the in-jokes, hip cultural decorating and cool movie homages, the whole thing just collapses under the weight of it's own nastiness and banality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-Stop Entertainment","review":"A film destined to be a cult classic. Benicio Del Torro and Ryan Phillippe star in this action packed, violent, dark comedy. The two play people who were tired of the normal life and chose to go off the beaten path. Sooner or later this leads them to kidnap Juliette Lewis, who is carrying a very prominent business man's baby. Now, the two of them are getting deeper into Mexico with two hit-men, Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs, the Police, and a Bagman (James Caan) after them. This is a deeply ejoyable disturbing film that shows true grit in its' greatest form. The performances from every single actor are stunning. Especially Benicio Del Torro's. And with a director Christopher Mcquarrie, also writing the script, who won the Oscar for writing the Usual Suspects script. This movie couldn't be better. Watch this movie.

Leave this type of metal in the 80s where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I was told","review":"First off the production is great. I just fail too see (or hear)all the hype with this band. I think the drummer is awesome but the guitar players are mediocre and stuck in 1988. They have all the cliché' Zack Wylde squeals, Marty Friedman arpeggios and Scott Ian nothing new Anthrax style rhythm guitars. I just don't see why people are so impressed with these guys. The singer is your run of the mill average nothing-different voice shredder. Also I think Shadows fall is the absolute gayest name. Couldn't they think of something more original? It sounds like a bad horror film from the 70's. I will give this band one bit of praise, they are very tight and have a good groove, But original??? I don't think so. All their riffs are the same. Is this the direction Metal is going??? Ah..... I think it's already been there. Just a tuned a little higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"toe-tappin'","review":"wanted to weigh in on this album.

From the moment I heard Idle Hands, I knew I wasn't dealing with just another unoriginal, American hardcore band. Scream vocals, with the occasional death growl and some clean vocals highlight the moods at different points in the cd. The first 3 tracks are pretty hardcore, but manage to retain some melody. Afterwards, a beautiful instrumental track shows how good these guys can write their songs.On the title track, the beginning solo, followed by the mellow guitar playing and vocals, set the mood for a fantastic chorus and one probably the best solo on the cd. The guitarists really shine on my favourite trackThe whole cd is fantastic and the whole album deserves a mention, but I'll leave it at this. Fans of Killswitch Engage, Children of Bodom and In Flames will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Americans still know how to make metal!","review":"Century Media has the reputation of signing some of the best artists in metal, but also some of the worst. Fortunately, Shadows Fall is in the former category, and this album proves that metal has not left the United States just yet. With noticeable influences from In Flames and other 'Gothenborg sound' metal acts, it's a given that these guys will be good. The cover of \\"Welcome To The Machine\\" is the standout track, although the title track and \\"The Idiot Box\\" are good as well. Truthfully, most of the material on this album is great, and I'll be investing in more of Shadows Fall's products soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks!!!!!!","review":"The more I have listened to this album, the more I love it!! It gets back to the roots of metal. Yes it has a 80's metal flavor, but good 80's metal. You can hear flavors of Testament and Iron Maiden in their songs, and great guitar solo's!!!! I was like everyone else, getting used to all these new bands who are afraid to, or just can't play a good guitar solo. Just a great metal album"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't begin to explain how boring this is.","review":"Shadows Fall includes a pseudo-thrash element within their typical metal release. With little musical talent and poor vocals this album is one to stay away from. There is absolutely nothing of value to benifit from this release as it's watered down pseudo-mall metal. Even the semi-decent track, Destroyer of Senses was repetitive and compressed in the overall duration of this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we still in the old days???","review":"People, you know what??? I bought this album thinking that it is gonna kick major ass.. but I was wrong.. Every single songs sounds like the 80's trash metal.. I sold it to a 2nd hand cd store.. What a shame for this band... They better take a look at what other metal bands around the world are playing.. if not they will fall behind. This album is full of crap!! I really got bored!!

Ridicule me if you like, but I've been an active participant in countless female orgasms, and can therefore speak with utmost authority on the subject. Depite my jaded outlook, I recently encountered an orgasm which caused me to stand up and take alarm. It involved a douche composed of pea soup - and forgive me for being frank - but it really produced a remarkable effect. I am despondant that the filmmakers decided to abstain from a more experimental approach such as occured in the genesis of this aforementioned orgasm. I hope that any upcoming additions to this series will choose to explore the medium of female masturbation, rather than defer to such a conservative approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad","review":"I think this movie is too bad, why?because...when you hire a woman body to act porn movie it's animality.when you share all of your feeligs casually, it's animality.so be human.be for one.be valuable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an absolute waste of money","review":"I can't believe I spent $30 on this DVD. It shows 30 minutes of the same stroke over and over. There is no instructional value at all. I had to rewind many times because I couldn't even tell that she actually had an orgasm. Even though I rewound the tape a few times, I'm still not even sure she had one. This video could have been condensed into 1 minute and it would have had the same content. You're better off buying something else.

No real insight or helpful instruction. If you need a video to let you know where the clitoris is located, you would be better off just looking it up in a medical text. For the voyeurs who want to watch the women touch herself, this is your video. If you are looking for some real instruction on increasing your sexual acumen and technique, you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is basically a long DVD of a woman giving herself an orgasm, so if watching is your thing, then you are likely to enjoy this DVD. However, if you are looking for some education and insight beyond clitoris 101, you won't get it. Some real insights and comments from a woman about her orgasm, how significant and what technique, some demonstration would be really good. Its true that if you watch this repeatedly, and if your TV has good enough resolution, you may pick up the subtle clues a woman gives about the state of her orgasm. But a partner, or indeed a woman on her own, would have difficulty improving their technique. Very disappointing as an educational aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hohum","review":"Ummmm, incredible how BORING an orgasm can be! If she ever actually came at all, which I find debatable. She seemed to just prolong the pre-orgasmic state for half an hour and then smile and wipe herself off. And....THAT'S IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT by this.","review":"This DVD is the worst DVD I have ever seen. Nothing that you can learn at all. It is just a woman masturbating. No techniques.

The lighting is flat and there is zero sensuality. For 25 bucks I feel like I got ripped off. On the other hand, some people may feel otherwise (see sales chart). Come on...let's get real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very enlightening","review":"I expected more given the 5 star reviews. There is no instruction, just a quick over view of the parts of the vaginathen 30 minutes of watching an attractive woman rubbing her clit very lightly.

About 20 minutes of index finger on clitoris with a quiver (don't blink or you will miss it) orgasm. I'm no prude.

She gets in the bed, and hikes up the nightee, and you never see them.What you do see, is not pretty. Now, I love women's bodies, but this one...

Team mates also recount the ambiguity of whether Elway was coming back and explain what was REALLY going on - It lends a lot of insight.

It makes me wonder if this one little bit of seemingly honest 3d code ever actually even worked. The matrix equations on pages 142 and 143 are totally screwed up like a proofreader never even LOOKED at the thing.

They were ahead of their peers in supporting reform causes such as Abolitionism, Women's Rights and opposing racial prejudice. The last one was especially significant since many white abolitionists were prejudiced toward blacks even though they opposed slavery.What is especially remarkable about the Grimke Sisters is that they were among the very few white abolitionists who grew up in the Deep South. They were from South Carolina and their cousin was Robert Rhett the famous fire eater.The book examines how their religious beliefs shaped their political views and their involvement in factional struggles in the Quaker Church and the Abolition movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable","review":"This is a pretty good bra.

The tip does not fit in properly to be exposed and thus I cannot write with this refill. When comparing it to what I am replacing: they are the same length, the same general shape, etc. But this refill has an additional plastic piece towards the tip that prevents it from being properly loaded into the pen. The plastic is not shown in the Amazon photo. Does that piece come off, if I try, will it leak all over me? Instructions may help. I'll try to call Cross and find out. Until then, I do not recommend anyone buys this refill.

For some reason it made my headset sound very hollow. As the previous reviewer noted, there is no mute button -- I guess I should have realized that sooner. The other annoying \\"feature\\" was if I had the headset plugged in, the calls were always routed to the headset; even when I picked up the handset! I could not figure out how to change this behavior.I returned the phone and started my search again. I found a company that makes great Home Office phones... Aastra.

I judge it to be a bit challenging to advanced undergraduate students in mathematics and engineering.

She is a prolific and exceptional songstress. Her vocal instrument, once her ace in the hole, has lost some of its range and power, at times she sounds as if she is growling. This cd contains nothing but covers. Melanie has done some exceptional covers in the past, \\"Wild Horses\\", \\"My Rainbow Race\\" & \\" Chords of Fame\\" come to mind. But, she covered those songs when she was in full command of her voice. \\" Ain't No Sunshine\\" is gorgeous and her voice is the powerful instrument it once was. But, most of these songs are buried under pretentious arrangements and sung in an almost monotone manner. She needs to invest in vocal training.

I read this whole series and it so phenomenal! At first, I read this book becuase Frank Franzetta is one of my favorite artist! I saw the cover and I had to have this book. So when I found out James Silke was the writer, I was a bit skeptical because I never heard of this guy. But much to my surprise, I was exilerated by the captiving story! I'm surprised that James Silke does not have any other books out there besides this series! I've always feel that this character should be recogonized & exploited but I don't think it will ever happen! If anyone ever get a copy of a book of the this series, please never let it go!

I've heard him live and his songwriting just keeps getting better. My favorites: \\"Can You Imagine?\\", \\"Why You're So Beautiful,\\" and a song surely to be on the next CD, \\"When You Were Wild.\\" Matt has a penchant for story songs about real people that truly engage.

I don't think I'm THAT bad at playing video games, but with this one I am! The graffics and colors are cute, and so is the concept but for me it's just too hard. What you do is you have the three girls floating around and you lead them and shoot bad guys and when you shoot someone you get a little circle that you have to pick up. I think you have to get a certain number of those circles. But when your girl gets hit, her \\"will to fight\\" goes down and eventually-if you get hit enough-that girl disappears and you have to play with a different girl. You can switch back and forth with the girls though, which is fun.

However, this CD just doesn't compare to his better work. Except for a few songs, he gets away from his rodeo/Western songs. Clearly someone made him sing sappy songs like \\"Love Needs a Fool\\" and \\"Light of the World,\\" two of the worst songs he's ever recorded.

You don't even see the gun when you shoot. It's fun for about five minutes. It really stinks when youre expecting something more from the game. I give this game two stars because of the graphics. They are pretty good considering that the game SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. As a fellow video gamer I advise you not to buy ths game. It was a waste of my fifty dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like shooters, but this was dissapointing","review":"First of all, I'm not a first-person shooter freak. However, I started playing this game for the first time at two o'clock one saturday. I fully completed the game at four thirty later that afternoon. I thought the graphics were great, the bosses a bit too easy to beat, and the missions not too complicated. I guess that's why it only took me 2 1/2 hours to beat. I think a two-player mode would add to the fun. Their version of a two-player game is getting two TV's and hooking up 2 PS2's via i-Link. I haven't played the first Silent Scope so I can't compare the two, but I don't like how you only control the sniper gun. I thought you would be able to move around, but the game does that for you. Overall, I would stay away from this game if you really want to shoot things. Instead, try Metal Gear Solid 2 or Half-Life were you have control of every move. Or at least RENT IT FIRST."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKY GAME","review":"this game is a terrible game of a sniper and killing people thats not the problem with it though. u might like it because of the arcade game where u can use a plastic sniper rifel to aliminate the terrorists. however u cant use a gun or special controller for this game.and to my appinion it sucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM SILENT SCOPE 2!!!","review":"ECK, for the love of god stay away from this terrible game! i got this because it looked so cool in a magazine, and its always cool to pretend your an assassin (whips out a gun and shoots silent scope 2) selling or destroying this game may be the only satisfaction you get out of it. it might have been fun if there was a gun compatible with it, but there is not. instead you must struggle with the analog stick. if you like shooting things i would reccomend Time Crisis 2, get the one with the gun and its a blast."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME ...

The canvas truly holds even the skinniest straps snugly and you'll never be picking up a piece of dust off your closet floor only to find it's that expensive top you were missing. I hang my sweaters rather than folding them, and these hangers are perfect for them, also.I'm buying them gradually. In addition to their holding power, they space clothes nicely in your closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"No wire hangers in my closet!","review":"I deplore wire and plastic hangers. I use canvas hangers only because my clothers don't slip off them, the clothes drape nicely and they don't allow for crushing items together.If I'm going to spend $ on clothes I'm also going to take care of them so they will continue to look good and last longer....these hangers do the job while keeping my closet looking good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smartster","review":"I bought these hangers specifically for sweaters so that they will stay on the hanger without sliding off. These hangers basically go straight across, which leaves unattractive knobs at the end of shoulder area. Unfortunately, since I've already opened the package to test this, I can't return them. I thought I might be able to bend them into a more sloped angle, but I think they're wood underneath, so was afraid they'd just snap.

Which will die within the first year of usage. I used the VEC157BD only when we are traveling with the RV so thats only 3 to 4 times a year. The battery is already dead and finding a replacement is impossible. And btw replacing the battery is not easy at all and will take some technical experience which is not for everyone.The type of battery is of course totally wrong as that should have been a lithium battery.If you already own one that do not deplete the battery all the way stay above 45% depletion. It might last you more that a year.Anyway total waist of money and a perfect flashlight going to the landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Does not work like it should.

We have purchased serveral other Henty books and enjoyed them all. For the Temple is a family favoite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! Historical fiction at it's best!","review":"G.A. Henty, the 19th century master of historical fiction, demonstrates his tremendous ability to weave a great story into the details of history. His accounts of the fall of Jottapotta, Gamala, and Jerusalem are faithful to all first hand accounts of Rome's war in Israel. In places whole passages can be linked with Josephus' account of battles and seiges. This is a must read for any historical fiction fan, and a dynamic story for those who just want good reading. I strongly recommend this book. (1LT Gary Thompson)"},{"rating":"2","title":"slow and steady, but worth it","review":"This book does a wonderful job of explaining many different factors contributing to the fall of Jerusalem. Eventually, the characters do come alive. It gets redundant at times, which is not helped by the over-use of dramatic emphasis throughout the reading--the listener has to group and weigh information in spite of the reader's inflection rather than being helped by it. Overall, worth the time, but I would rather have read it out loud myself than fight the recording. Recording does not indicate listening time or publication date of the original work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get a refund?","review":"Not very good. Wish I could get my money back.

Wouldn't pay money for it. I rated it four stars because it was exactly as promised with no problems- but price value is the issue.The sound converter and label maker came with Plus! for Windows XP, so those are just repeats. The dancer is pretty cool, but not useful. (Same thing with party mode, pretty much). The alarm clock serves no real purpose unless if your computer is next to your bed, or if you want to have to get up to turn it off. It can be set to play music on a timer if you like to listen as you fall asleep which is pretty cool.The sync and go for pocket pc is nice if you have a pocket pc, but you can always drag and drop files.Overall, nice features and little add ons.

I find the dancers are fairly amusing for a while and the analog recorder makes a really easy way to record old tapes, but that's about it. Also, the recorder ONLY records in proprietary Micro$oft .wma format instead of offering a useful-for-editing format like .wav. Because of this, the only time I ever use it is when I am feeling lazy and I have it set my recording level for me.I would only recommend this product if:1. Like me, you can get it \\"Free after rebates\\" (don't forget about taxes and shipping). Don't even think about paying more than $5 (after taxes, etc) for it.2. You already know you like a certain feature (like the dancers)--don't get this hoping for something great because you will probably be disappointed3. You have a lot of extra space on your hard drive and4.

I used this for my grandfathers birthday party and he loved it. I used old photos and some of his favorite songs and it was very moving.

In its Digital Media Edition, it includes such useless stuff as the Dancers, where people dance at the bottom of the screen, and an alarm clock. Like anyone is going to leave their PC on overnight to wake them up in the morning. Why doesn't Microsoft include items that the average home user can use, such as DVD software to watch DVDs, or an anti virus (like they included in Plus! 98). Another thing to note about this program is that you have to activate it, like you have to do Windows XP which is very, very annoying. If you're looking to save money, leave this worthless thing sitting on the store shelf. If you're looking to waste money, well by all means buy this.

That's not what this program does. If you double-click on a song, it stops the one currently playing and begins the song you clicked on.This program:-Doesn't display cover art,-Has a complicated interface,-Doesn't give complete song info,-Let users exit by simply clicking the \\"x\\",If you're looking for a jukebox program, this isn't it.

Until now, I've been happy with version 8, and I am reluctant to update to version 9 since it won't allow you to return to version 8 if problems occur.I wanted to try the analog to digital features of Plus, but I'm afraid this will stay in the box until and unless I decide to risk the upgrade to version 9 of Windows Media Player.

Better to listen to while driving.Songs by X and the Ramones are crappy, and I'm a fan of both groups so I fault the compiler of this CD (never liked the Red Hot Chili Peppers much so I knew before buying I'd hit \\"FF\\" here).I tend to dislike most collections (why not buy the original records?) so why buy this one? Well, I own LPs containing many of these songs and while some had other good songs, most had lots of filler and/or are expensive to buy today on CD.

Matt still has a great voice, and the band still has flashes of tight intensity, but everythign in between was so........common (for lack of better words).I am NEVER one to fault a band for changing sounds on albums, or trying new things, but this direction really does not work for Spoken. For heaven's sake boys...Cyndi Lauper covers??????It is like Rage Against the Machine decided to make an album and sound like Hawthorne Heights.I still love Spoken, and am in fact anxiously awaiting to see them live in a few days. But......I really do hope their subsequent releases are stronger, or they should really consider parting ways with Tooth & Nail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band, great message","review":"I had the opportunity to meet Detour 180 back in 2006 or 2007 when they were touring out in Indiana.

Another reason would be that is was a very interesting story about friendship. For example, Sam confronts Linc Solcum and tells him to stay away from her horse and that proving him self a cowboy isn't worth trying to hurt her horse. \\"Stay away From Him, catching him wont prove you're a cowboy\\". Another example is that Sam is so committed to protecting her horse she tells her grandmother that she will do anything t save him from Linc. \\"Gram, I know that the Phantom Is Blackie. I will do anything to keep Linc away From My Foal\\". In conclusion if you like horse stories then this would be a good book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I used the book last weekend to check out the caves on Vancouver Island.

The narrator drops some real gems, too, like this one: \\"Unsorted images crowded Anna's mind ... herself at her best, alone, looking, smelling, hearing, all her thoughts concentrated on the quality of light or air.\\" Now, what could this possibly mean? To me, it means \\"no more books by Jane Smiley.\\"On the upside, the story offers good, solid three-dimensional characters. Unfortunately, they're not exactly likable, and their views on marriage and family are so dated as to be at times offensive, at times unintentionally funny. But not funny enough to justify picking up this foul fossil of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customers relations problem","review":"I already own this EXACT pet crate and love it!

The song arrangments are incredible, and the words are very deep {some of the best lyrics ive ever heard}. Theres no doubt in my mind that this cd will be a classic in years to come. Its sad that the band only got to do a handfull of shows when this was released. I would highly recommend the dvd \\"letters from a porcupine\\", as this shows alot of great live footage from this period. This is the essential Melon cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece...Gets better with time","review":"I bought the album the day it came out in 1995 and listened to it once in 5 years. I revisited it again in 2000 and it became my favorite album of the 1990s. A true example of an artistic Masterpiece.This album just shatters what pop music is supposed to sound like and merely sounds like \\"Soup\\" by Blind Melon. Shannon Hoon's lyrics are the most challenging and heartfelt I have ever heard and the band brings those thoughts to life wonderfully. An amazing feat. This album is a MUST for any music fan. No need to review individual songs because each is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wishing for more meals","review":"As assured a sophomore as anything we have seen in the same era, Soup is still an understated masterwork of blue-collar alternative from a long-missed group."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice CD with a hidden track to boot","review":"To be frank, I bought this CD for its hidden track in the pregap of track 1. I didn't really care about the music at first, but now that I've listened to it I must say the music is in fact pretty good! I can't really name anything comparable, but if you like rock music in general you should give this CD a try. In my case, it was totally worth it. In fact, I even bought their \\"Best Of\\" CD because I wanted more. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This has been my favorite album for the last ten years. I didn't get the album on the first listen and thought it was \\"just alright.\\" I bought it for \\"Galaxie\\" which was a fun little number. On first listen, I heard the whimsical \\"Skinned.\\" I played that song over and over. Then realized I was staying through \\"Toes Across the Floor\\" and \\"Walk\\" every time I slipped in the disc. These were my favorites.Then new favorites emerged: \\"Car Seat\\" , \\"New Life\\" and \\"Mouthful of Cavities.\\" The vocals of Hoon and Jena Kraus in \\"Mouthful of Cavities\\" are amazing. If you've never heard the song, you're missing out.I've recommended this album to all of my friends and will continue to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 Bind Melon fan!","review":"Dearest new listeners, Ok, so you thought that the first album \\"rocked\\", the second album \\"rocked more\\", and this album topped it off. A good ending to an unfortunate loss. All songs are unreleased. Songs that we have never heard because \\"Blind Melon's manager\\" didn't want to put it on the first two albums. Any Melon Head would enjoy this album because of that. I have been a Melon Head for years and would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to \\"Nico\\". You'll love it!

If you're searching the universe, or even this solar system for that matter, for relaxing jazz guitar music... well, this isn't it. Some fine musicians, no doubt and some good cuts, but the guy who named this cd must have lost track of the vallium he had just injested. What was this guy thinking? Want to relax?

This is an awsome dvd set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from complete...","review":"This set does NOT contain the pilot movie FLASH GORDON - THE GREATEST ADVENTURE OF ALL that in fact kick-starts the story. By buying this set you enter the adventure AFTER the main arc and exposition that happens in the Pilot. This is absolutely incomprehensible. The Pilot isn't even available in DVD in ANY form. Why didn't Filmation licence the pilot along with the series?.In the extras there are PLENTY references to the Pilot film but NOWHERE in this edition the publishers bother to explain the absence of the Pilot in the set.Picture quality is fuzzy and a bit pixilized due to compression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could be better","review":"I remember watching the first season on TV and watched a few episodes from the second season which feature a 'cute' dragon (UGGH!!).The documentary included is average at best. You can learn more from listening to the audio commentary on the first episode.Too bad they couldn't have included the Flash Gordon animated movie because then I would have given the set a real feel of completeness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blasting off!","review":"In a nutshell, this is probably the classiest thing that ever came out of Filmation. Beautiful designs, all very true to the original Alex Raymond comic strip, and I remember being completely captivated by the serialized first season when I was a kid watching this on Saturday mornings on NBC. All it needs is the Queen song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a classic","review":"These DVDs are great! Every episode is fun to watch. Although by today's standards its not the best out there, the stories and action still hold up well. If anyone ever enjoyed watching this series when they were young, this is a must have.For sci-fi fans who never got to watch the show, I highly recommend enjoying it now that its available. Many times we forget how good an older show was/is until we go back and watch it again.It may have a slight \\"Saturday Morning Catoon\\" feel to it, but that's what it is. That's what Flash Gordon was/is based upon to begin with. An old episodic serial at the movies.One of the most enjoyable things about the series is that you don't need to wait until next week for the cliffhangers to be resolved.Its just a great show, well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cartoons to ever air on T,V,","review":"Ever Saturday at 11:00am the world came to a stop(at least in my house) and I was propeled into an adventure beyond the stars on the planet Mongo as Flash and company battled the evil Ming in the hopes of saving Earth.With a look of a big screen movie, this show set a bar for animation that T. V. still has yet to equal. The scripts were very good and hold up very well today. My boys have watched this with me and love it. I only hope that they release more of the old Saturday morning cartoons on DVD, they would make a nice counter point to the sad state of children's show that they try to pass off to us as good for the kids. This is one the whole family can watch and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Rendition Of Flash Gordon!","review":"I'll keep this review short and succinct. This DVD pack is stellar. The animation is leaps and bounds ahead of other animated shows of the time period. The music and storyboards and direction put the show in elite status. The first season storylines were so detailed and rich that grown ups could watch and enjoy the show. It was also faithful to the original comic strip.My only pet peeve was the format change giring the second season of the show. They dumbed it down by adding a pink dragon with wings. It is too bad that this show is out of print. I bought it for $31.00 during the days whrn I worked at B&N.; The DVDs in the packett will mesmerize you. Even though the second season is weak, overall, the set is still a Four and a Half Star rate. The defenders of Earth pilot is nothing to write home about. Too many characters with too few voices to match them.Buy this and you will not be disappointed.A.

It comes assembled and is easy to operate. There is a storage drawer for the markers and discs. She can't seem to fit everything in there easily. The top turns to focus the picture but it doesn't work very well. The lines are thick and make tracing the picture difficult even at it's clearest. (A bit of advice -- don't try to focus the picture after you've started drawing. The picture shifts and makes it difficult to realign.) Our daughter is happy because she has the toy, but she's saddened at the outcome. I do not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"I also thought the projection was blurry. Too blurry to even draw anything. After just a few months the light went out so I changed it. It comes with an extra one. It worked for a little longer and doesn't work at all now.

It was a nice big box to have under our tree and it was the first thing she opened and begged to play with. My husband set it up and we immediately discovered a major problem. The on/off switch is a button on top of the lamp. Supposedly, you push the button in to turn it on, and push it again to turn it off. When we push ours in, the light comes on, but it pops right back up and turns it off. We solved the problem temporarily with several pieces of duct tape, but when the lamp got hot after a few minutes, the tape loosened and the lamp turned off.

You know immediately that there is something wrong with the simple village lottery, and the suspense and horror builds with every word. That this can be achieved in the space of a short story is amazing - we have a very lttle time before we are faced with the shocking truth.\\"The Lottery\\" is the finest short story of its genre, and stands alone as one of the greatest stories ever written.

(And, incidentily always has been, since elementary school.) She is the author that everyone has some sort of familiarity with, unbeknownst to them.

No matter where you grew up, what your background, you will always find a common thread to link you to her world.

Neil's love for Bono shines on every page of this engrossing book, when he had every human reason to be eaten up with hateful jealousy. It speaks well of Neil that he is able to separate Bono's rock stardom as having nothing to do with his own failure as a rock star. It's a wonderful book and I wish more of Bono's friends would write such an honest account of their relationships.(Are you listening, Gavin?) I listened to Neil's songs and I'd say there is one area in which he is blinded. He simply doesn't have anywhere near Bono's talent, and charisma, but then, no one else does either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book - very funny!","review":"I absolutely loved this book!

It was, I thought, horribly produced.When I saw that it was recently released with extra tracks, I figured, what the heck, go for it. And while it still doesn't astound like Boulders or Shazam (The Move), it's a whale of a sonic improvement over the old LP, and the songs really shine with improved mastering. Lots of Phil Spector and Beach Boys influence. Very strong album, with the unfortunate exception of \\"Mustard,\\" which has been flattened to sound like a '40s recording and \\"Get on Down Home,\\" which goes on way too long, and has a lumbering drum solo. My suggestion: program that song out and you'll still have a great 45 minute listening experience. Would rate 5 stars if not for \\"Get on Down Home\\" and less than excellent sound quality.

This album is just completely uninspired, the songs are bland, they all sound pretty much the same and the production is just wrong(especially the drums). I'm afraid I just can't get into it at all. It's not that I think it's a sell out or anything like that, I just don't think it's very good.

Also, the lyrics on this album are more focused on one issue rather than sarcastic jokes (you know what I mean). For example, the \\"Killing Road\\" talks about the life of a touring band, \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" speaks about suicide, and the title track contemplates government corruption. On this album, compared to other Megadeth releases, they are more focused and mature without losing any of their edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"poop","review":"Megadeth was at one time one of the best metal bands on Earth.

Heck, I wanted to be Dave Mustaine when I was growing up, but even my adoration can't save this album. Here's how it goes....First four tracks are solid.The remaining tracks are uninspired and boring. Is that Nick Menza or a drum machine stuck on the same beat? The acid-tongue of Mustaine is gone here. The power and fury that dwindled on Countdown to Extinction has been snuffed out.The only reason I still own this disc is because of the first four tracks. It would make a great EP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chink in Dave's armor","review":"As a long-time, die-hard Megadeth fan, I was deeply disappointed the day I purchased Youthanasia. No doubt the album starts out with a killer track, but it goes downhill from there. I do not like to be critical of bands I honor, but the lyrics to Train Of Consequences are a little cheesy. It was unfortunate that Dave had such thought of suicide, but he did not need to sing them to us in French in A Tout Le Monde. The story behind Family Tree is very distant from the early Megadeth that loyal fans adore. The whole album is an embarassment to true Megadeth fans. I am insulted by the disregard Dave shows for the older stuff in the song Victory. The other Megadeth albums range from good to excellent, but Youthanasia does not belong on the same shelf as the other Megadeth albums. This album is the chink in Dave's armor."},{"rating":"1","title":"water","review":"Rust in Peace was a brilliant album. Countdown to Extinction was a great album. This one is just water. No balls.

There are three good songs \\"reckoning day\\" \\"train of consequences\\" and \\"a toute le monde\\". The rest of this album is countdown to extincton watered down even more.

Let's face it, Youthanasia is one of the best Megadeth albums ever. Musically and lyrically speaking. The mood is heavier, though the pace is slower than Countdown or Rust. The guitars have been tune down half a step, so it contributes to that.Musically, it is a killer! Mustaine's both vocals and riffing are amazing, very well produced and Marty does well with some amazing soloing.Sure, it isn't as \\"Megadethish\\" as Peace Sells or Rust, but it sure as hell is a definite highlight in this outstanding band's carrer.\\"Addicted to Chaos\\" is my favorite, but you can name every one of the songs in the album as quite good. Intricate, melodic, defying, dark and metalic. That sums up this masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood, Under-appreciated","review":"This album is as underrated, as it is misunderstood. Every album that Megadeth has ever done has been different from the other. They always keep it heavy, but are wholly willing to try anything new, so long as it is quality.I appreciate far more the thrash/speed metal Megadeth we all love, then, say, the \\"Risk\\" or \\"World Needs a Hero\\" MD, that takes getting used to or just isn't any good. Having said that, this album is high quality, as far as written material goes. True, don't expect \\"Rust\\" or \\"CTE\\" level decibles, but there is material to treasure here, I don't see how that can be in question.Most songs on here, while more metal than thrash, are extremely well written. I personally love the majority of the songs on this album.Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show me a better \\"metal\\" cd in 1994","review":"I get tired of old Megadeth fans unhappy that this band hasn't stayed the same.

This is Megadeth at their best, and one of my favorite albums ever. Dave is really multitalented. He can play the guitar like nobody's business, apparently he speaks French, and I think he knows karate too. He may not be the best singer on the planet, but he's Frank Sinatra compared to most of the nu-metal vocalists out there. How can you not love songs like \\"Reckoning Day\\", \\"Addicted to Chaos\\", \\"A Tout Le Monde\\", \\"Victory\\"...well, the whole thing, really! This album is nearly perfect. Just listen to that solo in \\"Victory\\". He must have broke the sound barrier when they recorded that! I got this album way back in '94, and it still hasn't left my player.

I just love it.","review":"Well, if some people can say that this marvellous album was a sell out by Megadeth, a new word will have to be invented to define what Metallica did, ha, ha!While RUST IN PEACE was a furious display of master technique to introduce the sheer power adn ability of the new line up, YOUTHANASIA concentrated on giving more focus, melody and great lyrics to the songs.The album flows effortless from one song to another. All of them a good, there's not a single one throwaaway or explicit filler. It's one of the best Megadeh albums, no doubt about that.The real bad turning point would come with RISK, not with YOUTHANASIA !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great stuff...wink, wink.","review":"God awful.

Sure, it's a little bit slower than Killing is my business, but you can still feel the MegadetH quality in it. The title song is the best, and I have a part of it stapled up on my door.

Rip-off is the verdict. If you want a great game, in the tradition of Elite and Privateer, turn to EgoSoft out of Germany. X-Beyond the Frontier, X-Tension, and the newly released X2-The Threat, all blow Microsoft's lame game to shame. Freelancer should be relegated to not the bargain-bin, (as it is now), but to the trash bin. And if you did play Freelancer, and actually liked it, then you will LOVE X2!

Make money trading, owning factories, blowing up Pirates or other bad guys, and capture ships. Own a fleet of transports, fighters, corvettes, destroyers, battleships and carriers! Compared to X2 by Egosoft, Freelancer is a poor Craker Jacks prize. And Egosoft has been growing this franchise for a long, long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good form, bad flight","review":"Overall I liked the game. It is the same great type of space flight simulator that we have come to love from this production team. However this game has some detractors that made me put it down and walk away. The primary and most serious of these problems is the flight control. The game is controlled exclusively by mouse. There is not even an option for joystick flight. I think their intenet was to make the HUD interface better. I had a horrible time with flying and shooting and the targeting system was off as well. The voice acting (at least in the demo) was pretty deadpan and uninspiring. The graphics were ok but not any better than Privateer 2. The only good aspect was that the ganme seemed more open-ended thatn P2 and the universe was larger. I recommend getting Privateer instead, at least until they (I wish) come out with another Privateer game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Cockpit Jock oldtimers","review":"Visually, this game is extremely good. The freedom of the plot line will remind you of Privateer. However, once you get into the cockpit, it is not this same. There is no joystick support at all.If you enjoy first person shooter games, you will probably adapt to the mouse only interface pretty quickly and enjoy the game. However, if you are looking for more of a flight combat sim, you came to the wrong game.I don't want to be unfair. Everything else about this game is top notch. I just could not get over flying without the joystick and using my programmable buttons. Firing and manuvering was just too cumbersome and I was forced to return the game.If they ever added joystick support, I would definitely buy it again. In the mean time, I'll stick to my existing sims."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"Let's just say, stay away from this game if you have a GeforceFx video card.

I visited the MS forum the other day and found that several other people were having the same troubles when playing this game with a GeforceFX. So just a warning to you all, DO NOT purchase this game if you own a GeforceFX...wait 'til MS releases a patch later in the future...if ever...This is yet another 'unfinished product' from Microsoft."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most repetitive RPG ever made","review":"First, I will state right up front that it is pretty and the space combat engine is pretty nice to fly. Having said that, I will have to point out that all the combats play out basically the same. Every mission you get from the NPCs is essentially the same. All your canned face-to-face interactions with the NPC are pretty much the same. In about two hours of playing this, you will already be extremely tired of the repetitious conversations. The combat will hold its fascination a bit longer, but in the end, that too will start to seem really repititious. In essence... As a space sim, it lacks complexity and detail. As an RPG, it lacks depth and variety. This game was truly disappointing to me after reading all these glowing reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfull.....but short","review":"This game is wonderfull! The gameplay and the missions are fun...but there are only 13 MISSIONS!! :( I completed the missions in about 2 days and didn't even have the best ship (not by a long shot). The only thing that is keeping this game from a 5 star game is the fact that the game is WAY too short. They should have added more missions. When I got to the end I could not believe that that was it! Sure, I can still fly around and sell and kill stuff, but what's the point if there are no more missions?!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Freelancer a little HOLLOW","review":"I downloaded and played the Demo..

Initially, it is very impressive and you feel like the Red Baron. But after a while it becomes a bit dull. They Keyboard flight and battles are not very difficult, but the endless rounds of air fights get tedious.Now, if you are a big flight simulator fan, then you might really enjoy this game. But if you want something different - some puzzles, some other form of fighting, something else, this game will leave you feeling empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immersing solo player experience","review":"Have never played Freelancer multi-player.

Luckily I downloaded the demo first. This a poor excuse for a flight simulator.You start off on a planet and you are told to go to the bar. I think, \\"ok lets walk around and find one\\". Lol, no walking allowed in this game, you just click the bar icon to go there. Want to talk to people in the bar, well click them and watch the cut scene.(Get use to them the game is filled with cut scenes versus exploring yourself)Once you get into space, then you have control. Well control over average quality graphics as you spins in circles with the shoot button held down :::yawn:::I'm sorry, but I'm deleting this demo and not buying the game after all. Its just a cheap game ment to get your money and take advantage of the no return policy on games :-P."},{"rating":"1","title":"Identity crisis","review":"Freelancer can't seem to figure out what kind of game it is.The marketing says it is a game directed by the way you play. In practice, it has a very linear plot that you are railroaded into following.If you want to play as a trader or miner, the marketing says it will support you. In practice, combat is thrust upon you so freqeuntly that you have little choice but to get a ship built for war.The marketing says it has role-playing elements. In reality, it is an action game with cut-scenes showing the plot.It is too simple to be a great space combat sim, but the combat is too hard for it to be an RPG. The choices are few and usually binary. I wanted Morrowind in space. I got frustration and disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Ending Game","review":"Once you finish the campain, this game lets you do just about any thing you want to.

I like how Freelancer takes off were Starlancer ends (The Alliance is fighting a losing war against the Coalition *no more spoilers*). I'm not crazy about using the mouse for flight and the interface takes a little getting use to. This game would be real nice if the joystick and/or keyboard were open options for flight control.Pros, awesome flight graphics but I think a little extra work could have been done on the character models though even though they do look decent with good shadowing (characters in Starlancer looked better even w/o shadowing).I havn't finished the game yet but the story is good so far.

They love it and can't get enough of it. The one thing I would recommend is doing the virtual reality tutorial first and listening to the demos to help you make the avatar move. Otherwise it can be frustrating to both you and your child, as another reviewer mentioned. My kids were even finding it amusing to watch Barbie fall down the hole or get swallowed by quicksand over and over again, at first, but once they knew how to make her climb, tumble, push and pull heavy objects, swing from vines, and do monkey bars, they had more fun. I have been a cautious fan of Barbie over the years, not loving her unrealistic body type.

The tank needs a filtration system to remove the fish and snail pollution for lack of a better word. The water remains balanced with their use. So much easier to use than other types where one has to measure charcoal, filter floss, and etc. I suppose I shouldn't but I extend the life of them a bit by rinsing them out in between using a new filter.

This makes her scholarship quite suspect because her aim seems to be in every case, to show that Japanese women as a whole, are 'losers'. I had to laugh out loud at some of the chapters in that book, which seemed straight off these angry message boards in which West Coast white women rage about how white men are abandoning them in droves and going for Asian women, because they are ----- fill in the blanks with your favorite Asian stereotype.So, the history was interesting but its obvious that the author has more than a few prejudices herself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth may be opposite","review":"Well, to me, it is more like white men are chasing Japanese women.

I think it boils down to how you categorize the book. If you view it as a collection of essays with a particular viewpoint and nothing more (as I did), you will probably find it a satisfying read, whether or not you agree with its conclusions. If you approach it as ethnology--a hard, academic tome--then you might find it wanting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is so prejudiced, a bad ethnography","review":"I think Kelsky sees part of Japan and generalise as a whole... And Japanese women are not likely to honestly tell what we really think in our minds in front of Westeners but just say something white people expect to hear, as Japanese women regard Westeners as outsiders. So, for white men and women, it is really hard to know what we really think. But they tend to take the words as it is. You may not know, but Japanese women very often make fun of white men and women as ugly, fat, bald or etc. I feel very sorry but many Japanese women often say this ... So many of us have no adoration to Westners. If you want to believe what Kelsky maintains, just believe it. Many Westners want to believe themselves to be admired, so it is helpless. But if you do so, you will never know much about Japanese people and culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious dissapointment","review":"Based on the the many Japanese women with whom I've spoken, this book is largely inaccurate and, at most, \\"based on a true story.\\" The author's sources are questionable, and her bias is obvious.Perhaps the only positive thing I can say about this book is that the historical references are informative, but if you are looking for a history of Japanese women, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tale of the Finicky Fax","review":"After setting up the HP 4110 unit to my computer, phone line and answering machine I sat and waited for the faxes to arrive. To my sadness I heard fax after fax attempting to engage the unit, but the HP 4110 remained deaf to the fax tones. After a 1 hour call to HP customer support the person on the other end stated: this unit will only work in tandem with an analogue answering machine and if there is any static on the phone line, the unit will not engage into the fax mode. It's been a long time since I've seen an analogue answering machine (remember the type with two tapes?) on the market and even longer since I've encountered a phone line that is 100% static-free. I returned the unit to Office Depot and received a full refund. Beware of All-in-One machines, they are too good to be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper Jam","review":"The HP 4110 is an ok for small jobs. If you will use the device on a daily basis I would certainly not suggest this unit. The paper feeder seems to jam often.

I upgraded to the HP 6110X1 and it is working without issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunction right out of the box","review":"I bought the 4110 primiarly for a fax machine. I pulled it out of the box and set it up per instruction. I received my first fax and the carriage jamed. I followed HP instructions to correct the problem to no avail. The carriage continued to jam with every fax. I called HP and received the run around. They finally said they would send me a refurbished unit. I told them I paid for a new unit and not a used one. I returned the unit back to the store I purchased it from and received a new one in return. Time will tell if this one works."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What you Pay For","review":"I bought this on sale at Staples for $99. It was a disaster.I have always bought HP printers because they have been so reliable and well designed. This unit seems to be the exception. It smears ink all over the page on printouts, even after multiple cleanings. Sometimes a 20 page print job takes 20 minutes, someimtes five minutes. I don't know if I just got a lemon or if HP tried to pack too much into a small unit and all the units are prone to defective output.On the plus side, I bought it for the scanner and the scanner semmed to work really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP Ahead in race to bottom","review":"This is by the worst HP product I've ever owned. I can wait until the cartidge run dry and I can scrap it. Noisy, slow, constantly jams.

Run from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed. Will not print docs in page number order.","review":"The 4110 software is defective and they (hp) will not fix it.The software will not print in reverse order, e.g. from page 1 to <end>. So, you have to manually reorder the pages (if the document is longer than 1 page).I talked to tech support and many others at HP. They recognize the problem but management will not fix it.

When you reboot, and go back into word, and try to change fonts, it will crash. I even did a factory install. Didn't change anything. HP doesn't have any support email for this on the site. The greedy people at HP also decided to not support network printing on this computer, thinking you should buy 1 HP printer per computer. Now i am going to go buy a new printer out of my pocket, and go as far as to pay 10 times more to get a brand that isn't related to HP.

Tanya Tucker is on her game here. The first three songs \\"Come In Out Of The World\\", \\"I'll Take The Memories\\" (this cut was also done by Lorrie Morgan), and \\"I Bet She Knows\\" are slow and tender love songs. But \\"Find Out What's Happin'\\" livens the album up nicely. It is followed by a very pleasantly executed duet with Willie Nelson on the album's title cut, \\"Fire To Fire\\". The next song is my favorite, \\"Between The Two Of Them\\" is a wonderful love song that tells the story of two life-long lovers as remembered through the recollections of their daughter. Ironically, it is followed by \\"Nobody Dies From A Broken Heart\\" and \\"I'll Take Today\\", both of which explores lost love. The album wraps with the tender \\"The Love You Gave Me\\" and \\"Love Will\\". This is probably one of Tanya's best albums. FIRE TO FIRE burns bright. Get close to the flame and feel its warmth. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARDLY A FIRE-RY ALBUM","review":"Having always enjoyed the music of Tanya Tucker, this is probably my least favorite album. There are a couple good tracks such as \\"Between the Two of Them\\", \\"Love Will\\", but as a whole this album is definitely not to be compared with her smash album \\"Can't Run From Yourself\\" or even the less commericalized \\"Soon\\" or \\"Complicated\\" albums. \\"Fire to Fire\\" is for only die-hard Tanya fans. If you want a GREAT Tanya album I would recommend the albums mentioned above or her \\"Tanya\\" album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is bad, the novel is worse.","review":"I never watched Star Trek V, but everyone seems to agree that it's a faliure. But however bad the movie is, it can't be worse than this. The novelization is incredibly depressing! The movie, at least,seems to have had a somewhat humorous mood.

It also includes an Offspring sticker, and a \\"31\\" temporary tattoo, as well as an XL T-shirt that has \\"Pretty fly\\" on the front with a small cartoon character and OFFSPRING 31 on the back.

For example, you do not get any idea how the author's family managed to lead a relatively comfortable lifestyle when their father had no income and there is virutally no description of day to day life in Kabul-other than the punishments meted out by the Taliban- from 1992 to 2001.It is a very simple and superfically told narrative that may appeal to children in the 8-10 age group.I am surprised it found its way to the history section of the Berkely Heights library.This book is too elementary for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling and eye opening, you will read right through this","review":"no matter how many women or groups write or put out books or readings on afghanistan and the talibans rule, every story is compelling and mind blowing, as well as individual and important to read and be enlightened to. this is personal story of one girls situation living under the taliban. the stories of what she has gone through will plague you long after reading and will make you want to help. for those who are not aware of what has happened in afhganistan to women under taliban regime, pick this up and read it. id be surprised if it did not enlighten you in a major way"},{"rating":"2","title":"a woman's sorrow","review":"What a great book! I can't imagine to be confined in my own home for months and years and without any hopes and future. Latifa grew up when the Taliban took over her country, Afganistan. According to the Taliban's rules, as a woman, she was not allowed to go out unless she was accompanied with a family male member. She therefore was forced to stay and lived for two years in fear. She was totally blocked out the outside world for two years. I felt so sorry for her. However I admire her courage--her courage to set up an undergroud school for girls and boys at her home. This book is not only Latifa's memoir, it also contains the history of Afganistan in late 1980s to late 1990s. Also the translator does a very good job on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lightweight account","review":"This is a short book about a girl growing up in Afghanistan and it ends abruptly. Personal accounts of hardship are difficult to turn into good literature unless woven into the historical and political context of the country (as is done in Reading Lolita in Tehran) or reflect a poetry and imagery which counterbalances the mundane (as in The Diary of Anne Frank, with which this book is compared). That said, the writer makes a good job of describing the times leading up to the Taliban regime and the factual horror of that time. The book became more interesting once she started trying to do something about it, and began her small school. I would recommend this book for younger readers who know nothing about Afghanistan, and for those who want a quick account of its horrors through the eyes of a woman. For a much better and more in depth account, I'd go for the Sewing Circles of Herat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unofficial at best","review":"the halcyon days DVDs are a series of interviews by people who were near the band during the times they each describe.

But once they work, they work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Networking does not work with XP","review":"I was a HP printer fan until I purchased the 7140xi. I purchased it because it came with a print server & networking capabilities for my home LAN. After 40-50 hours on the phone with HP Support; calling friends for technical support, weeks of frustration, and many installs/uninstalls later--the HP printer is being returned. I could not get the HP software to install on my desktop with Windows XP-Home. I was able to install the HP Director software on 1 Windows 2000 laptop but not on another W2K laptop. My advice: consider another multifunction. I just ordered a Canon Multipass 730 & have given up on a networked multifunction for my home LAN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Machine Ever","review":"I sit next to this monstrosity at work.

The \\"scan to destination\\" feature is only compatible with Acrobat 5, and will it only work from the profile under which it was installed. So, if you log in as \\"bob\\" and install Acrobat and the HP software, you will only be able to create pdfs while logged in as \\"bob\\". Acrobat disappears as an option under all other profiles. Judging by HP's forums, this is a well known problem; however, they haven't released new software since 9-17-2003. The media slot can only be accessed through HP's proprietary software; thererfore, it doesn't appear as a drive, and can't be shared over the network without installing the nasty HP software on every machine.If you just want a great fax/copier get this.

This 7140XI looks like it will perform, but I agree with the other review the product is not ready for prime time. Same complaints as above, HP software is bad, no recent attempts to patch.

We had already discarded the packaging and we elected to contact Tadpoles directly to see if they might help with a replacement. I'll admit I wasn't too optimistic when I contacted the company by email.

I just was not able to find any of this force fed humor believable enough, or funny enough, to engage in. Exhausting over-use of contrived quips and predictable dialogue of predictable characters underestimated the sophistication of readership. Sorry Janice and Lynn, for a crappy review.

The author'sanalysis is interesting not only in the spirited description of the individuals profiled but in his comparison of each of them with their political antagonists. The unique perspective he brings a man whose life overlapped some of these figures is worth a read for history or politics buffs. His admiration and defense of some he buttresses with argument. His passion is clear.His oratorical style is typical of the time yet conveys a vivid impression of his subjects, and reminds one of a time before soundbites and simple words geared to a mass audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition - doesn't have the music tracks!?","review":"I bought the Kindle edition of this book for my ipad, so I would have the backing tracks and book on my ipad for ease of use in the classroom.

The sound quality is great and there are several added features (FM radio, voice recorder, etc.) The transfer speed was very quick. I also got her a set of speakers to use in her office. She is now the envy of all her friends.The only negative thing i have found is the method for recharging the device.

Instead of a lot of buttons to access the menus, you merely touch the sides of the screen to navigate. It is that simple. the only buttons are on/off, smart button which is programmable, a slide to lock the player so you don't inadvertently press the side of the screen, and volume. That's it!The only downside, which hasn't been a problem yet is the 2GB limitation. It would have been nice to be able to use a memory card, but the price would have gone up dramatically.The versatility to load songs, data, videos and photos (including slideshows) is the main reason I bought this player. Players just for MP3 or WMA are obsolete. Get one like this that can meet your needs in a lot of different formats.All in all, I have been well pleased with my purchase from Amazon so far and would recommend it to anyone who can live with 2GB of memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!!!!!!","review":"I like this player even though the memory is considerably, okay a lot, smaller than my last player. The positive is I no longer have a brick for an Mp3 player, the sound quality is great, the screen is bright and easy to read except in sunlight, the headphones fit comfortably in my ears, the games keep me occupied when I am ignoring my teachers at school, and Ive dropped it a few times and it hasnt broken yet. Only negative is that it seems to take to finger prints like a duck to water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice player from iriver","review":"The interface is cool. Clicking and menus are very intuitive.

There is no-one like Lou Rawls - no voice out there that matches the quality, tone and masterful rendering of every selection. The only part of the LP that didn't make it to the remastered CD is the Budweiser commercial at the end of \\"Early Morning Love\\" - he just throws it in there and it's a natural. I was a little disappointed when I didn't hear it on the CD, but not enough to pass up the remastered version.

This one looked decent, so I purchased it. So far I'm very, super satisfied. For the wind-proof umbrella, I think this one is the smallest and the lightest for its class within the quality standard that I was looking for.

And I'm certainly not a Christian fiction reader, but I am a film buff and a couple we are friends with turned me on to this series. I gotta say, I came away very moved. Plenty to pick on to be sure, but dang it, that adoption scene in the church was a tearjerker. And, I kind of like films that are predictable and romantic especially when my wife is getting all caught up in it if you know what I mean. I want to go back and check out the one with the Grey's Anatomy actress, though how she got from Christian fiction to Knocked Up I'd rather not speculate.

As other reviewers have pointed out,WHY did they have to make Willie die!?! Its like they're trying to repeat the first installment,Love comes sofly,all over again and doing a sorry job at it.They killed off one of the best and most enjoyable actors which left me rather annoyed.Also what happened to some of the characters,Marty and Clark's kids and Jeff and the ranch hands? No explaination is given about them. That said, it still has some good points, Dale Midkiff has returned in his role as Clark and Christian morals play a big part in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family series!!","review":"This was another great piece of the puzzle.

First they killed off Willie, then they made Belinda the daughter & not the sister. Then the actress they cast to play Marty was terrible, she did not bring that spunk and inner fire to the part the way Katherine Heigel did.Finally, what happen to the virtues Missy had instilled in her? I was quite surprised to see her kiss the sheriff, if you remember in the 2nd one she felt that she should only kiss the man she would marry and not before marriage! I know it's only a kiss, but remember this is not set in the 21st century. The ONLY redeeming quality this has is my favorite DALE MIDKIFF. He is a great actor, when you get pass all the facial nuiances!

To think that they killed off Missie's husband Willie for theatrics and so she could have a new love interest is horrible. Also, what happened to all of Missie's brothers, and her other children? In the books, her and Willie stayed at the ranch and raised a very lovely family and prospered on their ranch. Now, all of the sudden, all of that is gone. Also, Belinda is Marty and Clark's daughter, who was a late surprise, not an adopted daughter of Missie's. I couldn't even finish the movie, I was so upset.

We use it only before nap, after BM, and before putting him to bed...I usually do not use it for just wet diapers during the day unless he seems like he is starting to show some irritation...I think most kids get a rash from being wiped and still having wet skin before putting on a new diaper.

All the musicians gave it their all despite the fact that is was not a sell out or even close to it. David deserves more recognition than he gets and I hope someday it opens up for him in a big way. Sweet Revenge was is an '80s attempt at the Disco-New Wave sound. The best song on the score is \\"The Filthy Rich\\" with \\"Sweet Revenge\\" as second. David proves he can adapt without selling out. A fine talented man whose career I have followed since his early days in New York during the \\"70s. I wish him more success than he gets....... and someday he will have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on the subject","review":"An excellent book, well-illustrated with photographs and drawings. The organization of this book can be confusing. It is organized by manufacturer, and aircraft built under license are covered in the chapter about each builder, not just in the chapter of the original manufacturer. For example, the Aviatik Berg D.I was manufactured by six companies. This means that you must check six chapters for the complete history of the aircraft. There is a chart in the Aviatik chapter, but this can be confusing if you are not already somewhat familiar with the subject.

He is also a teenager going through adolescence and facing teen relationship issues, yet trying to remain focused in his education studies while trying to \\"not be like his father\\". I would recommend all teens to read as it displays positive insight on issues such as premarital sex, peer pressure, respect for your parents, and many other juvenile related issues. But I strongly encourage parents/adults to read this book because it shows what we as women tolerate some things sometimes for too long and how our children can pick up the negative behavior they become subjected to.

Too many times, romance writers make their heroines promiscuous, and it is just not believeable in an historical time frame. Meg is supposed to have been raised in a strict society home and life, and yet she has had many affairs while still being an unmarried young woman. It turned me off. I enjoy the chase and seduction theme as much as the next person, but I need the plot to remain true to the historical context as much as possible. This just didn't do that. And, to top it off, Bonaparte himself is a character in the novel. Ridiculous. Don't bother with Feather's latest book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after page 94","review":"As in my other reviews, I have always found Jane Feather an auto buy and purchased this after being quite pleased with Almost a Bride. But as most the other reviews state, I have to agree this is a sleeper and a dud. I usually can't put her books down but this one I kept down and up for 3 days and still only got to page 94 before finally giving up and tossing it in my give away pile. I just have too many other books to read without spending days trying to find out why I just can't get into this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, Just Bad.","review":"It seems that Jane Feather books are really good or really bad, and this one is BAD. Neither character is enjoyable. The plot kicks in somewhere around page 300; before that is just boring talk about the ship. The heroine is apparently a sex-crazed idiot who's willing to sacrifice her own safety in order to \\"enjoy\\" a man she's known for days. This same man basically kidnapped her, lied to her, and she suspects (rightly so) that he is a cold-blooded murderer. So by all means abandon your worried friends and family for \\"adventure.\\" Just stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed reader","review":"I have read near every book Jane Feather has written and was looking forward to the release of this book. I was very disappointed. Neither the hero nor the heroine were appealing and too many questions remained unanswered. Who was Cosimo? How did Meg give up her cosseted life so easily?I still would recommend Ms. Feather's \\"V\\" book series (Vixen, Valentine, etc.), but skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Don't Do It","review":"I can't believe the Jane Feather I know and love - mostly - wrote this waste of time. I felt like Meg's character had soooooo much more potential from Almost a Bride, and her story is a supreme disappointment to me. It was just boring! And for Ana to never physically be present in the story, she was a large presence. And what happened to Ana, anyway? Who betrayed the spies?The ending seemed rushed, implausible and unfinished. How were their many issues resolved? Did he continue to be an assasin? How did Meg explain herself to her family and friends? Who in the world is Cosimo, really? We know he has family, but obviously they are somewhat refined. Is he a gentleman? And what happened to Ana? And why was David sailing with Cosimo? These are the kind of questions that I was left with. All in all, sorely disappointed. Glad I bought it second-hand, but still mad I paid any money for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Enjoyable!","review":"Almost a Lady is a spirited tale of adventure, intrigue, lust and love on the high seas. Jane Feather captures the escapades and caprices of a handsome, mysterious privateer, a lady of the English nobility, and Napolean. A quick, fun read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste","review":"I had to skim through most of this book and had a hard time finishing it. The hero was unlikeable because he was using the heroine and comparing her to his old partner through everything. The heroine forgave the hero way too easily too often and was also unlikeable. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn......","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this one. Nothing to like about either of the main characters. Only finished it because it was like one of those movies you can't believe is so bad, so you keep watching hoping it will get better...well, it didn't get any better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit or miss","review":"Jane Feather novels are either hit or miss with me.

Excelent gain"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not All That Is Missing Is Relevant","review":"What alot of reviewers fail to realize about this comp is that it's a Mute/Rough Trade collaboration/compilation which means only bands from those labels are represented.I actually do not own the disc but have most of the tracks on CD, vinyl or taped from the radio in the early 80's (WNYU). But am gonna get it ASAP since it's a very good representation of that era. Plus it's good to see NYC bands like Liquid Liquid and ESG (who were both on 99 Records in the US) finally on digital format.Yeah, there might be some stuff missing and the inclusion of the newer bands may seem lame, but it's definitely worth the money!Check out the Rhino Records 80's/Post-Punk box-set \\"Left of the Dial\\" for the rest of the worlds contributions (heavy on USA)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"Replaced identical printer.

But I'm returning mine.good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted...about 2 years","review":"I came online just to check prices for this printer, since mine just flamed out and I wanted to see how much I'd originally spent on it. I was startled to see other reviews detailing *exactly* what happened to my 1300... steaming along just fine until about year 2, then paper jams, crackling noises, shredded rollers and the works.The printer worked like a champ for as long as it lasted, but once the crackling sound hits, as mentioned in another review, it's time for a new printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prints Crooked","review":"I've purchased and returned three laserjet 1300's due to crooked print.

Eighteen months-two years, wonderful printer, then CRUNCH, the paper begins to crinkle, the printer beings to crackle, and you're looking at either a big repair bill ($80 an hour in my area) or a new printer. Ouch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuser film sleeve problems within a couple of years","review":"I administer around 40 1300n printers and most of them are doing okay after 15 months worth of use but I have noticed several starting to have problems with the fuser film sleeve coming apart inside. At first you start hearing a noise as the sleeve revolves around with the part that is flaking off making noise with every spin. And from what I understand, this is not something very easy to replace by yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious problems after less than 2 years","review":"This printer prints quickly and efficently, it was easy on toner and was used by one person printing less than 15 sheets per day. The down side is that it is less than 18 months old and the roller is shot, the teflon is gone on one side and it distroys anything I try to print. The cost to repair it is estimate to be $300 which is about a wash for a new printer. I guess it would have paid to get the extended warranty. Although new printers should last more than 18 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Our HP Laserjet 1300 lasted two years with very light use. Then the fuser film sleeve ripped. This $30 part cannot be replaced by the average user. I tried, but ended up throwing the whole thing in the garbage.It worked fine during it's short expensive life.Just don't expect to have it for long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid laser printer with plenty of features","review":"After doing plenty of research on laser printers, I recently decided on this one. Great quality, great speed, manual duplexing is easy. As one reviewer said earlier, sometimes pages print up crooked; it's only happened once or twice, and I'm not really sure why. However, that's the only problem I've had, and it's a minor one.If you could meet your needs with an inkjet, but want the extra quality and convenience of a laser, the laserjet 1012 is probably a better choice at half the price of this one. The 1150 is essentially the same as the 1300, minus all the internal features, for ususally about $100 less. I probably would have chosen it, but with a $100 rebate on the 1300 (and not the 1150), it made sense to go for the better printer for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not our Fathers Hewlett Packard","review":"I had a HP laser I bought new in 1992 that lasted 13 years under home use. I bought a 1300n and it has lasted 18 months under very moderate home use. I turned it on one day and CLACK CLACK CLACK , very loud. Sounds like the problem described elsewhere. Service cost is ridiculous. I would expect better from HP. In anycase, I am not happy, and won't buy another HP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good printer, inadequate documentation","review":"This is a fine printer with many good features. I particularly like the fast start: the first copy comes out in 10 seconds. The subsequent ones arrive very quickly too. It has all the expected features, such as duplexing and booklet printing.Installation of the software was unnecessarily difficult because of the inadequate documentation. The start-up guide is completely pictorial and does not tell you how to install the software, e.g., that it should be installed without the printer connected to the computer and which one of the several drivers to install. Those instructions are found only in the on-line manual and various readme files on the CD/ROM, which I am used to reading after installation. As happens more and more often these days, the on-line manual did not answer all of my questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"After just a few months, the print began to fade from the center of pages. HP warranty provided for a new \\"reconditioned\\" machine to be sent to me; same problem, right out of the box. Avoid this one at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"W/me 4 stars is great.","review":"I was recommended this by a friend whose taste I respect. I've seen them live and met Will Darling. Talent like this should fall on as many ears as possible. They are worth whatever listener support you can afford. Great vocals and stunning keyboard talent, that's what I noticed the most but there isn't an area lacking. Its cool to hear someone who has the \\"something\\" to make it big."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best independent albums out there!!!","review":"This album is sooo good. it's original, fresh, and well put together. it was produced independently by cyclesomething, which gives it an air of rawness that i can't get enough of. i discovered this band from their site...one of the best bands to come out of chicago in awhile! the songs are well-crafted with attention paid to great performances all around. while the tunes move through your mind, you will notice consistency that is solid but not too obvious. in other words, these dudes can mix it up and stay cyclesomething! i guess i can sum it up like this...it's a fresh rock album that could hit the bigtime without a doubt. can't get enough..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album","review":"Portrait's second release is a fine example of what great R&B is all about. A good smattering of both slow love grooves and faster up-tempo movers, this album shakes it up a little bit. However, the characteristic smooth and silky singing of the group stays true and is displayed on every track. The lyrics themselves show thought in the writing. A classy piece from a classy group, this release should not disappoint R&B lovers, especially those fond of suuch artists as Kenny Lattimore, Keith Washinton, or Az Yet. 5 STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Small you can barely SEE them","review":"When I opened the package I first thought they'd forgot to include the merchandise.

It was a different sound and was enjoyable. I cannot say that about the rest of the album. The songs are garbage and Daniel uses a really annoying higher octive in most of these songs that often times sounds way strained. If you are looking for other songs on this album like \\"Bad Day\\" don't waste your time or money. They aren't on this album.

Nope. It is just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Computer programming at it's best!","review":"Let's face it - this guy has no talent. The computer and drum programming are pretty good, but the background strings are really annoying. Just about anyone today can do an album like this with really good computer programmers, software, and a large record label that is willing to market you.This is another prime example of an over-hyped no talent artist with canned music in the background. \\"Having a Bad Day\\" was a catchy tune - but as other's have stated, the lyrics lack depth, it's a one trick pony, and they guy can't sing.I bet he is laughing all the way to the bank though! Because we all got suckered into buying this.If you like \\"Teeny Bopper\\" \\"Bubble Gum\\" music - you will like this album - if you are looking for something with some soul - look elsewhere.

There are enchanting melodies in almost every song and not many that i'd want to skip past.There are the upbeat and fun songs like \\"Lie to Me\\", \\"Suspect\\" and \\"Hollywood\\" and also the slower but still enjoyable songs like \\"Free Loop\\" and \\"Jimmy Gets High\\".An album worth your money, i say. It doesnt sound like these songs get old fast. Daniel Powter is here to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"...And I never write reviews for albums!","review":"Daniel Powter knows how to make songs that just make you feel good. \\"Bad Day,\\" although perhaps too overplayed, is a great tune.

Bad Day is about the only song I anjoyed on the CD. Most of the CD is sung in his falsetto, above his range, and I coudln't understand any of what he was singing. Honestly, I thought he sounded akin to Donald Duck throughout most of it. his lyrics are good, and I give him points for writing his own stuff, but overall I think it's a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music; bad CD; poor treatment of fans","review":"I love his music. It is the same style found in other artists like James Blunt and KT Tunstall lately. My only complaint is that I listen to music through my IPOD and this CD's copyright protection scheme prevents computers from being able to read it. I hope in the future such albums are sold with a large, clear, and visible warning. And its a bit of a cruel joke given that Daniel's website is constantly giving away IPODs in contests. I really think this copyright protection scheme has done irreparable damage to his career by significantly limiting his exposure. [UPDATE] After reading other reviews it is evident that the recently manufactured 're-release' of his album with additional tracks in 2007 do not have the copyright protection scheme present. It is nice to know that the fans who supported his career in the beginning are being blatantly walked over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulfull music!","review":"With his debuet single 'Bad day', Daniel powter rushed to number 1, both in the U.S and in the U.K, and i can see why!What an amazing track.

I've listened to this album multiple times looking for something as good as \\"Bad Day\\". I've come to the conclusion that it just ain't here. Fans have raved about the diversity of styles on this album, and, yes, there is some diversity. But the truth is that regardless of the style, none of the songs (save Bad Day) is particularly catchy or even particularly memorable. This one is going back on the shelf after I pull Bad Day to a good compilation disc. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"I'm lucky, I managed to get this CD for free. I snatched it up because I enjoyed Bad Day, and thought this artist sounded like somebody that could be great.Instead, after I put it on my iTunes (and for the record, I had no problems at all loading it onto my computer, and I have TWO burners) I usually hit skip. The songs aren't BAD. They're just not that GREAT either. They're really rather non-descript and I can't recall most of them now that I'm sitting here trying.I also don't like Powter's voice in several of the songs, including one most people love, Jimmy Got High. He's singing far too high for his range, and it just comes out falsetto and hard on the ears. I reccomend getting songs you like from a music download service, but skipping the whole album unless you've heard and liked it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GOOD JOB by Capitol Records","review":"Track choice is always personal feeling.

He covers Chuck Berry (\\"Let it Rock\\"), Irving Berlin (\\"Russian Lullaby\\"), The Rolling Stones (\\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\"), and Smokey Robinson (\\"When the Hunter Gets Captured by the Game\\"). That is a lot of musical territory. The collection was recorded in 1974 (just two years after the great European tour by the grateful Dead and a year after The Wake of the Flood) and found Mr Garcia at the top of his game.

In other words, when closed it read zero, but when you go to a known-accurate 90 degree angle I consistently got 89.9 degrees. More troubling to me than that is the flexibility of the movable arm. It's a somewhat flexible piece of aluminum angle iron, so if you press a little too hard when taking a measurement you will affect the reading. But a couple of weeks later the error correction changed to -.5 degrees around 90 degrees, and +.4 degrees around 45 degrees. In other words, it became useless.I returned it for a replacement and the second one was off by -.4 degrees. Returned that one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denali 11 Inch Digital Angle Protractor","review":"This is not a professional protractor. I've had the same experience as many others here who purchased this unit. I sent my first one back because it wasn't even remotely accurate. The second one is accurate to +/- 2 degrees.

Unfortunately, I have not personally used it, so I am sort of clueless about it, except for what he's told me.He did leave it on once, and the battery went dead, so I know it has no automatic shut off. It takes ordinary batteries, AAA, I think.He used it last week to put up some baseboards, and all his angles were perfect, so I think it works pretty well. He did cut one piece too short, but the angle was perfect!

It has a pre-fed zero which can sometimes be inaccruate due to jerks or falls.That is a disaster.

If the line gets jammed or if you don't bump it to release more line fast enough, you have to unscrew the head to reload it... try feeding two lines back into the head when you are hot, sweaty and tired!

Bad idea. I got too close to some concrete steps and accidentally let the spool contact them. With a tool this powerful, watch out! The spool and casing exploded into shrapnel. The spool is a spare part, but the housing is not. You have to send it back for service. My previous trimmer was a cheap Black and Decker, and I never had problems with the line feed and it seemed rather indestructible. It seems like a very powerful tool, possibly too powerful for its own good. The housing of the spool should be metal, and the drive shaft looks like it could be stripped easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch goes bad often","review":"I have had this trimmer for several years. This is my second one. The trimmer is great EXCEPT for the fact that I have had to replace the trigger switch at least twice every season.

A school teacher, Lydia, at the top of her profession leaves her native Denmark and travels to Jerusalem in the late 1920's --the beginning of a huge conflict between the Jews and the Arabs that is still going on today. She has traveled to Jerusalem because she has had a dream that she belongs there. And she gives up her home and her job to follow that dream. She arrives in Jerusalem pretty much penniless, but she relies totally on God for her needs, and He comes through. Just when she has spent her last coin for food, a money order arrives from Denmark to help her through another tough period. She has been given a sick, 18-month old child to nurse back to health, and she succeeds brilliantly at this job even though she must rescue the child and travel through a war zone with the child on her back. It's an excellent book because you feel inspired by Lydia's courage and ingenuity."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you can't see is powerful.","review":"This is a most excellent read.

He has apparently spent no time checking any of his facts, and one wonders if he has actually been to Greece at all. His lack of respect for the Greek people is typical of the British traveler, and his lack of respect for truth is perhaps typical of the British journalist (perhaps of most journalists today). But one might expect the publisher to show some principles. Mr. France can't even get the difference between ouzo and tsipouro clear, let alone the origin of the phalanx. He presents the Greek people as if they had just emerged from the Stone Age, when in fact, this is a culture which was enjoying epic poetry, lyrical poetry, and narrative fiction while his ancestors were still shivering in caves.

If Ryobi cannot maintain quality standards well enough that the replacement of an wearing item does not meet specifications, you should not give them any of your money.

The Hider's music thematically focuses on a sort of spiritual vacuum in the middle of a plastic and mostly gutted world.

Season 1 was the best and had the best Pokemon. It is so nice being able to watch them all in order. Each disk has around 9 episodes on it. The scene selection is just ok. I would prefer to be able to skip the intro sometimes, but it is not a big deal.Definitely worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice casual set","review":"This dinnerware is great for every day use and has a rustic feel about it.The bowls, however, are massive and take up huge amounts of space in the dishwasher (they cannot be nested like my old bowls, there are just too big). The plates are large as well, and somewhat non-uniform in color (that adds to their rustic nature). The saving grace was the free fruit bowls - nice sized for a small snack."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEA DOG: THE VIEWER'S CURSE","review":"SEAWOLF THE PIRATE'S CURSE is lame, ponderous, and dull. Any attempts at humor fall extremely flat, and the whole movie is limp and flaccid. Thomas Ian Griffith (Final Encounter, Excessive Force) is one of the most bland heroes we've seen in some time. Attempting to be a new Harrison Ford, Griffith only serves to remind us how great Indiana Jones was, and how any movie claiming to be \\"like\\" it always fall flat. Add Gerit Kling, a lovely German actress, whose accident is almost indecipherable, Barry Flatman who lives up to his last name in his role as a villainous colonel, and assorted chases and you have one cheesy movie. The heroes actually use a coral colored Volkswagen as their getaway car; the bad guys pursue an old Chevy Impala in Suzukis!!! There is little to recommend the film except for some lovely scenery of Cuba.A real dud; 2 stars for the landscapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guide that reads like a novel","review":"This book is interesting because it gives great marriage advice but reads more like a novel than a guide.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"still the one!","review":"my husband and i were instructed to read this book, as were many of our peers, during our engagement (1980!). more than just a moving story, it offers practical issues to think about as you're considering spending your life with someone. it weaves the personal stories of several couples with a series of sermons given by a traveling pastor on the subject of marriage. though until i saw it recently on amazon, it was a little tough to find, we have given it as a gift to several engaged couples. definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Intro to North West Indiana","review":"FINALLY! A book that actually points out some of the many good things about an overlooked corner of Indiana. My only complaint is I can think of some good restaurants that aren't mentioned in this book. But he does cover many very good ones. The guide to the Lakeshore appears very comprehensive. And I especially enjoyed the histories of each community. A great job!

Needless to say, having to pull out my laptop and hand carry it aboard was traumatic enough for me to scramble for another bag.The Checkpoint-friendly aspect is a breeze - it also has icons on the inside, so even if security doesn't speak English they understand that the laptop is on its own. The main compartment holds a good amount of odds and ends, and it's sturdy enough to take a few hits and not damage anything inside.Only con I would say is I wish they would make it in more colors or patterns...but that's subjective I know =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted!","review":"Who doesn't find it annoying to have to remove your laptop from it's bag every time you go through airport security? With this bag, you don't have to! Simply unzip and lay the bag flat and off you go. The bag also has lots of extra compartments for documents, supplies, etc and appears to be extremely sturdy. So far, worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect laptop bag for traveling","review":"I got this bag primarily for airplane traveling and it is perfect for the job! I can zip it through airport security without having to remove my laptop. The bag has a slim profile while still providing ample space for things. It's an ideal carry-on. There is plenty of room for other items to keep you busy on flights, and everything remains tidy.Of course, it's equally good as an every-day, computer bag as well. It has nice tidy paper storing areas to keep organized for meetings or conferences.This is my second Targus computer bag and they continue to satisfy me. My other Targus is a backpack style computer bag which went through college with me and shows no ill signs of wear. These are great bags, I recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase, just pick your plane seat carefully.","review":"So I have taken this bag on 2 work trips so far and it really is great. The TSA friendly configuration is awesome, haven't been asked to take out my laptop on any of the passes through airport security. One of the great features is that the bag is made to fit under the seat in front of you so you don't have to worry about getting in and out of the overhead bin. The only problem is that on a recent AA flight I sat in a middle seat and the seat in front of me had life vests in boxes below it, so my bag would not fit. Other than that one hiccup this has been perfect. I still highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Brilliant for travel, easy to put on a roller handle suitcase, lots of pockets, comfortable to wear also.

Excellent bag for airport checkthrough. Breezed through security at New York JFK and Portland, OR PDX.2. Ample room for Dell Latitude E6500 15.4\\", notebook mouse, and computer power cord and thin transformer block. If you have one of the older thicker transformer blocks, I'm sure it would fit, though with a very slight bulge.3. Very light bag compared to others, but still strong and well made.4. Romm for some papers, but not a lot. Not meant to be a full briefcase.5. Strap for fitting over rolling suitcase handle.6. Front side pockets for things like air tickets, one zipped and the other open but deep and snug enough so that tickets won't fall out.7. Easily fit under seat of AirBus 320."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for businessmen, I'm sure..","review":"Quick and easy: my 16\\" Toshiba fits fine in this bag, even with the extended battery (even though it creates a small bulge, it works). The padding is nice on this bag, however I was hoping that my laptop with my zipper case already on it would fit inside this case (for added protection), but the zippercase made my laptop justttt a bit too big for the compartment on this bag.Has plenty of compartments for accessories/office supplies, and would be easy to lay flat at the airport as advertised. Sturdy shoulder strap as well. No complaints!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Targus laptop case","review":"This laptop case seems to be very well constructed and intelligently designed. I say \\"seems\\" at this point because it hasn't stood the test of time - I have traveled with it yet, and it's only about a month old. It is bigger in terms of how much you can put in it, than it appears because of its efficient use of space and shape: it doesn't have unnecessary dividers and heavily-padded sides, just the amount of padding that I think is enough, with one thin divider and an external pocket that expands to hold a lot. So far, I'm very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zip thru feature is useless.","review":"I was disappointed by this bag. The \\"zip thru\\" feature is completely useless (at least in european airports), and it is too bulky for the capacity provided.

This bag has a lot of great features and many useful storage compartments.The old MobileEdge bag had two zippers fail after about six months. The bag was never overloaded and the computer was just a small netbook.The only minor issue that I can see with the Targus is that the cover of the separate computer section does not say \\"Checkpoint friendly\\" or have any other indication that this bag is produced to TSA specifications. This could cause problems with certain TSA nit-picking ego-trippers. I am keeping the instructions and labels handy in case there are any issues at the TSA checkpoint.I really like the backupack design that allows both hands free. The water bottle pockets are quite handy. Overall, a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case!","review":"I had trouble finding a case and found this one, which fits every need.

Bag has been outstanding. I have taken it through airport security over 10 times and have had no issues. For quality and ease of use I totally recommend it. I actually use it to carry two computers. When I unzip the bag to go through the X-ray I take out my personal computer. My company laptop stays in the bag. Speeds me on my way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"useful at different stages","review":"This book is excellent. It is short, lucid, inexpensive, portable. The format (chinese -- both characters and Pinyin -- in the left column, English on the right) allows for creative exercises. For example, one can cover the English and translate from Pinyin; cover the Chinese and translate from the English (what a better way to test 'thinking in Chinese'!); finally, cover the Pinyin and English and test the ability to read characters. The introduction on the structure of the Chinese language is one of the best I have read, perhaps second only to 'Chinese language; fact and fiction' by J. DeFrancis. Please note that this book may not be the best choice for the reader whose focus is pronunciation (no cassettes included) or writing (no stroke order). A few typos do not detract from the oustanding product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to Mandarin Chinese","review":"I'm learning Chinese and I have several books on the language but this is the best introduction to the language I've ever seen.

I also liked the cultural insights very much. I really recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction to Chinese","review":"There is an audio tape that goes with this book. It is sold separately and you should get it to help you with pronounciation.This is a very basic book and you can go through it relatively fast, without getting stuck along the way.Highy recommended for beginners.Some other program to help you with pronounciation of Chinese are Pimsleur's programs and to help you write Chinese characters - Easy Chinese Tutor CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pronunciation guide?","review":"Unless I have totally missed it somehow, there is no explanation in this book as to how the language is actually to be pronounced. Pinyin is used, to be sure, but no explanation of the Pinyin system is given. That seems like a pretty glaring ommission to me.The grammatical explanations are pretty good, so I didn't give the book only one star. I almost gave it three stars, but the author included several interludes in which he tries to teach you about a supposed connection between the Chinese language and the Chinese way of thinking and from a linguistic standpoint, alot of his ideas are questionable to say the least. Take that stuff with a grain of salt anyway, and for my part, I forwent the addition of a star to the book's rating.Final rating: 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough without a teacher","review":"This book wont help you to learn speak chinese at all if you dont have a teacher who can tell you how to pronounce the words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated","review":"Extremely annoyed to find after opening the package (since the wrapper was covering the cutters) that I've received two giraffes and no elephant.

I was looking for something that was more proportional to a little dog. I saw the \\"mini\\" cutters and I crossed my fingers. When they arrived tonight, I tried to think of a way to describe how small they are...the ark, for example - a nickel can fit inside, with a little extra on the sides. A dime fits inside the bear and a quarter inside the elephant. So they're definitely mini! The only reason I gave four stars is because I haven't used them yet to know how well they cut through dough.

I bought the first DVD set as soon as it came out as I have this one. I give the show 5 stars, I also love how they included the 90 minute episode that was advertised to air but was cut down to a hour. My only complaint is the quality of the episodes aren't so great. I would compare it to watching a Vhs tape of the show recorded on the fastest speed. Actually that may look better than what we have here because there's a lot of digital artifacts and distortion such as a green halo around the skin of anyone in the lightest shadow.Show: 5 starsQuality: 2 starsOverall: 4 stars seems fair right? ok maybe not but I love this show and glad to have it all together on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny for sure","review":"If you like the first season of Joe Schmo you'll like this one too.

I hadn't seen Joe Schmo 2, so I thought I would order it for some light comedy.Joe Schmo 2 was not nearly as funny as the original.

The acting was beyond horrible, sometimes even unbearable. When the talent faltered in the original Cube, the simplicity and dimension of the film made up for it. That's not the case with this one. Cube 2 was no monumental classic either, however, it was at least mildly entertaining and pleasant to look at even if it does hold so little weight it's not worth remembering.If you like typical Sci-Fi Channel (or SyFy as it now calls itself) fare, complete with cheesiness, overdone special effects, predictibility, actors practically being fed their lines, and an overall feeling that you've just been robbed when you're done watching the film, you will LOVE Cube Zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERN MEANT?","review":"I haven't seen the two previous CUBE movies, but I understand this is sort of a \\"prequel\\" to them. Admittedly a bizarre little film, it's an innovative and eerily effective little chiller that plays on the Big Brother concept to the fullest. The setting and special effects are above average for an independent low budget film, and Zachary Bennett as the geek hero and Michael Riley as the one-eyed corporate exec give good performances.

The Chris Lowe cd is listenable but the only thing really good on it is The Flirts Passion. The Neil Tennant cd is just boring. The mixing on both cds is that they just stuck the songs together, a really bad idea. And you think they would at least do a new song for it but no, they just use a bunch of people no one really knows. Overall, this is worse than Disco 2, which up til now has been there worst album.

So no talent? Never mind, wave your cheque book and real musicians, top producers, ghost writers and collective sycophants will gather around and come up with goods.You can then float your tinny, thin little vocals and banal lyrics over their work. Afterwards you can go to the bank in your pick-up truck and load it with money. Meanwhile genuinely talented people scrabble to make a living. Ah me.'twas ever thus. To take this parasitical develpment to this logical conclusion they have here issued an album of other peoples songs , sung by....other people. Con-artists of the first degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tale of two discs","review":"This CD set comprises two separate BTM collections, one compiled by Chris Lowe and another by Neil Tennant, and the two of them couldn't be more different. Chris' CD is absolutely stunning, an amazing collection of dance music, mainly 80s electronic and italo-disco. Even though the names may sound obscure, the collection is truly outstanding if you like this type of music, and very close to what may be described as the \\"traditional\\" PSB sound. .Neil's collection on the other hand is rather pretentious. (Btw \\"Pretentious\\" should be a PSB song title, shouldn't it?), very ambient, with some classical pieces, and the occasional pop song (Etienne Daho, Dusty). Even though Neil's CD is interesting, it is probably not something that you will often listen to (unless, probably you are Brian Eno ;-) )."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 hit wonder","review":"no turning back is the only song i really like on this cd. it is an excellent song though."},{"rating":"2","title":"great introduction to remixing","review":"Great buy if you're looking specifically at remixing.

He goes through too many topics in too few pages for this book to be useful.

He also fought the dunderheaded excesses of McCarthyism.

Policy now calls for \\"touching the desk\\", the typical car sales approach for the sales person to get the manager before the customer leaves the premises as a last ditch effort.

This album comes from a time and place when Radiohead were an actual BAND, not a whiny hermetic weirdo and a guy on a Macbook.This is just my opinion. I also love the album that comes after this (of course), which is when most people checked in on Radiohead. The one benefit of the fame attained from OK and their following albums is that it leads those unfamiliar with the The Bends to discover it and hopefully appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"The Bends is such a beautiful and sad masterpiece.

It was \\"overrated\\" if you didn't understand how important it was for British rock to crack the American mainstream. These songs are 90's guitar rock classics. They were the perfect songs to learn how to play guitar to & to understand what songwriters could do with only the four basic instruments.I also recommend 'Pablo Honey' for it is in the same vein of \\"pretty melodies mixed with thrashing guitars.\\"A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Me Wish I Knew Radiohead Sooner...","review":"The first Radiohead album I listened to was OK Computer, one of the most brilliant records I've ever heard and the best from the Radiohead album catalogue. By now, I know that Radiohead is not a rock band that will live up to its expectations from nobody, not even their most loyal fans. Their latest material is experimental, relying more on electronic beats and crackly, glitchy sounds than on sweeping guitars. And that's okay. The Bends, just like OK Computer, is their most accessible and enjoyable albums. The music moves me, the lyrics are simple and yet so deep. There's not a single song that I do not like. I recommend this album, OK Computer, and Hail to the Thief for essential Radiohead listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, but...","review":"Unfortunately, while this CD and many of Radiohead's CDs are very good to excellent, The Bends is the electrified, arena-rocked version of Jeff Buckley's Grace album. Wait...stay with me here for a moment. If you have Radiohead's Pablo Honey disc from 1993 and then you hear The Bends from 1995, you obviously notice a dramatic change in the scope of Radiohead's music. Instead of the Nirvana-ish \\"Creep,\\" now you have the epic, soaring guitars of \\"Planet Telex.\\" Also, Thom's falsetto starts emerging as a major component of the Radiohead sound. Not coincidentally, Buckley released his Grace album in 1994. It has the fretwork of The Bends (and later) album(s). The falsetto in Jeff's voice is quite distinct for 1994; of course, now the falsetto is a key component of a vast majority of bands (Radiohead and their followers Coldplay, Keane, Muse, Travis, etc.). It is not too far a stretch to think that Thom and co. \\"borrowed\\" a bit from Grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!","review":"This is absolutely one of the best recordings of the last decade. Every song on this album is top notch with beautiful vocals from Thom Yorke. Simply put, there comes along every so often a band that actually cares about the music they make and are good at it. Radiohead is in an elite class of musicians. They are the one band that this generation will remember for a long time. They are in one word...genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"(teach you how to be a ...) Holy Cow!","review":"Just when you turn on The Bends and the CD's spinning you think \\"Hmmm ... is this song going to end?\\" And then number seven (\\"Just\\") and number eight (\\"My Iron Lung\\") come on and you think: \\"Wow! Now THAT is cool!\\" At least that's what I thought when I popped in my new CD! No, most of the songs on The Bends don't add up to some of the songs on Pablo Honey (including the ever-so-emotional \\"Creep\\"), but Radiohead's frontman Thom York does it again with his fantastic (and almost humorous) lyrics and extreme vocals! As far as the pause in \\"Just\\" and the electric guitars in \\"My Iron Lung\\" goes, Radiohead is back in my list of favorite bands ... and there they will stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome cd!","review":"This is one of my favourite cd's ! I just love all the songs ... You should buy it now..you wont regret it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"While it has dated just a little since it's release, The Bends remains an absolutely essential rock album. The band would go on to do much bigger and better things on OKC, Kid A and HTTT, but this one has a special place in a lot of people's hearts. And with good reason. Should be 4.5 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"New sensation","review":"Although I think Pablo Honey is underrated, The Bends makes it very clear that the first major rock band since U2 has arrived. They deserve that accolade because they can't easily be compared to anyone else and the songs are uniformly terrific. It's incredible that this album wasn't that commercially successful at first because it didn't have a hit single. (Here's something to consider: The White Album didn't have a hit single either). But time catches up. Nothing this good stays a secret, and this still remains my favorite Radiohead album. Hard to pick favorites but High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees, and Bullet Proof are instant classics. Don't be cheap though, download the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best pop/rock albums ever","review":"The Bends is without any doubt one of the world's finest displays of British excellence.

I bought this album because of \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\", but after few listenings I started to like \\"High And Dry\\", \\"My Iron Lung\\", \\"Black Star\\" and \\"Sulk\\" as well. My favourite track on the album is \\"(Nice Dream)\\" because its mellodic mood and brilliant lyrics. \\"They loved me like I was a brother, protect me, listen to me\\" is exactly what I feel and aclaims to get, like Thom Yorke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid CD","review":"Radiohead is often associated with much hype and hysteria. Releases since OK Computer have been declared masterpieces by many. I personaly have many reservations to those claims. While their debut album was grunge, \\"The Bends\\" was the last Radiohead release prior to their avante-gard stage and is probably their most digestable release to date. What you have is a solid rock / pop CD with some U2 influences. Songwriting is strong as are tracks like: the bends, fake plastic trees, high and dry, bullet proof, nice dream, street spirit are very good. There is much less wandering here than on later discs and Thom Yorkes vocals are much clearer. If you are new to Radiohead or just want some good alternative rock-pop music then look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album ever. period.","review":"this is without a doubt the best album ever made. if you don't own it already, go get it. you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, fine record","review":"Believe me, it's hard to say something different about this CD than saying that this is a wonderful, fine record.

Well a few weeks ago I was going through some really emotional stuff in my life and my best friend handed me this cd...I figured I wouldn't like it but trusted his taste. WELL-long boring story short...this cd could not have come at a better time. I have been listening to it non-stop for weeks and am now a big Radiohead fan. Each song tells a story that you can relate to--it's great for those depressing days but also amazingly great any other time. Thom's vocals, his songwriting, the production...all is brilliant. If you're looking for a starter RADIOHEAD CD...this is it. It'll help, I promise :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genius ...","review":"What else can i say?

This is easily their most accessible album and much stronger than Pablo honey. Songs such as \\"fake plastic trees\\", \\"Just\\", \\"Bullet proof...i wish i was\\" and the title track are why so many people have fallen in love with this band. Not quite as perfect as their follow up Ok Computer, but The Bends is still an essential 90s rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rise up to the level of Radiohead","review":"Not as consistantly dazzling as their latest effort, Ok Computer (buy this. Please.), The Bends nevertheless is emotional and intelligent. Even the jangly bits are cohesive.

She lives with a broken man A cracked polystyrene man Who just crumbles And burns And it wears him out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening","review":"From start to finish this album puts me in some sort of blissful trance. Everyone I've convinced to listen to it has thought it's incredible (except perhaps my mother, but what did I expect). Thom just sings how and what I'd sing if It'd been me, the music spirals and twists just like it would if I was playing it, and if I could make an album it'd sound exactly like this. Particularly strong songs are Fake Plastic Trees, Just (which incidentally may have the greatest music video ever made), My Iron Lung, Bulletproof ... I wish I was, Bones and of course fade out/ street spirit (arpeggiated Am, C, Em with a descending D C B on the B string for any other budding guitarists). Radiohead can blend spontaneity and structure like no other band I've heard and that's what makes them so unique, brilliant and endlessly listenable. Far, far superior to Pablo, and closer to the heart than OK Computer, it's all good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave me the Bends","review":"I got the bends listening to this album and had to spend a few hours in a sound less chamber in order to return to normal society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patience is a virtue","review":"I tried, I really tried. Played it while I'm cooking, while I'm driving, just about any chance that I can have. I just don't get it. It does not grow on you. It just remains so boring.

I salute anybody who can do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"My ears now have the bends.","review":"Somebody once asked Ringo Starr what he did with the money his mother gave him for singing lessons. He replied \\"I spent it on fish and chips.\\" He was joking. If the same reply had come out of Thom Yorke's mouth I would have totally believed him. His voice annoyed me. I like something different as much as the next person but PLEASE! One good song, High and Dry, the rest was difficult to digest in an aural sense. For those who do like this band, I am happy you are able to find music that you are so passionate about. Difficult to do now a days."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"I cannot stand this album. Or, Rather: I cannot understand this C.D. Don't get me wrong, the tracks aren't exceptionally horrible but I don't see what the fuss is about. The guys voice is whiny and annoying and the songs are self involved. The only song that sounded marginally musical and lived up to the hype was Fake Plastic Trees. I doubt anyone really enjoys this album but simply puts up with it because they want to like it/want people to think they like it. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bends.","review":"Pablo Honey that had few good songs on it and one hit single Creep that has become Radiohead's signiture song. To follow-up Pablo Honey they decide to do something very different. Released in april 1995 The Bends made the music critics stand up and take notice because here was an album not like anything ever heard. Radiohead made something very special a brilliant album that to this date is one of the most played album in my stereo's. With gorgous melodies, brilliant hooks, amazing guitar riffs and quirky lyrics The Bends stands out as one of the most essential and best albums of the past 20 years. The muscianship and the production is flawless and not to mention amazing cover art. Overall a classic album 10/10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please stop whining.","review":"Please stop whining and enjoy the fact that Radiohead have grown and changed and make different music.You know what remains stagnant? Swamps and dead bodies.Great album by a band that has made even better albums after better albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This album amazes me on so many levels. I've never heard an album that offers so much to so many different types of listeners.The songwriting is superb. They aren't *too* experimental on this album and the songs, though not \\"hits,\\" are well-crafted. The production is trademark Radiohead. They continually use dissonance to elicit the highest degrees of emotion in the listener. Lastly, the performances, most notably Thom York, are passion-filled. His unbridled vocal style is not better represented on any Radiohead album.In our generation, they don't come much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where do we go from here?","review":"Radiohead's second album The Bends sent jaws dropping on both sides of the Atlantic. And for good reason. Fuelled by swaggering guitar hooks and soaring choruses, it recalls the infectious musings of The Beatles but with far more sinister and interesting undertones. Mixing balls to the wall rock (Planet Telex, Bones)with haunting ballads (Fake Plastic Trees, Nice Dream), the material here is completely accessible however Yorke's anguished lyrics and unsettling voice ensured Radiohead could not be snared by clumsy commercial types. Indeed, the sheer quality of the material meant no promotion save listener satisfaction was needed. Disgustingly good, The Bends stakes a serious claim for the best record of the 1990's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Radiohead cd","review":"This is definitely the best Radiohead cd, even though the others are good also. It's best to listen to it at once, as one song flows to another. The first time I heard it, I just listen a few seconds of each song and thought nothing of it, but later when I heard it at once, it blew me away. Thom Yorks singing is tremendous and the song writing skills are worth an A+. Not too many bands can write as many good songs as Radiohead on one album. Definitely a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!","review":"Thom Yorke has more talent in his little finger than most bands have collectively! What can I say, I think this CD is brilliant in every respect, writing, vocals, instrumentation, and that magical characteristic you can't define! It will definitely put you in another world, where everything is urgent and there is no escape from the unfulfilled longing. I like OKC a little better, but this one is a must have, and I would rate it in my top 10 all time favorites. Don't even think of not getting this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta get this album","review":"I got this after OK Computer, and it blew me away. Fade Out is one of the greatest songs I have ever heard. The Bends is a really groovy track that will keep your head jammin. And Trees is an unbelieveable piece of music, given that the lyrics are nothing more than abstract poetry. A very poetic, complex album. Black Star has the best lyrics, but the album itself cannot even compare to anything else. A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Radiohead","review":"I just started listening to Radiohead about a year ago. In my opinion this is a their best CD.

Radiohead and The Bends are really good because the instruments work great with nice vocals. When the album first takes off its enjoyable and by the end I didnt want to end, the CD is fulfilling. I'd say that every song serves a purpose and the Album never drags. A solid Album, fun to listen to, and worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accessible introduction to Radiohead","review":"I'm quite glad I chose this album to introduce me to Radiohead's music. After owning it for a while now, I would say that it's a very good place for people who are new to the band to start. It was on this 1995 release that Radiohead start to reinvent themselves from being a fairly unremarkable nineties alternative rock band, to becoming an ambitious art-rock band like no other. 'The Bends' does a fantastic job of treading the thin line between relatively accessible rock and the sweeping progressive rock of Radiohead's later music and the shift between the two genres is quite apparent. The songs here manage to be quite ambitious, and still palatable at the same time. Some fantastic music to be found here. Better still, there are hints of bigger things waiting in Radiohead's future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second best album of Radiohead without a doubt","review":"First I got say that my favorite radiohead song is on this album and that song is HIGH AND DRY!!!! Other great songs include in order of best song are Fake plastic trees, Just, Planet Telex, Black star, Bullet Proof I wish I was My iron lung, Sulk, Street Spirit, The Bends and i really didn't like any of the other tracks that much. A lot of people here say that Ok computer was their best album and I couldn't agree more especially with songs like Airbag, Karma Police, Let Down, Lucky and my 2nd favorite RADIOHEAD song right after HIGH AND DRY, PARANIOD ANDRIOD!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm...well...yeah...","review":"Did BORNTOLIE \\"B\\" (see prior review from 7/16/05) mean to post, verbatim, Rolling Stone's review of this? Or is this a peculiar coincidence?Anyhow, this is a great album. Great, great, great.'Nice Dream' is marvelous. Yeah. This album encompasses all that is good about Radiohead. I recommend this album above their others for the Radiohead newbie. Their later stuff is heavier and more abstract and, in my opinion, more well-suited for the fan who intends to stick with Radiohead for the long term. Just my personal opinion, so disregard it if you wish.This album contains beauty, horror, soaring happiness, indifference, choking sadness, feelings of stagnation, hope, fear, and a thousand other emotions. It will stay with you long after the last words of the last song fade out (pun intended) and you'll just have to listen to it again...and again. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"Apart from OK computer how do you better the Bends? Buy this and listen to \\"Killer Cars\\" and the beautiful \\"How Can You Be Sure?\\".This extraordinary album is made fantastic by the additons. \\"HCYBS?\\" is like \\"Fake Plastic Trees Part II\\" and \\"Killer Cars\\" fits in snugly with \\"The Bends\\" and \\"Planet Telex\\".Still cant believe they were omitted from the final selection.

They're a moderized version of u2..nothing more...nothing less."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 years, it's still quite good!","review":"After the bad 1st impression we got on Pablo Honey, Radiohead started anew with one of the best albums of 1995. This is the beginning of the sound that Radiohead is known for. There are mostly guitars on this, but here they just started experimenting with electronics. Planet Telex is a good example. It could be mistaken for Bjork. That is, until you hear Thom's whiny yet also beatiful voice. The best songs are High and Dry, a very catchy alternative song, Fake Plastic Trees, their most known single, Nice Dream, a very moody song with a killer guitar break, Just, a very good rock song, and Street Spirit, the sad ender.So, why 4 stars? 3 songs bother me. Bulletproof is out of place. We don't need another acoustic song. There's about 5 on the album. Black Star is too early 90's R.E.M to me (I never liked them), and I never got into Sulk. But it's still a fine album, and a great starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not better than Pablo Honey or O.K. Computer but good!","review":"The songs in this album are good songs. \\"Planet Telex\\", \\"High & Dry\\", \\"Just\\" and \\"My Iron Lung\\" are my favourite songs. I realize that this album wasn't as successful as \\"Pablo Honey\\" and \\"O.K. Computer\\" but lots of people think this album is the best because it has 5 hit singles (More singles then their other 2 albums). I like 3 of the 5 hit singles; I don't really like \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" and \\"Street Spirit\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST DAMN RADIOHEAD CD","review":"Just what I said before.

I got Computer first, and didn't think anything could top it, but The Bends might have. The point is, buy both of these albums. It could change your life; it's that powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"power of radiohead","review":"so let's see...you record this small little record named 'Pablo Honey' and one song off of it connects with the disgrunted, disillusioned and otherwise pathetic (but quite numerous) American lads. You become famous but are starting to wear thin because you could be filling the 'One Hit Wonder' cliche. What do you do? you make a record which destroys every preconception that everyone else had of you. Hell, there's even a song on the album which mocks 'Creep' (do you know which one?) No other album I can think of gives you the sonic attack that Radiohead does with their three guitar lineup. Yet for all the harshness in here, the simple songs stand out the most... I never liked 'Creep' or 'My Iron Lung' anyhow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent vinyl LP","review":"LP was packed safely & shipped fast the sound quality is excellent, of course your sound system is a major determination on how well it sounds. I'm a mid-range price audiophile, I'm spinning on a Audio-Technica AT-LP120 USB, to a ONKYO Receiver and I am very happy with the sound.

So, I'll do a track by track review on the songs I've heard.High and Dry:10/10 nice little pop songFake Plastic Trees:10/10 i remember vividly seeing this video on much music and thinking \\"What the f*** was that s***!?\\" I thought it was so odd, that I'd never get into Radiohead, but after a few more listens, I was hooked.Bones:10/10 Underrated, a good rocker with odd lyricsJust:10/10 One of my personal favorites, the video is great and so is the songmy Iron Lung:10/10 my favorite, very memorable riff at the begining.Street Spirit(Fade Out):10/10 very gloomy and beutiful song with a great riff and great lyrics.So, there you have it, all the songs I've heard from \\"The Bends\\".

When I first heard this record in 1995, I was stunned that the band that recorded a so-so Pablo Honey had followed it up with an excruciatingly beautiful, heartbreaking album like The Bends. The first single, Fake Plastic Trees literally reduced me to tears...it still hurts. But not to say that there is not hope among the angst...some anthemic songs here. Plus you have the rest of the album- all pushing music forward in terms of songwriting and technical innovation. Stunning. What much more can I say about this album? Probably that I would defend this album like it was a small, helpless child to the death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Album","review":"Radiohead's 2nd album, The Bends, is more guitar-friendly than OK Computer or Kid A. It also has some of their greatest songs. Fake Plastic Trees and High and Dry are the most well-known. However, My Iron Lung, Planet Telex, and The Bends are other solid songs. The entire album is solid -- one that can be listened to without skipping a single track. It just amazes me how this group can put out a great album like this and then follow it up with an even greater release in OK Computer. Not as innovative as OK Computer, The Bends is still a highly-recommended album and one that will stand the test of time. It is not an exaggeration to say that the top 2 albums of the '90's are OK Computer and The Bends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has to be in the top 10 cd's of the last 20 years!","review":"This cd has spirit! It takes you on a mental journey like only a few other albums can do. If you like a \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" journey through your mind get the cd immediately! As far as pure creative genius, Thom Yorke is at the top of the heap. Others can show genius for a song or two, but Thom can pull it off for a whole cd! OK Computer might be a little better but both of these are better than Radiohead's later efforts, Kid A and Amnesiac, in my opinion. So far I just can't follow Thom in the direction he's gone after OK Computer, although the critics and many fans don't seem to have this problem. Anyway, you owe it to yourself to get The Bends and OK Computer, there really hasn't been anything in the last twenty years that competes with these two albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Ten of the 1990's","review":"The Bends is Radiohead's finest effort to date. The band's progressive rock melodies and hardrocking undertones combined with Thom Yorke's voice makes this album a true 90's best of. Lush melodies and vocals on songs such as \\"plastic trees\\" mixed with true rockers like \\"just\\" makes this album a rollercoaster ride of how to write great songs. Their rumored 2000 effort can come soon enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"there is no in-between","review":"this is my first radiohead album and my first step into the world and mind of radiohead and into the fan base that is super anti- everything but radiohead- and i see why, and i should have found the Bends much sooner than i did. but for the record there is no good and bad with radiohead. this is what makes amazing musicians and this is the fundamantal ingredient that bonds amazing musicians into an amazing, inspirational and beyond-its-time band. and with radiohead there is no good and bad; there is only love and hate. and this is made absolutely evident from every review ever written about radiohead. take a look! for every review for this album on amazon, there is only five stars and one stars. there is rarely anything that constitutes as in-between. and that is why radiohead is a phenomenal and beyond its time band that everyone needs to discover even if they don't love it, b/c that won't matter, because i do."},{"rating":"2","title":"the epitome of perfection","review":"the best of the best. this cd is perfect in every way. i can't describe it any more. it is perfection!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bending The Rules","review":"After experiencing commercial success with their first album, Radiohead moved away from the mainstream with their second release, The Bends. The album is a richly textured collage of swirling guitars and multi-layered instrumentation that harkens back to the prog-rock days of Yes & Jethro Tull, but with a modern twist. Instead of being propelled by the commercial success Thom Yorke followed his own muse and the band created one of more compelling albums of 1995. From the acoustic tones of the lush \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" to the driving \\"My Iron Lung\\", The Bends offers an intense listening experience that challenges you, but in the end entertains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead, Bring It On","review":"Look, I don't [care] what anyone else thinks or says, I just reckon that this is one of the absolute best, and most emotionally charged CD's that I have ever owned.

They play British rock, but it has an American sound, due to it's flaming guitars and amazing vocals. Unlike their first album \\"Pablo Honey,\\" (which I recommend too), each track is different. Every single song one this album is great, and could have been released as singles. Radiohead creatively mixes their rock tastes to form a new sound, sometimes mellow, but frequently hard and driving. They are masters at creating vocal-guitar voicings, and make incredible melody-makers. I think \\"The Bends\\" has not recieved the recognition it should have. If people liked OK Computer, (which I did not like as much) then they will absolutely love this. I don't really recommend albums all too often, but this one deserves it, and I really hope you try it.

Although this band is based in New York City, Nick stays true to his Texas roots along with rest of a fine band. Fiddles, pedal steel and sweet vocals make for fine listening. And for a treat, there a few Cajun tunes with Nick playing accordian, reminiscent of Joseph Falcon.Some stand out tracks include: the uptempo honkytonk tunes \\"Woman Knows No Heartache\\" and \\"Reckless Heart\\", the ballad \\"No Kind of Life\\", and the Cajun tunes \\"N'oublie-Moi Pas\\" and \\"Bon A Rein\\"Do yourself a favor and pick this up now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far to small!!","review":"Well if you want to make teenie tiny loaves of baby breads maybe!

We didn't attach the top portion to assure ease of access. The dowel and cam method generally used in this type of furniture often will suffice. However in this case the frame was adequately held together, but the drawers/cabinet doors were very poorly aligned. The bottom cabinet doors are held by a screwed in plate with an upright pin. The matching portion is screwed to the cabinet door edge and sits over the pin. The drawers came with the rails attached to the sides but the ones inside the cabinet had to be screwed into place. The pieces fit together so poorly the drawers actually catch sometimes when a lower cabinet door is open. If you life up when shutting a drawer the cabinet door on the right hand side will pop open.

This movie is also known as Londinium (which by the way is the name of the book a character writes).This was a pretty predictable movie. Not one that I would classify as a Romantic Comedy.

However, Mariel Hemingway was not.Colin plays a TV producer of one of the hottest shows in Britain who is married to the shows star (Mariel Hemingway). A TV writer is acquired from America. He of course lusts after the Star.

It's a simple nylon-canvas strap with multiple loops that allow you to literally stretch out your entire body and works wonders on stiff muscles and joints. The beauty of this product is that it allows you to stretch safely and with control over how much tension you apply when going thru the various routines. With the accompanying DVD and illustrated instruction manual it couldn't be easier.I tore my achilles tendon and after surgery and some time in a cast and on crutches followed by an ortho-boot it was on to physical therapy. This is how I came to use the product and immediately went online to buy one for home use. The price is just right and whether you're fit and active or rehabbing from an injury it is a practical and effective way to really get a great overall stretch, a key to avoiding, sprains and tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense...","review":"Immortal Technique goes above and beyond with his material.

This is just another attempt by the American lefts and the extremists in the hip hop purist movement to push their beliefs on the rest of us and to politicize music and entertainment in general even further. These songs are just plain terrible. The beats suck, Tech's performance is awful, and his topics are boring. This isn't music, this is a propaganda tape and nothing more. I will give Tech props for his lyrics but this album is just awful, boring, lame, and poorly produced, his lyrics just can't save it."},{"rating":"2","title":"...the definition of Hip-Hop","review":"Again, as I say about Dead Prez. This is the roots of the traditional Hip-Hop as laid out by The Last Poets and Gil Scott Heron in 1970, and carried on by KRS, Public Enemy, amongst others.Everything this guy says is VERy well thought out and well researched, perhaps the BEST of the new meat, and perhaps one of the best of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary begins.","review":"I heard Revolutionary Vol. 2 first and was so impressed by that album that I had to hear what his debut was about. After listening to it for several months, I must say its a very good cd. The only reason that it is not as good as Vol. 2 is because there is some choppiness to it, where it just doesn't flow easily. This was probably because he wrote the entire album locked up with no music and he had to piece it together to make it fit. There are only a few instances where this is notable, but the rest is worth the price. Some of the songs are so good I just wanna throw it in right now while writing about it. If you've listened to and liked Revolutionary Vol. 2, than this is a MUST have, I'm not kidding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Debut","review":"Volume 2 certainly is Tech's best work to date, but his debut, Volume 1, is substantially solid. While there are quite a few gems here (peep \\"Positive Balance\\" and \\"Dance With the Devil\\"), the album's flow does suffer from a degree of choppiness. Some of these tracks feel misplaced and underproduced, which is understandable given the way Tech is said to have collected these tracks. Overall, however, this release is quite dope and will bump really well in your stereo. Make sure you don't sleep on Immortal Technique--the jump in quality from Volume 1 to Volume 2 is incredible, and he's only going to get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"spend your money on something that will last","review":"The bag on this thing broke after 3 months of use.

You have lost a customer for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible electrical connector","review":"Be aware---the electrical prongs do not hold the extension cord secure even when its wrapped around the plastic body hook. I still had to hold the cord while the blower was in use to keep it from slipping out. After using my new blower for only the second time, it burned a new extension cord and I broke one of the prongs trying to free the blower from the cord. Now the cord and the unit are useless, unless I can get Ryobi to make it good. Definately needs a better design. As a blower, works fine. Didn't use the mulcher feature, so can't comment on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"be very careful","review":"You must find some way to secure the extension cord.

And it does do a nice job at that. HOWEVER, the first time I used it the belt clip broke so I had to bend up a coat hanger to attach the strap. The 3rd time I use it the impeller broke and it started to vibrate so much that it could no longer be used. Ryobi doesn't exchange these, so it's off to the repair shop for several weeks for repair.

It's a good show, but I can understand why it was cancelled"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALiasing and I don't me the TV show.","review":"Watching this DVD without getting a headach and soar eyes is impossible. Throughout each episode there is aliasing. (for non-graphic type that means jagging edges) It not only happens to characters but also the back ground the foreground, lets just say some of the best episodes you cannot watch. Ex. You Only Lick Twice.This was one of my favorite shows and I was looking forward to its DVD release, but guess what the vhs copies I recorded are better viewing and still have the original theme score, which they removed from the DVD.All in all this transfer is awful, don't buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stripped of all claims","review":"[...]First, the disks are defective.

The Kid Rock theme used when it aired on TV was one of its great features.I recommend you DON'T buy this and wait until the technical and political issues are corrected. You can get all this rubbish on K*Z*A for FREE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"First it's not uncensored, close but not completely, take note of the scene with the chief having pictures of him in his birthday suit in one of the early episodes. A key area is pixilated, being a guy that did not bother me at all but it does say uncensored. They easily could have had an obstruction just as they do whenever Stripperella is topless. Now the cartoons themselves have above average animation, though the episodes seem slightly softer after the first few, this is probably happened when the show went on hiatus in mid-season. The jokes and dialog does tend to be similar from episode to episode, different sexual innuendos but I found them enjoyable. Be warned these are not for the young and should be considered adult only material."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure gold","review":"The funny thing was, this show debuted on my birthday, and even though I'm a woman, I liked this show. It pokes fun at the stripping industry as well as the superhero/villain genre (Cheapo, Klinko) and the innuendos peppered throughout brought a chuckle to my face. Some of the dialog was horribly cheesy - but then you realize that it was intended to be that way. Overall, this was a musing romp, and I am just happy that they made a DVD boxset for this. It was well worth my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest show in a while","review":"First of all, Let me say I'm not a kid, I'm just too lazy to log in.With that out of the way,I'm surprised that this show got cancelled. It was very very funny. The jokes were witty and all the sexual innuendoes where hilarious. There were two other shows that appeared in the same block as this on Spike Tv-Gary The Rat and Ren & Stimpy. Gary the Rat was also funny, but the Revival of Ren & Stimpy as an adult show was very stupid. I recommend Stripperella to all people who have a dirty sense of humor and are 15 or older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Wretched","review":"Okay, from a historical perspective you might want to own this if you're fanatically interested in the roots of Yes' music, but come on.

We haven't tried to transfer files to the computer yet, to transcribe them into word files, though. One caveat - we emailed Olympus with a question and even though their web site said someone would reply within 48 hours, Olympus never did get back to us. Eventually, we found someone else (another visually impaired person) to answer the question. Having said that, this digital recorder is still a helpful tool for visually impaired users.

So you often get new experiences and because of the very exactly descriptions of the different places and the caracters you can identify yourself with the whole story, you go with the persons very attentif and you are seizing until the last pages. But sometimes the many descriptions get you bored a bit..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you on the edge of your seat","review":"Rarely do you find such a compelling story as this. I was a little disappointed that Mr. Ripley wasn't apprehended. Although this is what makes a good novel, when you are so into it and can't control the outcome. It is chilling to think Mr. Ripley can do these horrendous acts with such daring calm. I haven't seen the movie, but am looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating...","review":"My interest in the Thomas Ripley saga was first piqued by the movie of the same name which was quite fun to watch. But the power of the book lies in what Matt Damon cannot, despite his superb acting, illumine: what is happening inside Ripley's mind.The book begins by establishing Ripley's character, and some of his past, and continues on to the story of how impoverished Tom Ripley hobnobs with the wealthy Dickie Greenleaf, murders him, assumes Dickie's identity, and escapes the clutches of justice, if barely. The story itself is rivetting, rife with detail that brings Europe alive. But the most fascinating part is the case study into the mind of a nihilist, and I feel this work to be on par with the another great study of nihilism: Dostoyevsky's \\"Crime and Punishment\\".Bottom line: read it, but don't expect the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely mesmerizing","review":"\\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" was spellbinding.....Patricia Highsmith wrote this novel brilliantly - full of suspense, macabre humour, everything. I know this is a trite phrase, but in this case....I found it true: I could hardly put this book down. Like other readers who have commented on this book, I found myself NOT wanting Tom to get caught. Horrible, rooting for a criminal, eh! But, I discovered that I pitied him and somehow liked him, despite his evils. Another of the author's novels, \\"Strangers on a Train\\" came alive wonderfully on the silver screen. It will be interesting to see how \\"Ripley\\" appears on film. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Talented Ms. Highsmith","review":"I just completed the book, and I found it amazing. It kept me riveted throughout and I never felt bored. It was nice too that it wasn't a very long book, but long enough to make you enjoy it. The characters are great and the story was wonderfully written. Patricia Highsmith was an amazing author. I can't wait to read the others in the series. I can't wait to see the movie, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I had only heard positive things regarding this book, but all I can say is that I found it to be an incredible waste of my time. I hated Tom Ripley, not because he was evil or manipulative, but because he was whiny and boring. He complained about the most inane things and if I had to spend any length of time with him, I would have killed myself! I think the basic plot - one man wanting another's life - was original and could have made for an interesting read, but I had trouble staying focused from the beginning. I did not care about any of the characters or their fates. I only finished it because I kept waiting for it to get exciting and, dare I say, dangerous. Tom Ripley is not a frightening psycopath; he is a bore whose life is more uninteresting in fiction than mine is in realtiy."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre fiction","review":"Mr. Ripley may be talented, but Patricia Highsmith is not. The writing is something a third grader could concoct (Dickie wanted to go by Marge's house to see if she was still there. They climbed some steps from the main road up the side of a stone wall, crossed part of somebody's garden, and climbed more steps.\\" The characters are unbelievable (Dickie's parents, Marge, even Dickie and Tom), and the plot is boring. Who cares if Tom can talk Dickie into going back to the USA and be a drudge in his father's business? Not me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again Hollywood Mangles Authors Intentions","review":"After seeing The talented Mr. Ripley on the big screen and feeling Incredibly disappointed, I turned to the novel to see if it was any better. The book sweeps you up in the twisted mind of Tom Ripley without all the politically correct apologies made for his charachter in the film. He doesn't kill out of self defense. He kills to move up in the world. He is clear calm and caluculating in the book. Compared to his easily flustered movie counter-part. There is an open ending to the book that suggest sequal (which I am now reading). The biggest joy about this book for me is its true to life statemets that Good doesn't always triumph and crime often does pay. Thank you Patricia. As for Hollywood please at least read the books you make movies from."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unlikable Mr. Ripley","review":"'The Talented Mr. Ripley' is a well-written story with a completely unlikeable main character. I suppose the title is meant to reflect on Mr. Ripley's ability to con and exploit other people ... which, I guess, could be perceived as a talent. I was not amused or awed by his 'talent'. I found Mr. Ripley to be selfish, insensitive, cruel and insane. Highsmith is an excellent writer, but I failed to connect with her character. I like to be able to relate with and actually appreciate the characters I read about. There was absolutely nothing about Mr. Ripley that I found remotely likable or intriguing. He exploits others and kills them when they have outlived their use. With his victims silenced he goes on to live their lives by using their identities and money to move on to the next victim. No silver lining. No justice served. In book one, he simply walks away, free to ruin someone else's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"eerily haunting","review":"to get it right out in the open, this book is very different from the movie. both are excellent stories, yet the storylines split halfway through. this book is a true thriller- though not as intense as most. its effect is more sublime and chilling. the gore is there, yet its presence is understated. the true thrilling nature of this book comes from the ability highsmith has of causing you to sympathize- almost empathize- with tom. she constructs his maniacal thoughts so subtly yet delivers them so matter-of-factly that you almost feel you're betraying tom each time you remind yourself that he's really insane! his thought process is logical; his ability to rationalize his actions is arcane.truly a \\"literary hall of mirrors\\" (taken from the back cover yet dead-on), highsmith turns the table 180 degrees on good and evil- almost without your noticing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest of all crime novels","review":"The superiority of Patricia Highsmith's novel to the recent Anthony Minghella film adaptation of it almost goes without saying: the homoerotic subtext of the film is here (unsurprisingly) laid bare, making the novel infintely richer aned more disturbing. Highsmith's novel is really a disquisittion on how identities are constructed: by objects, by friends, by official papers, and above all by writing. Part of its genius is bringing you inside Tom Ripley's very strange little mind so that his murders, by the time they occur, seem thoroughly logical and almost justifiable (which is part of Highsmith's moral genius). It's also a brilliant study of the manners of wealthy Americans abroad during the postwar period."},{"rating":"1","title":"very stupid novel","review":"This is a very stupid book it shows us how to be a criminal, it is dangerous for society, because you can learn to cheat carabinieri, polizia and guardia finanzia. The cheater is the hero in this book , like in the right life . Highsmith knows very well the laws and the systems of the country, so the book is very clever written. it is an outstanding thriller which has deservedly become a classic the book is very funny more funny than Peach Weber ( a local Swiss comedian), cleverer than Sherlock Holmes, more evil than joker and penguin but more beautiful than Verona Feldbusch more intellligent than Einstein and more thrillering than Hitchcock"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I picked this up one day after hearing about the upcoming movie. seemed intriquing....it is! this will be my pick for an upcoming book club choice. I want to share it with my friends"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just marvelous.","review":"I have read so many books, and I am eager to call this one the best, followed by \\"Patrick Süskind - The Perfume\\".Patricia Highsmith created one of the best criminal novels I have ever read. Partly because off her unique way to describe, e.g. when Tom Ripley, the protagonist, murders somebody. These scenes are told so cool and distant, its like if she was talking about going to the supermarket on Saturday morning. It sometimes gave me a chill, because I could not let go off this masterpiece - I just had to go on reading and find out what this psychopath was going to do next to continue being \\"A FAKE SOMBODY, THAN A REAL NOBODY\\", as he justifies his actions!It has been a great experience for me to read this novel and I recommend it to anybody who has a brain to think and eyes to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taut, gripping, and you root for the anti-hero","review":"Where has this book been for the last 45 years? Amazingly, Patricia Highsmith weaves a story that is just as fresh and believable today as when she published it in 1955. The characters are compelling, intriguing, and as a reader you find yourself snared in the ever deepening complexities that Mr. Ripley faces. Also, I found myself facinated by and amazingly sympathetic to Tom Ripley, at times even rooting for him against the established, moneyed, empty cultured lifestyle he both despises and longs for.In addition, the ending is a bit unexpected, but one I had secretly hoped for...it will be hard for the movie to top this piece of fiction. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"James? Nabokov? Nah.","review":"Are Italy's police really the world's worst? Is Dickie's dad really that stupid? Is Marge really that naive? Who hires a detective who can't speak Italian to solve a murder in Italy? It's pretty hard to swallow.Not bad, but there's much more interesting stuff out there than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Bad Thoughts Articulated Well","review":"Here is Tom Ripley on a steep learning curve of self-discovery; one which he passes with flying colours (all things considered), without recoiling from the chilling implications of this knowledge (although he doesn't exactly embrace it outright). What makes this such a rare literary feat is the calm and measured tone sustained throughout the novel by Highsmith, minus any hyperbole, as Ripley comes to terms with that high-functioning psychosis which will power the rest of this series.In less capable hands, Ripley's character would grate after a short while, and it's a testament to Highmsith's talent that his emptiness and petty ambition is oddly moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Ripley","review":"This is my favorite in the \\"Ripley\\" series because the intricate plot is so tightly worked it is impossible to put down and after reading you must find another Ripley book to see what he is up to.The film version with Matt Damon is a case of perfect casting and an example of quality film making. This is a must read (the book) AND view (the movie).Never a dull moment when reading any of the Ripley books. If you like the Ripley books, you're sure to like her short stories, she is a master of psychological suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unlikeable Mr. Ripley","review":"Good crime novel by Patric Highsmith, who created the fascinating character of Tom Ripley. Ripley is not a likeable character- he is an amoral, whiny, phony, petty thief, and eventually a murderer. I didn't like Ripley, but every time it seemed that he might get caught, to my surprise I found myself hoping he would squirm out of it. Not an easy tightrope to walk, to make the reader sympathize with an unsympathetic character, but Highsmith pulls it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope the movie was better.......","review":"I haven't seen the movie yet, but I honestly hope that it was better than this book. It dragged tremendously, and for $13 dollars the book was too short. I lost interest numerous times, but I was determined to finish it. This is definitely not one of those books that you would like to read a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars? Really?","review":"I can't believe I am such a minority here. I have never been so bored or annoyed by a book. I did finish the book, though, sure something spectacular must be coming to somehow justify its publication. Several of the reviewers have complimented the story as subtle. I can only imagine they are only using \\"subtle\\" as a euphemism for \\"boring.\\" Subtle it isn't: a summary: Tom Ripley is physically and mentally soft, weak, and afraid. Then Tom has a brief moment of unbelievable strength, cleverness, and drive. Then he takes a rest. Then repeat. The rest of the book may as well be a series of ditto marks. One review quotes the writer Hightower as saying about herself that her books are considered high literature by European critics. I assume this is Robert Blake-style self-promotion; if not, it is enough to encourage cultural ethnocentricity in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm half way through and too bored to finish the book","review":"this book is slow and boring. its hard for me to even get through a few pages without falling asleep. as an avid reader, i haven't run across a book this boring in years. i'm still trying to get through this book just because i paid $13.00 for it and also to see if it'll get any better. i hope it does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strongly disappointing! Totally unacceptable!","review":"Aside from asenseless plot of touring the reader from one Italian city to theother, Tom's characterization is nowhere near what I expected (based on what I have read from other viewers/readers). He is nothing more than a scheming, envious, social climber, loser --- rather than a hero as others claim him to be. Most importantly, I find it despicable for the author to come up with an ending such as the one in the book. Where has her moral & social responsibilities gone? I am not a fundamentalist nor a right-wing individiual, but by creating the ending, the author condones evil in the society instead of bringing up justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, dull, tedious and absolutely not scary","review":"OK, first of all, Ripley is a loser. The initial image I had of him in my mind, before I started the book, was that of a middle aged man- a genius psychopath who lives alone and spends his time plotting and killing people. You know, the regular serial killer type? But it turned out that Ripley is actually a 25 year old lazy guy who is in no way 'talented'. The whole storyline of the book centers around Ripley trying to bring a rich playboy back home. How sad is that?The book is incredibly boring. I am an avid reader and I couldn't read past the 100th page. All the characters here are dull and lifeless and none of them evoked my sympathy. I cannot imagine how anyone can ever like this book, much less call it a classic. I was not even remotely gripped or even slightly disturbed/ scared. Ripley's actions seemed cheap and cowardly to me rather sinister and scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated?","review":"I got about half way into the book then had to put it down.

I am most impressed with the fact that this writer/illustrator somehow allowed her voice to come through, without it souding as though she were standing on a soapbox. Many ideas, and perspectives, from many different cultures, and time periods are shared, and all of it is comfortably digestable.

Actually, in this band's case, this is not an improvement, even though Brian Wilson himself probably intended the recordings to be mono. The mono recordings are very muddy and one cannot hear the details of the songs as well as on the stereo versions. The CD booklet is somewhat improved and the songs have been restored to chronological order. This is a nice try, but it really does not add anything to existing catalog. Capitol faces a monumental task in restoring the Beach Boys back catalogue and I'm afraid that this CD was just treading water. Endless Summer has been deleted as well as most of the original albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete","review":"This was a good enough compilation in its day, but it has been replaced by the far superior Sounds of Summer collection, released in 2003. This CD only gives the listener 20 songs and has a downright meager running time of 49 minutes. SoS has 30 songs and runs for over 70 minutes. The only songs found here and not on SoS are \\"409\\" and \\"Catch a Wave\\".Add this to the fact that Sounds of Summer is frequently on sale, and there's no reason to go back to this outdated collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Good Good","review":"Come on, the Beach Boys' music is irresistable. You may not think that you have to own a greates hits by them and it may seem a little cheesy, but you should. Now that the summer is here, you can roll the window down and sing your heart out to some of the best songs ever written. Some greates hits packages only contain some of your favorites, but in this collection, they are all here. Trust me, after buying this you will be more satisfied than buying most anything else this year. Remember, you can always count on the BB for a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Of Their Career Making Hits","review":"The people who made these greatest hits discs split the songs up into two catergories: 1st greatest hits is all of their good songs that they are known for such as surfing songs, car songs, etc. 2nd greatest hits is for good songs that aren't as famous, but I'll talk about them in the review for that CD. This CD you can listen to beginning to end. It's really interesting to see how the Beach Boy matured in their songs and they broadened their horizons and vocal talents and added different instruments to get such songs as \\"Good Vibrations,\\" (Love the Vocals) \\"God Only Knows,\\" \\"Dance, Dance, Dance,\\" \\"Sloop John B,\\" and \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice.\\" The CD has a nice finish with \\"Kokomo.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Hits and Great Fun","review":"Everyone loves the Beach Boys, but not everyone can be a fanatic. For those of us who are casual fans and don't need to own every album, but love to tap our toes and sing along to their big hits, this CD is great!Every song on this CD is easily recognizable, you don't have to wade through any filler to get to the classics you really love.This album is perfect mood music for driving, working in the yard or the garage on a sunny day, or just having fun celebrating a good mood.There's a perfect mix here of happy upbeat songs, and slow beautiful balads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good album for a good price","review":"These are beach boys songs that everyone seems to know by heart.

They are found on Vol.2, as well as the great classic \\"Endless Summer\\" CD.\\"Vol. 1\\" is not even close to a complete Beach Boy's collection...get \\"Vol. 2\\" with it, or BETTER YET.. forget \\"Vol.1\\" and \\"Vol. 2\\" and just get \\"Endless Summer\\" along with \\"Pet Sounds\\" and you will have a great collection of Beach Boys songs.If all you have is \\"Vol. 1\\", you are not at all getting the full picture. It would be like buying only part one of a two part movie DVD.(By the way, I also happen to think \\"Surf's Up\\" from 'Smile\\" is essential. That one song ALONE is worth the price of \\"Smile\\".)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Band Deserves Much Better Than This","review":"Another awkward collection from Capitol. The non-hit versions of \\"School\\" and \\"Rhonda\\" as well as sequencing that does not make any sense. The band made so much money for Capitol in the 60s and deserves a better collection than this. The whole catalogue is a shame. All of the twofer CDs are out of print. Most of the original albums are out of print, as well. This band deserves to be remembered for more than just Endless Summer and Pet Sounds. What remains of the Beach Boys' catalog is the tip of a very large iceberg of fine music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Putting Filet Mignon In A Meat Grinder","review":"This is a record company which does not have a clue about this group. Granted the music is remastered but this collection does not make sense. It is not organized either topically or chronologically. The cover artwork remains horrible. Real Beach Boys fans already have most, if not all of these songs already. For some of these surfing and car songs, this is the ninth go-round on a CD collection. Capitol needs to rerelease the two-fer collections pressed in the early 90s, restore the Warner Brothers material, not put together another hits anthology. The Beach Boys were one of the greatest groups of the 60s and a groundbreaking vocal group. This release does not do their career the proper respect it deserves. Come on, Capitol, let's get your act together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD...","review":"THEY DID A GREAT JOB SELECTIN' THE SONGS THAT ARE PART OF THIS ALBUM-- BUT THE SOUND Is JUST TERRIBLE!oO MAYBE THAT'S HOW THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO SOUND-BUT I COULDN'T KNOWN THAT-I'M JUST 16yos."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing and mood enhancing","review":"All those non Indian audience swept away by the Slumdog Rahman experience HAS to listen to this album to realize the potential of Mr. Rahman. Slumdog really seems like a fairly ordinary creation compared to this. No wonder we were so pleasantly surprised when it was slumdog that made Rahman known! It was hardly his best.Dil Se has 5 rocking songs - each one of them varied, amazing and timeless. Chaiyya Chaiyya is already known as part of Inside Man soundtrack too. My personal favorite is the song Dil Se sung by Rahman himself.Also once you savor the beauty of the audio, do try to get mesmerized by the visuals of the song and the movie itself (although the movie itself was not a box office hit, but a wonderful film according to me)Also check out the soundtrack of Rahman's first feature film- Roja (in Hindi or Tamil).

His voice flows with today's dance and electronica. A welcome soloist in the tradition of The Pet Shop Boys, but much more layered and enriched with his falsetto vocal ranges. Only the British could produce an operatic quality male singer as the \\"pushing 40\\"- but still with vision- Jimmy Somerville. A tenor with eurodisco in his blood, and even though eurodisco is getting a bad rap these days, Jimmy proves with all of these tracks that he's got \\"Something To Live For\\"... for \\"This Must Be Love\\". A beautiful man with unmatched vocals and talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging heads up","review":"This is a heads-up about a potential flaw in packaging. On the set that I received from Amazon every disk had a filmy layer on it that was sufficient to interfere with playing. The disks cleaned up and are playing fine but the film soon returned. I think it is the cheap cases provided. They are leaching plastic material of some kind onto the disks themselves.

Not only is Cruver's writing crisp and concise, but the book has a wide range of emotions to help you feel engaged throughout. It is scary, funny and sad all rolled into one reading experience. I watched Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room and felt that didn't compare to reading this book. It's weird, you almost feel as if you are Cruver's friend, even if you have never met him based on the intimacy of this book. In all, a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unshed the truth","review":"My viewpoints on this book come from a very different angle then most reviews. I am only in 8th grader and the author of this book is the husband of my cousin. Im probably about 40 pages from the end and am actually enjoying the book. Some things go over my head, but I find it very interesting to see what actually happened. I think it's cool to see what it was like for someone who wasn't involved in all the lying and what it was like to be part of the company. I have learned a lot so far from reading this book and I highly recommend it to everyone else. P.S. If you carefully read the title, it is very clever, get it the Unshredded truth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it! Memorable book.","review":"Written very well. Extremely funny and gives you a true insider's look into the infamous Enron. The author has a great sense of humor about life, considering he was on the inside, making great money, and soon found himself jobless in the wake of the scandals. I give him extra credit for landing on his feet by writing this book! He explains some of the extreme cockiness and spend-thrift ways of his coworkers and his mysterious, anonymous mentor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opportunistic writing","review":"It is very obvious from the first chapters that Cruver wrote this book to cash in on the Enron story. He would most likely not deny it since he relates himself how he tried to sell internal company-wide emails on e-bay, but just don't buy this book thinking you'll learn the underworld of Enron, or any new information at all.As another reader mentioned, he joined Enron during its last year of existence, and not in a key position within the company. Although he does a good job at displaying the corporate attitude of Enronians, he's not sheding any new lights on the subject. The book is mostly descriptive, not explanatory: there is no real analysis about what went wrong.The audio CDs made my commute more exciting, but you could learn more about Enron in one WSJ article."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very junior writer - knows almost nothing","review":"The author was on his second year after graduating from MBA program, when he spent 9 (I got this from another review) months at Enron. Sadly, he would know nothing for a fact of what was going on at the top of the company. Good news, he does not really hide this fact. Bad news, the book is just that: what would it be like to be at Enron during the last days, when you are a junior guy. I think this has value to some readers, hence 2 stars. Just don't look for any analysis or explanations or insights, and you would be fine reading it. There is some over-reaching in the book, when the author tries to convey that he knows more than he really does. But for the most part you get the right impression: it's the bystander saying \\"holly cow!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anatomy of Greed","review":"As a former Enron employee, I was excited to hear that an insider was about to proclaim the truth about what went on inside Enron. Unfortunately, this book misses the mark--by no fault of his own but because he simply was not with the company long enough (9 months). By the time Cruver arrived at Enron, the wheels on the wagon were already falling off. Cruver was not a Trader but a marketing specialist / product developer which is very different. I'm still waiting for The Book, one written by a real insider. Although well written, it is more filler than substance (e.g. the Cow Parade) and by the way Skilling didn't quit because of Teeside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memoirs of a Carpetbagger","review":"Only published because it was first on the scene; given the author was an apparently unemployed junior credit-derivatives salesman (who had worked at Enron for just a few months before it went bankrutp, and who continued to receive paychecks for not showing up for some time thereafter) at the time, it's not too surprising he had the time to jump right on writing it. Kudos to him for exploiting the opening, but there's not much of value here, and the book is marred by the author's racism and sexism. The made-for-TV movie is actually better than the book, which says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done memoir","review":"Normally I am disappointed by \\"insider\\" books, which tend to be poorly written. This one was a pleasant surprise. It described vividly the experience of working at Enron, and the rape of the company, the employees, and the shareholders by top management, as seen from the view of an employee. It is well written, and Cruver manages to convey the essence of the businesses and the misdeeds of personnel without becoming bogged down in fact, law, and accounting rules. This is not a book for the reader intent on following the details of those rules and the precise nature of the corporate misdeeds. It is, however, fast without being dumbed down, and provides a great view of the world of the employees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great satire or inept reporting?","review":"It is difficult to tell whether the author is presenting himself as a personification of the organization or really feels that he is helping readers understand the events during Enron's downfall.If you want to gain insight to the Enron mistakes, do not waste your time on this book. If you want a light laugh at the human values that destroyed the organization, the author's self-centered account will be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend","review":"Definitely an engaging read. And for that, I rate it a 4-stars, in spite of some negatives mentioned below. The book captures effectively, the plight of employees watching a highly reputed company implode. The author's analysis of the situation of his co-workers, higher-ups, whistle-blowers, etc. is quite effective. The confusion of outside parties exposed to Enron (investors, analysts, etc.) is personified by the author's friend who is a research analyst on Wall Street.However, the author was but an employee for 8 months, that too at a division that never took off (which kind of puts him low on the dashed-expectations scale). Plus, he was not directly exposed to the level of management that orchestrated various happenings. Nor does he have deep insights into Enron's relationship with its auditor and any ensuing commissions/omissions. These don't take away from the fact that the book is still a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"do mba's ever learn?","review":"This book is a waste of time.

Each towel is huge and both are still going strong after being washed at least once per week each for the past 5+ months. They were extremely absorbent and soft initially. The reason I took one star off is that they seem a little less soft and absorbent than initially but just mildly so. not sure if it's the detergent but I have only laundered with ivory snow or purex baby liquid. another plus, the gingham print has hardly faded at all which was a concern of mine prior to purchasing and receiving the towels.All in all a good buy, much better than the run of the mill pretty but not very absorbent baby towels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best One!","review":"This volume is very funny and it is mostly about Makoto.

This book I especially enjoyed because it was set in 13th century Scotland and it did have to do with Medival times. This book was a bit slow paced but it was adventerous all together. The thrilling account of Meg's childhood and her transition into adulthood knowing of her sister's magic and keeping her head straight.

Very consistent in flavor, tone and theme, and with a strong, likable female protagonist. Parts of the book, especially those relating childhood escapades, are light, homey, and warm, like reading a scene from Little Women. Other parts, such as the death of the king and the storm scene, are dark and suspenseful. The author does a marvelous job of creating a scene; the Scottish dialect, once you get used to it, draws you into her world. An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a good book...","review":"This book is utterly incredible. It was one of my very favorites when I was younger and is a unique, refreshing, and incredible mix of fiction and fact, history and magic and love.

The relationships and emotions from character to character are tangible. Overall a highly, highly recommended read.

The speed of the recording is off: too fast. If this were a cassette tape instead of a CD I probably would have thought the physical mechanism defective.

The clasp bent open the first time I picked it up. After dealing with that for a while, I just tied it on.

It did not adjust easily and was unpadded. As good as Ryobi is at designing value into its products, you'd think they would get the strap right. Frankly, I think it should be free with all stringtrimmers that they offer. Should I choose to purchase the Ryobi 825r, I may look around for an aftermarket replacement for the strap I have, since the 4-stroke 825r is reputed to be a little heavier than the 2-stroke I already have. So Ryobi...are you willing to risk losing a potential customer for your normally excellent products by producing (and including free) an optional but chinzy accessory?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing","review":"If you use your trimmer more than ten minutes at a time (not including the ten minutes you spent starting it), you may find this strap helpful. Once I had it adjusted, I found it took a lot of strain off of my right arm. My model came with a newer clip and is as flimsy as anything. After one season of weekly use the clip bent open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere","review":"My strap came with my Ryobi, and is not designed well. The clasping mechanism is simply not strong enough. The clasp seems to be made of aluminum, and bends when any pressure is placed against it.

Which is really lame, because Marineland also makes Emperor products, which last a lot longer and are much better designed.

While Shandril has increased in power, Narm has not (why?) and is more useless than ever. He reminds me of the typical 'helpless female' character so prevalent in books and movies.This book seems like an exercise in writing combat scenes, as Shandril kills all those who oppose her, over and over and over again. In addition, it makes little sense that various allies of Shandril and Narm have the ability to magically travel but never share that with them, forcing them to walk and ride while coming under almost constant attack. It's almost like Ed hate's Shandril's character, and is torturing her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful! Don't waste your time or your money.","review":"This book doesn't even deserve one star. It is the worst Forgotten Realms book I have ever read. Some of their recent offerings have been weak, but this one was pathetic. I looked forward to this book for months. I should have saved my money. The book is the same scene over and over and over thirty seven times. The Knights of Myth Drannor are nowhere to be found. Every bad guy who said \\"Hey, pursuing spellfire is lousy idea\\" changed his mind. Some new ones showed up as well. Shan's kid disappears without explanation. There's no plot. There's no point. The ending is over the top and the montage is enough to make you gag. If you want good FR fantasy, pick up anything in the Sembia series, City of the Ravens, anything by R.A.

Spellfire and Crown of Fire managed to capture a sense of both humor and desperation.Not only does Hand of Fire lack the humor of the first two books, it's the single most depressing novel I have ever read. Now, I don't mind a tragic ending, I'm very fond of dark stories, but this ending was far too dark even for me. Narm and Shandril don't managed to accomplish anything, and then Shandril dies uselessly at the end.Do not waste money buying this book. You will only end up angry about buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing end to a promising trilogy","review":"If you enjoyed the first two books in the trilogy, stop there. Unfortunately, Hand of Fire is a great disappointment. This book will leave you with the feeling of being cheated. The first two installments made this conculsion look very promising. Ed Greenwood had the chance to get Shandril and Narm to their goal and accomplish something. By the end of this book I felt like I just ran around in circles, winding up where I started and feeling dizzy. It would have been better if he just stopped with Crown of Fire and left the story open-ended instead of way he chose to end it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking!?!?!?!?!","review":"As a fan of Ed Greenwood and his Forgotten Realms books I was looking forward to the release of this book. It was largely a disappointment though. Not only was the style below par but the plot seemed too haphazard, almost as if it was written by someone on too much caffeine. It may not be Ed's fault since editors will demand entire section of a book to be removed to get the page count within \\"acceptable\\" limits. But I will fault him on the way the book ended and the characters' mindsets to justify those actions.I won't spoil the ending for anyone who may want to read this book, but don't buy it.

I loved the first novel especially, and I would read it over and over. The same things applies to the second. I hated the third. The entire novel felt rough. There was no flow to it, and in fact there was the pointless death of Shandril. There is the whole message of no one will leave her alone, but there are places that Greenwood himself created that she could live out her life. It was a senseless killing and one that ruined the entire series for me.

But no, Elminster didn't have a plan on how things would go, and neither did Ed Greenwood, by the looks of it.Most stories with bad endings are poignant and meaningful, but this book just had a bad ending because Greenwood didn't know what else to do by the looks of it. There's nothing meaningful and it was such a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw this story into the fire","review":"I like forgotten realms books in general so its funny that the one author I typically don't like is Ed Greenwood.

To be candid they are bad plain and simple. He is an enigma in that he is a terrible writer and doesn't sell very well versus his peers and yet still he is hyped and touted. It is ONLY because he created the original d&d universe that he is given the courtesy of publishing garbage.

Most readers that chose to purchase this book know that the overuse of debt by the US is a long term problem/concern for the world. Buying gold to address these concerns is not constructive nor sensitve to the dynamics of world economics. I read this recommendation in 1980 by other sensational writers and would have endured miserable inflation adjusted performance if I had bought gold. Even at $1000/oz.in 2006, I would not have realized the performance of the S&P; or the Euro equivalent.Economics is a dynamic dismal science that has an ebb and flow. The US in not alone in its deficit spending practices. I wanted a better feel for the international dynamics of negative balance of payments; to understand how the deficit spending of most nations impacts the long term value of $US.I guess I bought the wrong book. But still appreciated the writer's sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long overdue wake-up call","review":"In the same vein as \\"the empiror has no clothes\\", this telling volume exposes that the \\"empire has no wealth\\".

There is no question that the deficit we're running in this country is an issue. However, I found the authors viewpoint of past American actions, and their thought that America could have easily stood aside in the World Wars, as well as Lincoln letting the nation severe in two, to be not only outragous, but personally offensive. It's amazing how many people out there are eager to portray this county in the most negative light posibble without presenting any balancing views... by page 100, I was truly tired of reading about how terrible this nation is. The book was nothing more than a long winded, repetitive, editorial on how terrible this country is and how stupid we've been over the past 100 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"EMPIRE OF DEBT IS AWESOME","review":"I am convinced we are an empire albeit somewhat different from earlier ones.

But Nathan's character started blinking red lights in my head because I'm not religious and usually when religion factors in, the book can get preachy. But, the principle of the book about a man being torn from his home, men dealing with wanting to be fathers who will have to deal with the legal system, money, and children's reactions, make for an outstanding story.

The beginning of the book had a lot of promise, but soon the story dragged on and on. Don't get me wrong, there were some very interesting parts in the story, but only parts. The best part of the book for me was towards the end when Jesse was trying to make her escape (loved the car scene). Of the three other Stephen King books that I have read (Desperation, Rose Madder, and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon), Gerald's Game ranks at the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good example of King's work","review":"I have probably read about 15-20 of Stephen King's book and this is one of the worst by far. I haven't read much of his work since because it was very disappointing.If you want an example of good writing by Stephen King try some of the following books: Misery, The Stand, The Talisman, Four past midnight, and anything in the gunslinger series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing, Mediocre Book","review":"The story begins and continues, and continues, and continues in Jessie and Gerald Burlingame's lake cabin bedroom where a sex game ends tragically. I give King credit for his excellent writing, but this excellent writing gives him the ability to write page after page after page about almost nothing. I read the first third of the book hoping desperately that the pace would pick up. At that point I finally did something I never do, read snatches and bits in the rest of the book, and, of course, the ending.King's protagonist is Jessie Burlingame, and he does a good job of getting inside the mind of a woman. I just didn't care particularly for that woman.The other two King books I read are \\"Salem's Lot\\" and \\"The Green Mile,\\" both superb. Those two books are so good that it is hard to believe the same person authored \\"Gerald's Game\\". I'll probably read more King books, as \\"two out of three ain't bad!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a refund on this one.......","review":"I have been reading King's stories for years, but this was a waste of my time and money. It dragged on and on. I know King is capable of much better writing than this. This book was boring, predictable and a waste of the paper upon which it was printed.

I would have given it minus 10 stars if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of King's worst","review":"From the mind that gave us 'IT' and 'Pet Sematary' comes Gerald's Game. I'm sorry, but this was just awful. SK's gas tank of horror must have been on fumes around this time. It seems he switched from frightening nightmares to battered women.

This feels strange to say since I would rather read a good book than watch a good movie. To me, this says his stories can be interesting, suspenseful, and/or horrifying; also, difficult to weed through and totally off-the-wall. Having said this, \\"Gerald's Game\\" was the best story I have read of his. I can't believe some of the negative comments of previous reviewers. This is a great story that draws you in from the very first page. A plausible story yet the telling of it makes you experience the horror and fear as though it was happening to you. The tie-in of her childhood experiences were terrific and the ending segment was as good as reading two books in one. Again, the tie-in was fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch.","review":"Painful all the way to the completely unrelated ending. How much backtracking has to go on in this story?

Two of my favorite books in the world are written by him. I've got nothing but love for the guy. But seriously... Geralds Game was boring and just plain bad. I gave it a shot. I tried so hard to get into this book, but I gave up 3/4 of the way through. Normally, King books start off slow and pick up nicely, but this one started off great and ended up boring me to tears.

In fact, call me crazy, but after reading plenty of King's works, it's one of my favorites. People say it drags on, but I found it to be very suspenseful. The way King presents the storyline, along with Jessie, gives the reader the image of woman's \\"modern struggle,\\" which is what I believe King intended to do. This was accomplished with the intertwining of Jessie's memory of being molested with her being stuck onto the bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"After masterpieces as Carrie, Running Man and others: Stephen King writes his worst book so far.

He warps back and forth through time and through the use of extremely clever similies and metaphors, conveys some of the scariest moments I have ever read.

If your in the mood for great suspense and talent beyond belief, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary and Thrilling","review":"I have read this book a few times, and each time I can't put it down until I finish it. This is definitely not a book for the squeamish! I think it is superbly written, you feel every agonizing moment Jessie goes through to achieve her freedom and come to terms with her past. Not your \\"average\\" Stephen King novel, but still with his great talent for storytelling.

Her character gets developed and then overdeveloped while nothing is happening except her being shackled to a bed that she can't leave. Then theres a revelation.

I was disappointed with this book. But, I was disappointed for different reasons than have been mentioned. I was disappointed with the ending. It is a very NON-KING ending. I don't want to spoil it, but I feel King was thinking about movie rights when he wrote the ending. What happened to supernatural, unexplainable events? When King's books are turned into movies, the endings are usually changed. Happy endings with ends that are tied together are what Hollywood wants. Stephen King tends to go in to opposite direction in his books. But not with Gerald's Game."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORROW FROM THE LIBRARY!","review":"Gerald's Game was okay, but I thought it would have been best in one of his short story collections, rather than a full novel.

Of course I've seen the movie renditions of his past works but not being able to put a book down for a second hasn't been one of my most habitual tendencies. It's an amazing read and really does play with your own thoughts (reading this novel in the privacies of my own dark bedroom late at night didn't help one bit, I couldn't even get up to go to the bathroom at some of the mind twisting moments). Very intreguing seeing what Jessie does in her situation and how she thinks and experiences all of our darkest fears, confronting them face to face. I'll cut this short, simple and straight to the point, if you ever have a chance to read this book, do it, you won't be disapointed (You'll probably never take life or freedom for granted ever again either).-Bryan Johnston, Stephen King's newest fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical King","review":"I stopped reading King back in '89 because I thought he was repetitive. Anyway, that was a long time ago so I though I'ld give him another chance (I used to really like him). I picked up a King novel at random- it was Gerald's Game. I had no idea what the book was about. After reading the first chapter, I prayed that the entire book was not just about this woman cuffed to a bed with handcuffs. Sure enough, it was. Hundreds of pages of the woman laying there tied to the bed in handcuffs. O sure, she starts to get delerious and has weird visions of stuff, and a dog comes in the house to break up the monotonous story, but overall this is a book about a woman tied to a bed with no chance of help. It was painfully boring for me. If you like King, my recommendation is to read Salem's Lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever hear of PROOFREADING?","review":"As with every Stephen King book I've ever read, I found this one to be a page turner and enjoyed the story. However, I wish as much attention was paid to Kindle books as the hardcopies receive. This was littered with way too many typos, stray punctuation, and wrong words. Not an issue from the author, I'm certain. Either bring the coversion process back ONSHORE, or have a little human interaction (from someone who actually reads) in the process. Some of us still actually care about grammar and clean text - even in a slightly racy story line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistically horrifying","review":"I love how Steven King was really able to play the role of a woman in this novel. What horrified me the most was how such a terrible thing could actually happen to anyone. The way Jessie's room in her vacation home ends up gradually turning into a real life torture chamber is amazing. The way King describes with such detail how Jessie suffered every second made me feel as though I were in those cuffs with her. As a reader I became so engaged that during the intervals when I wasn't reading I was actually spending my workdays wondering how I would manage to escape from such an authentically horrendous situation.This was by far one of my favorite novels from King."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stephen king fan's worst nightmare","review":"This is the worst Stephan King book I've read. It's slow and lacks plot; it's a concept rather than a story. A woman finds herself trapped in her house- with only her \\"voices\\" to keep her company.

The book started OK, but King got stuck on Act 1, Scene 1. It was like listening to an old 45 with a scratch that keeps repeating the same part. After 130 pages of wading through the same Scene, I started flipping ahead 50 pages at a time and was shocked to find that the story was still in the same place, and stayed there until about the last 30 pages. I gave up. What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and monotonous","review":"The end product is at least twice the length of its true content. The novel couldn't decide if it wanted to be a suspense thriller or a shallow character study. It failed at both--as a suspense thriller, it's neither suspenseful or thrilling for most of the pages; as a character study, the whole manages to be less than the sum of its parts. The protagonist Jesse Burlingame is painted in broad strokes as a self-absorbed yuppie stay-at-home wife; almost 500 pages of stream-of-consciousness ramblings is a painfully long time to be inside her head, and I didn't feel I deeply knew her any better after the 450th page than the 150th.Gerald's Game fails where King has succeeded so well in other books--as other reviewers have noted, it's hard to believe that the wordsmith of such breath-taking character portraits as Jack Torrance from The Shining could fail so spectacularly here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onlt for die hard King fans","review":"Only Stephen King is capable of writing more than four hundred pages featuring a single character and full it with chepa psychologic drama.

And like any King book, anything CAN happen WILL happen to prevent that. As suspenseful as climbing a flight of stairs when you don't know what's at the landing above to push you back down, this novel has your heart racing.

He makes the same mistake as the creators of the movie _Falling_Down_, insisting that only insane people perform even slightly deviant acts.

I've been a fan since the early nineties, and I love most of his work. But this book...Okay, this book is about a naked woman tied to a bed with someone or something possibly lurking outside for 448 pages. Honestly that's all that you get, except for some flashbacks. If you're afraid of being bound to a bed, you might like it more than me. It should have been a short story. There's not enough story here to keep me entertained for more than about a 25 page short story.The ending is cool, but it's not worth reading 448 boring pages to get to it. Once again if it was a short story without the tons of drawnout extra pages, I'd probably love it.I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone who is not a diehard King fanatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"I am a very big King fan, but this has to go under the category of \\"the book he never should have written\\". A premise that cannot be sustained for 300 pages and more importantly, it's boring. Read this only if you have made some kind of pact with yourself to read every one of King's books and then save it until last."},{"rating":"1","title":"I neither cared whether Jessie lived or died.","review":"King sets himself a difficult task here. He must sustain our interest in a single character who is alone, chained to a bed, and likely to die.While admiring his resourcefulness, his narrative skills, and many other of his books, I must report that I soon lost interest in his character Jessie and her predicament. I don't object to identifying with a character and sharing her long drawn-out agony if the experience is, paradoxically, a liberating one. One hour with Jessie, however, made me feel callous, heartless and dispirited. I neither cared whether she lived or died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Among King's Best Work (by a longshot)","review":"I have to say that I really got into this book right up until after the escape from the handcuffs. As far as I'm concerned, it could have ended there and I would have been more inclined to call it a good read. But it didn't end there, and what followed was some of the most boring, nonsensical wordiness that I've ever been subjected to. When it comes to King, I'm a big fan, but Gerald's Game was almost like reading two different books: one pretty decent, and one quite not.I'm still reeling from the disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books by Stephen King","review":"I can only recommend Gerald's Game.

Reality check--time out! It this story, Gerald and Jessie go to their cabin out in the wilderness, where Gerald decides to \\"enhance\\" their lovemaking with a mild bondage trick. He binds her wrists and ankles to the bedposts--and breaks his fool neck! Literally. The rest of the story puts Jessie in the position of a woodchuck caught in a trap. She's got a husband dead on the floor nearby, but not another soul within miles to help. It might have made a so-so short story in one of King's anthologies. Then again, his editors might have tried to talk him out of it. Whatever the case, it ain't no novel. And it ain't much of a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy ... Boring ...

This book is about a woman who gets chained to the bed after her husband dies. Then for about 30 chapters she is still chained to the bed and her biggest obstacle is getting a glass of water (wow true suspense!). There is a few parts, however, where some strange man is in the house, and that started getting interesting, but it turns out he does nothing big, except carry a briefcase with a bunch of bones in it. I have read most of Stephen King's books and I liked them all except for this one and 'Carrie'.

I got though the first few pages where she getts handcuffed to bed etc etc, and the dog comes in but then I had to put it down. I don't know how Stephen King manages to strangle all of the life out of a potentally good story, but he accomplishes that well with this book. Is it all words and no action with you Stephen? How could the author of It, and The Stand drop this low?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"The dog part was kinda interesting but the eclipse flashback(s) was disgusting and the rest of the book was really boring. It also could have easily ended about 50 or 60 pages before it did. But at least its short for a King book (445 pages) and I was able to force myself through it in a few days. Out of the 17 or so King books I've read this was definitely the worst, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you want to read every Stephen King book there is. - - 3/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish","review":"This is the First Stephen King novel I didn't finish.

She didn't mean to kill her husband, she really didn't, but now he's dead, and she's stuck. But she's not alone. She's being watched...by man and beast...or something worse...Stephen King's \\"Gerald's Game\\" is a thrilling glimpse at what a person will do in moments of utter desperation. Not necessarily a supernatural thriller (though it leaves you wondering), \\"Gerald's Game\\" is a great example of psychological suspense, written by the master of horror. Loosely tied with \\"Dolores Claiborne\\" (no, you don't have to read it to get this one), it is one of King's strangest--and yet most engrossing--novels to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and Terrifying","review":"As I started reading this book, I figured it was just one more of Stephen King's great works. I was not prepared for the terror which took hold of me as I read each night drawing closer to the end.

This is one of his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words, too many pages, too few results.","review":"You'd think that a women handcuffed to a bed with a dead husband on the floor and a famished stray dog at the door would lead to suspense and terror. Well, it didn't. Mr. King left us wandering somewhere amid all the words. I was very disappointed since the early promise was unfulfilled.

First, That whole part about the eclipse was BOring! I don't know why I did this because it was a complete waste of time. I sat on the couch for 1 hour trying to force myself to actually read the part about the eclipse. I finally got it. After the Eclipse part the rest of the book was very good(especially the places about the \\"Space Cowboy\\"). The book got bad again at the end when she started writing on the mac.

Put it back together and it is still noisy. The air valve either spurts bubbles off and on when adjusted full down, or puts out a ton of bubbles when increased. To be fair the other brand's air valves do that also so I end up not using the air tube. I replaced it with an Aquaclear 20.

Passports, holy cards, letters from presidents and celebrities and much more is reproduced to look like the originals. I found myself getting lost in the lives of these people and the decades in which they lived. Mostly, I closed the book with the realization that even icons like Lucy and Desi are flesh and blood people, drawn to their heritage, celebrating their children and accomplishments, and mourning the loss of dreams and friends along the way. Each yellowed news clipping and lovingly preserved souvenir is a reminder of the ties that bind us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is simply priceless.

He should have consulted the Serbian scholar Kocovic who has dedicated his entire academic research in the area. Or the studies funded by the Jewish communities of Croatia.

While DeShannon didn't score a lot of hit singles for herself, she wrote a large portion of hits for other artists throughout the 60's.....even well into the 80's (remember Bette Davis Eyes?)Jackie DeShannon is a truly great songwriter. Sadly, most people don't realize that she is also a talented vocalist. She delivers her vocals with passion and emotion, and is a vocal chameleon. She can shift from teen pop to smooth crooner on a Bacharach hit, to a bluesy, white soul that rivals the likes of Dusty Springfield and Annie Lennox.Take a listen and hear how she influenced music of the time (and later music for that matter)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What took me so long?","review":"I was looking for \\"What the World Needs Now, Is Love Sweet Love\\".

From the notes there are an amazing number of artists who have covered her songs (Brenda Lee, The Birds, Marianne Faithful, The Searchers, The Carpenters), and artists who she has collaborated (Randy Newman and Jimmy Page among others). Also she opened for the Beatles 1964 US tour.Oh and that great song, \\"Put a Little Love in your Heart\\"! This CD is worth the price just for those two songs I mentioned.

So if you are looking for a book about the philosophical question of what is the \\"self\\" than maybe you would be interested in reading Into The Silent Land; but do not buy this book expecting a book which helps the reader understand neurological conditions. . . do not expect Oliver Sacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good casual read, not a lot of \\"meat\\"","review":"I expected this book to be a bit more scientifically oriented.

He sheds light on the hardships of dealing with patients as whole people, while being all too aware of their component parts. While I realize this is an issue for any kind of practitioner, I would have liked a bit more solid information on the nature of brain pathology.The author surely has a way with words, but often rambles for pages at a time. There is very little information on any given patient or case. The focus is usually on the author's experience doing his job.Overall, not an awful book.

They might learn something in the process!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Housekeeping Tip: Avoid cluttering up your bookshelves with this one","review":"The quality of writing wasn't the problem with Housekeeping. It was the quality of the characters. They just aren't very interesting because they're about as deep as a paper cut and reading about them is just as painful. I plan to do a little Housekeeping myself by placing this one directly into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but found it poorly written and dull. The author takes a plot that could have been quite moving, and buries it alive under the cumbersome weight of her language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished","review":"Am incredibly disappointed in this highly acclaimed novel. Self-indulgent, overwrought, and boring. I tried twice to read it, got to page 100 and couldn't go on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and memorable (mostly)","review":"\\"Housekeeping\\" has two themes: memory/loss, and alienation. I think Robinson was clearer and more interesting in her treatment of alienation. Both Sylvie and Ruth can pretend to be normal, but just cannot keep up the pretense without being eventually found out, because they just do not find conventional life satisfying, and also feel it threatens their memories of their lost family members.Robinson is fond of long paragraphs full of imagery and detail. For the most part she carries it off, so that the novel does not sink under the weight of the writing, but rather is moving and memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book For All Free Spirits","review":"This is a book about two very unusual people who have the courage to stand up and be different and to live their lives in the way that is right for them and who refuse to follow the constraints placed upon them by conventional society. From beginning to end this book oozes with a warmth that is refreshing and all too rare."},{"rating":"1","title":"It looks like a good book but it's not.","review":"How interesting to read the dichotomy of reviews on this book. Many people love it and a few can't stand it. I'm with the latter. I have read thousands of novels in my time, and majored in creative writing in college many years ago. I think we're being conned with this book. It has the look and feel of \\"good writing,\\" but when you actually examine what the author writes, a lot of it simply doesn't make sense. She is full of fancy-sounding language that could fool a reader into thinking she is saying something but it still comes up empty.The plot also doesn't make much sense, and the \\"poetic\\" ending--of the ditzy aunt dragging her poor helpless niece along with her into a drifting life of madness--is truly depressing and unconvincing. I think this novel is a literary fraud and I'm sorry to see that so many people have fallen for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A literary accomplishment - but a slughtly depressing book.","review":"Maybe I SHOULD give five stars to \\"Housekeeping: a Novel\\", due to its undeniable literary merits - but, really, it IS a little depressing. Which, of course, is not \\"bad\\" - it's just that I would not want to re-read this book.I APPRECIATE the book's qualities: but it's not quite the same thing as \\"LOVING\\" it.Well, I must say that, come to think of it, \\"La Chute\\", by Albert Camus, is ALSO a very depressing book - and a masterpiece... I hope someone here understands what I'm saying.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Austere","review":"This novel blew me away. The beauty of the narrative lies in the language more than in the plot or the character development. I typically gravitate towards novels that favor story over words (I'm not much of a poetry fan), but Robinson's work represents a wonderful departure from that rule. I found some phrases to so surprisingly poignant, that I ended up slowing my reading down to a crawl just so I could let every word sink in. It's a solemn, lonely story, but oddly comforting, like a long walk by yourself. Anyone who is interested in becoming a stronger writer should give this novel a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance","review":"I hate to say it, but this novel feels almost doomed to fail now -- not because it's bad; in fact, it's excellent. But at this late date, our speed of life has gotten so fast, and our attention spans so short, that I wonder how most people are going to take to this story.I just hope readers who missed it the first time around will give it a chance now. It's a remarkable book -- Robinson's \\"Gilead\\" has gotten more attention, but this book deserves a wider audience. The characters are very odd but also extremely interesting. I did have a little trouble closing the emotional gap at first -- I felt distanced from them, but as I read, this changed. I suspect that's what the author intended; this is a book about human relationships but also about something larger -- the human condition, and we're all part of that even when, perhaps, we'd rather not be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book Club Pick - Resources Available!","review":"This is a natural pick for a book club discussion group. There are additional resources available for your book club through the National Endowment for the Arts \\"THE BIG READ\\" program. In addition to the book offered here at Amazon, there is a Compact Disc offered by the National Endowment for the Arts which has discussion of the book and interviews with Marilynne Robinson, the author. These additional resources make this book an excellent pick for your book club. The National Endowment for the Arts also offers a Teacher's Guide and a Reader's Guide in addition to the Compact Disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the name of the mother, the sister and the aunt","review":"Not many début are as assured, poetic and beautiful as Marilynne Robinson's \\"Housekeeping\\". It is a novel about family ties and loneliness and what people do in order to survive the pain of life. Her characters are always in search of some kind of connection with a place or someone else - and they miserably fail. The main character is Sylvie. She is seen through her niece's eyes, Rithie, who is also the narrator. This girl and her sister are left under the cares of their grandmothter, after being abandoned by their mother. When the woman dies, enters Sylvie - who seems to have some emotional issues herself..Robinson's prose is as poetic as profound and capable of illuminates some dark corners of the human soul. As it happens with her latest novel, the Pulitzer Prize Winner \\"Gilead\\", her writing is beautiful and demanding. Therefore, there is an immense payback for the reader. The more you give to \\"Housekeeping\\", the more it gives you back."},{"rating":"1","title":"too slow","review":"\\"The air filled with dust particles that looked like tiny bent threads, or hairs, which someone had once told us were atoms.\\"Brilliant writing?

Will not read another by her, no matter what the reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, kind of boring","review":"The language used to tell this story was at times compelling and beautiful, but the plot and the general pace of the book were lugubrious and sluggish. There are enough books out there with both powerful prose and a strong story line - I say skip this one and try Faulkner or The Hours instead for a beautiful book. I took everyone's suggestion and bought it and was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How a dreadful reader can destroy a book","review":"Housekeeping is a fine book. (I think) I enjoy listening to books and in the UK there is a tradition of fine actors taking time out to read books, which are then much enjoyed by lots of people. Housekeeping is the book of the month for my book circle in a little village in rural Somerset, UK. The fact that I have to order the audio recording from the States does not worry me - it arrives in good time and I settle down to listen. What a disappointment!! Becket Royce reads it as if she is a teenager asked to read in class by a teacher. Her voice has absolutely no expression, she does not vary the pace and does not appear to be enjoying the experience at all. There is wit and pathos in this novel but Becket Royce conceals both."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"Housekeeping a novel, is a dismal and depressing story of two young girls who really need at least one good parent. They get passed from relative to relative. They do have a brief time of respite with their very thin grandmother. Interwoven in the plot is so much twisted vocabulary it is hard to know what is really being expressed. I found it depressing from their mother's suicide to the ending. The book never redeems itself and it is an awful read. If you like to read prose for the sake of prose then go ahead and take the plunge, be warned it is dark water."},{"rating":"1","title":"A read that just plods along","review":"I too am among the ones who fail to see this novel's greatness. I never felt engaged with the characters, and the plot drags along without ever really going anywhere, just moving from one heavy, depressing scene to the next. I'm guessing this was the author's intent because it does reflect the overall somber mood that follows the main characters' lives -- a little too well. To me, there's a lot of \\"fancy language\\" and prose involved (better suited for poetry, really) but it just seems like good \\"skin\\" with no bones underneath. None of it actually says much of anything.I really enjoyed Robinson's \\"Gilead\\" and had high hopes for this one too, but for me, it really missed the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful; one of my favorites","review":"I just read this book a second time, and it still holds a place in my top five favorite books. It is beautifully written, somewhat sad, with very strong characters that you feel like you know at the end of the book. There is a movie from 1988, which is outstanding, one of the closest book-to-movie conversions that I have ever seen (I highly recommend it if you can find it). Having grown up in a severely dysfunctional family, then in foster homes, then with a series of equally dysfunctional relatives, this book and the plight of the two girls really spoke to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book and Great Movie","review":"I read this and Gilead when they first came out but am trying to get the best recommendations from Amazon (I love perusing their recommendations!) that I can, so have decided to periodically (as I remember them) review books that have stuck with me over the years and not just current reads.It's hard to believe there's such controversy over this book. All I can say about it is that I savored every sentence, character and scene. It enriched my life. I still carry images from the book with me.I'd like to add that the movie \\"Housekeeping\\", starring Christine Lahti, that was made from this novel is hauntingly exquisite. Every bit as good as the book. FYI for lovers of Housekeeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"By the time I read the first 50 pages I decided not to finish this book, which is very unusual for me. But this story did not seem to be worth the effort to read through to the end. For me \\"Housekeeping\\" didn't have the depth or compelling story line that I like. It was just a chronology of events related to characters the author did not make me care about. That's not what I'm looking for in a classic novel. I want a story that hooks me and draws me into what happens to the main characters. In spite of how highly it is rated, this one, I'm afraid, did not do that for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"so boring i couldnt get through it maybe just me. the characters were also confusing and hard to get to know"},{"rating":"1","title":"After reading the last sentence, I threw it in the trash.","review":"Yes, it was well written. Other than that, it had absolutely no redeeming qualities. I regret only that I could give it no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found that reading this book took great effort.","review":"I found this book to be tedious, wordy and above all boring. I never connected with the characters. What happened to the three daughters of the grandmother? What went so wrong? The author does not give any background to understand or sympathize with the transient traits. It certainly is a vocabulary builder and the description of the setting was well done. I wouln't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happens","review":"I read about half the book and nothing happened. Robinson's writing is intense and lyrical but also boring. It just went on and on and on and on...This is an extremely slow moving book, I was waiting for the plot to develop but it seemed like much of the book was the backstory.

The characters just seemed to move from one situation to the next. \\"Eccantric aunt\\"? How about \\"evil\\", \\"horrible\\" or \\"abusive\\" as adjectives? A terrible book about awful people with a depressing ending. Of the seven people who were at my book group discussion, the highest number of stars given the book was 3 (out of 10).

They are hard to believe and not sympathetic. A train falls off the track on a bridge? A mother leaves her two daughters and drives off a cliff? The two aunts who are taking care of the little girls leave in 45 minutes? None of this is pleasant or believable. I couldn't wait for the book to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I felt water-logged after reading this tedious book.

Eventually their aunt, Sylvie, moves in to provide adult presence in the household. Sylvie is a wanderer who \\"sleeps with her shoes under her pillow\\" and her head at the other end of the bed. She allows the girls to be truants. While Lucille begins to realize she needs to move away from Sylvia and finds a new home with a teacher, Ruth is more influenced by her Aunt Sylvie. Her life becomes more disorganized as she and Sylvie begin traveling first locally and then further away. This is a haunting tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing happens!!","review":"i found this book very tedious and difficult to read. marilynne tobinson's writing is beautiful and her manner of describing people and places was lovely, but it was over -internalized. The book just had too much of what was going on inside the characters heads and hearts and not enough of what was behind all of this existential agnst. i kept waiting for some kind of plot to develop. and what finally did happen was almost too eerie and bizarre to feel like real activity. being inside the minds of these characters was a bit like the feeling you have when you've taken too much cold medication."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will survive us all","review":"It surprises me beyond measure that some readers think this is a book about madness. Loneliness is Robinson's topic, the absolute solitude that is primary pain of being a person--which no relationship can assuage. The cold lake--death?-- in which memory, history, and love are swallowed threatens to absorb us, and we each make some sort of negotiation with it. The Stone girls, Ruth and Lucille, and their aunt Sylvie, strike their own balances, each preserving the only kind of safety she can in the face of dissolution. This novel will, for the depth of its thinking, the beauty of its language and the richness of its allusion, be a classic through the next century. It has the saddest, most lovely ending of any novel I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I read another book by the the author, Gilead. I thought it was great book and wanted to read more books by this author.I found this book very difficult to read. The plot goes nowhere. Suicide, death, and insanity is the main focus. I was relieved when I finished the book and found it very depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"lovestoread","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with one of the previous reviewers-- beautiful use of the English language but no plot. I also tried to read Gilead and came to the same conclusion. I am not really into stream-of-conciousness type of writing, such that I cannot find the story line. I feel cheated because the author clearly has a wonderful command of the English language and I love the way she plays with words. I felt like I was reading poetry, but nevertheless the books she has written don't hold my attention and I can't seem to stick with them. I wish she could use her writing talents in a way that could keep the reader more involved in the story line AND enjoy her use of the English language at it's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition is an act of violence against a great book","review":"First, this is a great book--without doubt one of the most beautifully written books ever. I first read it from the library not long after it came out, and bought this copy so I could re-read it over and over. The writing is even better than I had recalled. BUT, this edition looks like a bad photocopy of something that was typed on an old typewriter with a dried out ribbon and some crooked letters. Perfection is not necessary, but the quality of this imprint is so bad that it's distracting from the reading. Picador should be embarrassed to have their name on it, and Marilynne Robinson should sue. If you're going to read the book, get a different edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I read this novel after having been blown away by Gilead and Home.

The acting is the least of it's problems. If it weren't for the cast, this could very well be MST3K material (if MST3K was still in production). It's not just silliness, but juvenile, inane silliness. What a waste of a good cast! Oh, in case you were still wondering, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

It is worse than bad; it eventuates in that strange and almost surreal feeling that a part of your life is lost and never to be recovered again.

Were it not for Mike Love's impudent meddling and Capitol's pressure, Brian Wilson would have created a masterful album. Instead, we have to contend with Smiley Smile. It's a good album in and of itself, but it still lacks the dynamism of Smile. \\"Wonderful,\\" for example, was far more powerful and dynamic when it was Brian singing instead of Carl whispering. Also, \\"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter\\" was what was left of \\"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow,\\" in which case the latter was again superior to the former. Thirdly, \\"Heroes and Villains\\" could potentially have been a full-blown musical collage, but it was shortened and butchered just to satisfy Capitol's greed. Granted, the Smiley Smile version is still enjoyable, but it would have been inifnitely greater in its original Smile form.

BUT the mesh on this one is much poorer quality & kept snagging on everything I tried to put in there. Also, the holes on the bottom of the three larger pockets are so big that a small tube of shampoo or face wash will slide right through.

I can't describe it, but somehow the webbing in the product causes almost as much friction as velcro. Nothing moves smoothly within it. Then, when it does move, it's only to fall out of the large openings in the bottom. I actually hurt my toe when something fell out of the organizer and banged me on the foot.

I think there are other books with the same protagonists, and maybe if I'd read those first I would have liked this book better. I did not find the protagonists interesting at all. In fact, I found the villain--even though I think the author tried very hard to make him unlikeable--to be a more interesting and even occasionally compelling character. The plot had some trouble too...either I wasn't reading carefully enough, or there were some major unanswered questions about the motives of several characters. Last of all the author tended to use various names to refer to the same character (e.g. sometimes calling a person by his last name, sometimes his first, sometimes a title) and I thought this was a bit confusing since there are a lot of characters involved in the story.To summarize...this book was entertaining enough to finish, but mostly I was glad when it ended so I could start another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality JUNK!","review":"I ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life.

I enjoyed how Bear explored the ramifications of The Way's existence and how mundane humans and future humans deal with it. It didn't have the same awe factor as Eon, though. This is probably because we've already been spoiled to the big reveal, about the nature of The Stone, The Way and the people aboard it. It was fresh when I first read it. My take may also be tempered by the fact that I first read Eon in high school and I didn't come to read Eternity until 15+ years later.In any case, I did enjoy it. Bear spends more time exploring the characters he introduced in Eon, which was very welcome. His first foray with these characters was a little flat, but Eternity makes up for it by giving them dimensions and nuances.If you read Eon, you should definitely read Eternity."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a good sequel.","review":"I enjoyed this sequel to EON as Eternity followed right along on the story line.

His descriptions of the Jart are so obscure and long-winded, the reader may as well just turn the page. I found it annoying that Greg Bear attempted to invent even more words in this book than Eon. My largest complaint however resided in the high number of typos, duplicated words, letters dropped etc that made the reading even more disruptive. It really looked like there had been global replacements as the same errors were repeated. While I'd admit that an author is more concerned with flow, plot, and technical accuracy - the editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Opportunity","review":"Am I the only person to be unimpressed by Greg Bears' Eon and Eternity? After reading Eon I thought that Eternity could not be any worse and it wasn't but only just. Basically I felt I needed maps and diagrams every few pages just to get my bearings. I'm sure the author was only too clear in his own mind of the geography of the place but he failed to impart it to me with any clarity! I was quite lost almost from the beginning and for enjoyment of these novels a clear understanding of the layout of the asteroid was essential especially the 7th chamber which was crucial. This is a pity because the potential for expanding the saga both within the asteroid and onto other worlds is infinite but I would find it hard to raise any interest as the mechanics of moving to other worlds was completely lost on me.All in all an opportunity missed hence only 2 stars ie by my system books I would be quite happy not to have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thinking piece not an action piece","review":"Eon is a great novel with an interesting and dramatic plot that moves the story along and brings up certain important and interesting themes along the way. Eternity has much less of a movng plot, which is why I think many reviewers don't like it as much. Eternity challenges the reader to think about what's right and what's wrong, and how the answers to those questions make them feel.

I couldn't figure out (in 5 minutes) how to make the ladder work.I wish there was a basic model without all the tiny removable pieces to get only the the \\"good news\\" about the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but much better books out there","review":"Maybe I expect too much out of a book, but in order to get 5 stars out of me a book has to be an exhaustive review of the topic, enlightening or at least entertaining. This book was none of these.It skims the many facets of raising a toddler, based on all the \\"current research\\", but doesn't go further than that. For example, my daughter has recently acquired a fear of the dark. They tell me this is normal. Gee thanks. No review of common fears, no clever ways to handle it, nothing.It was like getting advice from a pediatrician who didn't go home and parent. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ed Sullivan Moments!","review":"This video contains some truly great moments on the Ed Sullivan show, including performances by such groups as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Byrds, Rolling Stones, and much much more! Get this video and you will not be dissappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What memories","review":"Imagine, no cursing or smut....imagine Ella's crystal clear voice, the eruption when Ed said 2 little words: 'The Beatles'; the roar when the ventriloquist went mum; the laughs, the clowns, Senor Wences.........a different age, a different world view- thanks Ed! Good things may pass, but the camera remembers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have no idea what this book really contains - I want to review the book, not really the prices, but what it containes so I know I am ording the right book, but all it says is Avon Bottles, Research and History. Research and history of what kind of old Avon bottles? It may not be the one I want or contains the bottles I want to price to sell. So basicly it's no good to me until I know what any of your books covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major dissapintment","review":"Bad graphics, and slow interface turn this into a real plodder. I only played the RPG version and not the RTS, but I was board within minutes. When compared to Neverwinter Nights... well, it's not even worthy of the comparison. It doesn't even come close to the original Baldur's Gate, and that is three generations of RPG back.I personally found it annoying that I couldn't choose the gender of my character, and that the character portraits were, lets face it, ugly. There is nothing to customize in character generation, and skills can only improve along one dimension. I could go on, but why bother?Artamas"},{"rating":"1","title":"good watch, bad strap","review":"I've had this watch for about 6 months now and have loved it. I love the style, function, and colors. My only complaint is with the strap. It has a thin, cheep layer of nylon stitched over the length of the top side, with wide holes punched in it for the buckle. This layer of nylon is not held to the other layers of the strap around the buckle holes, so it has room to stretch, fray, and tear off. After this happens the layer below comes out, because it is not even stitched in at all - only held by the nylon. When that happens, you are left with one layer of nice, but thin brown leather that is not strong enough for a strap (not to mention, it looks like crap at this point).To make a long story short - the strap sucks and WILL need to be replaced, but it can only be replaced by one made just for this watch since it uses a non-standard mounting system (no off the shelf straps will fit this). I'm going to be returning mine and getting a different watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Broken","review":"I purchased this watch for my husband, who was in need of it for work. I was thankful that it arrived in time for me to ship it out to him with the package I was shipping the following day. I looked over it to make sure that everything was complete, only to see that the mode/next button on the left hand side is missing, there is just a hole there. I am completely frustrated and waiting for a response from the company. My advise - be careful a great price could mean a defective item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indio - Indio","review":"Considering how Detroitian John Beltran's early albums were, it's no surprise then that his Indio project appears on perhaps the definitive Detroit label, Transmat. Beltran here returns to the smooth, complex arrangements that marked his work on Peacefrog. \\"I Need You in the Fall\\" is a fragile number, complemented by a melancholy piano line and some light bleeps. \\"A Thousand Storms,\\" instead of being all thunder and lightning, is more a light rain falling from an overcast sky. And the final track, \\"Snowdrifts,\\" does exactly that: drift along with some icy synth sweeps. Transmat, though not prolific, nonetheless delivers the goods."},{"rating":"1","title":"meandering techno lite","review":"john beltran has released a few decent albums under his own name for r & s records and peacefrog respectively. here, as indio, beltran's joined by seth taylor and sam mcqueen and like his solo output, this is new age techno for the Windham Hill crowd. here beltran and his cohorts have the unfortunate tendency of coating their subtle beats with a new age veener of meandering synth string streaks and echoed piano twinklings replete with titles like \\"a thousand storms\\" and \\"earthtones.\\" this is music that wouldn't be out of place in the cd racks of a sante fe crystal healing shop along side the likes of hearts of space and narada recording artists. soft, gentle and utterly vapid, this music has all the spirituality and groove of change rattling in a cash registrar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put the book down !","review":"my brother (ex-military) lend me this book in 1984 when I was 16, I couldn't put the book down. Was very intriguing and action-packed. I have been a fan of Mr. Johnstone since then and I have read all the different series that he has written and I love the collaboration with his nephew J.A. Johnstone. I am now reading Phoenix Rising and I'm looking forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puleeeeeeeze Lord help me just finish this book without gettng sick!","review":"Pendantic.....or downright boring, if you will, that's how I found this book. If one looks at the potential of this novel, you can't help but be frustrated reading it. The idea of a cold, calculated superkiller promises heart pounding action, and yet Johnstone delivers nothing but dull, disconnected and irrelevant sex scenes-- one after the other-- involving a teenaged homicidal loner who is somehow \\"different\\" than everyone else (God! How many times should an author say this about a character? Even middle school authors know that one should \\"show it,not tell it.\\") Johnstone never really does develop the character to the point where anyone who is trying to understand him can do so without accepting the spoon fed drivel about him being born to kill, and that everyone in the world can see that except him. If you are looking for drama, you won't get it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"HooHah!","review":"Take it for what it is worth. Written at the height of the ninja/pow/soldier of fortune craze it was probably heady brew at the time. The material currently available in this genre are much more sophisticated now. The sexual escapades are wooden and flat at best. There is no sense of gratification, just some sort of odd obligation. Almost no action sequences to speak of except at the beginning of the book. \\"his hands would have had to be registered as lethal weapons.\\" Please, this is so blatantly dating itself. The author came recommended as very entertaining in this genre so I will read another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Stupid","review":"Terry Kovak...Part man, part machine. Yawn! This book is a complete waste of reading time. My $5.00 would have been better spent buying a Happy Meal from McDonalds. At least it would have been more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Thoughts.... of the Dog Team","review":"I liked this book... and being that I'm in the Marines I liked the fighting aspect of the story, being a red-blooded american man, I also liked some of the intimated writing... lol But the one thing that kept me reading this story, was that everyone that read it (including myself) in some shape or form could relate to it... if not in actual experience, then in some kind of desire to do what Terry did... but thats just my opinion... have a nice day...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Main character not believable","review":"I have read and enjoyed Johnstone's books, however this one is not his best by far. The book is readable and well written. The main character is a cold psychopath, he is not likable and too cartoon like. I look for better from Johnstone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Entertainment","review":"Having read many of Mr. Johnstone's other novels, I can honestly say that this is one of his best. It's very fast-paced - maybe too much so - and ends with you wanting more. I would have liked a little more characterization with regards to the lead charater, Terry Kovak, who seems to spend too much time with his ladies and not enough doing what he was trained to do... kill. However, I have a feeling that with the sucess of this re-release, he will save more of the killing for a sequel down the road"},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK Overview","review":"Pass on the hype.....this book is a soft general overview. However it lacks on technical details. It focuses mainly in two areas, 883 coversion and history. Again the 883 conversion IS NOT TECHNICALLY DEEP and I would even venture to say lacking. I was disapointed in this book.
