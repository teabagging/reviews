I should have followed my hunch. This book is mostly new age talk with no real advice (ie, \\"feel the blue and red flame of your inner love\\"). What am I supposed to do with that kind of advice? If you're into that, good for you. I'm gonna go look for some more practical advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent and inaccurate - this is one book you should avoid!","review":"When you read a book where the main character has the same name as the author, you would probably expect it to be autobiographical. But in this case, it is not. Shakers do not have families; they are celibate. In fact, Shakers never were even in Vermont and there is no book of Shaker. Aside from the base false premises of this book, the graphically violent incidents are also worth avoiding. From the opening scene of the cow giving birth to the scenes training weasel dogs by nailing in a barrel or violent mating of pigs, the lengthy, graphic descriptions can be quite disturbing. There are harsh realities of growing up on farms, but this book sensationalizes more than it informs. There are so many other quality books about farming and boys coming \\"of age\\" - choose one of them instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, odd fit","review":"This works great for sound quality both incoming and outgoing. Noise cancellation works well cutting out many background sounds, but really sharp sound bursts like dogs barking will still come through. It's comfortable once in your ear but the strange fit makes it difficult to put on the earpiece quick and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great option","review":"Good bang for your buck. Very comfortable, decent sound, and great versatility. It easily adapts to right or left ear, is simple to put on, and it stays in place. I don't have to fiddle with it like so many other headsets. I use it for Microsoft Communicator calls at work through the USB adapter, and can also plug it into my desk phone jack for telephone calls. I've tried several headsets and am very well pleased with this one. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well on Linux and my home cordless phone","review":"The only negative I can come up with for this headset is that it is a little tricky to put on and remove from my ear. It is very lightweight and fits well when on, but if I have to run to the computer to answer a call, I may miss it. The bright side, though, is that you can answer the call and ask the caller to hold while you \\"install\\" the earpiece.The sound quality is acceptable, if not great, and the unit works on my Fedora 8 Linux laptop for both Skype and Ekiga softphone. I also use the earpiece (sans USB) on my home cordless phone.You cannot go wrong with this unit for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful- DO NOT GET THIS","review":"I've tried using this microphone with a mobile phone and a home phone.

I could hear the other person well, but others could barely understand me from their end. After much research at Plantronics, they said that this product will not function correctly with modern Smart Phones. Even though it has a 2.5 to 3.5 mm converter cord, the required voltage is not present with Smart Phones, whether they are iPhones, Droid OS, or other. They need USB voltage from a computer, for example. Call Plantronics and they will verify this. Plantronics is not making an appropriate 3.5 mm wired headset.I could not find a good quality Bluetooth headset until my recent purchase of the Plantronics Voyager Pro HD. It is not 100%, but amazingly good. It is available from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good wired headset","review":"I bought this headset a couple years ago, for a non-smart phone. I remember really liking it, so I bought it again recently. And overall I am very happy. I bought this mainly because I wanted something simpler than a bluetooth and because my phone does not support them anyways. And again, I really like this headset. The best things about it are:1. Hangs on one ear, and fits even small ears without falling out2. Has a small clip for you to clip to your clothes3. Has a mute button and volume buttons on the cord4. Fits 2.5mm so I didn't need an adjustment piece.5. I can hear very clearly the person on the other side of the phone.The downside is that people say that I sound a little bit muffled. It is better when I move the mic further away rather than keeping it right up on your mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light weight","review":"I like this ear piece a lot, hardly now I have it on. Would have given five stars except it is easily pulled off of ear, needs to fit a little tighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Volume Level","review":"I was really looking forward to this piece of equipment doubling as a hands-free solution for my cell as well as handling my VOIP needs. I can raise people just fine on my VOIP connection, but they are barely audible through the headset. I can actually hear a coworker 50 feet away from me better through the ear without the headset on than I can through the headset, even with the volume on both my laptop and the headset at 11.The conclusion at which I've arrived is that this was designed for people with bat-like hearing. So, unless you have bat-like hearing, save yourself the trouble of shipping it back and choose something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three in one - but not cell phones","review":"The jack is 2.5mm, not 3.5mm which fits in cell phone ... oh well, fairly comfortable and good for computer use, but as landlines are virtually non-existent, not so multifunctional for cell phone only users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound qualities, especially for the person you are calling.","review":"This headset sounded terrible to the people we called. A much less expensive, older headset we owned was superior, so we returned this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"I do not like the Plantronics Mx500i headset that I purchased from Amazon. I had hoped to use it to receive Voice over internet, allowing me to receive calls through my laptop where ever I chose. I can not keep the headset in my ear. It pinches and then falls out.I will be returning this to Amazon and trying a different type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable but cheap. You get what you pay for!","review":"The 'over-the-ear' fit is not the most comfortable, but for non-wireless earphone jack, this is a good buy for the money. It's the second one I've owned and one must be very careful when removing from the jack port on the phone. Apparently I've drug my phone and all off the desk and/or counter too many times and the wires became disconnected within the headset itself, requiring the need to purchase another. Easily transfers from right to left ear depending on the user's preference. If I would have had the money, I would not have purchased this again. But, again...not bad for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little headset","review":"I have only been using the headset on and off for about a week. So far it is very comfortable and I like the under the ear design. Most of the time I forget that it's sitting there. The sound quality is very good and I haven't had anyone on the other end of the phone complain about the quality either. There is also an inline volume adjustment and mute button. This is useful so I can lower the volume of the headset only without having to lower the overall volume on the phone.I haven't tried the USB attachment for use with computer-based calls but I like that I have it in case I want to use it in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did fit my needs","review":"Product was so so, but it did not work for me.

Skype compatiable2. Laptop compatible - Dell Precision M653. Linux compatible - Fedora Core 74. Small and compact - laptop bag storageThe product did not meet my requirements. The Under-the-ear was novel but awkward. The 10 foot cord was way too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics mx500i pretty good headset","review":"I wear a headset all day some days so I need something comfortable. The mx500i fits that bill. Since I have a hearing loss in some frequencies audio quality is important to me. This doesn't have a lot of booming bass that makes me unable to understand people. So that's good. I do find that the noise and echo cancellation are a little worse than I would hope. People in conferences with me do hear background noise more than I'd like and if I turn up the earphone too far they will hear an echo coming back at themselves. But it's a good buy overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is amazing!!!!!","review":"This headset is so darn comfortable you can literally wear it all day long and not even know you have it on.... This is an amazing product and I would recommend it to anyone that uses a non-bluetooth ready phone. This is made for all day phone conversations. Even if you only use the phone once and awhile and you have a lot of things to do you can wear this headset and do what you have to do and not even know you are wearing it. You can clean or take care of your baby and answer the phone if it rings at that inop time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I got this headset to use for WoW and couldn't be happier!

Because I planned to use this for my computer, this is completely unacceptable. The cord won't reach from the computer to my ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great Older USB Cord Was Better","review":"The Plantronics MX500i 3-in-1 Headset is a great product for any internet based phone can even use for a cell phone with the included adapter. One thing that Plantronics changed with the newer headsets is the usb adapter. The previous one came with a longer cable. The new usb adapter is not connected via a cable but is now in a similiar format as a usb flash stick. This considerably shortens the overall length of the headset. On a laptop this would be a better option but on a desktop unless you have the desktop sitting on top of the desk the cord is way too short. Everything else is fine but I would like to have an option for the usb adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"I purchased this product a month ago. Seemed ok at first but within a week, the microphone would cut in and out so I am making/taking calls and the person on the other end cannot hear me. To fix this, I would have to remove it from the USB port and insert again. Also, just this week, the ear piece broke in half. What a piece of garbage. Would not recommend buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 3 months","review":"Was using this to communicate through Skype and PC games.

I waited for unit #2 and when I had it set up I encountered a different problem with that unit. I called their tech support again and again they came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with the unit.

Compared to my previous headset this headset has a very short wire (probably around 45 inches). This means you will be tied to your pc and will not be able to move very far.The volume is the worst. It is very low and sometimes I have to hold and press the speaker in my ear in order to hear anything. I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive","review":"This is a very mediocre headset. For $10 -$15 it would be ok, but not for $30. After wearing it for a short time it becomes rather uncomfortable and the sound quality is just ok at best. From what other people have said, apparently the quality of the microphone is good. Also, the cord is very short and I wasn't able to get it to work without the USB dongle that come with it, so it makes it a pain to attach a longer cord.Overall though, just not worth the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality","review":"This is a high quality piece. There's a few extra pieces in the wiring to allow for different connections. This threw me a bit and since I only use one wire I got rid of the rest. I just feel bad about that.However, for what I used them for, which was skype while I was deployed, they functioned very well, reliably and with clear sound. They fit well into my ear, didn't cause me pain or anything, and I also used them to listen to music and watch movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This headset is good, it came quickly, and works well.

I'm not a fan of using stereo headsets to play games because I want to hear the game as it is intended on full surround sound. So instead of getting one of those bulky ones that cover up your ears I decided to try this one out. It is by far the most comfortable little headset. I can hear and be heard very clear.There are no cons with this headset that I have ran across.

Sometimes where I sit, I could use some extra volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and cheaply made","review":"This Headset is not only uncomfortable but the speaker part broke after only a month of use.

The consensus is that my voice sounds thick, muffled, and generally unclear. That said, I have a fairly deep voice, but it's not like James Earl Jones or anything. Since I constantly have to repeat myself, it looks like I'll be adding this to the pile of expensive headsets with extremely disappointing microphones.

It is comfortable, and once I learned to trust it to stay on, very easy to put on. Since I barely feel it, it took me a while to be sure it wouldn't fall off, but it never has. The cord is long enough, and the volume control/mute button is located well. The microphone picks up my voice without a lot of background noise, and people seems to hear me clearly.My only issue with this headset is that I can't turn the volume up as high as I would like.

Also it fits comfortably unlike other headset that hang around the earlobe. But BEWARE of the chances getting a defective USB adapter! The thing is poorly made with crappy sounds and must constantly adjust the 2.5mm plug to make either sound or mic to go through the adapter. (Or maybe im just unlucky to get the crappy USB stick :\\\\). The alternative way to work on PC is to get a headset to PC dual adapter/separator plug into PC as analog inputs, or in my case, an XBOX 360 controller (it works!)Recommend to those who use this without the USB adapter. i give 2 stars just because of the USB adapter quality. overall the headset is good for 4 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we reviewing the same item?","review":"Because I couldn't get this thing to fit my ear. Even when seated properly, the slightest movement causes the earpiece to dislodge from the ear, the rubber support to droop, and the boom to fly outward. I then had to gently wrestle this contraption back into place only to have it happen again moments later. The earpiece isn't even shaped properly. I felt as though I was trying to shove a golf ball in my ear. I didn't even get a chance to test the sound quality becasue I couldn't keep it on.

The unfiltered mic picks up lots of extraneous noise, such as air conditioner hum, background music and nearby conversations. Callers complain of \\"tunnel\\" sound. Putting it on takes practice. It is comfortable to wear, but that's irrelevant if it's unpleasant and distracting to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fit is really bad, sound quality is great","review":"I replaced a Plantronics over-the-head mono headset with this one.The earpiece broke after only two weeks use. I could never really tell if the speaker was seated properly in my ear, so I was constantly fidgeting with it, until the ear piece finally broke. The earpiece swivels, and both the speaker half and the non-speaker half are shaped the same, so it is difficult to feel if you have the correct side pushed into your ear while you are using it. It doesn't really fit - it dangles, which often gives the sensation that it has fallen off or out. There simply is not enough there for a snug fit, and while it was far from uncomfortable, it would not be accurate to say that it was comfortable. I am returning this. The sound quality on both mic and speaker was awesome though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Arrived quickly, packaged well, as described.So far this headset works great.

The one book I found that tells ALL the behind the scences stuff and info. about Hanson and the GIRL TOPIC is Dancin' with Hanson by Ravi. In the book you find out how a lot of back up musicians left Hanson to join other bands that they thought would go futher. They were wrong though!!! Also you find out that the title isn't some corny line but the \\"Dancin'\\"part means changing their scheduale sometimes only hours or minutes before the actual show! So if you have read all the other Hanson books like I have and are dieing for some TRUE and DEEP info. on the boys get Dancin' with Hanson!!!!! I definatly give that book a 5!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Subject, Pictures, Writing, and Info I didn't know","review":"I liked these books because they were based on my fave band Hanson. The pictures were fab, giving enough variety to each one. The chapters in each one were fascinating (aka Zac: The Ham On Wry One) and hilarious. The information was mostly stuff I didn't know and I'm thankful for the writers for not putting junk that everyone knew. Hanson, if you're reading this, you guys are fantabulous and funkilishious.

Banana","review":"I saw the other reviews stating that the beeswax and banana hand cream had been replaced by the almond milk cream. Fine with me since I have 2 jars of the banana cream already. Hope the almond works as well as the banana; it certainly feels great on my hands. The almond smells like Amaretto and makes me want to have a drink. Yum! The supplier should have inserted a line about the substitution.The only objection I have to the kit is that the gloves, which do not have the little bees on them as pictured, are made in China...like most everything else we buy now. Wish they were American made and that they said what the material is. Too stretchy for 100% cotton. I have large hands and the gloves fit just fine.I ordered the product on Friday night and received it on Wednesday. Not too bad for Christmas time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware.

My friends and I had arguments, Atari vs. Coleco vs. Intellivision, and it was all a lot of fun!When I heard about this book, I couldn't wait to read it. Now that I've completed it, I can say that it's a great overview of the early years.However, it falls short when talking about the most recent years of video game history. In addition, the book starts off with a good base of chronological chapters, but about half-way through it starts to get confusing; jumping back and forth, sometimes forcing you to revisit earlier chapters to re-learn the characters.Again, having said all that, it's a GREAT read. I do hope that a new addition will come out, perhaps a second edition, with updated chapters on the recent video game machines (DreamCast, PS2, GameCube, and XBox), and a revision of some of the interior chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Book","review":"This could be the most comprehensive book about the video game industry I have ever seen. It was very informative and enjoyable. The only reason that I would rate this book as four stars is because of the few typos I found in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only one of its kind...","review":"Steven Kent has been working on this book for over 10 years, and it shows. Interviewing tens (maybe hundreds) of industry professionals gives the reader the intriguing position to hear both sides of the story - and there are a LOT of stories. Kent covers everything that's happened throughout video games. Negative points to this book include perhaps too strong a focus on the law revolving Genesis and SNES battles, and glossed-over sections about the rise of the Playstation and next-generation systems. In addition, there were some pretty negligent fact errors (Metroid's lead character will remove all of her armor at the end of the game if beaten correctly, not just her helmet) as well as some poor layout and grammatical errors. Overall, though, it's a really good read for anyone who has interest in the video game industry (note: it is the ONLY book currently, too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best in the Field","review":"This book is one of the most comprehensive tellings of the history of video games. The author puts you right in the middle of the discoveries and events that shaped how we view games today. I have read about a half dozen different books about video game history and this one is hands down the best written so far on the subject.

Secondly, halfway through the book, there has been little but talk with his friend Cashman ashore. As I found myself skimming rather than reading more and more pages, I decided to stop altogether, and return to Forester, a real prose stylist, even if his character is a little priggish.Or reread O'Brian, whose character is appealing, and his prose wonderful. Lambdin does not belong on the same shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chinese Reference Cookbook","review":"I have owned this book since around 1980. No it should not be your first Chinese cookbook - too too much. I started with Joyce Chen which has maybe 100 recipes and assumes nothing.

Also if you have some ingredients and want some inspiration this tells how to cook almost anything Chinese."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Must-Have\\" basic Chinese cookbook","review":"I've had this book since it was first published. I continue to give it as a gift to any and all of my foodie friends, explaining that the dishes are so like what I grew up with at home where my father was the main cook. Since they have enjoyed the meals I prepare for them, they are happy to get it. While it may not be the trendiest in regional cooking, it is truly a fine example of basic home cooking that many Chinese Americans would find comforting and familiar. It is so amazing that a non-Asian woman found the voice to represent this style of cooking in such an authentic manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Reading, Dull Recipes","review":"The book's title led me to think I would be buying a treasure-trove of fabulous recipes. Instead, I found it a helpful resource for understanding Chinese ingredients. I tried several different recipes, and they were equally flavorless and boring. It seems that neary every recipe is flavored with tiny amounts of soy sauce and sherry, and the end result required trying to add ingredients to step up the flavor. I am going back to the other Chinese cookbooks I have come to rely on. Funny as it sounds, every recipe I have used in my Betty Crocker Chinese cookbook has been superb, and it remains my source for delicious recipes and flavor combinations. This disappointing book will stay on the shelf as an informational resource only."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok.","review":"Arrived in excellent shape, just like it was describe on the listing.

Unless you seriously want to really dive in and spend all your cooking time learning Chineese cooking, the 1000 recipies are simply just far too many. It was difficult to decide which recipies to try as often there are a dozen that are essentially all the same with one ingredient different.

Psychologists, counselors and other mental health professionals recognized it as a breakthrough self-help text. With insights, information and concepts that you'll be able to apply to everyday life, Bridges leads you through an often angst-ridden process.

The reviews on amazon made me jump at the game because most had given it a high rating. The game can't be found in stores because of how old it is, so I found it here at Amazon (Which I am greatful for Amazon because here you can, for the most part, order hard to find games).... BUT... the game controls are awful, the graphics bite (When moving your character, the foreground and background graphics move as well), there is a map that stays on screen the entire game and you can't get rid of it, story line is weak. The only thing that seemed to be somewhat fun was shooting and having to slowly move upon enemies, doors, etc. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainbow Six is the best game EVER!","review":"When I first played this game a felt I had gone to heaven and back. You start out by picking out 1-4 men from a roster of special opretives. After, you make a kit of a large weapon (machine gun,shotgun...),pistol,and two extra slots. Then you make up 2-4 teams of 1 to 2 opretives.Then you plan,THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART,you're able to make way points and go-codes(example: when you let you're A.I. buddies run in a room and blast all the baddies).Last you execute,this is when you execute the planning, you move in a first person view. For me it took a little while to get used to the conrtols. They're tricky,Turok style controls.

The Hellfire Club's Inner Circle has to be stopped; using Emma Frost, they have plans for the Phoenix force that don't include Jean Grey. Magneto has to be stopped; he's bound & determined to start the war between humans & mutants and is attacking New York City from the back of Senator Kelly's own Sentinels.

It touches on the everyday frustration of lost keys, the way memories pale over time, tip-of-the-tongue blocking, how we manufacture memories that couldn't possibly be true, and more.

Yesterday I purchased Morrison Hotel, and I was disappointed. Yes, Roadhouse Blues is a gem, as is Peace Frog and maybe Waiting for the Sun. But the rest of the album is really uninspiring. The lyrics aren't as deep as Strange Days and the instrumentals aren't as good/catchy as their debut album. It feels as though this album was created by four guys who ran out of ideas. An album created out of contractual obligation rather than creative drive. If you already have Roadhouse Blues on another compilation purchase LA Women. THAT'S a good album. One of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"the doors can rock","review":"the doors put it all together. great lyrics,great sound, alot of messages in their songs. but they were best at playing good ole rock and roll. a great album to listen to while going down the road. on a blue Sunday, okay sing along, leave your cares far behind, just keep your eyes on the road, still sounds fresh even after thirty years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great way to end the 60's and the Legacy of The Doors","review":"This is one of the best Doors Albums. Period. The only one(s) it may have compitition with is their magnificant debut album and Strange Days. But unlike the debut, witch had scorching keyboard and very low guitar, the guitar is right out there on this, and it is an amazing work of art, and too bad the late Jim Morrison (RIP) passed away or we would have more albums like this. You have probably heard people say \\"The 60's Ended in a bang\\" (from all the big things in the 60's mostly had someone die or they broke up)and this was a part of the boom.

'Morrison Hotel' rocks! It certainly is an album worthy of the bands legacy that may have been shattered after previous letdowns. Morrison rocks the blues, and even reminisces with sounds similiar to ther bands debut album with songs like 'Indian Summer' and 'Queen Of The Highway'. 'Roadhouse Blues' the opening track was a wise choice to kick off the album, hooking the listener instantly. Its a great album and fun to listen to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Next to best","review":"This album, being the first after the woefully underacheiving (but not entirely bad)soft parade, showed the Doors at the rockingest:Roadhouse Blues is one of their greatest, you make me real is allright, peace frog is magnificent,ship of fools is good, Land ho is a classic, maggie mcgill is good as well. waiting for the sun is a more experimental doors song, blue sunday and the spy and indian summer are all nice ballads (the spy the best)queen of the highway has a great jazzy tune to it(the demo is the best version from the box set)-all in all, this album ranks up with the spuerb Doors, LA Woman and Strange Days as 4 of the best albums ever-not that waiting for the sun and soft parade are bad-they have good moments of them too, they r just not as well developed and created like theyr first 2 and last 2. get it -u will be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Doors go unquestioned","review":"A lot of songs on this album you will love immediately if you are a Doors fan like \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" and \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" \\"Queen of the Highway\\" and \\"Maggie McGill\\" with it's satisfying crescendo chorus. \\"Peace Frog\\" is another undeniable rock n roll song underlined with Morrison's dark poetry.

This is an improvement, and the closest they came to matching their debut. Strong cuts include Roadhouse Blues; Waiting for the Sun; the funky Peace Frog; and the underrated trilogy Ship of Fools; Land Ho and Maggie Mc'gill (bad lyrics aside, it rocks). The bad?

To the common working man that lyric probably ranks up there with the Holy of Holies. I know in middle, and high school it was recited at least once a day. I found it very unispiring. This whole album was uninspiring as The Doors pretty much fell flat on thier butts after the first album. This was rock bottom. The only good song that came from here was \\"Waiting For The Sun\\". \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" has a good riff, but the rest is stupid, and \\"Blue Sunday\\" is so downhearted that it makes me want to kill myself.

I have been playing this one for a month now.Roadhouse Blues, Waiting for the Sun, Peace Frog, Queen of the Highway, Land HO! AND Indian Summer ( holy moly!!!!) No rock band today could ever dream of being better than the Doors-although U2 are definitely on par. With this cd you have outtakes of Roadhouse Blues, Peace Frog-my favorite song and funny commentary by Jim Morrison tallking to his bandmates-he sure was one funny guy as well as very talented!

Don't dare to look for quality here, for energy, for melody, for - life. Barry seems to have transformed into some kind of zombie giving us only the most predictable and empty material.

Please Barry, don't stay that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning CD!","review":"As one who came of age in the 70s, I never really liked Barry White.

Years ago, he used to belt out his husky, sexual voice whether it was an inspired, up-tempo love song, or something slower. His voice \\"ran the show\\" back then, and commanded attention. It doesn't anymore. Now lackadaisical, hypnotic instrumentation (dare I say dull and boring) rules over his music. This guy was so capable of putting out better music. You know Barry's creative juices have run dry when he includes the remakes of \\"Low Rider\\" by Eric Bourdon & War and \\"Thank You\\" from Sly & The Family Stone on this album. It is such a shame. Bring back the old Barry music from the 1970's....that was truly his best stuff. This 1999 release is just fluff. About as memorably exciting as watching paint dry on the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me? It must be just me...","review":"...I think Barry has lost some of his range and the melodic nature of his voice. Sure the icon is love but I think he's ridden on his reputation on this one.

This could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same formula, no new thoughts, stick with the oldies","review":"While this album perfectly duplicates the mood of his prior recordings, I see no reason to buy this album if you already own a fair number of his prior recordings. Perhaps no other artist is as consistent (some would say predictable) as Mr. White. This albums provides no new insights, no new takes on love ( I could have accepted at least a new way to phrase the language of love) and absolutely no change in style. Why not stick with the Barry White CD's you already have because there is nothing new here. The only reason this CD can be recommended is that you are able to hear his never changing formula with the benefit of today's recording techniques (more bass, better treble, no a.m. radio sound). Of course his consistent sound will be attractive to many fans who would not accept a new sound from him, but for this fan, I can only own so many CD's with exactly the same groove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry's HOT!!!","review":"Barry's new CD is reminiscent of his best hits.

It covers all main subjects in linear algebra from invariant spaces to canonical forms and includes applications to numerical analysis (condition number),statistics(markov chains), and linear differential equations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST ever","review":"Cal Tjader was the king of latin jazz, and Carmen McRae was one of teh finest jazz singers ever! So naturally the two put together made for a sizzling jazz date. McRae's vocals are velvety riding smoothly on Tjader's hot vibes. The percussion is exellent, this is a great latin jazz vocal album. McRae & Tjader downright sizzle on Evil Ways!!! The whole labum sizzles with sensuality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of McRae's finest sessions ever...","review":"This session by jazz legend Carmen McRae featuring afro cuban vibe king Cal Tjader is excellent. It belongs in any serious jazz collectors library. Absolutly essential, one of McRae's finest sessions ever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"A botched effort. What Cal Tjader and Poncho Sanchez try to do here just does not go well with the great lady's singing. This is a mess. I bought this album mainly to hear her sing the fine Besame Mucho--and I'm sorry to say her phrasing too often does not work (in that she overdoes it). Too bad, really. I'm still a Carmen fan and will buy other albums by her--but this one is a major disappointment. Maybe they ought to re-do the music side of this CD and have musicians back her who are used to supporting singers. Tjader and Sanchez play as if inexperienced at backing a singer as talented as Carmen Mcrae. Sorry to have to give it one star. I'll be looking for a refund or to exchange it for some other record."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST!","review":"The worst \\"jazz\\" record I have ever heard. I can't stress enough how much I hated this CD. And it isn't even Carmen McRae's fault--because I love her voice, always have, but the idea of teaming her up with the loud-playing Tjader and Poncho Sanchez drown her out entirely and there you are straining to hear the great and unique Carmen sing. This thing is over-produced and a big miss-match. And then some of these songs don't make sense and don't belong on a jazz record, songs like Santana's Evil Ways (I mean, give me a break...who chose this material? Who produced this annoying record and why?) I'm sorry I got the CD and will be sending it back in exchange for something else by Carmen, hopefully a jazz record that sounds like a jazz record. This hybrid simply grates. I gave it a 1 rating because that's the lowest Amazon.com allows you to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Biased","review":"Fuller wrote an embarrassing hagiography of Grant and libeled Lee. In fact, some of the qualities he so admired in Grant, such as selflessness, he condemned in Lee. Moreover, he never mentioned Grant's drinking, nor the deliberate lies in Grant's memoirs that disparaged other generals, such as Rosecrans. Grant was also given credit for Shiloh without mentioning that it was Grant's negligence that provided an opportunity for the Confederates or that it was Buell's timely arrival that saved him. Fuller also gave credit to Grant for Iuka, where his inexplicable failure to participate almost cost Rosecrans the battle, and Corinth, in which Grant had no role whatsoever. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So you think Grant was a butcher...","review":"If you do, this is the book for you. Fuller adequately and methodically shatters the myth that Grant wantonly sacrificed his troops in battle. He refutes this notion with painstaking tables and charts which proves (surprise) that Robert E. Lee lost many more men per 1,000 than Grant. Fuller further shows that Lee's stature as a great general should be on tenuous hooks and that greater appreciation should be given to Grant's brilliance.Is the book unbiased? No, Fuller clearly prefers Grant, which is to his everlasting credit. Had more historians seriously compared Grant and Lee, USG's reputation wouldn't have been so seriously compromised today. Fuller lays the facts out on the table and shows that Grant beat Lee for a reason: he was the premiere American soldier."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting view on two great generals","review":"Grant and Lee by J.F.C. Fuller is a compelling book, written with a fresh view. Its main objective was to get a clear and unbiased viewpoint from which to examine these two exceptional men. While I myself do not agree with many of the conclusions drawn from Mr. Fuller's interpetation of the events, battles, campaigns, and lives of R.E.Lee and U.S.Grant, his opinion was generally well reasoned and contained few unfounded inferences. I belive that Grant and Lee is a important read for any objective student of either general."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Enjoyable Book, Very Interesting & Very Creative","review":"This is a small book, but don't judge it by its size. It is a great little book. Grant & Lee, with such different backgrounds, lead two great armies in the strangest of times. In the end, with no grudge, the two men get to know and respect each other. But the story of how these men fought & how they thought so similarly in the battlefield and how they were both so noble and courageous help show that two men that could not have been more dissimilar, ended up being so alike serving their causes. I highly recommend this book. Very entertaining, and very educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dispassionate and Thorough","review":"There are so many books on this subject that it's easy to start a fight from any point of view. Fuller is writing from across the Atlantic, and I believe that has given him a perspective that makes for a clear study of the two men. Fuller makes good use of Freemantle's observations from the latter's time in the Confederacy, extending observations into well reasoned analysis. This one is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Out of the Box","review":"The firetruck did not work from the beginning; several batteries were tried to no avail.

Firstly, it took us forever to figure out how to get the batteries in the actual truck...the only instruction provided was an arrow at the bottom of the truck that made absolutely no sense. Once we figured that part out for some reason the front wheels would not spin which resulted in the truck only being able to go in circles but not forward or backward. After less than an hour of playing with it the back wheels stopped working also. After spending most of the day trying to fix the toy we eventually gave up and let him just push it around. In addition t the technical difficulties, the truck itself is pretty boring, maybe if it had some flashing lights or something my nephew may have been a bit more impressed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Turn","review":"Great except the turn button just makes the thing move slower. Its supposed to left turn tank style with right drive wheel going forward and left going back, but both just go forward much more slowly.

Daughter (and mother and father) have played with it quite extensively over the past three days. It moves just fine across our dense wool living room rug, although it it drives off it can't get back on. However, my husband figured out it could drive up onto our lower rugs if you come at them from an angle. I knocked off one star because it only turns one way (try explaining to a two-year-old that to go left you go right three-quarters and stop.) So three buttons would have been better than two, but otherwise the simplicity of it is ideal for a very little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing 1st RC experience","review":"It doesn't matter how old the child is, they want a toy like this to be responsive. But this toy does not work well. It doesn't turn well (the counter-spinning wheels have no traction on hardwood floors), and when it does, it only turns in one direction by design. This means you cannot turn it to steer. When it goes straight, it starts out at an angle from the direction it is pointed. In other words, you cannot really maneuver it, which is the whole point of a remote control vehicle. (The steering wheel design is therefore a kind of lie). This is very frustrating, even for someone with more coordination than the toddlers it is meant for.

The fire truck did not respond to the remote, we thought both batteries were flat, but replacing the batteries did not fix it.

This one was, by far, the easiest to operate. The other ones caused a bit of frustration for them (though they still enjoy them-- and I should concded that those other ones were rated for kids 5 and up or so). But this one was really easy for them to use from the start, and yet doesn't really seem less functional or particularly more baby-ish or anything.Only downside is that you can't choose it's channel, so if you have multiple RC cars going at once, they might end up getting controlled by other controllers. My kids generally find this amusing, though, so not a big problem. And the advantage of having one pre-set channel is that there are no problems with channel on remote and on car getting out of sync, which does cause confusion for the cars we have that have variable channel choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"broken straight out of the box...

I'll probably buy another car and a pink one for the girls. When we have play dates, ALL the kids want to play with it, even the older ones! Very durable, because it survives my very rough-neck children. I've seen some other reviews complaining about the noise. Um no, we currently live in a town house with 3 kids and we gets lots of visitors with more kids and the children are much louder then this little toy.

No sound effects audible in the one we received. Was working great apart from that for +/- 10 mins out the box. Then, as described by other reviews, the motor seemed to slow down. This meant that the turning feature went from a tight circle to a very wide arc, making it very difficult to do anything other than go forward. Fresh batteries did not change this poor performance. Would therefore NOT recommend. Seems that many have received properly functioning units but that was not our experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and quiet","review":"This is a wonderful first time remote control truck. The body is made of rubber and is very durable. It is not squishy rubber, just flexible enough not to damage the paint on the walls when bumped/crashed into. The tires are heavy plastic and the back tires are rubber. It has two directional buttons on the controller (looks like a steering wheel). It only goes forward and spins to the left to change direction. It definately spins on a dime! My son received this for Christmas, he will be four in January, and loves this truck. It has no problems driving on carpet. Definately has a lot of \\"pick up and go!\\" The only sound it makes is the typical remote control humm. There are no lights and sirens. Nice and quiet! lol.

The only thing listed on the box was that it needed the double A batteries. At 10pm on Christmas Eve my husband found a gas station that was open and actually sold 9V batteries thank goodness! We put all batteries in and to our disappointment the truck barely moved with the remote control. You practically had to be touching the truck with the remote for it to move.

In an effort to make the antenna short, they have made this a toy which only works when you walk with it, nearly touching it the whole time! Therefore I would NOT recommend buying it. Children want to stand in one spot and be able to drive it around a bit, not have to practically touch it the whole time. If your child is under 4 years old they won't understand this concept. It simply drives a few inches then stops, and they don't understand why. It seems broken. They will be bored and frustrated with it in a minute or two. I don't recommend this product to anyone.

He watches his big brothers play with their RC cars and now he can join in too.Negative: it has a siren that turns on every time the truck moves and it is loud. I wish there was a on/off switch for the sound.Overall, a great first radio-control truck for a little one!Update (3/24/10): Came up with one more negative. If you have other RC vehicles you may have trouble with the frequencies overlapping. My older son's RC hummer remote also operates the fire truck so unfortunately the 2 kids cannot play with their RC trucks at the same time. If I could give 3 1/2 stars for this I would.

She shows the disparity between the newly arrived, the native Americans and the Mexicans. It is a tale of prejudice and perseverance.I enjoyed the book. The central character Joseph Kimmel shows the strengths that define Texas and the flaws the define human nature. Kimmel's basic dissatisfaction with life and his unrequited desires for a life that might have been are central to the books theme. Each major character is totally humanized by Vida. They don't seem like characters in a book, they seem like real, live people. Katrin's desire to be the best she could be was both inspiring and sad. It seems like a sequel is necessary to track the further lives of these people. It was compelling voyeurism."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite enjoyable","review":"Nina Vida's \\"The Texicans\\" takes place around the time when Texas become the 28th state. I enjoy historical novels and Ms. Vida has created a blended cast of characters from different walks of life, all trying to make a way for themselves in the Lone Star state.

Not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE","review":"An excellent founding idea, the lost Gospel of Judas (an authentic text that refutes the Resurrection) is lost in a self-indulgent swamp of pointless extraneous subplots. The most important thing with this idea is the world's reaction: the weakening of Chrisendom and the strengthening of Islam. Instead we get a hackneyed rendition of the adulterous priest-cliche, a pointless set of flashbacks to WWII, and a general abandonment of realism for the sake of a lazy, trite story that dribbles off into a stupid and inconclusive ending. The only reason I bothered to finish listening to this as a book on tape was to see if the ending was going to be as bad as the rest, but it was even worse.

Two clownish, greedy men are enlisted by a warlord (Toshiro Mifune) and a princess to transport a pile of gold across the mountains to re-establish the princess's defeated clan. They get into all kinds of scrapes, many of them improbable and comic - a la the old Hollywood western action pictures - and, of course, succeed in their task. Also like many western heroes, the characters are inspired by a code of honor that places duty above all else. George Lucas stole freely from this movie when he was making STAR WARS, including the lengthy fight with lances. Mifune is excellent, as are the two buffoonish, bumbling fools (later reincarnated by Lucas as R2-D2 and C-3PO). A fun movie to watch, especially in the hands of a master like Kurosawa."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hidden Fortress","review":"In this bristling adventure with a leavening dose of humor, Kurosawa created one of his most indelible, influential early films, inspiring George Lucas to conceive \\"Star Wars.\\" (Think of the peasants as distant ancestors of R2D2 and C3PO). Kazuo Yamazaki's evocative black-and-white photography is enhanced by the widescreen format, which Kurosawa used here for the first time, lending the action a dazzling visual sweep. Meanwhile, Mifune plays at the top of his game as Makabe, while Uehara makes a feisty, bewitching princess well worth saving. Whatever you do, don't keep this \\"Fortress\\" hidden."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hidden Fortress","review":"The least of Kurosawa's works is also the most fun. It follows the adventures of two cowardly, greedy peasents as they try to smuggle 200 pieces of gold out of enemy territory. They encounter a powerful warrior, played by the great Toshiro Mifune, and a beautiful yet strong willed princess, to whom the gold really belong. Mifune is excellent as he outwits and outfights the enemy soldiers as well as bamboozling the hapless peasents by playing upon their excessive greediness. Parallels can be seen to Star Wars but not as many as you might think. Kurosawa's love of all things film can be seen in the impressive shots of the land as well as his cleaver editing techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurasawa at his finest.","review":"This Film shows off all of the points that makes a Kurasawa movie great. Although it was his last effort for Toho he left them with a film to be remembered. Although the story is quite simple the complexity of charectors, and the emotional states of those traped in the time and place -1600's Japan- is realy what drives it. Also the diffrence between class in Japanese society of the era is also shown. Kurasawa is best known for his Samurai era films and this is one of his best due to the fact that the three elements of the \\"Kurasawa film\\" are evident His historical sence his realistic charectors and his humor.Goerge Lucus him self must love this movie for star wars was partially based on it this fact is most evident in the story line and of course the opening seen as the two farmers wander aimlessly in a wasland."},{"rating":"2","title":"FRENZAL's GREAT FOLLOW UP","review":"Frenzal Rhomb's new album \\"A man is not a camel\\" , in my opinion is the best album by Frenzal Rhomb yet, the first single of the album \\"We're going out tonight\\" is the sort of punk music we have come to expect from Frenzal, but the second single \\"You are not my friend\\" has taken a more pop feel that I believe will appeal to more people, also the track \\"I miss my lung\\" is a very different song, it is the sort of thing we haven't really heard from Frenzal.

I have tried making the belts tighter to the point where it seems uncomfortable for the dog and they still don't stay in place.

With a bit of fiddling, we got seven working solidly, and they make for a terrific phone system that meets all our needs. We expect to use all eight instruments in time, as two or three separate systems, so I can forgive this one problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Receiver/Handset","review":"I received this phone and the Receiver/Handset was not working and I was unable to get a replacement for it. The customer service is terrible, as I believe Panasonic does not support this model anymore.I received this phone and the mouthpiece on the handset has never worked.I decided to try and replace the handset but nobody sells the part, so I was essentially stuck with a \\"paperweight\\".As stated the mouthpiece of the handset has never worked. The user can hear the person on the other end but the person on the other end cannot hear the user. The phone has never worked and I could not find a replacement part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Phone System","review":"We have 8 phones throughout our home and the system works great. My only complaint is lack of backlite on LCD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound / lacking features that are needed","review":"Like others here I'm wishing I had read the reviews. I saw how many 5's there were and read the product description. I'm astounded that the phone has (a) no message indicator for voicemails; (b) no indicator light when one of the other lines is in use (so if I pick up the phone and start dialing I may well be interfering with someone else talking on the line in the house); (c) no backlight on a display that is difficult to read even in decent light - especially because the phone angle is so low that I have to change positions (almost stand, leaning over the phone) in order to use the display. I assumed these three items would be standard issue. I do love the sound quality - I record webinars and I'm probably going to keep the phone for awhile only because the sound quality with the headset jack is so good. (Hence a 2 star rather than 1)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trancendent!!","review":"Quite possibly, the finest rock and roll since Sir Paul, John, George and Ringo went thier seperate ways.

You WILL like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grunge reborn","review":"Michael Pitt, more known for his cinematic work than musical, is a great songwriter and proves it with his band Pagoda. The effort is a solid album that can take repeated listening. The only thing to criticise is that it does sound like they want to be Nirvana. Saying that, they do have a less 'produced' sound than Nirvana ever had (the sound resembles Bellow's \\"Look Out! Bellow...\\" e.p.), and the inclusion of a cello-player in the band lifts the music above 'just another grunge band'.Thurston Moore has put his name on the sleeve to support the band, a gesture of good will no doubt, because of the work he and Michael Pitt did together on Gus Van Sant's superb \\"Last Days\\".Pagoda is an album I've listened to surprisingly many times. \\"Death To Birth\\" is a truly captivating and addictive song. It's the stand out track amongst many superb concoctions.I hope to hear a lot more of Pagoda over the next years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don\\"t buy this book!","review":"Do not buy this so called new title! I made the mistake being a loyal Barbara Delinsky fan, this is a recycled title being passed off asnew. It is from 1986 I only saw that after I sat down to read it. I is almost twenty years old.

I don't think it's the author's fault - I definitely blame the publisher. I'd would like to see authors adopt what Nora Roberts does - now SHE'S an example of honesty being the best policy. Her new books have a seal on the cover with 'NR' that indicates a BRAND NEW BOOK. Bless her. I will always buy her books, not only because they're always such a good read, but because she is honest enough to insist on differentiating between her older novels (regardless of whether the cover has changed) and her new ones.

However, her latest, \\"First, Best and Only\\" was such a disappointment.

This should have been published in mass paperback, in my opinion. I won't invest in any more of her hardbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found this at the Library","review":"I went to reserve this from the local library and found that I could get it now in largeprint.

That's shameful for so many reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Veggie Tale Lover","review":"This is four books in one. All of the beloved veggie characters make an appearance. My son is particularly fond of the one on numbers. The shape one was a bit disappointing (even a small child can tell you that tires should be circles within one or two attempts...and some of the shapes are hard for kids to recognize). These books are missing some of the humor of the dvds and in general fall a little flat. We love Veggie Tale dvds, but this book is only picked up occassionally (and probably only that often because it has Veggie characters). There are much better books that teach numbers, letters, shapes, and colors, but if you have a Veggie fan, it is probably worth investing in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy","review":"I had such high hopes for these books. I only read the whole series because I did fall in love with the characters, but you need a vivid imagination. Ms.Wallace writes her books about teaching a moral or a lesson and incoporates her characters around what she's trying to preach about. Instead of the lesson and morals Ms.Wallace tries to have her readers pick up on, she looses us because within the whole series her characters do not grow. Some of the dialogue is so horrible! Ms.Wallace writes lines between Erik and Isabelle (and many other characters) that get right to the point, that bring up the past right away like they haven't spoken about it which for bestfriends is really unrealistic. Though the book isn't a terrible loss to an extent, there's so much potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"tragic.....tragically badly written","review":"This has to be the worst \\"breakdown\\" I have read in years. If not only terrible unrealistic, tragically written and incredibly disappointing, I would not even recommend that you use it for target practice. It is far too bad.

You can tell it is written by a straight woman trying to build high school acceptance in the classroom.DO NOT PURCHASE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, The Pains of High School!","review":"It is so easy to get wrapped up in the imagery and life of Erik and Isabelle. I found myself reliving some of the painful and good moments of high school, almost 35 years ago.Young people now have gay fictional characters they can relate to in Erik and Isabelle.

There are no obvious strays from our modern culture--so that the reader doesn't \\"trip\\" over references to an era that was very different from today.

The first time, it was thought provoking, the second time, life changing. It was skillfully written with detail and poses many questions to the reader.

One was the cut and paste from the first book when the author had to provide information about the background of the town and some of the continuing characters. Maybe it was more noticeable to me because I was reading the first and second books so close together, but it struck me as lazy writing because the language was totally the same. At least find some new way to express the same information. Yes, one character is gay and hates his first name, another one won $25,000 on Jeopardy-- but neither point is germane to this particular mystery!Second, the climax when the killer is revealed is handled in almost exactly the same way. Not that the killer is any surprise. Western Union couldn't have telegraphed it any more obviously.So, no, I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cozy mystery!","review":"I discovered this series while \\"surfing\\" on Amazon one day.

But he who has the perspicacity to read it will have gained great initial insight into traditional Catholic prophesy.It must be noted that the book is a bit dated in terms of historical interpretation. Completed in the early seventies of the last century, there was much emphasis on the monolithic communist empire in terms of historical interpretation. But, if the Zionist movement is substituted for communism, the prophesies and interpretation make perfect sense even today.This lovely little book should be a source of great reflection and further study. We are very grateful to the wonderful folks at TAN Publishing of Rockford, Illinois for bringing it to print in this attractive new format."},{"rating":"2","title":"So accurate it's scary","review":"This is a small but powerful book.

Strange people live there. That's about it. The plot is non-existent, and there are no chills at all. It's somewhat funny at times, but I think the joke is ultimately on the viewer.

The authors have devoted a chapter to the Second World War ... that utterly fails to mention the Holocaust.Considering the education of those who authored the work, it is hard to escape the conclusion that this was a deliberate omission. That this event is not mentioned makes me wonder what the real thrust of this work is and what political agendas the authors might have.

Reminded me a lot of A Simple Plan by Scott Smith, which is a novel on the same kind of idea that I enjoyed infinitely more because of the character development (they also made that one into a film with Billy Bob Thornton). Also similar to the Marcus Sakey story Good People (if you're one of my Chicago pals, you need to read some of Sakey's stuff - a lot of it based there and his book The Blade Itself based in Bridgeport!).

The software driver does not mitigate the dreaded \\"you have removed a USB device unsafely\\" Windows error message, which happens each I switch the switch.

However, there is no discussion of the ethics, personal sensitivity and discretion necessary to the success of even a \\"Rhino.\\" The book is the notable effort of a fresh college grad, but it's neither deep nor thorough.

No subject is deemed too sensitive to be discussed: the topics of pain, suffering, suicidal ideations, and the utter hopelessness of living with a debilitating chronic illness for which there is no cure -- all are approached without flinching. Each of the essays resonated with me on some level because I've been a CFIDS survivor for five years. If you or someone you love has lived with this awful illness, this book will be of great comfort and will reassure you that you are not alone. The book contains incredible insights on the realities of being sick in a society that does not accept invisible illnesses. \\"Stricken\\" is magnificent in its truth and compassion.

Something so obvious going unnoticed is not a good start. The errors reach a fever by the time we reach the W114-115. Additionally numerous non-standard cars are used as illustrations that will confuse the unaware. As a long time collector of these cars I could only suggest this book if one has enough knowledge to know when it is wrong. I have dozens of automotive books that I lend out and I will not let this one out because there are so many errors.

BUT! None of my birds can figure out how to get to the seed. They keep landing on the ring ABOVE the tray that they are supposed to perch on. They can see the food from there, but fly off after they can't find any feeding ports there. I tried sprinkling seed all over the bottom tray, but all that did was get them there to eat that seed, then they fly off without learning how to reach the seed inside the feeder. So sure, it keeps the seed dry. But after 4 months, I've yet to see a bird actually figure out how to get to the seed. A waste of money for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This feeder can't be beat!","review":"Being 74 years old, I have purchased many birdfeeders in my time.

The seeds stay dry through rain and snow. It is attractive looking and very durable, too. If you live in a windy area, (it was suggested to me) to use a swivel hook when hanging it in a tree, etc. Also make sure the top ring is screwed down tight.

Aubry Malone, a timid English woman, is kidnaped by Captain Black while she is sailing on a ship to run away from an arranged marriage. Jean Luc, Black's quartermaster, is smitten by the fair beauty. Jean Luc's fate is sealed when Black learns of his forbidden love for Aubry. Mix this with a crew with a pirate mentality and you have a page turner full of adventure. It leaves you wanting more. And there is more to come in the next book, RB The Enchantess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"RB: The Widow Maker was very interesting to read. It is written in a way that allows your imagination to make you think you were a part of the story. You had the sense that you were there watching as events took place. Just as you thought you figured out where you the plot was going, it took a turn in another direction which makes the story more interesting. You have to keep reading to find out where it is going next. Very well written. I highly recommend it and look forward to the reading the continued story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Hoped It Would Be","review":"My initial excitement over this book quickly turned to disappointment. Being a priest and a member of a religious order I thought it would be great to read the memoirs of a priest my own age. However, I found very little insight in the book. It seems to me that Father Beck goes to great lengths to tell us about the people in his life yet he reveals very little about himself. Even his musings about God and spirituality at the end of each chapter seem shallow and condescending. Perhaps the writing of memoirs is best left to those who are well seasoned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intensely Personal and Frank","review":"The biggest surprise of this book is how intensely personal the stories are and how open Father Edward is to sharing his innermost thoughts and feelings. Some of the stories made me cry, both with sorrow and joy. Most of all, they made me want to experience the Spirit in my life as intensely and in such a meaningful way. Father Edward's intent in sharing these stories is to show how the people in his life have shown him the way to find the Spirit beneath, and he succeeds wonderfully in doing the same for the reader. In giving us a peak into his private spiritual life, he magnificently shows what it means to be human in the best sense, to be drawn by the Spirit ever more deeply to that special relationship which gives hope and salvation. This is a book worth savoring and rereading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming and Personal Stories by a Catholic Priest","review":"Fr. Beck brings the reader along for a journey through 21 touching and highly personal stories about his life experiences in this easy to read book. I absolutely could not put the book down and finished it all in one day. Some stories had me laughing, some crying, and others both at the same time! It's very unusual to find someone with a gift of telling stories such as Fr. Beck's. He is able to use brutal honesty to allow you into his heart and soul and to imagine walking hand-in-hand with him through some really challenging situations. Fr. Beck doesn't try to gloss over the fact that life sometimes challenges us, but he shows the reader that there is a bit of magic in the strangest of places!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book spoke to me!!!!","review":"Father Edward takes the world of GOD and spirituality and applies it to our everyday lives. In a series of incidents from his own life, Father Edward demostrates how his life parallels a passage of scripture that starts each chapter. He takes the mystery out of the clergy and shows through his example his humaness. He shows how each of us, with all of our frailties and foibles, can be an extention of GOD to all we come in contact with. Father Edward has become part of my spiritual patchwork and I am richer for it. This book is a must read for anyone on or contemplating a spiritual path."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soul is made of Stories","review":"After reading Fr. Beck's book I am once again reminded that the SOUL is made of STORIES ( S O U L = Story Of U/US Longing). God Underneath is an honest, realistic yet hopeful memoir by a vibrant catholic Priest who reveals himself as a real human being. Like so many in this muddle age, Fr. Beck is wondering in the middle ground of not only middle-age but amid the important religious issues of power, sexuality and honest relationships. Fr. Beck reveals just enough about himself to get to a point that the reader can identify with yet not so much that the stories end up just pointing back at him. With an uncommon talent and skill Fr. Beck's very personal stories point always to the GOD UNDERNEATH. This is an exceptional book for those who long for God, whether catholic, heterosexual, conservative or plainly other-wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Perhaps it's because I'm not Catholic (though I am a Christian) and therefore don't rever priests, or perhaps I was looking for something a little deeper, but I just didn't find a thoughful priest writing this book. The little stories with their Sunday school endings, the misplaced angst, and the name dropping of Carly Simon just don't rise to the level of suggesting that this is a man on a difficult spiritual journey. While I can appreciate his continued questioning of the demands of his calling, that is part of the maturation process, not necessarily unique to a priest. I felt cheated by the time I finished this book, for I have known Catholic missionary priests who've lived hard lives who would find absolutely nothing in common with Fr. Beck. I think he thinks he's wasted his life and this is his apology for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointingly uncreative","review":"I bought this book to use in teaching an undergraduate course on John's gospel. The premise was promising: a feminist reading of John's symbols that didn't pit women vs. Jesus/God/the Bible.I was greatly disappointed. Much of the book summarizes traditional scholarship without much critique or creativity. The book could use some substantial editing: it is redundant and just not very well written. And in the end, the author barely delivers on the premise.The best parts of the book were near the ends of each chapter when she engages other feminist scholars who overreact against the very real oppressive reality of patriarchy by throwing out the while Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusted","review":"Seemed like a good set.

So, when I found an copy of this at a flea market I was overjoyed. However, after reading it, I'm kind of wishing I wasn't so lucky. The book has a quirky sarcastic lead, like Arkady Renko, but beyond that there are little to no similarity to the Renko series which is utter gold.

The author of that book had served on a submarine the Halibut and told in a vivid way of his time on her. The book was fascinating.Bowfin by comparson was dissapointing. The writer is either a historian or journalist who simply has written a book based on some secondary sources. It makes rather dull reading. Another weakness is that the unlike \\"take her deep\\" there is no real effort to work out what had really happened during the combat patrols. One example of this was an encounter in which the crew of the sub thought that they sank a battleship. Galantin did a fascinating reconstruction to show that the ship sunk was probably a destroyer and illustrates in some detail why mistakes such as that were made.In Bowfin the author makes no real attempt to look at the reasons why post hostilities evaluations of sinkings were different from those claimed in the war.In sum give it a miss there are better books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vivid accurate account of one subs career in the Pacifc.","review":"I've read many sub books from WW2 to present and this one stands out.

I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something you'll treasure","review":"As you'd expect in a book like this, it tells the tale from Columbus to Madonna, and tells it well, concisely, entertainingly, without being annoyingly fulsome or reverent. What makes this a treaure, though, are all the surprises--you turn a page and find, actually tucked into a corner or attached by glue, replicas of ancient passports, or hand-written recipes, or coupon books from some old immigrant mutual-aid insurance policy. There's even a St. Lucia prayer card from somebody's funeral and the jury's verdict form from a trial of Al Capone. It brings the history to life in a way beyond mere words.

Some movies tend to mature in my mind and I like them over a period of weeks or even months (took me years to like Amadeus) but I'm afraid that \\"IKIRU\\" is beautiful from beginning to end.One of the best things of the movie is the fact that it doesn't want to be a tearjerker. It doesn't try to make us cry and those who would cry at the end will not feel manipulated into it.

If you want to get a view into the inner workings of Japanese governmental society and a man, who could realistically be any number of government employees in Japan, bereft of spirit that has been stripped of him I suggest you buy this movie.

After years of self employment as a clinical therapist and college professor in Pennsylvania, I needed to return to California due to my husband's poor health. I went back to work for the County, (something I swore I would never do). Nothing much had changed except for the exaggeration of the Ikiru themes.

It is timeless in its depiction of corporate/government meaningless work, the jokeying for credit when, miraculously, something is accomplished, and the beauty that life can nevertheless offer to the individual mired in the system. And for film buffs, a true masterpiece. Note particularly the artistry of the scene near the end showing the cloudy sky viewed beyond the electric train catenary wires.

Within that simply outline,however, lies one of the finest examples of film making and acting. The absolutely luminous portrayal of this man as he tries to make peace with his life makes most academy award performances look tawdry by comparison. The direction is without flaw. The Japanese seem to love a sense of poignancy and nostalgia in their art, and this film is absolutely the best example, also, of that love. See this film if you want to see how a movie should be made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film in a terrible transfer","review":"I have been told many times to keep the VHS tapes of important films, and Ikiru is definately one to keep in tape format. This DVD flickers and has large white lines down the center of the picture.

You can hardly see the two men; the film flickers and whiteness enters the scene covering the entire picture, continuing for a long time, reaching into other scenes that follow.The sound is very scratchy, and the subtitles many many tikmes unreadable because of the whiteness and the constant flicker.Then there are the sharp white lines down the center... an unforgiveable transfer. I have the VHS tape..great shape. Hang on to this or buy this tape fast before it goes out of print, and you are stuck with yet another bad Criterion transfer.Be warned..this is the worst yet I have ever seen on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody has to say it...","review":"This is a lousy movie. Tedious, badly written and badly (over) acted, with an excruciatingly slow plot and too long by about an hour. The main character is utterly unsympathetic, has about 2 facial expressions, and perhaps it didn't translate well to subtitles but his inability to spit out a complete sentence--mildly humorous when remarked upon by another character--rendered the movie almost unwatchable. The two most interesting and somewhat sympathetic characters play brief roles and then are gone without a trace.A real stumper is why he was able to make something of his life by pushing through a proposal to turn a cesspool into a park, yet was completely unable to find some connection to his son by the time he died. In fact his son (and to a lesser extent his daughter-in-law) plays a puzzlingly minor role in the overall plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"This is an uplifting, carefully crafted movie by a master.

So I tried another Crest product: Crest Complete Deep Clean. I called him up over a week later and said I still felt an odd taste in my mouth so I didn't think it was healing properly. My mouth was getting more sensitive to cold liquids and the taste in my mouth was worse than ever before. He said, \\"Your mouth is totally healed.

He also does a great job of dissecting the Big Apple back when there was something dark and festering at its core.This isn't a novel so some may not like the way some things were left unanswered but that's real life. Real life mysteries aren't always neatly wrapped up in a bow in less than a CSI-hour.If you want to read a wonderful real life mystery book then this is the one for you. The 'good old days' weren't always good and neither was Mister Poe and Stashower does an excellent job of reminding us of this.It also offers up some interesting facts as well, such as Edgar Allan Poe was a Sergeant Major in the Army, occasionally dined with Thomas Jefferson, and that the gangs of New York weren't the only thugs in town.Good stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stashower covers already published material","review":"Stashower has used images, ideas, and archival information already covered by Amy Gilman Srebnick in \\"The Mysterious Death of Mary Rogers:Sex and Culture in Nineteenth-Century New York.\\" Srebnick's book is a brilliant discussion of gender, class, and sexuality in the nineteenth century. It is too bad that rather than cover new ground, Stashower uses Srebnick's important work without going any further.David BrodyAsst.

To a certain extent it's a biography, maybe even two biographies, that of Edgar Allan Poe and of Mary Rogers. To an extent it's a true crime story about the actual murder of Mary Rogers. In another way it's the story of the media attention to the real murder and the serialized version that Poe was writting. And finally it's a story about the New York City of the 1840's.Actually, of course, it's all of these combined into one, but more than that it's a well written story that holds your attention from beginning to end. It makes you wonder if Poe really had some kind of inside information source to explain how some of the details of the real murder got into his story. Was he perhaps famous enough at the time to get the police or someone in the police to talk to him?What is known is that Mary Rogers and Edgar Allan Poe both went to New York. They both nad a difficult life, and both died very young, and in mysterious ways.

It seemed to dive into great detail about side characters and devote entire chapters to characters that maybe didn't need to be developed as well as they were, for example an entire chapter was written about the creator of a newspaper just to give detail about the author of an article about a trial, further slowing the pace of the book.

This made for me the reader a conundrum unfulfilled and wholly unsatisfying - thus wondering why the author went to the trouble of writing on this frustrating subject in the first place.Next time I would suggest that Mr. Stashower choose a topic that offers the reader more substance than tone and period atmosphere - one with anactual resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acorna's Soul is Shrinking","review":"The first volume of this series was wonderful - a great story, with great characters, danger, intrigue, romance...well, you get the picture. In the course of her search (in 5 volumes), Acorna has encountered a number of people - very few of them with any socially redeeming value. The few new characters introduced in the later sequels are almost entirely nasties, if not outright villeins. It seems that McCaffrey (or someone) is determined to show that all peoples, particularly those from a venerated past, are mean, low and self-centered, particularly scientist types who really want to either exploit or explore our heroes without their consent. I'm not sure where this is going but I sure hope McCaffrey and her heroine get there fast.

Santa was under the impression that Breyer is the best when it comes to horse stuff. Unfortunately, when Mom went to put it together, some of the thin, brittle plastic parts actually cracked and/or broke off during assembly. The joints of the barn don't stay joined, the barn doors come off, and as mentioned, the horses don't stay standing up.

The box also came with a missing piece, the cupola on top, so it doesn't look as nice as it should.I contacted the customer service number listed on the instructions and was told that I had to return the item to the store and the store was responsible for getting me the missing piece.

I am astounded at the amount of things breaking on this stable, and the companion truck/trailer set my daughter was given as a gift. The concept and look is great, and the opportunities could have been endless for play if my daughter was not bringing pieces to me one by one from these sets. She is 5 years old and gentle with her toys, but this toy simply can not handle being played with even as intended. There are things we can fix, like the cupola or roof shifting/falling off, but it is also beyond repair where gate/door hinges break. We were without receipts for this item or it would have gone back the first day when the breaking began. We have had a much better experience the Schleich jeep and trailer purchased for her 3 year old sister, but have not found a similar sized stable.

And forget keeping the little chimney on without some super glue. My husband and I both put it together several times, and my husband can rebuild motors for pete's sake! We're not clueless people by a long shot when it comes to assembling things, but this stable frustrated us both beyond belief. The pieces absolutely would not stay snapped in correctly, no matter what we did!I had planned to try and glue it together, but instead decided to junk this to the recycle bin because I've already wasted enough time on it.

Perhaps the most interesting part for me was seeing just how connected the royal houses were. John of Gaunt's decendents formed the houses of York and Stuart and the kings of Portugual (with first wife), the kings of Castile and Leon (with second wife), and the house of Tudor (with Katherine).

It goes to show that with a bit of digging into the past you can unearth some real treasures in more ways than one.This book tells the story of a woman who was born the daughter of a French herald, with no noticable prospects before her. Katherine de Roet is a little known (today) figure of English history, but she is still important. For without her long term liaison with John, Duke of Lancaster, much of English history (and it's royal family) as we know it today, would never have happened.The author has done a pile of original research for this novel (some of it is detailed at the beginning), and it pays off with a rich portrait of Katherine, her times and the people she lived with, through the ups and downs of her life.All said, this is a superior historical novel, that makes you wish you could find out *more* about the real (not just the novel version) Katherine Swynford."},{"rating":"1","title":"PUBLISHING ISSUES","review":"The first point to make is that this is a wonderful historical novel.

The publishers should be ashamed to charge so much for something into which they have put so little care and attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama in Medieval England","review":"This novel is one of my favorites because of the rich history of medieval England woven into a tale of romance, endurance and sacrifice. The Lady Katherine Swynford truly comes to life as the reader follows her life from her early days in the convent, through her difficult marriage and on to her place as one of the most powerful women in England as well as the ancestor of one of the royal families.The descriptions of the countryside, the living quarters, the uprisings, the wars and the drama of royal life paint a very vivid picture of this time period and manage to put across all those details even though the book spans Katherine's entire lifetime. Although what happens is real, you feel like it is a fairy tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katherine","review":"A fantastic historical romance - and a fairly accurate one - fascinating descriptions of the 14th cent - and the impact of the Black Death in Europe - and the incredible romance of John of Gaunt and his beloved Katherine - and even important personages of Edward III, Queen Philippa, and Geoffrey Chaucer - it's full of well-drawn historical figures who have left their mark on the history of the Western world. It is especially fascinating to a devoted student of British history...and descendant of the heroine and her beloved Duke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katherine","review":"I read this book in the late '50s. I remember it as one of the best books I ever read and was so sad when the book was finished. I have always recommended it to my friends even though it was a difficult book to find. Now that it has been re-released I look forward to reading it again. The details of living in those days was detailed and as accurate as I have ever read. I lived with Katherine all of the days I was reading about her life. It is a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This was an incredible book. While it wasn't 100% historically accurate it was wonderful. As soon as I was done with it I rushed out and bought Green Darkness, also by this authour, and also a wonderful book. If you like authours like Sharon Penman and Jude Devaroux you will like her. This was not a bodice ripper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katherine is a multi-read through the years","review":"Read it first in high school English (1968) and still re-read it. Excellent Historical Fiction which will probably snag you on Anya Seton's writing.I recommend The Winthrop Woman as well. And Theodesia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I have read this book at least 3 times. The story was well and richly written. The first time I read it I could not put it down. It has a wealth of info about 15th Century life."},{"rating":"2","title":"hopelessly romantic","review":"I LOVE this book. I love Anya Seton and this is another magnificent book. This is one for the hopeless romantics like myself. Not the smut romantics that want details of sexual acts because you will find none of that here. Seton writes magnificently and leaves much of the down and dirty to our imaginations. She leads us on a beautful trip that reminds us that there is someone out there for everyone and when that person is found no matter what you can be happy in their embrace. Full of right on historical details with real people. I can not wait to read this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real History","review":"I love history and reading novels that bring real people to life for the reader are the best in my opinion. I once dated a man named John and his sister likened us to Katherine Swinford and John of Gaunt. I enjoy Anya Seton's writing and have read several other books by her but Katherine will always be my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly unforgettable read.","review":"This was my first experience in the historical romance genre, and to date, I have never come across another quite like it, although Avolon and Green Darkness came close. I have read it countless times since high school in 1970. The reader does not experience Seton's characters and their experiences through his/her own eyes, but are allowed priviledged passage inside her books to laugh, love, cry and bleed, through her devastating characterizations. She raises long forgotton ghosts to their proper place in history"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read and I read alot!! If you can buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So romantic, it makes you fall in love....","review":"I was delighted with this book and found it difficult to put down. I fell in love with Katherine and John and despaired with them. This book made me thirst to know more about English royalty and the history of the era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and Flat","review":"Many people adored this book, as evidenced by all the 5 star reviews, but I was not one of them. It took a real effort of will to trudge through this drawn-out emotionally dry and dusty tale. The writing style reads very much like a romance novel from the 1950's or 60's with characters who seem over-simplified and shallow, rather like how you might tell a story to a small child (except for excruciating detail in just about every other way- down to what each and every serf and shepherd are wearing). I never really understood what drew Katherine and John together because they aren't written as especially engaging or likable characters. They are both good-looking. And he is rich. And she is pious. So if that's what appeals to you in a novel, this may be something that sets your heart on fire. If you are hoping for more, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"I discovered this historical novel years ago and have read it more than once.Anya Seton painted vivid characters and clear pictures of life in 14th Century England, using as much historical fact as possible. I have been requesting the Kindle version for as long as I've had a Kindle, so was thrilled when it appeared. The only thing lacking in the Kindle version is the family tree that I referred to frequently in the hard copy version to keep all the royal family straight. THANK YOU for making this available on Kindle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Going Back to What Was Good","review":"I have just ordered Katherine to read again, also Green Darkness and Winthrop Woman. I loved these books when I was a teenager. I wish that a publisher would sell Anya Seton's books as a boxed set. A new generation of readers would appreciate her writing. No better author of historical fiction/non-fiction is out there. Anya Seton's books are no longer available in the library, so I came to Amazon to be pleasantly surprised that they are available! I would recommend these books to anyone, of any age. I first read Anya Seton as a teenager in a condensed Reader's Digest version (Winthrop Woman)and have been hooked ever since (at the age of 47 I am rediscovering her work again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this Book! It's everyone's favorite!","review":"I highly recommend this book. I first heard of it when my British Literature teacher said it was her favorite book. I went to the library to rent it and the librarian said it was her favorite book. I read it, now it is my favorite book. I bought the book (so I could read it again) and lent it to my mom. It is now her favorite book. It's romantic and entertaining and historical and just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate Love Story","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was a very passionate love story and I was compelled. I did need my dictionary handy to understand a few words but it was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos","review":"Under normal circumstances, I'd give this book 5 stars because the writing and story are brilliant. However, the number of absolutely ridiculous and unwarranted typos in the text was so irritating I seriously thought about calling to complain and ask for my money back. What a disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Love Story","review":"Since this was written in the fifties you don't get the raunch that love stories nowadays have, but it was good none the less. The story, for me, began too slow and ended too fast, with so much time passing inbetween that you had to be caught up with nearly every chapter, or every \\"part\\" so that sometimes you were left confused and wondering. That was why I gave it four stars. The writing is great, however, very discriptive and enjoyable. The characters themselves are very in depth and realistic, and the time spent with each one is appropriate. I did love the ending, with Katherine finally marrying her long time lover, and discovering the fate of her daughter who had disappeared years ago, something I correctly predicted before it happened. I'll recommend this book to all my friends, and to anyone who reads this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll keep this book forever!","review":"I still have my paperback copy of Katherine, falling apart, old and yellow. It's such a wonderful and well-told story I can't bear to part with it. I re-read it periodically, and will pass it on to my daughter. I'm going to buy the hardbound copy for my library. This is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My mother confiscated this book when I was 12 years old!","review":"Yes! I came across her old copy and started reading it. Apparently she thought some of the concepts were too \\"adult\\" for a 12 year old. All I could remember of the book was the first chapter, when Adela de Northwode tells Katherine she has eyes \\"like a rabbit's fur\\" and \\"near as large as a sheep's\\".When I came across the book again in my high school library, it became my constant companion and a refuge from the \\"terrible\\" teen years. I still have the copy I acquired then - now a very sad paperback indeed.If you enjoy historical romance, with more than a touch of authenticity, READ this book. For detail, it is way ahead of the competitors in this genre.Poor old Hugh Swynford - what a way to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my alltime favorite!!","review":"I've read this book twice - just this past year and the first time over 22 years ago. It's my absolute favorite. If you like historical romance, this you will love."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Read!!","review":"I first read this book over 30 years ago. I just ordered it yesterday and can't wait to read it again! I had long forgotten about it but now remember it was one of my favorites! My daughter is all into the show \\"The Tutors\\" which is based on the times of King Henry the V111, 15th century and I know she is going to love this book as well so I got her a copy too. This book was first published in the 50's. I remember History was so very accurate and well written you could almost believe you were walking the halls of the castles right along with Katherine!! Again I can't wait to get my hands on this book again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great favourite of mine.","review":"I was given this book to read years ago and like many other readers, I read it maybe once a year or so. We even visited her grave in Lincoln on a visit to England! For those who enjoyed this book, seek out the Sharon Penman novels such as Sunne in Splendor, Here Be Dragons, Falls the Shadow etc. They are in the same league as \\"Katherine\\". Knowing who Katherine was now, I always look for references to her in royal family trees and the like. I get great satisfaction by knowing exactly who she really was and that she was the ancestoress of the Tudors, another of my faviourite topics. There are a number of women in history that make my favourites list, and Katherine is right up there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and well written","review":"I loved this book. I was immersed in it right from the start. Ms. Seton really gives you an amazing historical experience while telling an incredible story about the Lady Katherine. We chose it for our book club and it was a sucess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to send it back","review":"This wonderful historical novel showed up on my Kindle like it had been copied from a secondhand paperback which had fallen in the bathtub a couple of times. Every page had miscopied words and names. What a disappointment. Amazon wants Kindle readers to have a seamless reading experience....this wasn't it. I will buy it again IF they clean up the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Piece of Historical Fiction!","review":"Anya Seton matches Philippa Gregory for historical fiction and outstanding writing. This was another book that I couldn't put down and which led to my purchasing others by the author. I definitely recommend this book for anyone interested in English history or in a good romantic sage which is well written by an articulate, literate individual."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Floyd, A True Pioneer","review":"King Floyd is truly a pioneer of today's R&B and is also a legend. I had the pleasure of playing in King Floyd's band as Keyboardist and I can truly say that King was a legend and one of the greatest writers of the 1970s era. If you are a fan of 'Old School' R&B music, I'm sure you will not be disappointed and can really appreciate this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Caution","review":"This book although well written was disappointing because it only covers the fundamentals and the basics of investments and portfolios. I suppose I was looking for something more in depth and challenging and this wasn't the write book. But if you are looking to learn the basics this book seems like a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast delivery","review":"Needed this book for a Financial Investing class, I ordered it on thursday and received it Wed the following week.

But after just a few months the DVD player started going out and completely died. OK, so we got an external DVD player not the end of the world and that went good for a short time. Now the TV won't turn on! After only two years this thing is completely as dead as a door nail. Stay away from Akai. Just google Akai TV problems and you will see how chronic their reliabilty issues are. I wager that a lot of people on here who gave it great reviews are either now pissed (or shortly will be) about how their TVs have died very far before what their life expecancy should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Television, and a Great Price!!","review":"This TV is exactly what we were looking for. The built-in DVD player is a big plus. We wanted to be able to play our in-house DVD movies on this unit, and I was concerned how, and if, they would play. After reading good reviews elsewhere, I ordered it, and have been very satisfied. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and function","review":"I got three of these to run slide shows continuously for display and they've been great. I like the side loading DVD player because it keeps it under 4\\" thick. The only disadvantage I see is that you have to have the remote to use DVD menus. The button controls on the unit are limited and basically only for the TV functions. Overall it's a great value for the size and functionality for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Akai TV Sucks","review":"This piece of junk lasted 2.5 years. After about a year the screen quality degraded with black smears in various places. At 2.5 years it quit working completely. Since I paid about $750 for the piece of junk that's a cost of $300/year. What a deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price... great","review":"I've had the TV for about a year and a half or more. The DVD player never worked from day one, so I'm not judging by that, I have an Up-Converter with HDMI anyways. But the TV is great. Picture quality is great, shows in 1080i (I have the 32 in), has HDMI input, and HD component cable input. My beefs with it are that it will randomly switch between mono and stereo sound, and I have yet a way to figure out how to make it stop. After about 9 months, you could here a small crackle in the sound every once in a while. And now, there is a dead/dying pixel. But honestly, for the price I paid for a 32 in HDTV.... phenomenal.ps. The Start up takes a long time.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV as well as wonderful computer monitor","review":"I've had this Akai 27\\" for over 1 1/2 years now, so my review is based on extensive use and long past the factory warranty.It's just as good as described by all the happy customers who've posted their comments here.I don't know what to add, except that after 20 months it's still going strong.The DVD player works fine, except of course it's not as good quality as the more recent DVD players that have come out during the past year. Still, the convenience is wonderful, and the quality is as good as anything I've been watching for the past five years on DVD.My only complaint would be that the sound cannot be turned up to a loud volume: small room volume only.This TV/monitor is being used about 8 hours every day, and I could not be more pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland with SEEDS and peels!","review":"I was VERY disappointed when I received these pears. They are not peeled and the seeds are not removed. The peels alone I could probably forgive, but many pieces have seeds and/or core, which make for difficult eating, especially for children. Even the taste is rather bland. They are not sweet pears at all, and are leathery texture. Definitely not a child-friendly snack! Now I'm stuck with close to fifty bucks worth of seeded dried pears, because you can't return food. Definitely would NOT recommend -- I would give it zero stars if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real houserockin'and trash talkin' raw, raw blues!","review":"This is the first of Poonanny's albums...and if you don't know who he is, you better go ask somebody.

Of course watching it as an adult things look a little hokier. I still think however this movie is the king of the kung-fu genre. This movie has a story line, a twist, and great fight sequences. There are five men who each train under a different style; snake, toad, scorpion, lizard, and centipede. Each style represents a different ability.If you like these type of movies where the words don't match the lip movement and lots of whip cracking punches and kicks, then you will love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this bootleg","review":"This DVD is a poor quality bootleg. A company called Celestial owns the worldwide copyright on ALL Shaw Brothers movies. Their digitally remastered DVD has been available for a couple of years, and puts this bootleg to shame. That catch is that you must purchase it from a Hong Kong based web site. Amazon is not allowed to sell it, so they have listed this bootleg. Find a Hong Kong based web site and purchase the official DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"I remember watching this film in Black Belt Theatre when I was a kid.

The fight at the end was good but this movie to me really isnt a kungfu movie but a msytery I havent seen all the venoms films but Im sure that the others have to be better than this one. Im gonna just say that 5 deadly venoms (is bad)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche ridden, \\"worst of kung fu\\" waste of time!","review":"With all due respect to different tastes, I found Five Deadly Venoms lethally boring. I thought the dialog was trite and incoherent, the humor lame and predictable, the martial arts stunts and display average to bad. The plot lack subtlety, imagination or surprise and although some of the sets and costumes looked authentic, I could not finish this loser. Perhaps it was better than bad when it first came out, but hard to watch after more recent kung fu fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"i expected somwthing else","review":"This item had a lot of good ratings and so i decided to get it. It was portrayed as a great martial art film and a must for a collection.

In my review I give this dvd a 1 star rating because of the following: The clarity throughout the whole film is grainy. The quality in color of the picture is very faint. The audio level is lower than normal. It almost seems like someone simply transferred their vhs recording onto dvd and mass produced it. The scene index is also quite poor. Just a blue screen with the thumbnails. If you don't mind any of those factors maybe this dvd is for you.

It used to be a very special thing indeed, I can remember meeting him once in Chicago at a book signing and remember thinking how that man sitting writer THERE, the dude with the leather jacket and the earing could have come up with the prose and imagination of Imajica.

The story is not so much \\"A Hollywood Ghost Story\\" as it is a touchy-feely expression of emotions......in a word, gay. I mean, I liked Galilee and Sacrament even though they were somewhat of a departure from his usual works, but this was too much. This story is sappy. This story is cliche. This book is admittedly based largely on Mr. Barker's homosexual lifestyle, and I just couldn't enjoy the so-called story that seemed to have taken a back-seat to pushing gays.

Clive Barker must be warped to even imagine such demoralizing sexual acts and views. If \\"Old Hollywood or New Hollywood\\" even faintly resembles the goings on in this novel we should burn the whole place down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clive Barker Returns to His Twisted Roots","review":"Let's face it, no one tells a story like Clive Barker. Some writers push against boundries, Barker smashes them, then picks them up and kicks them across the block. After reading Galilee, which I enjoyed, I wondered what happened to the mutalations? Where are the horrific, twisted creatures and the detailed depictions of sexual deviance? Well, this book has all of that and more.The story starts off pretty slow, centering around a soon to be washed up Hollywood actor staying at an old mansion in the hills. The story quickly picks up the pace, involving ghosts, a strange room, kinky sex and some other \\"surprises\\". Once you start reading this book, you won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange, very very strange","review":"I happened on this book by chance at the library, bought it for quarter for it off their discard shelf. Never heard of Clive Barker, know little about him even now. There's nothing on the front cover or on the inside flap to tell you how bizarre the story is going to be (I have the book jacket showing the guy in the tuxedo). Unfortunately I didn't read the back cover mentioning Barker as a horror writer, but I don't think the horror was the whole problem with the reading of the book because I gave up on it during Part 4 (out of 11) before it got into the really weird parts, and then skipped the Epilogue to get it over with. I'm going to return the book to the discard shelf so the library can make another quarter off it. Or sell it at a garage sale so I can redeem my quarter."},{"rating":"1","title":"GLORIFIED PORN","review":"A waste of everybody's time and energy, Barker's talent. I am open-minded, and I hung in there. Whichever characters survive this nightmare, I simply don't care anymore. Maybe the book is a struggle between good and evil; if so, this good reader became too weary of the filth to continue. Quite limited and negative view of women in this book. No love, no inspiration, no redemption. The scariest thing about this novel is how many people think it's great literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barker - a great story-teller,but enough of the sex already!","review":"Four areas that hit me the hardest...1. The reader's breathy performance was terribly distracting. I wont pick up another audio book read by him.2. Barker has a great way of putting emotional states into words.3. The long, drawn-out, scenes of beastiality and other XXXsex stuff were simply not needed.4. There wasnt one character who had my sympathy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A LET DOWN","review":"THERE HAS NOT BEEN A BOOK OF CLIVE BARKER'S THAT I HAVE NOT LOVED, UNTIL NOW. HIS PREVIOUS BOOKS WEAVED SPELLS THAT SO PULLED YOU IN, SO ENTHRALLED THAT YOU COULD BARELY PUT THEM DOWN, LET ALONE LEAVE THEM, WHEN YOU HAD FINISHED. COLDHEART LEFT ME WITH JUST THAT, A COLD HEART. I DID NOT FEEL DRAWN IN AND INVOLVED, IN ANY WAY, AS I HAVE BEEN IN PREVIOUS BOOKS. WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT. I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE IN THE STORY, EVERYTHING FELT CONTRIVED AND \\"SURFACY\\". CLIVE BARKER HAS THE MOST FANTASTIC IMAGINATION, BUT I FEEL IT WAS ON HIATUS IN THIS BOOK. I WILL HOPE FOR MORE THE NEXT TIME OUT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun story, good audio listen","review":"Coldheart Canyon is a stange combination of modern-day ghost story, light erotica and Hollywood parody. The plot's a bit outlandish, but Coldheart Canyon is ultimately a fun story with well-developed characters. I listened to the unabridged audio version, and Frank Muller does a fine job pacing the plot, and making the dialogue sound authentic. Coldheart Canyon is enjoyable overall, and a good listen on audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"i just finished clive barker's coldheart canyon and i wasnt disappointed. i must agree with other readers and say that it was about 100 or more pages too long (unimportant or nonrelevent information), but all in all i wasnt ready for the story to be over when i finished it. it took me about 3 days to read it; when i would start again i didnt want to put it down. it does have a lot of sexually explicit language and scenes throughout the story so if youre weary of those types of reads then i would pick something else (i like those types of reads myself so i thoroughly enjoyed it). i also didnt find it at all scary, frightening or suspenseful either, but like i said i liked the story and in a couple-few years i'll probably pick it up and read it again for old times sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point?","review":"What a time-waster this is...good grief, I kept hoping it would improve or do something, but no...just tripe through and through. What a huge disappointment, can't believe I was stupid enough to keep plowing through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coldheart belongs in the deep freeze","review":"This is one of the dumbest and sloppiest books I have ever read. I was rolling my eyes throughout and at one point I put the book down and said outloud, \\"Geeez, this is bad.\\" A shame because WeaveWorld was brilliant. Money down the drain. Barker should have taken a long vacation before he wrote this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who in Hollywood [ticked] off Clive?","review":"Alas, Barker is going the way of Anne Rice, self reflexive to the point not only of using his own house as a setting, but his own face on the cover. Aside from some interesting dish on the inner workings of Hollywood, this is a mundane tale, shallow, predictable and it reads like a first draft.I found the use of real stars' names jarring, to say the least. While this may have been intended as some sort of tongue in cheek, insider joke of Hollywood, it came off more like Truman Capote with PMS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guilty pleasure","review":"This is just pure entertainment. Give in to it. Clive Barker knows how to tickle his readers in all the right places!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slips into self-parody","review":"I had long thought Clive Barker to be one of the most imaginative writers around today. Books like Imagica, The Great and Secret Show, Weaveworld and even Galilee kept me enthralled and kept Barker at the top of my favorite modern authors list.Coldheart Canyon almost seems as if written by another, less talented writer. I never really got into the rhythym of the book. The characters are flat -- I didn't care what happened to Todd the movie star. Even the \\"classic\\" Clive sections (horror & fantasy) seemed to slip into self-parody -- the grotesque wasn't gross, just descriptive and boring. It was an effort to finish this book, whereas with his other books I had to pace myself not to finish them too soon.I still highly recommend the above titles for fans and those new to his work, but this is one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like buttah","review":"This goes down like butter at first. But after a few hundred pages you realize...ick...I'm eating butter."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarassing read .....","review":"I am not a prude by any stretch of the imagination, but this book is nothing more than a poor excuse for near-hardcore porn. What a colossal waste of time! Back in his \\"Books of Blood\\" days, Barker showed so much raw talent, but now that he can publish anything he writes, it's almost as if he's toying with the print industry, saying \\"Ha! I write this [stuff] and you have to print it - and everyone makes a buck!\\" Do not waste your time or money on this one - it would have made a 3-star short story, but a 700-page novel? I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeuck!","review":"If you've ever suffered from depression - give this one a miss.Maybe if you like nasty horror and pointless sex you might find it's plot appealing - if you can find a plot that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tremondous Effort of the Supernatural","review":"This book was everything...the occult; bizarre, fleshy, bloody, and full of unreality, or is it unreality? However, it was these things that kept me at the edge of the bed each night I picked it up. Mr. Barker, you are one of the most creative writers I have ever come across. It would be an exhibit indeed just to draw the things you have described, especially the peacock. A real accomplishment after your father's death. You write and you write, and the story just took me away. My best to your future endeavors. A good night's read...."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BOOK I'VE READ IN A LONG TIME !","review":"One of Clive Barker's best works. It was hard to put this book done, but i'd find myself doing so after every few chapters just to keep the suspense going a little while longer. I hated to see this book end ! Just where he could have actually ended the book he goes even futher with it. Really makes you think about what Hollywood and the \\"stars\\" are all about. It is truely a wonderful book !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clive wrote this?!","review":"This book was horrible. I was about 3 quarters of the way through it when I realized I no longer cared about the main characters and was hoping they would die and get the story over with.Aside from a couple of the more erotic parts, the writing style in this book didn't seem anything like Clive Barker. The characters were shallow and under developed, the plot didn't have any of the usual complexities you'd expect (total no-brainer), and it was almost painful to read. I actually read it to fall asleep at night which is something I never thought I'd do with a Clive Barker novel.If you want to read a great book by Clive Barker, skip this one and pick up 'The Great and Secret Show'. It's amazing.Hopefully Clive's next book will be more on par with the rest of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"should not have been published","review":"This book should not have been published and if Clive Barker had not already been an established excellent novelist, this book would not have gotten published. Very poor character development - I did not care about what happened to any of the characters - and ridiculous, over-the-top sex scenes. I normally appreciate Barker's smatterings of sex throughout his books but this one seems to have it all throughout the book just in order to keep the voyeur in all of us reading.Some of my favorite novels of all time include Imajica, Galilee, and Weaveworld. These are fantastic, wonderful works of art, and its a shame this book has to tarnish Clive Barker's reputation. Boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just remember Clive has written great ones.","review":"The only thing worse than the style and content of this novel was the length of this novel. It was as if this great author knew how bad this was and tried to write his way out of it---I'm sorry to say that he never made it. Oh so predictable one dimensional characters permeate a plot that wanders and never really comes into focus. His attempt to write dark erotica was pitiful and I felt for his futile efforts. If this book could've been half as long it would've been twice as good---but even at that length it still would've been lousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much, Much Too Long","review":"There's no reason this book had to be nearly 700 pages (hardcover). It goes on and on. A few chapters are devoted to a dog dying, for heaven's sake! They go to the vet, they come home, they go back to the vet, and you keep turning pages. In addition to the careless editing, giant failures in logic undermine the story. The last two sections seem tacked on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Barker is clever and imaginative, but missed his mark with his latest novel. The book seized me at the beginning, but soon grew wearisome. Barker strained to drag the story along for the last third of the book until he could finally find closure. I suggest reading some of his previous noteworthy works first and avoiding this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"inflation","review":"From the vanity photo on the cover to the six hundred page length, everything about this novel is inflated. I heard an interview with Clive Barker on the radio in which he stated this novel started as a short story. It was probably a good short story...in fact it still is. Of the six hundred pages, probably 350 tell an exciting, even chilling story. The other two hundred plus pad, inflate, and bore. The story logically ends and then continues for at least two hundred pages. This is a clear example of a good short story turned into an overwrought inflated novel. I'm glad those extra two hundred pages only cost me fifty cents at the library for overdue book fees."},{"rating":"1","title":"SK #1","review":"Clive Barker is the Liberace of schlock. Along with the rest of the L.A. to Vegas, Tarantino rodent trail."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"I like some of barker's work but this one was so unlike his other work that it was as though someone else had written it. It was too long and drawn out with chapters that served no real purpose in getting the main story across. there was too much emotion put into it. blah blah blah. don't waste your time with this worthless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea...but he didn't know when to stop","review":"This was my first Clive Barker book and I have to say I was impressed initially.The story was very entertaining up to a point. Then it became a burden to finish and silly.It should have ended 300 pages earlier. I was very disappointed. Now, I have no desire to read any more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Scary","review":"As a fan of modern horror novels, I was excited to pick up this book after hearing so many good things about it. What a disappointment! It had been awhile since I read a Clive Barker book, the last being The Great and Secret Show, which I enjoyed, although it was a difficult read.The best thing I can say about this book is that it is an easier read than his usual. The premise is interesting (following the same general theme as Weaveworld) but after the first chapter or two my interest quickly waned. My major complaint is that it was not scary. Not once did I fear to turn the page. Barker includes his usual perversions, such as humans having sex with non-humans and other over-the-top sexual situations. The characters were two dimensional and by the time the book was over you just didn't care. Come on Clive, you can do better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"While a masterpiece of twentieth century literature like The Reach by Stephen King can be shrugged offby the bilious sanctimonies of the ivy league café and their short term/confined influence, recent British migrants like Barker and Neal Gaiman (\\"one of the top post-modern authors\\") have shown a cynical aptitude in colonizing small but affluent markets \\"the business of horror\\" to quote Barker.So Even though he's a Hollywood millionaire who's not much read, despite his tacky writings and atrocious movies (Nightbreed, Lord of Illusions) progressives except him because he coddles their self-image.Barkers only contribution to the tradition of horror fiction has been to sicken it with a slippery self-consciousness outsourcing his flashy persona as the Jackie Collins like book cover here demonstrates."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Teroraea of a Novel","review":"A formulaic combination of the author's tired world-hidden-in-something-innocuous device, and a profusion of dialog and sexuality of the most trivial kind -- which I can only guess is there to meet some kind contractual length obligation. The rest is made up of syrupy coprafluences about Los Angeles, its people, and the author's wanderings about the world in general.The 50-plus page cathardic epilog might have been necessary if the story were in the least bit frightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarantino-esque \\"Dialogue\\"","review":"Clive Barkers new book is touted by Quentin Tarantino on the backcover. There's a preface where he talks about his deal with Disney Corp and associated corporate publishing (often the same owners Touchstone publishing for example owned by Disney) he makes some vague remarks about commercialization but the fact that this will make writers increasingly beholden to movie studios and hack directors trained on T.V. commercials doesn't impress him much apparently. What follows fails to balance the ethical & artistic flaws which the forgoing imply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"This is the first Clive Barker novel I read. I hated it. It reads like it's a pure Hollywood story. Also, the events in the story are so nonsensical, I couldn't help but continuously think, \\"This is stupid.\\"I love horror novels, but this isn't much of a horror novel. I'll never read another Clive Barker book.Added on 2007/03/24: I forgot to mention. This book is huge. 686 pages. At around 3 different points in the book, I thought, \\"Ok now it should end.\\" Yet it kept dragging on. Bleah.I can't recommend this book for anyone. I guess diehard Barker fans would like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very silly book","review":"Not a masterpiece, not incredibly awful---just a mildy entertaining piece of fluff. It occurred to me early on that this book is nothing but a beach read. There's nothing here to challenge your mind. Good book for a long train ride or the ICU waiting room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"The outside of the book looked good. The reviews on the back cover were stellar. I was unable to read more than thirty pages. I felt that I had stumbled into an adolescent ghost story told around a camp fire. Apparently, Mr. Barker tells better stories elsewhere, but as an introduction to this writer, this novel seems to distill misogyny and pointless vulgarity with no purpose but to \\"make fun\\". If one is not a devoted fan of Hollywood and its players, why bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"possibly the worst book I ever read","review":"OK it's supposed to be a \\"parodY' of Hollywood and it's extremes per page 368 \\"There wer movies being shot all over the city. Joyless little pornos..\\" so the author subjects us to pages oh his own ridiculous porno- a woman geting off by letting snails crawl all over and in her vagins, obscene over the top sex acts, etc. The basic premise of the book is not bad but like Hollywood it did not need all the crap filler. The author seems to be obsessed with women and their sex lifes and I do believe he's gay (maybe that's why- unhappy memotries of woman). A book made too long and ruined by grotesque unnecessary sex garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the prudish","review":"This is not the book for just anyone who loves fantasy. You have to be a little warped to be entertained by this story, but then again, if you're reading Clive Barker, what would you expect? If you have a good imagination, and are a bit on the \\"kinky\\" side, I believe you will thoroughly enjoy it. Sexually explicit involving creatures you've probably never dreamed of. Some say it is a bit too long, but I would have enjoyed another couple hundred pages. I've only read a few of Clive Barker's other books, and this one by far has left it's mark in my imagination more than any other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech.","review":"Well...I've been a Barker fan for years and years. And until this point, not a thing has come out that I have not enjoyed. Until now. I have defended his work in the past maybe sometimes when I should not have. I will not defend this. It was garbage. It seemed like just an excuse to put as much sex as you could in a novel without the novel going anywhere. It just kind of ended...and poorly. There was no emotion or feeling for me. The only reason why I give it two stars is because...well...I'm retarded and I like him too much not to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"For years I'd been awaiting Barker's newest publication, constantly checking and rechecking as the dates kept being pushed back, but perhaps they needed to be pushed back even more so that Barker could have turned this pale reflection of his talent into something more moving and cohesive.All of the things I normally love most of a Barker creation were missing or malformed in this work -- the characters were forced into absurd situations, merely so the dodgy threads of this murky story would somehow weave themselves together. The story itself was forced forward instead of propelled by its own momentum of character and imagination. Everything felt out of place, I didn't care about a single person throughout the book's nearly 700 pages, all while I'm desperately trying to like a mediocre work from one of my favorite authors.It just didn't work. Better luck next time, Clive. I'll still be waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out really good but gets almost ridiculous after a while","review":"I bought this book expecting a spine chilling horror novel and got my hopes up during the first 150 pages or so, not because it was scary but because it was funny, interesting and very well written. But then after a turn in the plot (which I won't reveal of course), the story seemed to get a little weird, then strange, then more than a little bit ridiculous. With 450 pages to go, this was a bit of a let down and I probably wouldn't have bothered finishing it if it weren't for the very good opening of the book and the hope that some later parts would be as good. But sadly quite the opposite happened, the last 50 pages were surprisingly bad and I was glad when I could finally close this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified Porn Is Correct","review":"First the story captivates you, and then the porn begins. Usually its ok because books get through it and move on with the plot. Not this book. Page after page, the most detailed porn and underside of the rock as this articulate (obviously) gay man can muster.Plot is second to his getting his rocks off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy this book","review":"I checked this book out from my library as cover picture and blurbs made it sound like a good old-fashioned mystery. I had never heard of the author before.I quickly lost interest and stopped reading it. It's not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it","review":"I picked up \\"Coldheart Canyon\\" by Clive Barker because it was a Hollywood ghost story and I enjoy those Hollywood stories. Unfortunately, I chose the wrong book to start reading Clive Barker. I heard that his books were great, but although this story started out okay, it soon become drawn out and slow and boring. I could not connect to the story or the characters whatsoever. I was looking for horror not sex. Can anyone recommend a better Clive Barker story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I started it! Whilst it is not my favourite of Barker's works (Imajica still tops the list) it definetely shows that Barker is right there in top form. It does get a little dragging at times but it is still an excellent work. Barker fans will not fail to miss the references to Weaveworld and Imajica in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great one from Clive.","review":"The past two releases from Clive were kind of a let down for me.Galilee just sort of dragged on and sacrament had much of the same ending. I've been a Clive fan scince the middle eighties and read everything,so it was nice to see a return to old form in my eye's.Cold heart canyon was a haunting ghost story set in the Hollywood hills,lots of spooky characters,sexy scenes,and lots of grisly horror! It mixed elements of weaveworld-the tile room- with a fireside ghost tale. Fast paced action and maybe a realistic view into the lives of Hollywood's rich and famous?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A SUPER FANTASTIC EXTRAVAGANZA OF FUN","review":"Two dog friends want to see if there is more to life than eating garbage and chasing annoying squirrels. What they find on their circumnavigation of the globe is an extravaganza of fun: a techno-color magic carpet ride in India, spaghetti trees in Italy and tight rope walking under the Eiffel Tower.

I have long loved fair isle, but have usually backed away from it as it always seems so daunting. After reading all the wonderful reviews, I thought I'd bite the bullet and give this book a go. I was not disappointed. It is very comprehensive with stacks of basic traditional fair isle patterns and lots of really helpful history and instructions. My only critisicm is that some of the actual patterns are a little outdated, would one actually ever wear some of the jumpers? Having said that, the kids ones are adorable and there are some beautiful gloves and a scarf that you can 'dip your toes in' with before starting on the larger projects. This a really minor point as there are full and easy to read instructions on how to make your own fair isle project, which is probably the way to go anyway. I think with this will be the book to help me get over my fair isle phobia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional inspiration","review":"This book is a keeper as I love to have basic books for my library, however the color inspirations are fairly traditional and I tend to like more vibrant mixes of color. The book gives a plethora of patterns and designs from 1+ row peeries to seeding patterns, 8 different norwegian stars to more elaborate 19 row patterns and borders as well as all over patterns...surely this book will let your imagination soar once you pull out your own graph paper and colored pencils. I can imagine using self striping yarn with a coordinating solid to get a beginner like me started. Mittens, gloves, beret, vests, sweaters for the whole family...much better than having loose pieces of paper that can get lost, and I love how the book encourages the reader to create their own designs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very outdated","review":"I bought this book because it's supposed to be a \\"knitting bible\\" on Fair Isle Knitting. Well, the designs on the book are really boxy, very outdated and the color choices are a bit shocking. Maybe this is inherent of fair isle knitting (although I don't think so). Anyway, there is no way I'd be caught wearing one of those really awful, boxy designs. I bought the Aran Knitting book by the same author and loved the designs there, so this is very disappointing. I made the mistake of not looking when the book was published and if it has been revised (it hasn't) so save yourself some money and some shelf space and wait until Ms. Starmore updates this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"back in print WOOHOO!","review":"I just saw that this is coming back into print in paperback.

Good history and patterns.","review":"Alice Starmore's phenominal study of Fair Isle knitting provided me with everything I want to know about it: history; common designs used in Fair Isle knitting; great patterns; enough help for me to learn the techniques of manipulating two yarns at the same time; enough guidance for me to design my own patterns; and beautiful, inspiring color pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"hook, line and sinker","review":"I think Ms. Starmore is over rated.

However, through normal use, the player wouldn't play through the left speaker/headphone!!! Furthermore, contacting Digitalway is so painful (perhaps purposely?) that it doesn't seem like its worth the time. After 5 letters and e-mails, I just gave up. This makes the warranty useless. Afterall, how can you use it if the company won't even respond? So, buying this product is somewhat a gamble, and at $125, you might want to search for other products by other companies. Of course, if you have the cash to blow, you can just buy an iPod.

When i download music the program ALWAYS freezes (im also using xp.) Today i was deleting some files and it freezed so i did my regular thing of un plugging the usb stick and then all my songs went missing! but the room those songs took up is still taken so i tryed to download more songs and it wont let me! Dont buy this product because u will have no luck with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had such high hopes","review":"I had great hopes for this player. There is even a free after market software for it. There is a Yahoo owner's site which does help. The player has good memory. It looks good and it is light. BUT, it is a pain to download music into it. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is not only slow, but sometimes the downloading process freezes. Also,it is hard to connect it to other software like Musicmatch or Windows etc. One night prior to going on vacation I tried to remove an old playlist and fill it up with new music and I was unsuccesful. I have wasted hours upon hours trying to get my play lists into this machine. Now the problem has worsened. Ughh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The player is ok, the software is a joke","review":"Don't waste your money on it!I bought this player from ***.

It is too buggy to be a commercial roduct.It supports SD card, good, but don't expect to load files viaa card reader, the player won't find them!The only pro is the earbud, I used it with my PDA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a Different One","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER!!!!

I run on a treadmill while listening to it, and it's worked great. I've been told I have a fat head, but my ears must not be proportionate, because the in-the-ear headphones were uncomfortable. Once I switched, there was no problem. The FM mode radio works great (no AM). Learning to load the MP3 files was pretty easy. More than enough memory for my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent MP3 player: needs better ear buds","review":"...What is good:The mp3 player works well. Equalizer works okay. Size and footprint are great. Smaller than some pagers. Leather case is excellent. The software is easy to work with. The menu system on the player itself is easy to work with. SD card expansion slot is good. will be getting a 512 mb sd card for about 150 to augment the memory.what is not so good:While the radio reception is great, the playback is so so. mp3 playback is a lot better. The earbuds are so so. Swapped them for a much better philips ear bud.

I am very happy with the Digitalway MPIO FL100.Pros: Small size of the unit. Mostly intuitive operation (after a few minutes of use, the buttons make sense). FM radio is nice. Good sound (I imagine it will be even better with better headphones). Memory can be expanded, unlike some other 256 MB MP3 Players.Cons: I wish it worked with MusicMatch Jukebox, but this is a minor inconvenience. In some places, the instructions are almost indecipherable; a re-write of the manual is in order, using better English. The inclusion of an FM radio recorder is baffling; does anyone actually do this?All in all, a great purchase. The \\"cons\\" keep me from giving this a \\"5\\" rating it would otherwise deserve.

The shiny side is all cracked and the outside is all dirty. But it's still working. Great fm reception and amazing mp3 sound!

Also, it can only access another 512mb of external memory, which is not shown anywhere in any documentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of flaws and lousy service","review":"Soon after buying the player it seized up during uploading and couldn't be revived. I sent it to the company that MPIO uses for repairs in North America and had a series of problems with them over the 8 weeks it took to get the player back. Since its return it has proved to be prone to crashing and needing to have the battery popped out to reset it. Finally, the software used to up/download files is very buggy and quite slow. You would be wise to steer clear of this company altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this actually work?","review":"Yes it is light weight. Yes it looks good. Yes it has nice features.

All I did was simply hit the delete key to delete a 14MB song that took the total flash memory used to around 420MB and the thing is now completely useless. I tried rebooting my computer and completely restarting FY200 to no avail. Somehow all those 420 songs are still in the flash memory, but completely UNACCESSIBILE on the device itself. No clue. My dear hubby got this for my birthday 2 weeks ago - we have the Best Buy receipt and I'm taking it back today and keeping the cash or maybe will try an IPOD or minidisc.

It's very small (pager size) and does an awful lot on a single AAA battery. Overall I'm very happy with it. Both the player and the accompanying software are easy enough to figure out without much time spent reading the manual. The sound is impressive even with the original headphones they provide (based on MP3 files sampled at 192K). A couple thoughts:1. The carrying case is so tight it's hard to slide the unit into and out of it. And it doesn't quite fit right. And the carrying strap is a nuisance to put on and take off.2. The access doors to the battery and expansion card slots are a bit flimsy.3. The install CD worked fine on Windows 2000 but was a bit flakey on XP professional.4. The unit is assembled in China, not Korea.5.

I use it primarily for jogging and it definitely is not designed for that purpose. The buttons on the side are extreemly tiny and not easy to identify with a quick feel. The carrying case is so tight that it actually depresses the volume buttons - I had to actually cut out part of the plastic so that would stop happening. The overall user interface isn't memorable either.That said, the size is perfectly tiny and the expandability is something that most players this size don't offer.

The unit was small, had good sound quality, and worked well overall. However, once I upgraded the firmware to allow the device to be used as a USB mass storage device, there was no going back (literally). The player could no longer function as an mp3 player, only as a mass storage unit. Myself, and many other disgruntled customers, contacted customer service via phone and e-mail. There was no e-mail response and during the phone call a secretary took my contact information and I was never contacted.I would consider buying from another Company if you expect any customer support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, Easy to use.","review":"The manual has its translation issues, but if you're vaguely familiar with computers, the software is easy to install and use.

The earphones included in this are terrible. I replaced them and the sound improved, but I am not impressed with the sound. The bass is weak even with the new headphones and the equilizer set to dynamic bass. Also, the first time I went to use it, the system turned off and wouldn't allow me to play any songs. It has done that twice for no reason at all and no warning. I have only owned it for 6 days.Save your money! I had better sound with my portable cd player.

Unlike other reviewers, I am impressed with the audio quality, the bass in particular is strong and rich, but only with different headphones. I am using some of the $50 Sonys. Battery life is also amazing, typically more than a full day with volume up high. My unit turns itself off only when the battery is low. My caveat is that tech support is non-existent. The player's LCD broke in my briefcase, and although the unit still plays as well as ever, I can't read the display. The voice/radio record function should be handy, but the file format is unusual and I can't play the low bitrate wave files on my computer. Hence I can't save a lecture or meeting notes for example. With all that, I would buy another one, with as much memory as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"My only regret is that I didn't get the one with 256MB of internal memory.

Yes, it is compact and lightweight but the problems outweigh this. The software included with the mp3 player is horrible, and while trying to upload songs onto the player, the program will freeze up. I have downloaded all of the software upgrades to no avail. The mpio website, just like the manual for the mp3 player, is not in english. Well, I guess they are, but whoever translated them did a very poor job. The broken english is hard to understand and the player is hard to figure out without proper instructions. I would not recommend ANY mpio products, especially this one. I would stick to brand names like the iPOD where you know you will be able to get the proper support. That will be my next purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Software and Indecipherable Manual","review":"While the sound produced is admirable, the software is, to put it kindly, \\"weak\\". Windows XP locked several times during download or erase attempts, requiring rebooting. The manual purports to be written in English, but is indecipherable and, for all practical purposes, useless. The actual capacity is somewhat less than advertised (possibly also due to a software glitch). Running or a session at the gym will often affect the performance. The battery power is a plus when travelling, a few small AAA batteries, each lasting about 8 hours, being less cumbersome than a charger. Overall, however, just not in the same class as the ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted (buyer beware)","review":"I bought this player about 6 months ago. Initially very impressed by sleek design and convenience of a small, lightweight player. Sound quality was fine to me, though I don't profess to be an audiophile.A few weeks back the player stopped working. Electronics and such seem fine from outside (i.e. player turns on and shows a song \\"playing\\") but absolutely no sound coming out.Within the past week I have left messages with Digitalway customer service and/or technical support via phone and email, but have yet to hear back - not even a confirmation of receiving said calls or emails.If you buy this player, be sure you know what you are getting into. Try calling their customer service line - listed on the website (www.mpio.com), it's almost comical. I spent ~$150 on a player that lasted 6 months and am now an unhappy customer.(If I do happen to hear back from Digitalway in the next week or so I will update this review accordingly)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking for another one!!!","review":"The only positive quality I can think of is that it is priced very competitively. Other than that, I wouldn't use this player/recorder again even if I received it for free. The actual way you navigate through the software is NOT as outlined in the instruction manual, and does not interface well with RealOne player. The control buttons do not respond well to the touch, and using them to navigate through the functions is very confusing. Also, the battery life is grossly overstated; I was killing a AAA battery a day. I highly recommend a Sony Minidisc player/recorder. A bit more expensive, but definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst customer service ever.","review":"I purchased my FL100 a few months ago. The performance was fine, I downloaded a debugged version of their software off the internet.However, I recently went on a business trip and neglected to take along the USB cable that comes with the player.

I thought I got what I needed. One of the main reasons to choose this product was that it had storage capability. But when I got my hands on it, I realized that it reiqured a software to enable the UMS capability, which is not practical for everyday use. I wrote to Digitalway whether it will be possible to release a UMS firmware for FL100, they promised me that they would release it in a very near future. But after some time they announced that they would not work on firmware improvement for UMS support. All FL100 owners became very disappointed after this desicion. MPIO must do everything what they promised. You can visit and see the complaints about their customer and technical support at www.mpio.comI am not a satisfied customer and I protest MPIO since they don't take the necessary action to release a UMS firmware and make the FL100 owners happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot play many MP3 files","review":"Beware of some serious flaws with this poorly designed product. If you have MP3 files ripped from a couple years ago, or using odd bitrates (i.e., not 64 or 128), you are likely to encounter problems with transfering and playing the files.

But I love my MPIO FL100 it holds a decent amount of music and I love the ability to add a 512 SD card to obtain more music. I download from my website straight to my MPIO, with no problem. this unit is compact, sleek, I have used it in the cold, dropped it, my kids have smacked it around and guess what it looks and plays excellent, never skipped. I feel most of the reviewers are complaining about software. I feel once the software issue is resolved they would see this unit is great; Personally I did not have that issue. BUt the radio does suck! i have to move it around like and antennea to get a clear station.

But after a month it is horrible. The program that comes with it crashes and freezes whenever you use it. Making it almost impossible to add and remove songs from the player. When you try and use it with real player instead, the same thing occurs. Leading me to believe it is the payer that has serious issues. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is a waste of money and causes more headaches than anything. I've had this product for a year and it gets worse with time. Please do not waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little player","review":"This is my first MP3 player and it was given to me as a gift. I love it and it's probably the one I would have bought for myself. I love that I can slip it in my pocket or if I choose to use the neck strap, it's so light that I don't notice it. Plus, it just looks so cool. The big plus for me was the FM tuner.A couple of drawbacks: The arm band... Pfft. It completely obscures the controls. The manual was a definite translation. I read it just for kicks. The good thing is that the player is so simple to use that you don't really need the manual. The only other problem I've had is that the software it comes with is a little flakey. I recommend using Windows Media or Real Player to transfer your songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad customer service and support","review":"I bought this player in January and it worked well for about 6 months. One day the display goes dark and I called customer support as a toll call and held for 45 minutes. After an unanswered email, I mailed it in for warranty repair. They denied the work claiming it was damaged and considered uncovered by the warranty. I would definitely buy another brand of player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Player is flawed and Digitalway does not support","review":"I was given the FL100 as a gift and soon realized the product is flawed. If the player is connected to the PC and the battery dies, it will corrupt the internal memory and the player will not restart after replacing the battery. The player BIOS will initiate, however, once the internal memory check is complete the message \\"Battery Low !!!\\" will appear and it shuts down. The internal memory can be re-formatted but the player must be on to do so. I contacted Digitalway regarding this and they said, \\"If the player purchase date is less than 30 days old and you have the receipt, you may return it to the place of purchase. If the player purchase date is more than 30 days and less than 120 days old and you have the receipt, you may return it to Digitalway.\\" The key here is receipt. I also believe they are not really backing this product. I would recommend looking at comparable players and especially the warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"No customer service","review":"This MP3 player works great until you start having problems. I have purchased 3 of these for various members of my family. The first one broke within the 3 month warranty period and I returned it to the company for repair/replacement.

The bad side is that it has very bad sound quality on MP3 and on WMP formats, on top of that it has developed a annoying habit of turning itself off at random times when i took it back to the BestBuy that i got it from the person at the returns desk told me that i was the third person in a month to take one back with the same problem"},{"rating":"2","title":"big sound in little package","review":"Received this player on Friday and was excited to use it per the reviews here on amazon. Took a while to set up manager software since I installed it while cable wuz connected to PC (shouldn't have), so had to re-install software. Then it worked like a charm! Volume is strong, but had to cut a hole in the case to control the volume (if not, the case is so tight it pushes the volume knob skyyyy high!). Had to cut another hole for access to the menu button. Only downside was the wristband is not as useful as an armband would be. Try this MP3 player, you will enjoy this big sound in a little package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good as an FM Radio","review":"I purchased this over a year ago and it has never worked right.

I was hesitant at first but after all the good reviews I decided to give it a try. Right out of the box everything worked great. The instructions ARE poorly translated and, yes, at times unintentionally comical, but that's the worst thing about this device! I've been using it for about 4 months now and if it quit tomorrow, I'd probably buy another one. It's easy to use; the software works with XP and Win Me with no problems. It comes with a great case and decent ear phones (which do get uncomfortable after a while) but they work. I couldn't be happier with my first MP3 player. mpio did a great job with this product! ... I do recommend spending the extra $$ and getting a 256 SD card for extra memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"great design, suspect lousy support","review":"OK- here's the good news: lovely design for the most part. I use it fairly often and haven't noticed any stress problems after about 2 month's use.Here's the bad news: the company doesn't seem to care about customer comments except for 1 cute reaction; the customer community section on their wbsite has beem mysteriously down for an \\"upgrade\\" for a couple of weeks (they must think we're idiots). Doesn't look like they care about firmware upgrades for this model, and their firmware is always released in a beta state- buggy!Their manual is a joke - really substandard English.Bottom line- not quite ready for prime time.

I much more prefer their 1991 \\"Sampler\\" - a more compact compilation, covering the same period. Maybe, because the 'Sampler' has most of the songs that I do like, and only one or two that I don't care for; this way I can listen to it without having to skip tracks (which would be kinda cumbersome thing to do when you play vinyl).Conclusion: If you are just \\"curious\\" about Cocteau Twins (as opposed to being their steadfast admirer, you may be better off with their 1991 'Sampler' than with the Stars and Topsoil."},{"rating":"2","title":"great songs, inferior set list","review":"Ask any Cocteau Twin to choose 18 songs for a compilation, and you're likely to get a different response each time. Still, Stars and Topsoil leaves out too many first-rate songs to be considered truly representative collection.Let's start with track one. Why was Blind Dumb Deaf chosen to represent the Garlands album, and not Wax and Wane? Scanning though the rest of the list, I picked up on some glaring omissions, including From the Flagstones, Crushed, and Oomingmak.Furthermore, a proper collection would have encompassed the whole of their catalogue, not just up to 1990.

The only problem that I had was that they didn't have all the best fights which included some of the anderson silva and lyoto machida fights. Instead they just had 3 miuntes montages of a few different fighters of what they did in 2008. I wish they actually showed the whole fights that are presented in these packages, but they just don't.

Even had people tell my I had to see it 'cause it's a trip. It's a trip, alright! A pretty bad one! What really stunned me about this film is the horrible screenplay! Ugh! It was brutal to listen to! The script was so bad, it was laughable! Sure it was a low budget movie! (You can see the microphone a couple of times and you can clearly see the school yard in the background of the opening sequence.) But if they didn't play this straight, I would have enjoyed it much more! Overall, this film isn't what people make it out to be! You're better off hangin' with \\"The Mack\\"!

Check out The Human Tornado for even more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 hours well spent","review":"This flick looks like a first year film student's end of the quarter grade B assignment. But that's a big part of it's charm, as well as the tons of great one-liners delivered by Dolemite. My favorite part is when Dolemite is confronted by a gang of street thugs who ask \\"Hey, are you really Dolemite?!\\" Dolemite proves his identity by by launching into an endless stream-of-consciousness rap that just goes on forever. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"You would expect someone from Philly to like this movie but don't let their enthusiasm change your mind. Sure, on the surface, this film seems silly and sophmorish but don't be fooled - this movie has depth that modern moviemakers only dream about. The characters breath and develop with every scene.

There was no clearance between the soft body of the bus and the wheels, which prevented them from turning. Because the wheel wells are molded to cover more than 180 of the wheel circumference, raising the body to provide clearance was not an option. Because I didn't want to disappoint my son on Christmas by telling him we had to return the toy, I ended up cutting the case (which is soft plastic) to provide the necessary clearance for the wheels to turn.

I'm just so sad I have to put this gift in the trash. I really wanted to use it. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lot of work from what they portray on TV","review":"My wife purchased this thinking it would be a great thing to be able to make natural fruit juice rather than purchase it in a store with all the additives and sugar..which is true, but the way they market this machine on Tv is far from what you actually get. It is a lot of clean up and you constantly have to clean off the blade because it does get clogged so easily. The spout also doesn't make sense because it goes strait out instead of pointing downward which juice gets stuck unless you are constantly putting fruit in the machine, because it doesn't tilt down. With that being said, since it doesn't tilt down it also has a tendancy to spray out when putting fruit in the machine. This is a good machine for getting natural juice, it's just very very messy and a lot of clean up and the pulp catcher isn't anything to speak about either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job!","review":"I purchased this juicer cause I borrowed a friends and the drive disk that the blade screws onto had cracks in it after I used it. I could not remember if they were there before or not, so I replaced the machine. It works fine. I mainly juice carrots and apples (suppose to help with arthritis - jury still out on that). It is a little involved cleaning the product. All in all, it does a nice job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets the challenge","review":"The juicer is my first. One thing I am not happy about is the groove in the middle compartment which may hold specks of left overs and cleaning that is a pain. The opening was said to allow dropping fruit as a whole, well I suspect that as even granny apples could not fit whole. Good thing is pulp is relatively dry with no juice left."},{"rating":"2","title":"juicing","review":"I bought this for my parents because of gastrointestinal health problems.

I've had juicers for years. They all will juice carrots and leafy vegitables. Incredibly, the Lalane juicer WILL NOT JUICE CARROTS. It will juice about half a carrot before it simply stops juicing the carrot !! And don't even try leafy vegitables. When I checked the power rating of the motor it turns out to be the WEAKEST MOTOR of all of the juicers and at HALF OF THE RPMS!!Returning the juicer is a nightmare as they purposely mix up the order numbers and charge over $24.00 for shipping and HANDLING ! Once they have your telephone number for a return, they block your phone !!! So if you want to call them a second time you will need a different phone.As I said, though, I held Jack Lalane up as a real hero and leader ever since I was a child. Now I know better. Jack is just a salesman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ricardo","review":"The Kack Lalanne power juicer is a farce. The parts are made of plastic and when the break you cannot find spares.

Its better then my old waring juicer and easier to clean. Some of these people who are giving bad reviews I dont think have used juicers before. You always have to clean out a juicer, thats normal.If someone ever invents one that doesnt require you to take it apart and clean it Im sure they will be a millionare.Anyway 100 bucks to be healthy? Its way worth it. By the way I had no problem doing tons of carrots, it doesnt do really well with softer things but firm fruits and veggies were fine, for leafy veggies I followed them with a firmer thing like a carrot."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it wasn't given to me, I would be upset","review":"This was given to me from my brother. He had only used it a few times. I liked it although it is a lot of work to clean. After about the tenth use, as many have alread mentioned, the plastic parts holding the blade broke. Why would they make these parts plastic? That is cheap. I would advise a juicer with metal parts. If I do get another one, it will be better crafted and I hope, last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long to think I would do this daily","review":"I'll keep this short because it's all been said. This is not a good product. It leaves lots of very wet pulp on the inside. I put in 4 leaves of kale, 2 celery stalks, 10 baby carrots, and 3 apples. In return I received about 4 or 5 oz of juice. The cleanup was the deciding factor for me. I even needed a screwdriver. There's no way I would do this everyday. I posted pictures of the cleanup process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whisper quiet motor...","review":"Well, wow is this a piece of junk. I bought it about four years ago and used it a few times. Then I let it sit on the counter for years. I started to use it again for a week. The juice was great but it was such a pain to take apart and clean. I decided to use it again this week. So I just went to the store and spent $200+ on fruits and veggies to do a juice fast. Thanks a lot- on the second day the motor went out and it is completely dead. Whisper quiet motor because it is on its death bed when you buy it. You get what you pay for and for a good juicer you have to pay. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going strong after 8 years!","review":"I bought this juicer at least eight years ago. I love it. I had another brand first that was way too loud and difficult to clean. I juice about 4 times a week but I only juice veggies and an apple; not sure if that makes a difference for some people. I have not had to replace anything. I think it's a quiet juicer - I would say a little quieter than my Oster blender. I agree with another reviewer (and strongly recommend) to rinse the parts as soon as you finish making the juice; it's fast and easy. I don't bother with scouring the stains, I just rinse the parts and set out to dry. One time-saving tip I do: I rinse/clean all my veggies when I bring them home from the farmer's marker and then I separate them into juicing batches in those green, stay fresh bags. That way, when I'm ready to juice, all I have to do is pull out a bag from the fridge and the bunch of veggies is all ready to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks and then breaks again","review":"The motor is supposed to have a lifetime warranty.... but the company makes you pay $40 for shipping, which is too much. It could even be ok if it did not keep breaking, but within a year I have had to pay more than the juicer. On top of that, they sent me the wrong model, and the experience has been awful. I do not recommend this product because of the terrible after sale customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't recommend it.","review":"I got this juicer as a gift for Christmas.

I've ordered a new pulp collector, and three months later am told it's still on \\"back order.\\" I'm on hold this minute (and the past ten minutes). They tell me the parts are made in one country and the orders are taken in another, so they don't really know what they have when they take your order.

I would go into kicks of juicing, then forget about it for a while. I've had it for about two years now, and the only reason it lasted me this long is because of my infrequent juicing. In my latest bout of juicing, I was in the middle of juicing a green lemonade. I had just juiced some kale and lettuce, and then it was time for the lemon. I put ONE lemon in, and the juicer broke!! It didn't even finish juicing the lemon. The recipe I was using called for one whole lemon to cut through the taste of the green juice. The rind had been taken off of the lemon, and after that I had a naked lemon and no way to juice it. The juicer had a warranty, but after reading reviews of the warranty, I wasn't going to bother getting a new Juicer. It's time to upgrade, anyway, to a juicer more relevant to my current obsession with juicing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died with little use","review":"I believe I used this a total of approximately 6 times.On the last use...it died....never to be resurrected...very; expensive juice indeed.Overall it did a fair job of juicing, when it was working, the clean up requires a fair abmount of work.I won't buy another..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"this was the worst juicer. the rim broke off after 3 months of use. nd it could not be reatatched. very flimsy. a waste of $125. buy the breville fountain elite instead. the all silver one. it costs more, but i have had that one for a year, and i love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My juicer has worked fine.","review":"I've had my juicer now for about 3 years, and I haven't had any problems with it. In fact, after having had several juicers, this one is my favorite in the price range.I also don't understand the customer service problems. One of the rubber feet on the bottom split, and I called customer service. A week later I had four new ones in the mail!Pros - much quieter than most juicers of its type. As well, I did a side by side comparison with my buddie's Juiceman Juicer, and my yield was approximately 30% greater.Cons - as with any other similar juicer, cleaning it gets old. That's probably the only think that keeps me from using it multiple times/day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Buyer Beware! Biggest rip off on the market. Yes lifetime warranty- Ours broke after one use and they will send out a new part for 30 dollars. That is not lifetime, only if your life lasts 60 days. After 60 or 90 days it is going to cost you more money. Do not buy this juicer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Juice, But Disaster to Cleanup","review":"I'll be short and to the point. I must admit, I hardly use this myself as my wife does most of the juicing and leaves the cleanup for me. Although the juice tastes great, the cleanup is a mess. We've learned to put a plastic bag in the pulp bin, so we don't have to clean that out, just throw the bag away. But then there's the blade, the filter piece, the top, and the piece of plastic used to push the fruit down. Sure, the juicing is easy, but the cleanup is easily triple to amount of time. Fruit pulp gets stuck everywhere, especially on the filter piece as the holes are tiny. Bottom line, find something else and save yourself time and the water it takes to clean this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well built","review":"This juicer is not built to last. I understand the price is low, but building something that can not last a reasonable time is a waste of resource. And the blade is powerless,the motor pauses when juicing hard fruits.

Having to go on a 10-day cabbage juice cleanse, I was hoping this would save me some cash to juice my own cabbage as opposed to having Whole Foods juice for me by the lb. Not so. It's hard to clean and more important, the yield is extremely low - one whole large cabbage only gives you about 6 oz of juice. You can't really ball up cabbage as the instructions note so you are left with a ton of roughage in the pulp bin. Pretty disappointing considering the cost of organic cabbage these days. I am now researching other juicers to see what might be a good alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Failed After 6 Months of Daily Use","review":"This was my first juicer and it was a great buy if you are a beginner. I started with this juicer, then I got hooked on juicing and I juiced every morning!

Sorry to say however that the Jack Lalanne Juicer's motor failed, after exactly 6 months of daily use. It's in the garbage can as I write this. I'll be shopping for juicer with a more powerful motor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product, but not perfect.","review":"For all the setbacks the Jack La Lanne's Power Juicer has, I still highly recommend using this product. The juice that came out of it was unbelievable, and the machine is powerful and can go through a lot of fruit/veggies really fast.

This was sold at Costco, so I thought well Costco generally carries great products so I went ahead and bought it. It was cheaper than the Breville Juice fountain which had been a trusty Juicer for my sister which I saw my sister use everyday through her entire pregnancy.I was DEAD WRONG!!! Jacks juicer sucks. It chokes on any pressure (i was juicing an apple). This is a below par piece of plastic, that wouldn't be useful for a doorstop.I returned it immediately and went and bought a breville Juice fountain, now that is what Ima talking about. That baby has power, I LOVE MY BREVILLE JUICE FOUNTAIN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many parts, very messy, and leaks","review":"I have tried to find a sturdy juicer that is simple yet effective.

It is very messy, with too many parts, leaks at the joints, and is not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juicer got juiced after a week","review":"Well that was quick. After a week of daily use, the juicer went berserk. I cut up a mix of apple, pears, carrots, and leafy greens to put in the juicer. After successfully juicing the greens and apples, it was the pear's turn. I threw in the quartered cut pears and the whole juicer started rattling violently making a huge ruckus in the kitchen. I shut off the machine immediately and began to smell burnt electronics. I then proceeded to open the machine and saw white shards of plastic in the pulp collector, in the round metal screen, and even in my juice! After further investigation, it looks as though the metal blades went off balance and started shredding the plastic chute where the fruits enter the machine. Will be returning the unit and purchasing a non Jack LaLanne juicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Juicing- Worth the Cost!","review":"I purchased this machine 2 weeks ago and between my husband and I we are both juicing 2 times a day. There are 4 parts that you need to take apart, but we clean it with a baby bottle cleaner for the blades and my Norwex spirisponge is awesome at cleaning up the mesh area. We put it into the dishwasher and it works great. I love that you can put a plastic bag into the container for easier pulp cleanup. This would be a 5 star if it was able to get more of the juice out, but so far so good for a juicer under $100!Update: We have had this juicer for about 2 months now and we still use it quite a bit. If you follow the instructions for use and don't put hard rinds or big pits down it then its great. Still very happy with our purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible juicer","review":"Maybe this juicer is fine for soft things, but forget it when it comes to juicing carrots or anything remotely hard.

Heck, all I paid for was a juicer and you would expect that could be use for 30 days. Let me see, $ 113.00 cost of juicer, pretty expensive juice!!!!!!!!

BUT..the very first time we tried it, it would not juice anything we put into it. We got a little juice, and then it spit the vegetable or fruit out into the pulp basket. It was not overworked, as it did not shut off. You could see and hear the blade spinning, but several attempts did not deliver the expected juice.Not a terribly expensive machine, but one would expect it to work!

I immedeatly turned it off and disassembled it to make sure I didn't leave something in it or something, only to find that the plastic plate and screw on top of the motor was broekn. After looking at other reviews, I can see that this is a common problem, most likely due to the design of the juicer. The feed tube is positioned off-center, putting a bending stress on the attachment screw every time you press down on a piece of fruit that gets stuck in the chute. With this design, and the fact that the user must tighten the blade down to this plastic piece every time, and its a wonder they all don't break after a few uses.I would not recommend this juicer because of this poor design. I am going to try the Beville compact juicer that has a center feed chute and a one piece blade/filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been through 2 in 6 months","review":"Do not buy this juicer!!!

This juicer works like it claims it would and makes delicious juice. The price is right, it is user friendly, AND it makes juice without having to remove skin.

This juicer (as it says once you read the booklet) doesn't juice carrots well. They jam the machine making you take the thing apart and making a mess. My prime juice is carrot-apple, which means I wasted $100 on this piece of garbage. Also, the plunger gets stuck in the shute so tight that you have to bang it to get it loose. It is quite, but what good is that if he machine doesn't work as expected.

We called to find out why and ask for the correct one to be sent. They first accused us of telling them we had the Healthmaster. Then said they would send the correct one for a charge of $20. After some arguing, they finally said they would send for free. I was happy with the juicer while it worked. But, if it only lasts 3 months, then wait 4 months for replacement, I am not really getting the benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope!","review":"My unit started leaking horribly after only a few uses.

They promise it will be whisper quiet, but it actually makes quite a bit of noise. It's actually NOT dishwasher safe, a fact I learned after taking it out of the dishwasher and discovering that it was now stained and had rough, peeling edges. The chute is only big enough to feed a whole apple into if that apple is the smallest one ever grown, and the juice spout is so low that you have to use shallow bowls to collect the juice. The kicker is that the plastic screw is extremely flimsy and broke within about a dozen uses. I'm in the market for another juicer, but I won't be getting another Jack LaLanne. This time I'll invest in something like a Breville that will actually WORK and KEEP WORKING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!","review":"I wish I had researched juicers before I blindly followed someone's advice to buy this.

Don't lose any of them or you're screwed, especially that blade unlock tool. And clean all the parts (10-15 of them) before enjoying your juice or there will be lots of dried on messes. Then WAIT don't enjoy the juice yet. First re-assemble all the parts of the juicer NOW while you remember where everything goes otherwise you might not be able to get the thing back together later. It's almost not worth all the clean up trouble unless you are making a lot of juice. For one glass? No.But yeah you can throw whole fruits and veggies down that big opening and it grinds 'em right up. I line the pulp bucket poop-chute thing with a plastic bag so it can be tossed out without washing the chute. That HELPS with the clean up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"I found this hard to use and not realy worn the price.

This juicer ran fine first year. Now when I try to assemble all the fruits and ready to juice, the motor does not run fast. I can hear the sligt noise like the motor is trying to run, but it can't run fast to the full speed. After some manouvering, disassembling, assembling, then on/off, the juicer will run and do it's job. But, I am very disappointed, then when I want to make juice, the motor just doesn't run. It ruins my excitement of making the juice. I would say that the machine is very good when it runs, but it is highly unreliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Purchase Experience","review":"I purchased this juicer from the infomercial. I have a Juiceman II Juicer (still working years and years later) and the motor is kind of loud. I purchased the Jack LaLanne Power Juicer because it was supposed to be quieter and the chute was larger. BIG MISTAKE!!! I should have known something was wrong when I was asked if I wanted to purchase a refurbished one by the salesperson for a discounted price. I bought the new one and it was not even a month when smoke started coming out from the wiring. I thought it was going to catch on fire. It never worked and they would not answer my questions and I could not ever get information to return the juicer. HORRIBLE PURCHASE! So, I am still plugging away with my Juiceman II juicer that I do love, but am wondering what I am going to do when it finally wears out. I am afraid to purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Customer Service!!!","review":"Good luck with your juicer. Mine arrived broken.

I CANNOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved it.... util platic screw broke and it became useless!","review":"I will not write a long review, since everything has already been said in the 300+ reviews. Just wanted to state that I've experienced the same problem as other reviwers: My juicer worked wonderfully well... but 2 days ago, (after a year or year and a half of using it) the plastic screw that everybody is mentioning, broke, and now it doesn't work at all. The problem is that this screw is not a part of the juicer that can be replaced: it is attached to the motor itself. So I have a perfect motor, in a useless machine! I will not be buying this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes! What a Yucky Mess it Leaves!","review":"To be fair, this juicer does provide adequate juice. But the thing makes such a mess that in the end the juice really isn't worth the effort. Not only will machine's unstable wobble spray carrot pulp all over your kitchen counter, windows and cupboards, but the machine's mesh screen requires top-secret high-heat micro-wire brush sanitizing techniques that can only be found at NASA. From the time you take this monster (it's way too big for the average family) out of the cupboard you had to have built specifically to store it in, juice your juice and clean the umpteen parts, it's about 20 minutes of work for 12 ounces of juice. If you have that kind of time, maybe it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Worthless","review":"I have owned 2 juicers previous to buying this one. The Juicelady, which worked perfectly for 5 years before breaking, and the Hamilton Beach big mouth, which worked great for 2 months.I bought this one at Target, thinking that it would be of better quality than the Hamilton Beach, since it was 50$ more. Was I wrong!!! This juicer could not handle carrots at all! We cut them as small as possible, and it still could not juice them. The motor is not strong and the cutting blade is not sharp enough. I dont understand any of the positive reviews for this machine. Dont waste your time and money. I'm strongly inclined to just spend upwards of 200$ to find a decent juicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack Lalane Power Juicer from worldesales@hotmail.com","review":"I bought a (supposedly) new Jack Lalane Power Juicer from worldesales@hotmail.com It broke down the very first time I tried to use it and hasn't worked since. When I turn it on it smells like it's burning. I've sent four Emails to worldesales trying to get a refund and they haven't responded to any of them. They included no invoice or packing slip with the order. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"This is my second juicer and it was quite a disapointment. Too many parts that don't fit well. You need a special tool (provided) to take the blade in and out. It clogs easily, it overheats easily and yes, I cut up my fruits and veggies first and have mostly used carrots and apples. The pulp was wet and stuck to the collector.Its a pain to wash. I used it a total of 15 times and it overheated after making about 1/2 cup of juice.

The second machine eventually did the same thing to the point that we couldn't even open it to clean it! You would think I would stop buying his juicers, but I was so impressed with the ease of cleaning it, compared to others, that I once more, bought a third machine, and right out of the new carton, the machine did not work. When we called the manufacturer, we were told that there was a defect in the motors of that model. We're done. My advice, Jack looks like a very nice guy, but get your next juicer from a different company. I heard Champion is very good. That's going to be my next one. I love my Vitamix, but there is nothing like pure juice (without the fiber, which by the way, is easier on the digestive system)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack LaLanne Power Juicer - Juice Extractor- The ultimate Lemmon","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh juiced fruits & vegetables and did feel more energized from my Jack LaLanne Juicer which was given to me as a gift. However, after 2 months of using the juicer 4-6 times a week, it stopped working and it did not juice the apples and beats easily.Of course, there is no longer a warrenty so I cannot get it replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack Lalanne Juicer","review":"I purchased the juicer based on information obtained in an informercial. After 3 weeks the motor died and I assumed that I would get satisfaction from the life time warranty they advertised. Upon reading the fine I discoverd it was very misleading. In order to enforce the warranty you must pack the juicer and ship it accross country at your expense. You must also include a $29.00 check with returned product and the recipient would notify you how they will proceed. In essence, this so-called life time warranty requires that you spend over 30% of the purchase price of the item without guarantee that they will either provide you a new juicer. I thus proceeded to place the juicer where it belongs, in the garbage. I have been a big fan of Jack Lalanne since I was a child. I was very disappointed to find that he has allowed his name to be used by scam artists. I purchased a new juicer at a much lower price and better quality. Needless to say, I do not recommend the Jack Lalanne juicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juicer does a great job","review":"I bought the Juicer so I could make juice for my three year old son who will not eat veggies, and I want him to have good healthy juice that is not loaded with sugar. Juicer works quickly and quietly and I am very happy with it. My son loves the whole process nad is happily drinking vegies every day. :) It can be a bummer to clean but the quality and flavor of fresh juice makes it a non issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"Alot of people in my family use the same juicer. I love it personally. The cleanup is really a breeze and the recipes included are easy to follow, delicious and handy. Sometimes there is more prep work than I expected, but its not an all day event. I can prep, juice and clean in a matter of minutes (I'd say less than 10) which is really helpful since I have a two year old! I would recommend this to a novice juicer or somebody who's been juicing for life! This is great! I've bought at least 4 juicers in the past 6 or 7 years and none of them have worked half as well! What a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but quite good","review":"I received this juicer from my mother for my birthday. At first I thought, uh-oh, I've read reviews on it that weren't so hot. But after the first use, I was hooked. Cleaning up isn't easy nor difficult, it's just a job that nobody wants. So I'm not judging the assembly and disassembly. It does a wonderful juicing job on fruits and works well on hard stuff like carrots. The pulp is wetter than I'd prefer, the only real negative. The juicer comes with recipe books telling how to use the pulp in muffins, etc. That's nice. All in all, it's a very good product for the money and I would recommend it if you're on a budget or don't want to pay the big bucks for a professional quality juicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not dishwasher safe","review":"I just received one as a gift. After just a couple of uses, the cover & juice bowl warped in the dishwasher. It won't fit back together. When it did work I liked it overall. It was quiet but a little underpowered compared to the Hamilton Beach juicer I've had for 8 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had it a few months and then it broke","review":"I bought this juicer elsewhere and used it daily for about 2 months. Then, when unscrewing the blade, the plastic threaded piece that is attached to the motor snapped off. I wasn't putting undo pressure on it, I didn't tweak it, I was unscrewing it with the provided tool. It juiced well for the most part, I was satisfied until it just broke. I won't be buying this juicer again."},{"rating":"1","title":"planned obsolescence on steroids !","review":"Go ahead and spend a bit more money on a quality machine. The parts of this machine WILL NOT hold up if you use it regularly. I went through two before I grew a brain. So yes, they fooled me twice. Even the screw that turns the motor breaks very easily (plastic). Once that goes, you might as well trash it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy! - major design flaw","review":"I purchased the plastic version but discovered online that users of the stainless steel version had the same design flaw as mine: the juicer's blade screws on to a threaded plastic post that spins and gets very hot, causing the plastic threads to wear-off after only a few months use, rendering the juicer useless - you can no longer screw the blade back on! Fortunately, my cheap-o $20 backup juicer that I'd previously used for 7 years is still working fine. Were Jack Lalane still alive, he would no longer endorse this product upon learning about it's design flaw and the resulting disappointed users who shelled-out extra bucks because of his name and reputation. However, I'm certain the manufacturer has already made millions on the sales of this - bummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job for me","review":"After talking to a local man who beat cancer with his Jack LaLanne juicer, I was convinced this was the one for me. It is relatively inexpensive and gets the job done to my satisfaction. I also like that it is quiet in operation. It is a good entry level juicer for someone like me who is just beginning to discover the world and benefits of juicing. I have had no problems with it, and I use it every morning. I would not hesitate to recommend this juicer to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Wastes most of your fruit. Claims to leave very little pulp because it gets more juice than other machines. What it actually does is keep the pulp - much of it not even pulverized - inside the juicing area instead of throwing it out into the handy pulp bin that comes with it. This way you get to clean it so much more often. There is always more pulp inside the juicing area than in the waste pulp bin - WAY more. And it's very wet, juicy pulp, which means maybe half the juice got extracted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after the first use; company has poor communication","review":"I had been wanting this juicer for a long time. When I finally bought it, I used it once and it worked great. The next time I tried to use it, the blade wouldn't spin. It was almost like it was stuck. I then sent it to the company under the warranty; however, they haven't communicated with me regarding the repair. I had to send them a check for the repair work, which they immediately cashed. It has now been two months since they cashed the check and I haven't received my repaired item or heard about the status of my juicer. I am frustrated.When it did work, it was great. However, there are a lot of parts to clean between each use (even if you only use it once!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT impressed","review":"I'm not impressed with this juicer. Kale gets stuck even when added with carrots, thought I was going to burn out the motor but shut it off in time. The juice is mediocre and the pulp is very wet indicating I'm not getting as much juice as I should. It stains very easy but I wash it right away so have managed to avoid the staining of my juicer that other people I know who have this model have experienced. My plunger somehow has water inside of it I can't locate a leak but obviously there is one so I won't be able to use it at all now...the thought of stale water leaking into my juice isn't exactly appetizing. Guess I will save my money for a stainless steel model. Sorry Jack, I adore you but am not impressed with your juicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bringing it back.","review":"This is my second juicer. I ended up getting it because I had heard so many great reviews and thought, well it can't be that bad. I picked in up at my local Big Box retailer and I must say, it is simply awful. Don't get me wrong, it works most of the time but that doesn't make up for the jamming of the motor. It gets caught up on the smallest amount of pulp in the shoot and it shreds ripened pears into nothing but pulp. But I guess the big question is, why am I returning it? Because the Juiceman I got from my local thrift store does a 100% better job. The sad thing is, it is nearly 15 years old. Sorry Jack but you need to try a bit harder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Escoude?","review":"This is easy listening gypsy music, maybe too easy.

The form of the poetry evokes (and occasionally uses) the forms of the Biblical Psalms. The subject matter sometimes corresponds to the Biblical expectations as well. But within this framework, the poetry is firmly committed to a very urban, hard and somewhat dark view of contemporary life. The poet is very skilled - the craftsmanship is there but invisible - i.e. the content rather than craft comes through in reading these poems. This book is well worth reading - even if you find you don't like the poems, your appreciation for poetry should be expanded by seeing what April Bernard has achieved"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bullocks to Weezer's last 2 albums!

Her writing was a wonderful as ever, I just didn't identify with Alethea as well as some of the other characters. However, she is still a well-developed and interesting character in her own right. And to say, \\"I didn't enjoy it as much as the other two\\" means very little. This book still makes a fascinating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error-filled and unfriendly","review":"I might forgive the \\"unfriendly\\" part, considering this is a distilled reference to give you just the facts.

There is absolutely no way that the distribution tree can attach to the Lite cylinder's plastic rim.

Seriously lady, get a job and stop analyzing your emotions, they are really not at all interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lie on your bed and swoon....","review":"Here are the feverish and impossibly romantic convulsions of a schoolgirl mind - but I mean that in a good way. Nin is unlikeable yet enchanting - she is some dreamy, exotic species of narcissist, and her constant fawning over herself has the perverse affect of making YOU enthralled by her, too. Nin's reality hovers exquisitely above the pedestrian, grimy one the rest of us inhabit, and if you give yourself over to her absurdly beautiful view of things, she will transport you. You end up feeling like a kind of sighing, envious voyeur as you read through these pages and wish you, too, were an eccentric beauty drifting amid some bygone literary demi-monde.Lie on your bed and swoon...This is a fantasy/romance novel for those with vague intellectual pretensions..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This is among Anais' best works, possibly the very best. It describes the beginning of her multiple love lives and her collaboration with Henry Miller. Since she had already published what she could in her lifetime, these Unexpurgated Journal of Love volumes are largely her emotions and sexual feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright","review":"The main thing to remember about this book is that it is a journal. So if you are looking for a beginning, middle and end you won't find it here. I kind of felt like \\"what is the point?\\" after I read it. It was also hard for me to understand how Anais Nin could write all these words of love about Henry Miller. I tried to read Miller's TROPIC OF CAPRICORN but I had to stop because he is such a misogynistic jerk. I couldn't believe the feelings of hate he had towards his poor first wife, and the way that he saw all women as trash. I had a hard time not thinking that Anais Nin was crazy to risk her marriage to a wonderful man for a horrible man like Miller. This is not a great book, but the one good thing about it is that it is very sensual and erotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"life changing, mind blowing","review":"I read this book when i was 25. and it changed my life. I finished all of Nin's books within 1 1/2 years,and this is still my favorite. I think every woman should read this book. With the sensual, provocative, sometimes painful self-discovery, Anais Nin created the most original artwork while creating life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening","review":"Before Henry and June, I had never read a book by Anais Nin. In fact, the only knowledge of her writing I had was from a poem I had to read in junior English a couple of years ago. Oddly enough I went to a bookstore that was going out of business and decided to pick up this book because it was offered for 5 bucks. I started reading the book and was instantly swept away by it. Her writing is so intense and blunt, she holds nothing back from the reader. I have learned so much about myself just from this one book alone. I agree strongly with her views on men and women. With this one book she had become my favorite writer. Even above D.H Lawrence (who ironically is mentioned many times throughout the novel!) As soon as I get paid I am going to make it a point of myself to read as many of her books as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rewarding Read","review":"One cannot read this excerpt from Anais Nin's lifelong diaries without a measure of admiration and envy. It describes her \\"belle vie\\" in the early thirties in Paris. She has a lovely home, a loving husband, and a circle of intellectual suitors. While undertaking huge liberties and deceptions in the name of literature (she uses her writing as an excuse), she yet does so with an almost childlike need for love and acceptance. In explanation, the reader learns that she was infatuated with her father, who later abandons her. The irony of her seducing and manipulating the psychoanalyst who is also treating her husband and incestuous lover is humorous. The insights into her torrid affair with Henry Miller are fascinating. As in her fiction, she displays a knack for tasteful eroticism. She disarmingly admits to her propensity for embellishing reality. Anais Nin is narcissistic, but who could not be fascinated by a woman of such candor, talent, and complexity?"},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite book","review":"this reads like really good fiction...Anais opens up and analyzes everyday life to death....expresses emotions that everyone can relate to...as well as daring, very strange, and exciting situations in her life. very sensual....very deep views of relationships...very optimistic..never EVER DULL...always at maximum pitch"},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging read. More than a peek into Nin's psyche.","review":"The reader will have a sense that they are inside Nin's head after reading this fascinating excerpt from her 1931-32 diary. I found myself completely drawn into Nin's descriptions of her joys and losses stemming from multiple relationships with the men in her life. The diary allows the reader to witness the unfolding of Nin's sexuality and makes for, at times, a very stimulating read. It is also interesting to observe Nin's sense of feminism (at the risk of placing this term in an era where it didn't exist) as she struggles to decide whether a woman can love more than one man at once, and whether she deserves the luxury (and pain)that these relationships bring her. If you like this one, try \\"Fire,\\" Delta of Venus, and Little Birds (erotic fiction), as well as Nin's other unexpurgated diaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Froid et faux","review":"Anais Nin and Henry Miller are minor writers, the former considerably more minor than the latter. However, I daresay Anais Nin is more widely read nowadays than is Henry Miller. The interest in them is gosspiy - that whole Americans in Paris in the thirties schlock - and nicely seasoned by the erotic. This book is actually a rather revolting self-portrait of a self-obsessed woman with too much time on her hands. Her writing is Lawrence without the passion for truth, and her living is all words. Everything is affect. There seems not an ounce of tenderness in her. She (and this book) is cold and false."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ron Can Whistle","review":"Ron McCroby - the Puccolo Master.

Montauk's book is amazing and is a great guide through the entire process of applying to law school. However, this book was a complete waste of time. Every page has a first person testimonial that is just a repeat of what the author just stated in the previos paragraph. Testimonials should show the application of the principles laid out by the author. This is literally a bunch of warrantless claims. Remove the testimonials out and you got a 50 page booklet.

This book portrayed a child \\"crab\\" who was hospitalized, medicated and back to school with little difficulty. It did mention the families trauma but made it seem so short lived. Having a bipolar child that has been hospitalized three times and on at least 20 different medications, I am disappointed that this is such an unfair portrayal of the journey. Being a member of a support group with at least 16 parents who have had similar stories as mine, can tell you that the journey does not end so happily ever after and this story would be a confusing message to send to our children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells children with Bipolar they are not alone","review":"I loved the book, more important, my son who is Bipolar loved the book. He was very interested in what people's responses to Matt were. The best part about this book is that those responses are realistic. People get frustrated and irritated when stressed out.My son loved the fact that Matt's Mom was so loving and understanding and the rest of his family wasn't. It was a good reflection of his own situation. Another good thing about this book is that it allows the Bipolar child to see their own over-reactions to situations, without getting angry themselves.

In fact i'm a bit irritated with people who complain about not finding traces of ZZ Top in this band. This is Moving Sidewalks, not ZZ Top, get it?I wouldn't recommend Flash to ZZ Top fans. In fact i think Jimi Hendrix fans could dig this more. This is prime 60's Texas psychedelia (actually i wouldn't recommend ZZ Top to 60's psych fans either). Moving Sidewalks qualifies as one of the top acts of the era and scene, along with the 13th Floor Elevators and Bubble Puppy. The songs perhaps aren't all that memorable, but the band plays them with solid groove and guts. Forget about that long bearded band for a while and dig the Moving Sidewalks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Espionage Thriller","review":"It's no classic, but Karloff fans will like this \\"B\\" picture full of twists and turns as you try to figure out just who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.Best of all it's short and to the point.

Not only did I find the content entertaining, but the words ignite feelings of courage, hope, and persevarence that I'm sure will serve me well. I also think it is important to note that while most of those profiled stand at the cutting edge of capitalism, they also remain sensitive to social and human values, a balance which I think all should keep in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I'd read this years ago!","review":"Outstanding insights into the lives and learnings from powerful African American leaders in all walks of life. At many times, I had to put the book down and just absorb a profound insight one of the achievers shared. I would strongly encourage all students entering or leaving college to put this on their personal reading list. I'd love to see a new edition of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books when I was a kid.","review":"I read this book years ago when it was given to me as a kid. I loved it and read it several times. I liked science but was not very interested in early hominids. I still found this book interesting and engaging. I enjoyed the cross over between the two narratives. It has been years and I no longer own the book but I still think about it, that is a testament to its quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting ideas about our ancestors...","review":"There are really two, very parallel, stories told in this book, and they are only separated by a couple of million years. In the present, a young teenager named Vinny has convinced her mother to let her spend summer vacation with her father in Africa. Her father, Sam, is working in an archeological site in Africa without much success. Vinny turns out to be his good luck charm. Flip back to the past and we see a teenager called Li that is half-ape, half-human that thinks way beyond her time. Each chapter goes back and forth between past and present. A couple of times I was lost in the paleontology talk and the present storyline was a bit boring, but I liked the author's way of describing the past storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Liars...this books stinks!!","review":"This book was poorly written. The relation between the two stories was minimal. The story was hard to follow, 'cause I can't read when I fall asleep from boredom. The descriptions gave me no pictures in my mind, Dr. Hamiska was a big blur, and I only got a picture of the heat, which I honestly don't CARE about. It was a real page turner...I was eager to finish the book, and get it over with. I wouldn't have read it if my teacher didn't assign it. My dog refused to eat the pages I ripped out, and seemed to, much like me, think the book stunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK WAS WORTH NOTHING BUT A PILE OF DUNG!","review":"This Book was rely boring. I fell asleep after reading two pages. I will never sugjest this book to any one. Here is a list of what the book had. It had a sleeping pill along with the words. To go to sleep read this book. A horible description. Vinny never followed through on what happened. Li was ok but thear could have been a battle, instead of running away. This book could have a beter ending, like Dr. Hamiska geting killed by Watson. Anna May and Dad should have gotton married.A summary of this book is: And then...

The premise was unoriginal, the execution blah. I skimmed it just to finish it. Such a disappointment after Levin's fantastic \\"A Kiss Before Dying.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A minimalist novel","review":"I read this book when it first came out, when it was a bestseller. I enjoyed it then, but had a snobby attitude that only Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Faulkner existed as writers at that time, being young and supremely critical about everything. I still don't think it's a work of great genius, but it has a minimalist style that is very clear and never waivers in its \\"voice.\\" Levin is definitely a master of this. And with his short, concise sentences, he builds the suspense. The book is a creepy, guilty pleasure. The film, by Polanski, is true to the book except, as another reviewer has said here, for the ending, which would have made the movie even better, I think. I listened to the audio book with Mia Farrow reading. Perfect. If you haven't heard it, check it out. It's lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosemary's Baby: The age-old battle...","review":"Ira Levin's novel Rosemary's Baby explores that mind-boggling realm of the absolute darkness found in human nature. His depictions of evil are frighteningly real; even atheists may have trouble remaining in their state of disbelief in the good and evil supreme beings. This book is truly one that is nearly impossible to put down; it is extremely readable without seeming childish. Levin's ideas of good and evil are explained in a manner that is easy to understand, yet it is still perplexing to even the greatest of minds how such evil can be personified. Levin is truly a literary genius; this book proves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Read","review":"Remembered seeing the movie as a pre-teen because I love love love the horror genre... the book lives up to the movie in a rare instance I was not disappointed with either no matter the time span between seeing the movie and reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I wanted to read this book after since watching the movie so many times and for it to explain on some unfinished scenes that made no sense but did after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't very good.","review":"Although the book was intriguing at times, the story deteriorated into absurdity with the ending and denouement. However, everyone else seems to like it, so if one likes horror, one would probably enjoy this book or if one is a from a Western religion, he may find more horror in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, understated gothic horror","review":"Ira Levin stands with the tradition of Poe and Lovecraft in \\"Rosemary's Baby\\"--portraying in understated, thoroughly credible terms the horror that lurks within everyday life. Levin's Satanists are next-door neighbors who read \\"Jokes for the John\\" and inquire about the prices Rosemary paid for furniture. Yet the impact of what they unleash on her--and on the world--is the more powerful for the banality of how they do it. Levin lets the plot unfold so masterfully that the climactic scenes hit the reader with all the accumulated hints he dropped earlier. Rosemary's character is splendidly developed, too, and Levin's depictions of everyday life in Manhattan are comfortably realistic (and add to the gnawing sense of horror that builds at the end). One of my Top 10 novels. (The movie, with Mia Farrow giving the performance of her career, is first-rate, too.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosemary's Baby","review":"This is a classic and fast read! really enjoyed the memories. also got the movie and is very close to the book so very enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never had read this before","review":"This was creepy, scary!

Not knowing exactly what the \\"baby\\" was, I finally decided to read the book. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Not only was it poorly written, but it isn't very suspenseful. You know what's going to happen from the beginning. I won't ruin it for those of you who haven't read it, but don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I found this book to be a letdown. The plot was slow and painful. The story seemed too simplistic to be truly frightening or even slightly creepy. And the ending was extremely simple and anti-climactic. While one would expect Rosemary to have a terrible reaction to her baby, she instead calmly accepts the kid. Not very scary. I just wasn't impressed with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like the movie..","review":"I love the movie so I wanted to read this and see if I could get more from the story. It's actually almost identical to the movie, though. Apparently, the movie is the most accurate adaptation of a book ever so there's not much more here except for a couple tiny scenes that were probably planned to be in the movie and eliminated at some point for time or whatever. In any case, this is a fun book and even knowing the story from watching the movie a million times, it does its job of being scary and suspenseful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that influenced a genre","review":"Thirty three years after it was first published, Levin's book still stands as one of the best Horror/fantasy novels ever written. As one of the first books of the genre to become a nestseller, one can almost imagine what a stir it caused back in 1966. For even now, with Roman Polanski's masterwork film version indelibly shaping our imaginations as we read, \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" still manages to send a genuine chill down the spine with it's deft handling of it's ingenious yet simple plot.Within the premise of a young wife having her womb bartered to the devil by her selfish husband, Levin weaves issues of religion, women's changing social roles, betrayal, modern vs. ancient, dehumanization and paranoia.\\"Rosemary's Baby\\" is not only a fun read, it's honestly scary, and, if you let yourself think about it, pretty darn smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent horror story. surprisingly, the movie adaptation was very accurate of Levin's story. Though, until the critic below mentioned it...i didn't notice the prejudices of the book. might make for an interesting paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"The plot of Rosemary's baby was the most entertaining and the most suspensful I have ever read.

It seems the book was taken word for word and put on the screen.I read the book hopping to get more insight into the charcters, but I didn't get it. There is zero character development and very little suspense. This is a horror novel, I think the children's book Where the Wild Things are scared me more.

I keep my player in my bag all day and use for my commute.When the player is on 'hold' you would expect that pressing the buttons would do nothing.However, when the iRiver is on 'hold' and you press a button, the screen lights up and tells you that it is on hold (probably for idiots who forget it is on hold).The point is.... when the screen lights up every few minutes because my bag gets bumped and some button pressed, it drains the battery like crazy.

Because one corner of the cover refused to stay down, I optimistically hoped that it had been dropped and damaged in the store or in shipment, so I replaced it with an identical model. 2nd one worked for 11 months before it stopped working. Since it was under warranty for 1 more month, I sent it back. Whether iRiver replaced it with a new one or repaired the old one, I don't have a clue. I just received a player back from them without any explaination about what was done. It worked for about 2 months, before it stopped working. No attempts at resetting or reformatting have worked.

One thing Itunes does that the Iriver does not do is combining files (for example) by \\"Beatles\\" and \\"The Beatles\\" I had to go through and rename them each after I'd put them on the Iriver, mildly annoying.-It only works on Windows XP, which was fine for me.

I e-mailed them AND called them, and I was told from both places that the screen is not covered under warranty (seems as if almost nothing truly is). I even asked them if I could pay to have it repaired, and they said no, tough luck. Anyway, I'm pretty pissed off right now.

Also, it has the same sound presets that are used in Windows Media Player. The only reason I gave the H20 4 stars is that the battery can fade quickly, and it can lock up if the battery is low.

He's not a big eater and has never been a chewer (never chewed on furniture, shoes etc) so although he won't grab ANY bone, he does enjoy them.

I'm VERY happy that before I read it to him, I quickly flipped through it just to preview what he'll see. I was shocked to see how many scary images (for a toddler) there were. But the worst of all was the actual story lines...talking about being kidnapped, never going to see your father again, being eaten by a whale and doomed to die of starvation. REALLY??? For a toddler???Now I'm sure this was the original story and that's just fine, but if you're buying this for your little one with the idea of reading a light-hearted story about a boy whose nose will grow when he tells a lie (this was not mentioned at all in this story), then you'd better stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not received","review":"Very disappointed.

I think from time to time we get a little bit of both from him. I'm not one to idolize anyone but I think this guy has some talent, I really liked Labor Days as well as Float. Bazooka Tooth on the other hand was nothing spectacular. I saw this guy in Philly maybe 2 or 3 years ago and he is sick live.

Alternate between the two dependent on mood, and I outright challenge you to get sick of either album."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underground hip hop standout","review":"Aesop Rock is the Mozart of rap. The kind of emcee an eloquent wordsmith such as Eminem could look up to with envy. While his nasally tone, awkward delivery and surrealist imagery make it evident why he has not risen higher in the miserable genre of mainstream hip-hop, this mans pen unleashes the most potent stream-of-consciousness styled lyrics heard. While it all may sound like a garbled bunch of nonsense to the uninitiated, spend some time with these rhymes and you may find that elusive quality in rap music-a gift that keeps on giving. Effective and understated production, albeit of an older-school nature, from this early album does not drown out the lucidly verbose and relentless word attacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why friends can always be trusted for recommendations","review":"I wouldn't have known about this album unless it was for a friend who suggested it to me.

If you want to give Aesop a try, I reccommend that album first. Labor Days is a excellent continuation to already die-hard Aesop followers and fans. Aesop has a talent that I have yet to discover in any other MC's, and that is the ability to flow to pretty much ANY beat he wants. Even at first, you may think he going ahead of the beat, but it seems to all flow perfectly after you are done listening to the song.The best part about Aesop's work is; it never gets old. There is so much to digest from Aesop's songs. When it comes to solo artist, Aesop gets the job done. When it comes to Rhyme with Reason... Aesop does it right. This album is beautful.

Don't worry, he puts Eminem to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Def Jux = Greatness, buy this CD and the Daylight EP","review":"Aesop Rock is one of the illist, sickest, most confusing, but highly addictive MC's I know of.

I played the Earthworms CD in my car and one of my friends actually liked it, and that is verry rare because my friends usually dont listen to me when it comes to music.

My neighbor who also has a Peg Aria cannot do it either, so I know its not just me. So maybe I got a lemon, but for $280 I should be able to open and close this stroller more easily.I went out and bought a cheap graco metrolite to keep in my car now.

However, if you want the story of Bach, with some musical adornments, you might like it. The entire recording is about 60 minutes long. Out of this, there are about ten identified snatches of Bach's music, but only for seconds each, except at the very end. So, there can't be more than five minutes of music, probably less, in the entire recording. If you're looking for Bach's music rather than his biography, you'd be infinitely better off by downloading \\"The 99 Most Essential Bach Masterpieces\\" from the Amazon MP3 section.

Claiming that Christianity's truth is best served by being brought into the public sphere to maximize its influence, Total Truth delves into complex theological and behavioral questions. Examining how feminism contributed to the privatization of Christianity, the power of evangelicalism, flaws in modern scientific theory, and more. While the ideas presented in Total Truth are strong, and sometimes appears to discount the unshakeable reality that America is and always will be a nation of plural faiths, the passion in the author's conviction to improve human life on physical and spiritual levels through the power of religious virtue is undeniable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keynote reference and rhetoric","review":"Nancy Pearcey logically and clearly communicates the 'waters in which we swim' and the effect they have on the Christian life. She accurately recognizes the assault on original design ,then Biblically constructs a retort to 'culture' and shows a accurate plan for living an intentional and thus fruitful and fulfilling Christian life. I commend this book to all ,not just those who are admitting to apprenticeship with Jesus Christ ,but those who doubt the gospel. Her work is impeccable and if you don't 'get it\\", then you may never 'get it'. Reading Total Truth will help you understand why C.S. Lewis said \\" I believe in Christianity believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Guide to the Modern Thought Battle","review":"Pearcey provides a well-thought-through explanation of the contrast between post-modern thought and a Christian worldview. Each chapter contains numerous footnotes, which point one to source material and add to the book's credibility.

If you are a new student of apologetics, this book may be for you. It is a very comforting read and guides you in how to think critically while demonstrating strong arguments for the necessity of absolute truth. This is not for the astute student of philosophy for the author misbehaves epistemically and takes too much for granted. This is a wonderful starter book for one who desires intellectual growth in apologetics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful research on a present-day dilemma","review":"As a Christian, I have found myself at odds with the Christian culture without fully understanding why.

I was wondering why it was taking the authors so long to get to some cogent points. But by the 2nd chapter, the author's subtle references of the exalted ones, soon turned into gushing worship. Calvinistic narcissism is just so intense, it always turns my stomach. Such overt manifestations of self-ingratiation, one has to be blind not to see. I thought perhaps I could struggle through the reading with my nose plugged, but when the authors proceeded gushing over Calvin himself, the hubris and history-revisionism was more than I could endure.

It would be no less absurd for me--as a biological scientist--to write a book on constitutional law or astrophysics. Intelligent Design is not a scientific theory, and this fact is not changed no matter how many people claim that it is. As a committed, liberal Christian, I find it very sad that the Intelligent Design crowd spends so much time, energy, and money trying to prove the existence of God, while countless numbers of their fellow humans remain hungry, naked, and homeless.

Yes, the books reflect the man, but do I have to sit through a hundred pages of literary opinion? It's excessive past excessive when the point could have been made in one chapter, and dull to boot (considering these are mainly old Latin and French works with which most modern people would be unfamiliar).It picks up a little at the end, when the main character's eccentric behavior finally does him in, and the doctor orders a return to normal life as the only cure.

I wrote to Amazon a while back to inform them of their error, they acknowledged it, but the info here remained the same. Obviously, overloading anything can be very dangerous. The cart itself is exceptional, and very useful for any number of material moving tasks. I'm in construction, and we are seeing more and more of these things on jobsites. Just keep it at less than 500 lbs.! Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Chain","review":"This Spiga is awesome! I was very impressed. The chain is very heavy, nice and smooth. It's hard to find Spigas in the store and definitely not in this quality. The chain is very substantial and I recommend ordering one size longer. Due to the thickness of the chain it fits much closer to the neck. I have a nickel allergy and really appreciate that this chain is nickel free. I'll order another one in a different length. This is a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality and value!","review":"I bought an 18\\" Spiga Wheat necklace from Kmart that was very shiney but was fake. That one stuck to a magnet like glue. .925 Sterling silver and .9999 pure silver will not stick to a magnet. As soon as I recieved my 5mm, 20\\" Spiga wheat necklace I tested it and it's the real deal. I love it. It's not a hollow chain, this thing has weight to it. I don't give out five stars often but this one hit it out of the park. I plan to buy another one soon. I just hope they have this in an 8mm.

As far as this ink goes, it's just price gougeing. These sellers know that Leapfrog no longer makes this product, and are trying to get rich off of it.

I know that I filled out the info correctly when ordering. I was really disappointed. Amazon customer service was awesome. I shipped back the floorliners the next morning.I ended up buying the floormats from Autoanything.As for the floormats themselves, I love them.

This sheet music book includes every vocal number from the original cast album. And bonus!- there is a big picture of Angela Lansbury on the front inside cover! The reason I only gave this item 4 stars is because Mame is a very old show, and I prefer contemporary musicals. Songs in this book are: St. Bridget, It's Today, Open a New Window, The Man in the Moon, My Best Girl, We Need a Little Christmas, Mame, The Letter, Bosom Buddies, Gooch's Song, That's How Yound I Feel, If He Walked Into My Life, and Finale. Bosom Buddies is a great comedy song! My Best Girl is very moving, and The Man in the Moon is HYSTERICAL. If you like 'Mame', buy this book! Every page is precious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Not","review":"This book is okay if you're looking for something with a few tunes from the show that are easy to play. However, if you're buying this with the hopes of singing some of the songs as they were heard on the Original Broadway Cast Recording, you may want to splurge and buy the score. Most of the songs in this book are all in extremely different keys, and all of them have melody in the piano part. It wasn't what I was hoping for, but I'm sure that some people will have no problem with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good product","review":"This is a very reliable presenter, the range is very good, it fits well and comfortable in your hand, and I never have problems with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's GREAT!","review":"This is easy to set up and easy to use.

As a result I will hardly be using it.Bought the model with the laser pointer, it works very well. By the way it's used with a Mac Air which does not have much clearance for the USB transmitter, thus the slim USB transmitter is appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate action, unbelievable dialog","review":"This series has a promising premise -- naval fiction based on the viewpoint of a China trader turned privateer during the Revolutionary war. However, the promise never materializes, largely due to the truly appalling dialog. People in the mid-1700's might have written in that odd, stilted, formal vernacular, but I can't believe that it was ever spoken. Certainly no one ever stood on a quarterdeck and emitted any of the pompous speeches that Geoffrey Frost is guilty of, if only because the battle would be over by the time they finished. The net effect is that Frost comes across as a self-righteous unlikeable prig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean at Ashley River Creative Arts El.","review":"I liked the book A Pinky is a Baby Mouse.

If you were a baby dog your name would be a puppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hannah at Ashley River Creative Arts El.","review":"A Pinky is a Baby Mouse was very interesting because it had so many different animals. The weirdest name in there was a baby seal's a Beach weaner. I liked the picture of a platypus. It was so cute but he had no name.

It's called a pup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rashad from Ashley River Creative Arts El.","review":"I especially like the book A Pinky is a Baby Mouse. Now that is a great Book.

It is however, probably the most important spiritual and scientific book of our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable and filled wtth incomprehensible detail","review":"I found this book to be unreadable. I could read only a couple of pages at a time. I did not feel any love emanating from it, It was all intellect and no heart. The subject-matter was potentially extremely interesting to me, but the negative vibrations put me off. Highly developed beings emanate love, this writer did not. I like to read books that help to raise my vibration not lower it, so I felt there was something not quite right with this book.The book also contains pages filled with unnecessary and incomprehensible detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let it speak for itself...","review":"I have looked high and low through countless new age books and Voyagers was the first book that really fofilled my sense of longing. After every other book I had read, I found myself still searching, but after Voyagers, I no longer needed to search. That is not to say that everything you ever needed to know can be found in this book, it is more of an introduction to a larger body of work where you can find information on everything you wanted to know, and then some. If you are genuinely looking for answers, then don't take my word for it, or any one else's for that matter... just read it for yourself and decide for yourself if it is right for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Scene is No Dream","review":"The color is way too light to show up on my eye lids and I'm fair complected.

It stays on throughout the day, despite terrible heat and humidity, and even a bit of sweating. The only thing I can't figure out is that the pencil claims to never need sharpening, yet I see no obvious way of getting more pencil once it's worn down, without sharpening. Is this a false claim, or am I missing something?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this liner!","review":"Have been using this liner for the last few years and think it's amazing for the price.

It could include a scissor.However when we first opened the hard plastic case, half of the contents fell out, since they are not secured inside it. Additionally the case is difficult to carry by the handle (there's no hole) and is not securely closed. Not to mention its bulkyness.We returned it and bought Nursery and Bath Care Set by Summer Infant Products. For additional [money] you get a few more extra items, all secured in elastic loops in a compact pouch."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS!","review":"I registered for this thinking it would be great. Everything I need. RIIIIGHHHTTT.. haha.. The only things in it I can use are the nail clippers (but I cannot use the magnification because it distorts everything and I cannot see my sons nails), the hair brush which is nice, the comb which is nice, and the nail files which I dont like anyways because the chalkboard scrapping sound lol. The thermometer [stinks]! It doesn't beep so you dont know wen its done. You have to watch for it to blink or something like that and it only blinks a few times so if u miss it ur gonna sit there for a LOOOONNG time but hey it takes a long time to work anyways. The medicine dropper is TOO hard to pull out and push in. And the tweezers are very flimsy"},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY!","review":"The thermometer takes a VERY long time to work, if it even beeps at all. The medicine dropper is awkward.

It's hard to open everything falls when it is open.The medicine dropper is awkward. Etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"You may want to pass on this one. At first when I registered for this it seemed like such a neat idea to have everything you need in a compact case but when I opened it up, everything fell out of the case. Nothing would stay in it's place....and when you have a sick baby at 2am you don't want to be picking up items off of the floor in the dark. Not to mention that the thermometer takes forever to read. Its a great idea but needs some more modifications before I would buy it. I ended up taking it back and just buying the items I didn't have separately and keeping them in a plastic zipper bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement","review":"I did a lot of research when I registered. Apparently I didn't research this particular choice very well. The case looks nice and I thought it had things that I needed. First, the case doesn't stay shut, so all the items fall out. Second, the items are not of the quality I would expect. Third, I don't even need half the items included. I would recommend buying baby care items individually instead of in a kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Use","review":"I have actually thrown this kit away since one night my son was very sick and it was taking me an hour to open the thing. I got fed up and threw it across the room and the next morning I threw it away. I kept the medicine despenser though b/c I kinda like that. But everything else is worthless especially the thermometer. Imagine having to fight with a sick 5 month old trying to get an underarm temp only to have the thing take FOREVER, and then just shut off when it's done. NO BEEP, NOTHING. It doesn't light up in the dark, and you can't replace the battery, not that I'd want to anyway. The nail clippers are useless, I almost went blind trying to see through the glare of the magnifying glass and babies nails are too soft to be using emery boards anyway. like they're really going to sit still while you file their nails, that's ridiculous. It's hard enough cutting them! This product is NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of cheaply made products does not make a bargain!","review":"Being a parent to be I registered for this thinking it had all of the major items I needed. The tweezers and nail clippers come with a useless magnifying glass that is wobbly and gives you a very distored view of your baby's fingernails. Speaking of clippers...the pin that holds it together kept popping out (the ones that come with Lil' Tummy's gas drops free have been the best). The medicine dispenser is hard to pull up and doesn't dispense all of the medication in it. The thermometer didn't even give an accurate reading (scary thought). I gave this two stars because the brush, comb, nail file, and toothbrush are just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to agree with overall opinon","review":"I have small hands, so I actually can't grip this product with one hand.

As an RN,we encouraged prospective parents to refrain from being drawn in by the \\"cuteness\\" of items that are geared only to be sold, not to be useful.

In this way, you can check for quality and longevity. Put together your own kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"The screen protector is an overpriced and useless piece of plastic. It is impossible to eliminate all the bubbles, so it must be removed to watch anything on the screen. There must be something better out there.That said, the player itself is fantastic.

Her trademark telling notes in the margins accompany some stories, making this an excellent resource for use with new tellers.

The past five years have witnessed such an explosion of religion-related resources on the internet that tracking reliable & authoritative information can become a chore. With a scholar's critical judgment & a master teacher's communication skills Bruce Lawrence guides cyber-pilgrims -- both seekers & scholars -- from one end of the religious spectrum to the other to websites that are worth the trip. This is a book that any researcher in religion should consult before going on-line. Minutes consulting this Guide can save hours wasted in sorting the chaff churned up by mechanical search engines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good show.","review":"The author of this book is clearly literate and well-read, and puts together a really interesting chronology and analysis of the effects of the breakup of the European empires. At the beginning I wasn't very encouraged, as I found the first chapter to be a little too abstract and opining, but thereafter the author quickly gets into some fascinating matters of real substance. We learn where the term 'third world' was first used; how when the inhabitants of French Guinea opted for full independence the French decolonised so emphatically they took the phones off the walls when they left; how Bokassa's coronation ceremony is alleged to have cost a quarter of his country's wealth, and so on.Don't let the brevity put you off: this is a well-written, well-rounded portrait of decolonisation by a guy with informed opinions on these matters. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Phone Beware","review":"I purchased this phone. It malfunctions often. Many of the number keys do not work. The sound quality is bad. Batery life is very short. If you do buy this phone make sure you have a backup phone; becaues it malfunctions often. The answerning machine recording quality is very poor.

But maybe (maybe) the lyrics are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hip to Care?","review":"I am a Speech fan. I really am. But after listening to Hoopla I came away feeling a sense of wanting. Not for the lyrics - Speech is as conscious and political as he has ever been - but for the music. In his efforts to enlighten the unenlightened, he forgets (ignores?) the medium through which he is delivering this message. The music accompanying the message is uninspirational barring a few sweet tracks such as \\"Real Love\\" and \\"Our Image\\". There is a sameness to all the tracks that was so refreshing on his first album \\"Speech\\". But for the 16 songs, give or take, on Hoopla, it is repetitive and unimaginative. The reason why \\"3 years, 4 months and 2 days\\" and \\"Speech\\" were so well received is because the substance was accompanied by a burst of muscial fresh air. Sadly, Hoopla doesn't.Then again, maybe I didn't get Hoopla. But I think I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively grooves, great lyrics, good sounds...","review":"Wow, \\"Hoopla\\" is a fantastic disc! Speech's reworking of the 4 non Blondes song \\"What's going on\\" into \\"The Hey Song\\" is a great reminder of what hip-hop is supposed to be about: building a killer song from the groove up, and having fun with it. Speech's production skills are incredible. This disc is just crammed with all sort of facsinating sounds. You'll hear something new with each listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ear candy that you can not get enough of.","review":"This is one of the most positive CDs I have heard in a long time. Yeah, Yeah has a nice groove that gets in your head and you just can't get it out. Mountian of lonely reminds me of The Artist (Prince)but with a more positive message. Its about marriage and spending you live with that person. Our Image makes you want to move something. The beats and the lyrics are tight. The mixture of jazz, hip-hop, rap, and R&B makes this a great CD. There is a little something for everyone.

I just did not get into this book. After the first 200 pages, I just couldn't read any more. The writing was sophmoric, very easy reading, with no depth.

Kate sings lead on the title song,\\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\", and \\"Christmas Just Ain't Christmas Without You\\". She also sings backup on \\"Winter Wonderland\\".Kate has the hard country blues style of Patsy Cline and rough rock sound of Pat Benatar. If it weren't for her voice on this album the album would not be worth listening to. Wow, what a voice.The rest of the songs on this album are hokey at best and not worth listening to. I wanted to skip past the rest of the songs, but I made myself listen to them once.If you want a Christmas album that is unique and stupid at the same time, then this is the album to buy.

I've had it for six or seven years years and have bought several copies for friends, who also love it. The title cut alone is worth the price, and I don't understand why Christmas Just Ain't Christmas Without You doesn't get air play. What a great song! Ditto their delightful, toe-tapping renditions of White Christmas, Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland, and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. Makes you want to get on the dance floor.

Our local radio stations have the phone ringing off the hook at Christmas time to play this song. It is the single most requested song at Christmas in this area. People keep bugging the D.J.'s to find out who is singing that song. Whoever the artist is that is singing it (we can't determine who it is) has a wonderful voice. We bought the album, but it doesn't say who the singer is. We play the song occasionally all year long because we enjoy it so much. Also, we like \\"Christmas Just Ain't Christmas Without You\\" on the same album. We think the same artist sings both.

First off in Robot mode he is nearly impossible to stand up without a back support, in beast mode he can stand on his own( but only with the feet in the right spots). The lights and sounds are the only saving feature. Yes He has two fireing missles(In one arm Making that side neadlessly heavy and un poseable) and an extending battle claw in the other arm(but you cannot use it when he is holding his sword). On a scale of 1-10 I give Supreme Cheetor a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great-looking toy for big spenders","review":"This Beast Machines Cheetor is the biggest transformer I've ever seen. It's also one of the heaviest and most expensive. It resembles the TV Cheetor a lot, especially in robot form. The transformation from the animal to robot mode seemed really easy, another plus if you're buying for a child. It's also electronic with neat sounds of an explosion emitting from Cheetor's chest. Everything about this toy is great except two thing. Since his legs are nearly half of his height and the torso is heavy, it took me a while to stand him up on his own two feet. Also, it was hard to keep the tail from coming off because the little joint was too small to fit the hole. Overall it's a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM TRANSFORMED!","review":"Cheetor is in a word \\"prime\\" . but one majore fault ive been hearing about is that he usally topples over . it is very easy to stand him up once you get the hang of it just staghten out his legs and make sure those little spikes are out. another fault is that he is bigger than every other beast machine toy, which makes him invinicple to any vechicon . hasbro should have made a supreme thrust or tankor to battle cheetor and other than that cheetor is very cool . he launches two missles from his arm and he has a giant sword ( he only came with one wich stinks but what am i going to do ) he is electronic and looks very much like his C.G.I model or computer generated image. In cheetah mode he is bigger than my cat . his head is tiny but still cool . I highly reccomened buying this toy evern though the price is high ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Heavy Fun","review":"Alright, I am a long loving Transformers fan. I grey up with them in fact. Now first off the pros. Nicely posible and I like the missles that shoot out of his hand, kinda like a gun. plus it is COOL to have the 2nd largest TF toy ever. He just looks cool and how he lights up and stuff. the negatives - transforming is TOO simple - for [the money] I want a challenge like Optimal Optimus. Another thing, his legs are TOO long to hold up his body, his TOP heavy body. I've only gotten him to stand up as a robot once, which was soon knocked down when my friend blew on it and laughed. one thing that gets anoying is the little arm things popping off and the front chest panel because they are flimsy. Still a great toy, but they should've choosen a diffrent figure to make the large one.

It is nothing more than a windy, self-indulgent waste of paper that will leave even the most ardent of legal thriller fans struggling to finish.

I told them that was crazy and they should at least let me have other Kohler toilets and they said no.I am now in the process of writing Kohler upper management.

I have found that I need to close the control valve on the regulator to allow my generator to run properly. The generator requires 10PSI of propane to operate properly and by having to close the control valve on the regulator either the valve is NOT outputting 10PSI or there is a problem with my brand new generator. At this time I am holding both in question hence the two stars for the regulator (generator got two stars as well). I will update this review once I find out which item is the culprit.1/16/2013 UPDATE.Well I've used the generator and regulator during a power outage and they both worked well. I did however still need to adjust the valve shut off slightly to achieve the 10PSI my generator required.

Of course, Segal kills them all and even downs a helicopter with a small 9mm that suddenly converts to full auto.

Can you really take seriously the thankless police commander who demoted our man when he saved the day on the bridge at the start of the movie, or the woman boss who would not have looked out of place in a shampoo advertisement or modelling clothes?? The fight action scenes were reasonable. As a biker, I loved the Ducati but why the wheelie? It slows you down when you have three vehicles of bad guys and auto weapons chasing after you while you only have a never ending supply of bullets in your one and only handgun. I know we should not take this seriously and I am very fond of films where you can just watch and not believe all that you see, but this was a poor attempt at revitalising Stevens career and would fit better in the 'film spoof' category.

Somebodywalks up and tries to get the person being protectedaway from them will be given full body ventilationand a third eye.The Secret Service men here just nod andturn him over to an unidentified person.Not going to happen.Additionally, flash a badge to a SWAT team when theyare entering a building in a fire fight and theywill search you and cuff you to a fire hydrant keepyou out of their way until the building is secure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exit Wounds is explosive!","review":"When I saw previews for this movie, I thought to myself man I want to go see this movie. I never did though go to the movies to see it. I finally rented it though and I wasn't disappointed one bit. The action is off the chain, the plot is pulsating, and Seagal is his typical bad ass self. There were other good performances in this movie as well. DMX is equal to Seagal in the bad ass department, Isaiah Washington shows off his versatility as the cop teamed with Seagal, and Michael Jai White is very convincing as the devil cop Louis Strutt. The best part in the movie is when Boyd (Seagal) fights Strutt while Rollins (DMX) fights Bontini. If you're a movie fan who likes over-dramatized Oscar movie dribble, then this movie isn't for you.

Looking healthy and trim, he struts and pounds through this fast-moving police action flick.Rapper DMX is very cool as his co-star crime-fighter, and his video \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" is Bad.

I watched it expecting something like the excelent Glimmer Man or Under Siege series, Under Deadly Ground, Above the Law or Out For Justice. But unfortunatly what meant to be a good story, ended meeting Joe Silver, producer of The Matrix, which is an excellent movie. But I trully don't understand why Joe Silver keep insisting in his formula of impossible jumps. This might be the right thing to do when Keanu Reeves or someone else is running the show, but surely it isn't a good thing when Seagal is on the stage. Seagal does not need any \\"turbo\\" effects to make his fighting nice and thrilling. This film totally screwed up Seagal's talent and his reallistic fighting. The only nice thing in this movie is the end when the fat guy is in a talk show.

This movie is filled with mindless plot twist, and pointless fights that end with a sputter rahter than a bang. The most notable happens right before..yet another plot twist. There is killings of characters that in a good movie would effect the characters in some way, however seem to be forgotten about in this movie.

There are at least 3-4 other spotlights here, and the movie gets pretty comical at times.

Great Moments that make you feel excited. Like a five minute car chase, a final battle between druglords and cops. I was like, oh sweet.

I have a bottle I bought in the UK (also made in the UK) which smells like the true \\"classic\\" one, but it doesn't advertise it on the bottle. I compared the two formulas and they are different. This one smells different, as if it were made with cheaper ingredients. That characteristic strong pine-horse chestnut smell is gone. Even the colour has been messed with. It dilutes into a cheap, artificial, almost urinous yellowish-green that makes you want to run away from the bathtub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best scent in the world","review":"I have been using this soap since I was a little girl in Germany.It smells refreshing, clean, and green!Leaves you moisturized, not squeaky, keeps your jewelry shiny, and has a pleasant texture to use.I do recommend dispensing it into another container that squirts easily into your hand... the widemouth bottle can lead to overly generous dollops of soap!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I have used this product for many years.

The scent is very strong if you take a whiff from the bottle, but once in the bath water, it is much less in your face. This bubble bath is not overly bubbly, which I like, gives off a very relaxing yet stimulating scent, and makes your bath water a pale green. Which, to me, adds to the relaxation for some reason. It's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Badedas is the absolute best","review":"I was introduced to Badedas when I lived in Germany many years ago. Once you use this product nothing else can compare to it. I am glad to see that it can be purchased now within the States but someone is making a lot of money on it.

Wild Angels is really classic Martin at his best, invoking a bit of gospel a la \\"Faith on the Table\\" and \\"Real man\\" and \\"Happy\\" is just a plain and simple catchy tune that makes you want to hum and sing along.Not in the league of The American and Black Sheep, but much better than his freshman efforts on \\"In the Journey\\". I saw him in Seattle just a few weeks after the release, and his band is fun and musical. Hardcore Sexton fans might whine that Martin has lost his edge, but I like to think that he has just found his groove and mellowed on this album.Still, the rumored album of Martin covering famous tunes would be incredible. Until then, we have this great effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy tunes but uninspired vocals","review":"After all those years of hearing Martin perform live (since 1989 in that church basement in Worcester, MA)...when you hear this recording you just want to grab him, shake him, and yell, \\"SING!\\" The performer who has blown us all away with that amazing, soaring voice, refuses to put his trademark energy into any of these tunes. I don't know why, and it's very frustrating. The tunes are catchy, and several lend themselves to be taken \\"out\\" a bit...you can feel it coming...then it doesn't happen. Those who have never seen Martin live may enjoy the music: it is not bad at all...it's just not Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointing","review":"this long anticipated CD was extremely disappointing. we felt very let down by the lack of artistic originality, depth & Sexton spirit which have all been indelible trademarks of Sexton (previous) recordings.

The Giant Cat is about Auon (the son of the main character of Quest for Fire) and his friend Zouhr who end up leaving their tribal lands and discovering a far-away land with plentiful resources - a kind of paradise. During their journey, they establish a connection with a giant cave lion, whose friendship provides a good contrast to the treacherous and malignant nature of people, whether their original tribe or other enemies.

Lo-fi perhaps","review":"My first impression now :) is that the albums was not good at all; GbV evolved from good old lo-fi to, well i can't put a name tag on it but it's just some kind of studio hi-fi rock album, probably made to sell. If they start with keyboards the whole thing turns out wrong. It started with Mag Earwigh! and it just got worse. The sort of 4/4 straight to the head kinda heavy wall of sound stuff just is nothing compared to there old albums like the brilliant Under the Bushes or Self Inflected Areal Nostalgia or Same place the fly got smashed. There is missing something, perhaps it is Toby Sprout?

I wanted to hear the new stuff before I started to work my way backward into the catalogue. \\"Do the Collapse\\" came out just in time.This album is supposed to be a step up --- better sound, a real producer, etc. But GBV albums seem to stand or fall on the songwriting, not the production. On \\"Do the Collapse,\\" everything is slick and nothing sticks. The hooks are as sincere as a Backstreet Boys record. Every song is forgettable.

Best tracks: Things That I Will Keep, Strumpet Eye, Wrecking Now, Surgical Focus, Unmarketed Product. Some dirge-like, weird, vaguely-early-GBV stuff too (In Stitches), sort of like Kid Marine with \\"pro\\" production. Any GBV fan will like this album. Newcomers go to Under The Bushes Under The Stars, Bee Thousand, Propeller, & Alien Lanes. I'd love to see Robert Pollard find a nice middle ground between his instant pop genius and his weird, Wire/early Genesis/prog, etc. side... that will be his true masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has GBV sold out? I don't care... this is a great album","review":"While accusation swirl about \\"selling out\\" they should fall on deaf ears, since those same ears should be listening to this album. I had written GBV off after the very lackluster \\"Mag Earwig\\" album which seemed to abandon the quirkyness of their previous material. \\"Do the Collapse\\" is a return to form of sorts, but stretches out their songs so that they play for more than 45 seconds and keeps the emotion intact. Take \\"alien lanes\\" and polish it up to a major label standard then you got this album right here. A good effort all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upon further review...","review":"As a long time GBV fan, I hated this when it came out in 1999. It wasn't the production that bothered me, I thought the songs were weak, especially when up against the brillant standard set by \\"Bee Thousand and \\"Alien Lanes\\". I puleed it out tonight and I still don't like \\"Teenage FBI\\" and \\"Zoo Pie\\", which unfortunately open the album. They sound like filler to me, not album openers. However, there is not another clunker on the disc, and some absolute gems. Many have commented on \\"Surgical Focus and \\"Liquid Indian\\", and I agree that those are two of the best. My favorite, however, is the final 1-2 punch of \\"Picture me Big Time\\" and \\"An Unmarketed Product\\". A gorgeous tune followed by 63 seconds of tuneful bedlam.

For every inch it moves forward, it jumps back a half inch. The quality of the scan is great though.2. After the first toner and drum wore off, I have had a miserable time getting the replacements to work. I tried Brothers toner and drum and later, some from ABC ink. These are very expensive (high cost of ownership). Whatever I printed or copied had streaks or too much greys in them. Some forums I visited said that cheaper alternatives do not work with Brother's products.3.

You may want to check that one out too. You can read all about how he died and how the fake Paul, or Faul is not taking his place. Just thought I should let you know. For one if Elvis were alive he'd still be singing, the man was possessed with music, and he's a habitual performer. You could tell he loved music too much to just let it go.. And finally, if Elvis were really alive that whole Lisa Marie/Michael Jackson thing never would have happened.

And this is the only reason I'm not giving the album 5 stars; However, most of the songs are very good.Giorgia however, is brilliant. Her voice rivals any singer you may think of. But the \\"gist\\" and the personality that comes through, and the way she uses her voice is unrivaled. The music is not in function of flaunting her vocal capabilities, as it appears in the later albums of Mariah Carrey or Whitney Houston. The music, the songs, and her voice make a balanced, harmonious ONE. This is Giorgia's music and she's \\"in it\\" voice, heart, and soul. If you understand italian, the lyrics are beautiful too, especially the song \\"come saprei\\" - a moving love song by a woman to a man. Hats off Giorgia!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch Italian rock","review":"This is a terrific CD.

Most will be mastered better than this, although the remastering is not bad at all. The only reason why this should be noted, for completely mad die-hard Numan fans, is that the version of \\"We Take Mystery (To Bed)\\" is the 12\\" version, which I have not been able to find anywhere else.

As a Floridian, I lived through much of what he wrote about. Hiaasen's incredible wit paints a disturbing picture of the follies of the Politicians we Floridians have mindlessly voted into office. During the first few pages I laughed pretty hard. But then he kept reminding me time and time again about what we've allowed to happen to our state, to the point where the book got depressing.

It was followed by another amazing song, which was followed by two more amazing songs. It was the kind of music, that even though I had never heard it before, was immediately captivating. I went and asked the store what they were playing and it was this CD from the Cheathams. I bought the CD and I've loved it ever since. It is a very high energy Jazz. Jeannie has a beautiful voice with tremendous vocal expression which is perfect for the poignant lyrics that are often rather amusing and blunt (such as the final song that declares \\"You need a doctor to take thw wrinkles out of your birthday suit.\\") The beat is very soulful and exciting to listen to.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's remember AUTISM and ASPERGERS are very different!","review":"I think this book is discouraging and mistitled.

HUGE differences. Don't be mislead by this book. Although you should not give up hope when you have a child with autism, you need to remember the child with aspergers IS higher functioning.

People that I never realized have autism have had to live with the same difficulties as our little Carley. People who have accomplished wonderful things in this world.

Students need to know that just because they have a mild/moderate disability does not mean they can't be personally successful at something they love. It is often the disability that leads an individual to their success... and this book points that out. It should of course be noted that success doesn't necessarily equate with riches or fame. Non-disabled students should read this book so they can have a greater appreciation for their disabled classmates. Disabled students could use this book to do a 'hero' report on an individual in the book. I can also be a springboard for discussing well-known individuals with disabilities living today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroes","review":"I loved this book.

It took a while for the \\"good\\" stuff to happen, but it was interesting to watch how this bacteria began to mutate and turn it's victims into mad raging killers. I seriously dug this enough to actually write this review. My only complaint and why it only gets four stars and not five is that it ended too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A RIDE!","review":"A smart thriller of a movie, this one traces the accidental creation of a mutating bacteria that turns people into blood-spewing (and spilling) killers. While the general concept is not new, the strength of this movie lies in the smart storytelling, lingering over character development, giving us reason to care for the characters long before all hell breaks loose, and focusing on the story behind the breakout of the bacterial plague. The characters feel like real people, with real lives, real problems. Although there are plenty of other killer virus/plague/zombie movies out there, none are as believably told as this. Definitely worth watching, and watching again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Version of 28 Days Later","review":"This could have been a really good sci-fi movie, but it attempts to be \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" at the end. And fails miserably. It's more watchable than the Sci-Fi network's wreck of the week, but not by much. Good actors hamstrung by an awful script. Actually, I may have to take that Sci-Fi statement back. At least you know what's going on, (and probably know the whole movie), within the first few minutes. This piece of dreck doesn't seem to know where it's going or what's it's all about until half way through this slog. Confused about the first 2 minutes of the film? Don't worry. It ties back in somewhere toward the end. Assuming you want to wait that long to find out. Even if it was free, you're better off re-watching \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".

It was so boring; the acting was aweful; they threw things in that made no sense {random girl/girl kiss for example). I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. The only excitement was in the last few minuts, but it was so bad that you would just be excited it was almost over (that is if you made it this far).

But I really believe Sonatine is the best film he ever wrote - directed - and acted. As a second film he directed, there were some very rough parts, but the film itself has such a strong power and it shows no fear. I was rather disappointed on his recent work \\"Brother\\" as I was hoping that film to be more like \\"Sonatine.\\" I find new discovery everytime I see this film. His treatment of comedy and violence is so powerful and extreme, which comes from his background as a stand-up comedian. I really wish the DVD version will soon be released.

A better way to say it is that the characters don't say much, they sit around waiting, they walk around like sticks until they briefly shoot at each other at close range. They seem like they are in a trance and don't seem to care whether they live or die. We get to feel like the characters - totally bored. (And, I had difficulty reading the sub-titles.)I don't get it. I am on another planet from those who rave about this film. Critics must have to go to a special film school that teaches you to see magic where there is nothing. There is so little here that the film becomes whatever you wish to project onto it. This movie is close to a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"make sure you know what you're getting into","review":"I got almost nothing out of this movie. I'd like to believe the guy who suggests that it's because I don't speak Japanese, but I don't think that's the problem. I've enjoyed lots of foreign films, including Zatoichi by the same director. This movie, however, I did not enjoy. All of the comparisons to The Godfather and Goodfellas are totally unwarranted, and I must say I wonder if the people making them are truly genuine, or just plants of some kind. There are parts of Sonatine that I enjoyed, but on the whole I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I will say that some of the acting is good, but as a whole the movie does not succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hollow men","review":"Easily one of the most vaccuous movies in recent memory. Only for those fans who misjudge the empty silences between explicable action or dialogue as fraught with profound implications. This movie is nothing but a pretentious yakuza flick. The gunfights are cheesy (they go off like cap-guns), the acting is wooden (Kitano especially, who possibly has two expressions to choose from), and the characterization is completely arbitrary. And if I see one more movie glorifying another gangster, whether or not he has the heart of a poet, I'm doing something rash like joining the NRA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Con by the reviewers","review":"Watch foreign films three to four times a week.

Pickover is obviously a very smart man (has website with riduculous-smarty-pants stuff on it) who has a knack for making difficult topics readable. He feeds the reader enough hard science references to challenge the mind, and then surrounds them with a \\"cute\\" story. It makes the book easily readable, yet thought-provoking.I found this book most useful as a launching pad to other mathematics-science-astronomy texts. (Flatland, Fantasia Mathematica, and Brief History of Time tie in closely.)For those who have not yet considered interaction with 4th Dimensional beings...or with alternative visions of your \\"God\\" I recommend this book.

Herrero is so exhaustive in his efforts to describe every type of bear attack that after a while you wonder how you can possibly survive a night outside. It seems that in every situation, no matter what you do to avoid a mauling there is a story where it leads to a mauling. But his complete look at all types of maulings comes to two conclusions. First there are basic strategies that work in almost all situations and second, bears are unpredictable so there is no magic answer for all situations.The book does have a lot of graphic bear attack stories, but this is not a typical \\"bear attack\\" book. In the end this book is an academic book full of scientific analysis and statistics. Between attack stories, it can be dry, scientific reading. But if you want to know everything you can about you won't do better than this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bear Attacks","review":"I found the book to be interesting, but confusing. The author obviously is a scientist, and knows what he is talking about; however, he included a lot of facts and figures which, to me were not really necessary. Also, he seemed to vacillate back and forth in his descriptions of and solutions for bear attacks. I did not know whether I should run, play dead, fight, climb a tree, or intimidate the bear. I think that in the very few seconds before an attack, there would not be time to decide whether the bear was predatory, starving, or merely protecting its cubs. Not to worry, though, I don't plan to ever be near any bears, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart Coffee Carafe red","review":"I actually needed and thought I had ordered a Hamilton Beach carafe, but the Cuisinart carafe fits in well in my Hamilton Beach coffee maker.

Talk about potential wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than awful","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune of enduring. The concept is interesting, but the special effects really are the only thing this movie has going for it, which is a real shame. The Asylum, who make the usually pretty dire SyFy Original Motion Pictures, do better than this... six or seven times out of ten. Poor writing, really rather dumb, unlikable characters, and writers/directors who really seemed more interested in making video games than movies make this one one to miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special Effects vs Plot","review":"(Beware, this review contain spoilers.) No plot but very well executed special effects. I think most everybody could have developed a plot like this one. It is easy to think of a story about humanity perishing under the attack of interplanetary aliens. Come on, that's really easy. The aliens come, shoot or burn or eat or disintegrate everybody, then end of story. No necessity for developing an ending where somebody saves the day, no matter how improbable. Just mankind disappearing. One of the worst movie ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"revolting","review":"Great special effects. Everything else was horrendous, not to mention revolting.

I don't like things that don't have either an ending or an implied sequel. I seriously doubt that they will have a sequel so it was just a dumb ending. I give all movies a 1 star that DVD manufacturer/producers have started making the consumer buy Blue Ray to view any of the extra features as seems to be popular with DVD movie makers today. Worse, they have a menu and sub-menus of extras. Each one taking you to a message that says you have to purchase Blue Ray to view. What? You weren't making enough millions on DVDs? I will NEVER purchase a Blue Ray system. DVD is just fine with me. I can't afford, nor will I let any producer shove formats down my throat. How possitively rude. By putting the extras 'tease' menus on the DVD that lead to no where but your pocket book, you guarantee me not buying your product.

I absolutely hated this movie. I felt like it had a cast filled with supporting actors, no heavy hitters anchoring it down. Now, this movie is compared with ID4, Alien, War of the Worlds, whatever...NO WAY... ID4 has real heart, characters you care about, they have an affect on the outcome. Alien is cinematic classic, this doesnt even come close to touching Alien...so forget that comparison! Lastly, War of the Worlds, brilliant, beautiful, scary and like nothing I'd seen, this movie doesnt touch IT either.

(which is almost the same film released just a few months apart), and the upcoming tv series FALLING SKIES... etc. Nothing worth watching except for the seamless special effects, but even the aliens and the alien spacecrafts of the film aren't interesting. There is somewhat of a social commentary about the negative 'Hollywood' lifestyle and it's denizens. It was so, that, nobody cares if the characters in this film live or die. This reviewer recommends just putting in INDEPENDENCE DAY, if one wants a rousing \\"alien-attacks-earth /earth-fights-back\\"/type film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD FILM","review":"JUST A WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS.

This is the plot/story. Aliens Invade, Human Die. The End. Its a constant bored. At one point I really thought it would get better, the last half hour would be awesome. I was wrong, it was worst than the beginning of the movie, it just kept getting more retarded by the minute. The CGI work was good, the acting was horrid along with everything else but the CGI. Don't waste you money on buying, or renting.

It had the right amount of action, suspense, and great special effects, but the ending was just borderline ridiculous. The movie itself was like a mix of Cloverfield, and War of the Worlds, but the ending was like a very cheesy 60's sci-fi ending. Jarrod and his wife, Elaine go to L.A. for his friend Terry's Birthday. Early the next morning, bright blue lights come from the sky and huge alien spaceships appear. If anybody looks directly into the light, they become entranced and burn their blood vessels. The aliens are stealing humans. Jarrod, Elaine, Terry and their friends try to survive. I would not recommend SKYLINE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good sci-fi","review":"I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. I guess you either love this or hate it.

Or does the light see him? In any case he's consumed with aliens. This is a real brain teaser. The noisy music is what probably drew aliens with better taste.I have never seen a more pitiful excuse for a movie. It's the standard invasion movie you know like \\"War of the Worlds\\" without the pathos. Even Stephen King would barf. As you know even a Stephen King formula is to keep it almost believable, not inconceivable. A better duffus film like this would be \\"Independence Day\\" (1996) with a better actor Bill Pullman.I suggest you do not waste your time with this ridicules thing and if you must watch something that has aliens walking the streets and peaking in windows watch Target Earth (1954).Target Earth ~ Richard DenningOver Sexed Rugsuckers from Mars"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever","review":"My title says it all.

They are unable to see truth in anything and prefer to get the \\"Safe version\\" where it all turns out ok in the end. Well, sorry to inform them that life doesn't always turn out ok for everybody. This movie shows a small story of what is a huge invasion, it's not the entire story at all. If something like what this movie portrays really happened, the outcome would not be a good one. I'm confident enough in my opinion to believe that the lower the IQ, the more unhappy the individual will be with this movie. Specifically because they just can't understand it and need that reassuring message of hope that this movie does not give the viewer. Don't watch this movie if you're IQ is less than 100, you won't like it or understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Alient Storyline","review":"Not sure why people are giving it low rating.

The characters are so vapid and low that it's heartening when they are serially slurped up by the aliens. Thankfully everyone eventually was consumed so they had to \\"end\\" it, if you can call the last scene an ending. Sometimes special effects are enough to at least make for good escape, but the plot in this case is so awful that you will regret allowing the images into your memory. If there is a subliminal message it is that the human race is so hopeless that the studio thinks people will pay to watch a movie that illustrates their hopelessness. Don't enable them to insult you. Something positive? The poor actors did a good job trying to make something positive out of the hopeless screenplay.

The worst part is this movie was just horrible. I was curious and bored (bad combination) and so I rented my first movie from Amazon last night. I doubt I will ever make that mistake again. There is just not enough new movies to choose from and this one should just be removed from the library. Skyline is a rip off of Independence Day and a bad Godzilla movie. The alien the main character fights on the roof looks almost identical to the alien in the lab on Independence Day. Then lets talk about how the first 20 minutes of the movie is obviously geared toward impressing pre-teens with the LA party scene.

The plot was grotesque, the acting was even worse, and the storyline as a whole was non existent.Total letdown with no probative value whatsoever, special effects where meh, and the creatures themselves were so appallingly unbelievable that it was painful to watch.

The actors were ok at acting, but the story just dragged. They pretty much sat in an apartment the entire time while aliens destroyed everybody and everything. Their efforts to escape were lame, and they didn't really try very hard. The ending was when the movie finally got interesting and grabbed my attention, but then the credits rolled and I was left wondering why I spent $10 to see it. It seemed open for a sequel, but they really should have gotten to what happened at the end much quicker and continued the movie from there. They would have had a much more interesting movie.

When any person looks into the light, gets pulled into one of the spaceships. Why? Maybe perhaps the aliens want to use the humans as a power source to power the blue LED lights? We don't know until the very end.There are way too many holes in this film. When a nuclear bomb is detonated on one of the spaceships, it does not vaporize. It gets damaged, but somehow it proceeds to repair itself back to the original shape and form.Throughout the movie, they are trying to make it to the boat, because the aliens can not function over the water. What would prevent them? They seem to have advanced technology.Some of the special effects are cheezy, dialog terrible.

A group of irritating, partying stoner-types, whose lives you will never care about because the writers obviously didn't, are followed during an alien invasion. I've enjoyed Eric Balfour in Haven and other appearances, but this movie was not his friend. The character was shallow, more-so than the usual action-movie characters, and there didn't seem to be any coherent story line at all.

I don't understand why nobody wants to offer him a role in a major motion picture. Once again he's very good and engaging in a movie that just crashes and burns.

What it is - as one other reviewer said, \\"Independence Day done right.\\" The beauty of the movie is not in what it says, but what it doesn't say. The movie leaves you with more questions than answers which I have to admit, I enjoy a lot more than having every piece of the plot backstory, and future filled out with no room for conjecture.As I said, it's a good flick - solid acting - more drama than action. If you like movies that make you, \\"huh?\\" or \\"what the ... is going on here\\" give this a whirl. It will sate you.

I'm not exagerating either, or a big movie \\"buff\\", this was plain awful. Theres no appeal to this, the aliens have no character or purpose, the scenes are unoriginal, characters non existant, boring. The fact that there is anybody who could give this 5 stars is amazing.

I don't think any particular one of those elements are especially terrible, it's just that none of them really work all that well here and all these sub par elements combined make this a sub par movie that had lots of unfulfilled potential.Nevertheless, it kept me entertained, and I honestly don't think it's as bad as everyone else seems to think it is. If you decide to watch it, my advice is don't set your expectations too high and don't take it too seriously, and you might enjoy it despite its flaws.2 and a half stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"That ending...","review":"A film about an alien invasion of the earth where the point seems to be harvesting human beings for some purpose. Set in Los Angeles, we follow a group of characters living their lives when the aliens invade with their motherships and eerie blue light that does strange things to people. We watch our heroes hiding and then trying to escape the invasion but to no avail: everyone dies or is captured. The air of the movie is bleak, the special effects are great, the whole movie has an air of hopelessness (on mankind's part) and is quite disturbing but then comes the ending of the film with our two remaining heroes (one of whom is pregnant) captured by an alien mothership and the aliens harvesting human brains... a bizarre ending to what up until that point was a not too bad film. I would have said avoid this film but apparently there's going to be a Skyline 2... maybe this will repair some of the damage of that God-awful ending?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run while there is still time!","review":"It's unusual for me to come across a movie that doesn't seem to have anyredeeming value.

The acting is quite horrible and puts the existence of films to shame. The special effects are nothing to brag about, and that is saying a lot because the guys behind it have noteworthy credentials. The progression of the story itself leaves me in utter disappointment of watching such a derisory film. I will admit that the trailers for this sorry excuse of a Sci-Fi movie entangled me to view it. When the film decides to pick up the pace along its slow plot, the action is completely predictable and unsophisticated. Lastly the ending and the main character's \\"special ability\\" has no background or sense to it, that it makes me scoff at this extremely lackluster movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"My God....The worst movie i have seen !!!","review":"There are no words to describe how bad this movie is...Sci fi fans...stay away from this one..the story line..horrendous..the acting...awful...the special effects..few , not bad but not worth spending your money...if you want to end a friendship ..give this movie as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"only chose one star 'cause it won't let me rate it NO stars","review":"Pro: Very well done sfxCon: it's like they WANT you to dislike all the characters. there was no point, acting was not good, the aliens are here for our BRAINS!! when it's over you just feel like 'why did i bother?\\"Battle: L.A. is everything this movie is not, go see that, then go hug a MARINE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombie Aliens","review":"Brains!!!!

Close Curtains, peek thru curtains go out to roof, see Aliens, run hide back in Apt, peek thru curtains, hide from harvest sentinels peeking in, sneak down to garage, try to drive out, get stopped by giant alien, drive backwards into garage, run back up to Apt, see military, go back up to roof, hail military, see military get whacked, run back to Apt yada yada.It didn't go nowhere.

And the reason for the alien invasion? Well, a viewer's suspension of disbelief requires a little help from the movie-makers, but we as viewers never get the help we need. If you can blot out all attempts to understand the action in any rational way, you might enjoy the mayhem and the effects. I need a bit more, even in an action/effects flick.

Move along, move along. \\"Skyline\\" is an amalgam of plagiarized tidbits from similar movies, sprinkled with boring dialogue. The main characters are sleazebags, and it's not clear why they're included. It's hard to identify with anyone. Some SFX mistakes are noticeable, and some juicy potential shots are missed. The plot is hollow and predictable up to the very last scene, which delivers an \\"Oh, BROTHER\\" moment. The ending is a slap-in-the-face fizzle. Trying to understand this movie, I think the writers visualised the modern equivalent of a 1950s serial or \\"B\\" movie, but the charm or campiness is missing. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious Unintentional Parody","review":"I rarely watch SciFi movies because in general they can be counted on to be trite, unimaginative, and deathly dull. This movie is no exception save for the special effects, which are really good CGI. But the plot is, well, entirely vacant and the acting is wooden and the script was apparently written by an eight-year-old who clearly enjoyed highly caffeinated soda more than literature of any kind. Pretty much no cliche is left unturned, but the funniest moment for me was when the terrifying alien invader - that has resisted all manner of hi-tech weaponry so far - is vanquished by one angry young dude's fists of fury.

Lame acting--main character seems to be on drugs. More action than character development. Unrealistic reactions from some characters. For this type of movie, didn't like the flashback style of the beginning. No need to see the first few minutes again.However, most of the movie was better than I expected. This movie received terrible reviews and was only in theaters where I live for a very short time. Didn't expect much, so wasn't disappointed.Except with the ending. Very abrupt and left me going HUH?? Pretty obvious what would eventually happen, but interesting that the creators avoided explicit violence at the very end, unlike throughout the earlier film. I think they were hoping the film would be a hit so they could justify a sequel that would pick up at this point. Probably not, unless it goes straight to video."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST FILM OF 2010","review":"Prepare yourself. One of the WORST movies of all time.

The computer effects were very well done so there's really no complaint from that department; the storyline was the familiar alien invasion by a technologically superior force.Most of the component elements of the story were pretty much of an \\"off-the-shelf\\" variety so there were few, if any surprises. The genre of this movie is a blend of sci-fi and horror with the horror part taking the lead most of the movie. Did I mention that there is no ending, the movie just picks a point and stops on a very downer note. I've seen other movies and books that did this and I must confess this approach is rather annoying to me.This is definitely one you want to watch before buying; some of the reviewers liked it but it's a very polarizing movie in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skyline","review":"This was a totally different concept with an Alien invasion movie!

I think I say goodmorning in a hungover state in more tune than this man sings."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've heard one, you've heard em all...","review":"Wesley Willis: the most laughably awful musician of our time. His songs are repetitive verses with the chorus consisting of Willis yelling the title of the song and a crummy musical background heading up most of the track. Willis is an incredibly untalented \\"artist\\" who is not out to make any statement of any kind. I meet trash collectors more creative than Willis. If you hear one of his songs, guess what: you've heard every single one of his other 400+ songs and you've wasted about three minutes to boot. Don't believe the lies spread by the other reviewers here. Willis is the worst artist in the world today."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'a a Harmony Joy Busride","review":"Wesley Willis is the real antipop!He is the granddadyy of Rock & RollGet down to his crazy lyrics and old skool keyboard beatsFeel the power of Rock & RollRock over London!Rock on Chicago!Heinz!

Why the love/hate relationship to this music? Bottom line, if you give it a chance it is infectious, like a case of herpes. It drones on in your head and you find yourself siging a rousing chorus of \\"Oil Express\\" at the most inappropriate time. For all these reasons I fully endorse the genius of Wesley Willis. He does what all modern rock does, using a repetitive and predictable formula as a basis of the artform. Its magic is in its repetitive simplicity. Plus he's a cool guy, great live too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good record done very well!","review":"Yes, most songs start and end the same. Three songs are heavy metal based-by far the best remake of girls on film (duran duran) The genious in writing a song about getting your oil changed is hard to top. I'm running my ink pen sounds like some early Department S 70's punk. Wanna get some funny looks? crank the vultures ate my dead ass up at a stop light. This is a master piece of punk rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Chuck Berry, Wesley is the new daddy of rocknroll","review":"I, too, have not heard this album, but I can assure you that one day soon I will. Wesley is truly the man among all musicians, not just rock n rollers. He tells it like it is, and though his sincerity may partially be the result of his schizophrenia at least he's making money off of it. No other musician has dared tackle the issues he does as bluntly as he does. Not even Rage Against the Machine. He is genius, however crude, and all musicians should follow his example in sculpting their careers. For all the hip-hop artists who are trying to keep it real, and for the punks who are trying to stay indie, this man, Wesley Willis, is the example of how to do it. ¡Viva Wesley! ¡Viva su Fiasco! . . . BTW, Jello Biafra loves Wesley Willis--even though the latter bumrushed the former as he was counting the ways. Why don't you then? Keep chillin and illin and rhymin and stealin, cats, I know I do. Yeah........."},{"rating":"1","title":"but seriously ...","review":"Yes - Wesley Willis has something to say. No - this is not music. For those of you ultra-bohemian (or perhaps simply misinformed) listeners who liken Wesley Willis to the next Sex Pistols, you are gravely mistaken. Punk rock, and indeed all good music, has been about inspiring an audience through lyrics and music. While Willis provides a certain jarring form of entertainment (which could explain the identification with punk), I refuse to believe that anyone could actually be inspired by a single one of his songs. Listening to his droning Casio inspires a sickness a la Clockwork Orange, while his lyrics do little but recount the nominal details of his admittedly odd existence. If, somehow, his music truly moves you, or his lyrics about mullets or birdman change your outlook on life, by all means buy this album - then quickly check yourself into to some sort of institution."},{"rating":"1","title":"holds up for a single listen","review":"I have a sense of humor, but Wesley Willis is an extremely overrated novelty act. His lack of skill and squealy vocals are pretty amusing the first time through, but the songs are identical, right down to the predictable choruses, which drastically cuts down on replay value.

My Spanish is very basic and I still knew more than what this book contained. There were a variety of phrases (of which only a handful looked useful) but they were grouped in categories that made it weird to find quickly. The size of the book makes it very convenient for travel, but I could not find a lot of common nouns and verbs I needed to order or ask questions so it just became extra weight to carry around.

Check the CD cover and you'll see... nothing.*Doom metal can be divided into this main categories (just for organization):- Proto doom: Black Sabbath- Traditional doom: Candlemass- Death doom: dISEMOBWELMENT- Funeral doom: Shape of despair- Melodic doom: The 3rd and the Mortal- Symphonic doom: Lacrimas profundere- Stoner doom: High on fire"},{"rating":"2","title":"It should be on DVD or Bluray","review":"This is one of the best TV dramas I have seen, and it is a completely accurate account of the negotiations that led to the founding of the Irish Free State.

It is so mind-bogglingly stupid when you look at the actual facts.Here are the facts -- hundreds of millions of people have been killed by the true weapon of mass destruction -- the AK 47. Terrorists all over the world use high explosives -- because they work.A nation spun up because of straw men and false threats, which is really what bio and chem weapons are, is easy to control.

In terms of their abilityi to find fish, it cannot distinguish between a school of small feeder fish, and when I say small, I mean tiny and a 10lb bass.

(I'm still working on rap & most hip-hop, but I don't think that stuff is written for a small-town, 40-something white guy like me anyway.) I just never had much interest in listening to bluegrass, but when a friend loaned me a copy of Scott's CD, my musical curiosity got the best of me.

But I knew I'd not live long if I did that, so I came back down to earth and just listen to it as much as I can while still working at my job and dealing with the ball & chain and rugrats.

I did read a section of it that appeared in Best American Non-Required reading. It was painful to read. Her writing style is exactly what you would expect from a high-schooler, so full of embarrassingly sharp pain and melodrama. The best writing is not emotional trash that you spew out as soon as it crosses your mind. If she really needed to write a book about her teenage angst she should have a least waited for her thoughts to mature into something worthy of national attention.

On my way home I could not wait to listen this new cd, to my surprise it was not Sylvio, it was a group called (Synthesis) that if you look carefully at the cd, you will see in small letters this name. Sylvio is a special guest and his intervention in this cd is very minimal. This is a lack of respect to all Sylvio's fans, and to Sylvio. Do not buy this cd unless you listen to it first, because is not even close to Sylvio's style. I was lucky enough that the store in which I bought the cd returned my money.

The first two representatives I spoke with (last year), admitted that the dvds were part of a batch that had problems with this cracking. However, the person today said that was not the case, and they need to physically inspect the dvds before they can replace them. Who knows how long that will take.

This unit is relatively easy to use and very easy to program. The ONLY drawback, when compared to my SONY remote, is that the SONY is capable of learning some commands that the Universal cannot. I am hopeful that this will be corrected in the future. Fortunately, when I come across a command it won't learn, I simply use the SONY to learn the command first and then learn the command from the SONY.

The fact that it was written by journalists, in lieu of traditional historians, provides much of this readability for anyone who is interested in learning about the war as a hobby. All points of view - British, German, and Italian - are well represented.The product description as well as that on the back of the book itself make it sound as if the book is entirely about the battles at El Alamein; while they are the main focus, the many months preceding them are covered in fine style, as well as the aftermath.I, for one, highly reccommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book on the British Side in North Africa","review":"Ive always been interested in the Africa War of World War II and this was a great book on ihe German Side and the British side of the war, from Rommels and Monty's HQs all the way down to the squad level where the the action is.

After reading both their books (checked out from the library), I can only conclude that they have learned very little about the book world and they remain book-collector-wannabes.The entire book is nothing more than an over-inflated magazine article possibly suitable for publication in Reader's Digest or maybe GRIT magazine. It would have been much better if they had actually written more about booklore and books and less about wardrobe and how much money they have or how they might scam a free meal.

The book is divided into THREE MAIN SECTIONS: (1.) SUBMARINE SEARCH & RESCUE (2.) NAVAL SPECIAL WARFARE (3.) DIVING AND SALVAGE.Each section then proceeds to lists the findings in detail. This book is in essence a TECHNICAL manual, however it is so well presented and the sub-sections are so logically laid out that I actually found it a rather pleasant read!

My first complaint is that there is only one switch that turns on all three lights at the same time. Turning the knob a second time makes them brighter. So you are using all three lights when only one or 2 are necessary. In addition it uses 60 watt incandescent bulbs - we are a compact flourescent household.

I hope this author makes an expanded 6Sigma book with more technical stuff, clear color charts , better paper quality, and to follow a project though from begining to end.

The reason I liked the book is because it showcases how the leadership at the Islamic Center of Long Island leverages its grassroots power, citing examples from Muslims positively influencing the Central Westbury Civic Association to defeating New York Senatorial Republican candidate Rick Lazio and helping elect, now Senator Hillary Clinton.Unfortunately, very few Muslims understand the significance of a mosque in Islam.

The only interesting tidbit about the skating world, if this was the goal, is the news that a past competition was fixed so Boitano's team could win.Was it supposed to be abook about Brian Boitano?

It then goes off on tangents, tells us nothing about the Muslim sense of humor, nor what makes them (or us) laugh. The standup show scene in the New Delhi hall was beyond awful and magnifies Brooks' lack of comedic talent. I remember thinking that these people arent laughing not because they're Muslim, or Hindu, but because the comic is atrocious.Other plot structures go nowhere, the assistant's jealous boyfriend for instance.

I sincerely hope Albert Brooks had a good time, because nobody else did.I will be very generous here, and hope he had a point, and that it was that of the oblivious American traveller. He goes to India, which isn't Muslim, and manages to find an alternate reality version of the place so sanitized and Americanized that he could've easily filmed the entire movie on the studio back lot in Hollywood. But if that's the joke, it misfired horribly. If that's not the joke, then my opinion of Albert Brooks must go way down.I really don't want to jump on a \\"I've lived in Asia since 1999\\" high horse. I just want to say the movie sucks and don't waste your time, so I can go type more words about a more worthy film. And really, all films are more worthy.

But this movie just didn't go anywhere.There were a few parts of this movie where I thought, \\"oh, hey, that's okay.\\" But Brooks, who I'm not ultimately that familiar with, comes across as a weird, edgy, paranoid guy, who really isn't that funny, performs a pathetically weak comedy act for a bunch of Indians, and is constantly arguing or worrying about random things.I feel like there's something I didn't get when I watched this movie.

Four string players in four helicopters, imagine what that must sound like! However, this disc is best left to the imagination.... the result is not half as furious, or remotely as interesting, as it could have, or should have, been. Between the repertoire of Stockhausen and the reputation of the Arditti String Quartet, I expected more than a pale tremolo for 30 minutes alongside a faint sputtering of rotors.

That's not to say they can fairly compete with any high end system, but if you're not ready to lay out $1000, these speakers are entirely adequate and will get the job done for much less. One caveat: They're rated at 6 ohms impedance and are best complemented by a decent active subwoofer. 6 ohms doesn't seem like a big deal until you put power to them. Expect to drive them harder than speakers with 4 ohms impedance or less, but after that it's all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Speakers that do their job","review":"I did a lot of looking at reviews and spec's on a lot of speakers to replace my Altec Lansing floor speakers which have incredible sound, but all that blast power isn't needed anymore and I wanted something to go more with the HDTV rather than the CD's.

Along with my subwoofer (should have with these) and small rear spkrs, why I am all set. Oh yeah, they look good w/the TV also.

Few if any had any obvious relation to real world engineering problems.

The characters don't appeal to me at all, and the premise - that the heroine is so embarrassed by her eccentric family that she doesn't want to know the hero - is just ridiculous. Scenes which are clearly designed for humour leave me cold, and I find I don't much care whether the hero and heroine get together.Give me a Balogh, an Oliver, a Kelly or a Jensen any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A response...","review":"To Wolfgirl: I wasn't looking for earth-shattering passion, just a good book.

But, judging by this book, Barbara Sherrod is not one of them. I read a lot of Regencies, as you might see if you check my review page. This is one of the *very* few books I couldn't even bring myself to finish. And when I've paid good money for a book, that isn't something I do as a rule.Sure, we're all entitled to our opinions.

A different model without a true sine-wave reproduction wouldn't work, but this one holds the load fine, both on startup and to run the furnance for a good 30+ minutes. I'd previously blown multiple components on our furnace due to bad power or surges, and this also allows me the comfort of at least being able to run the system for a short period during an extended blackout; enough to limit the chance of it freezing since it's really our backup heat source anyway.This unit may not have the LCD/bells-and-whistles that some others do, but the actual power features make it capable of doing what several APC units couldn't for less cost than one of the APC Smart-UPS units with comparable features would have been.I'd give it five-stars, but I usually save that for something that exceeds my expectations.

The fuse blew after 25 months (out of warranty) at 33 months at 36 months and now again after only 1 day. There is something seriously wrong in the power supply board of this TV. Samsung needs to redesign it and offer it to all of us who have been burned by this unit. As it is, I have a large stock of fuses and I have an access panel cut into the TV so I can replace this fuse again and again and again and again.I will never buy a Samsung TV again in my life and will encourage others to do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice TV/Lousy Samsung Customer Service","review":"I've had this TV for almost a year and it's darned nice! As it should be, for the price. However, the optical connector went out on it. It was covered under warranty. The service guy had to change out the entire motherboard to replace the optical connector. I examined the old motherboard, and the optical connector had broken off--it appears to be a very weak unit; can't handle any stress. Samsung's customer service is the worst, however. Wait times are long, and then when you finally get connected to a real person, they go by the script and cannot think for themselves. First thing to do when you call is ask to speak with a supervisor and that will bump you past the robots. However, don't expect a lot more from the second line. They get to be a bit more rude than the first line, but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TV","review":"I love this Television.

Audio is good - many adjustments available to customize. There is one issue that is unacceptable. Picture quality when using the side SVideo input is awful. There are noise patterns in the picture. Samsung must be aware of the problem. The online manual mentions to use the supplied ferrite beads to clamp on the SVideo input cable. The manual supplied with the display mentions the beads but does not mention installing on the SVideo side input cable. Artifacts of this type in the picture come from cables or wiring picking up noise internal to the unit. This is due to improper routing or shielding of the wires or cabeling internal to the unit. This artifact is unacceptable in a unit of this type. The noise is not there when using the side composite input.

This thing can be stacked, because there is no fancy shapes and inputs all over surfaces like in many other similar but funky products. Performs well with majority of USB devices except those that can work exclusively with computer hub directly.

Now, no more picking and choosing what gets power and what does not. No more constant switching.The Pockethub comes with an ac power adapter which is huge beside the little hub itself. The literature says that the \\"...AC power adapter must be used for maximum performance\\" . I'm using 3 of the hub's ports with no ac attached and it's working flawlessly. I may need the ac boost as the ports fill up, but for now, the little hub is doing just fine on its own.The Pockethub itself is well made, attractive ( in an unobtrusive way ) and small, taking up minimal desktop space.

Would not suggest this product. Not worth the price. If you open it up and look at it it is a circuit board that is supposed to be held by brackets on the metal casing. The board itself is not big enough to fit into the brackets so the card fell into the casing and shorted out the components.

I replaced it with a 7-port Newer Technology hub from OWC. The new hub is smaller and has a more robust power supply. I'm done with Kensington.

I took it according to recommendations - I actually took it with absolutely no water or food (it certainly isn't the worst tasting thing I've ever had in my mouth). I finished the bottle and saw no difference in my supply during or after finishing it. I work 3 days a week and pump twice a day on those days.

No difference whatsoever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Very Well","review":"I bought this about 6 months ago when I first had my son. I was worried about not making enough milk and i only used one fourth of the recommended dose after a few days because it worked too well. I used it until he was 4 months old when the bottle ran out I did feel like I needed more but found out quickly my milk supply was set and didn't need it anymore unless I wanted to pump. If you pump this is Great otherwise your body is doing fine on its own if you child is gaining weight. Best of luck, Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked good for me","review":"It really worked for me along with other fenugreek seeds....I bumped up my supply with this along with lots of pumping!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Nasty Tasting...But Effective!","review":"Believe the hype...More Milk Special Blend does taste pretty awful, like a bad batch of Jagermeister. However, it works, and for me, within hours! My son would normally take two breasts at feeding time. Now he can get away with one.I am taking one star off because I ordered this item during the trial period which guaranteed 2-day delivery and I didn't receive this product until 6 days later.

I did get my package the next day, but the item was in a bag and there was liquid from the bottle all in it. It also had the word \\"Damaged\\" written on the bag. The top was broken on the bottle and someone just put tape on the top to try and keep it closed. This is my first time with this company. I contacted them via email the same day and never even got a response back. I had to wait until Monday to call them since my order arrived on Saturday and they are closed on the weekends. I had a very negative experience with this company. I couldn't even use my new product! I called the company and they told me I had to call Amazon which I did. Amazon couldn't even give me a new one free of charge. They just gave me a refund. I needed this product ASAP and now I have to wait longer due to someone else's mistake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ive got milk!","review":"Got Milk?After adding this to your milk maid tea, regular tea, or just some hot water, you will be producing again! My milk was nearly gone, and I usually use this in combination every other day with Milkmaid tea. You will be able to determine after a few tries how often and how much to take.

I got much better reception with my old 900 MHz. Also, it would be nice if the channels automatically changed when needed, since the reception was so bad (you had to change often). The caller ID was also weird in that if you picked up the phone and missed the call, that number wouldn't be in the caller ID. Overall, we were surprisingly very unhappy with the phone, and just returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor reliability for a Motorola product","review":"I purchased this model about 1.5 years ago and expected it to perform for 5-10 years. It stopped working after a year and a half with the buttons not responding at all. I bought a new battery in hopes that would fix the problem, but the phone still does not work. I even tried the page button on the base stand and the pager works, but had to unplug the battery to stop the phone from beeping. I expected better reliability from a Motorola product. I have been using a Sony remote phone for the past six years (we have two phones) and it is still working well. I guess you just have to buy a product nowdays and take your chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four months of static and then nothing...","review":"I got about four months of life out of this phone. There was consistently static and then the phone started to die mid conversation. I bought a new battery, which didn't fix the problem. Now I get about 10 seconds tops before the phone cuts out (but doesn't die, so I know it's not the battery)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"I liked this phone for the first few days. I actually convinced a friend to buy the same phone.What I discovered on BOTH my phone and my friend's phone is that voices get clipped, ie, cut off prematurely and you have a \\"cell phone going out of range like quality\\" to the conversation even though you are only a few feet from the base unit. I suspect this is a design issue, where to save battery power, the phone cuts off transmission when it thinks no voice is present even though you are still speaking. I use cordless phones all the time for routine conversations and this one is just annoying. That's a shame because its a nice size, battery life is great, and so is the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love static, buy this phone.","review":"I have had this phone for a year and a half. It is in a room where it is rarely used. The static is terrible and changing channels doesn't help. I have used it in more than one home with no change in quality. Now I am beginning to have other problems--works in one location and not another. Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this phone","review":"I have the phone/answering machine model. More than half of the time the caller ID doesn't save the missed calls (so you can at least see who called you while you were out), but my biggest complaint is that you have to listen to all of the saved messages again to get to the new messages. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorola phone dies an early death....","review":"We've had our phone for about six months. We just wanted a phone with no bells and whistles and were very happy with this one until it just stopped working one day. Keys froze up and nothing we tried, including replacing the battery, fixed it. Our experience sounds comparable to some of the other reviews here. It's inexpensive enough that I don't want to mess with the warranty and judging by others comments, it's doubtful we'd get any satisfaction. We just purchased an ATT model to replace it. I won't be buying any other Motorola phones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice styling, poor sound quality","review":"There is a lot I like about this phone, however none of what I like outweighs the fact that the sound quality is so bad I had to take it back within the first week of buying it. The appearance, weight, features and price were all excellent. BUT when I spoke to someone on the phone, my voice (and surrounding noise) came through my earpiece like a loudspeaker! It's as if the mouthpiece is a microphone playing through the earpiece amplifier. Very annoying and impossible to have a conversation with anyone unless they are a real yapper and don't let you say a word anyway! I don't recommend buying this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The display on our phone quit after only one year. After two years we had so much static on the phone we could no longer hear the other person. Changing the channel no longer worked. The last cordless phone I bought lasted me fifteen years. This on died after only two. Even when the phone did work the volume was way too low even though you can control the volume it did a poor job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work out of the box!","review":"My parents had this phone so i registered for it as a wedding present. It didn't work out of the box and as with most wedding presents, i didn't have a receipt and they wouldn't take it back. We tried to go through Motorola to fix it, but that was a nightmare. Just be careful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like ringing in your ears, buy this phone!!","review":"This one of the worst phones I ever brought!!!!The phone is less than 2 months old and it gives echoes, feedback, ringing and you cannot talk while the microwave is in use.I gave it 1 star because I could not give it anything less.It does offer some good features, like the format button. Which is a time saver. But overall, DO NOT BUY!!!!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone !, Great Price !","review":"I love this phone. I dont know what phone other people have who are writing reviews have,but this phone is great. Long battery life, and has great sound.

I could not be happier. people should buy this phone!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"keep looking","review":"This purchase was one of my all time biggest mistakes as far as home electronics go! Don't buy it, the sound quality is terrible. I paid $49 a few months back and you could not give me one for free now. I have my friends call my cell phone just so I can actually hear them. The positive reviews must be from Motorola stockholders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like style of phone, but quality stinks","review":"This phone has awful problems with static. I can't figure it out because from time to time I will get static wherever I am in my house and even changing the channel does not help. Another VERY AGGRAVATING problem is that I CAN NOT have my microwave running without horrific static blasting in my ear -- this is absurd. However, I give it a rating of 2 because I really like the caller id, the glowing buttons feature, and the soft buttons.The rings are also a little strange -- only one rings loud enough and the other is too off the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confused by mixed reviews","review":"First this is not Motorola's first cordless phone. I had one 10 years ago, it looked like a cell phone and the reception was bad. I have the exact same 2.4 GHz phone by motorola but in black and it works great! I'm going to buy 2 more today. Hope the quality isn't different because of the new look."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money...","review":"I purchased this phone in December as a present to myself, and I was dismally disappointed with it. Thinking that the 2.4GHz would have a great reception, I was surprised to find that this phone is little more than a static-noise device. So much so, that I use it for nothing more than a decoration on my desk. Changing the channel does absolutely no good, not even a slight difference can be noticed in reception after doing this. It has some other minor flaws as well, but it's useless to point them out, as what good is this crappy phone if you can't even hear on it?! Best thing about this phone is the appearance of it, nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"Well I read all the review before I brought this phone...Something told me to buy it!

I am on the phone all the time and it still works great!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"I have owned many cordless phones. When I purchased this phone, I figured Motorola was a safe brand to choose. Who knows phones like Motorola right? WRONG! Broke within a week of normal use. BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but that's it","review":"I bought this phone for my apartment and really had no trouble with it for a few months. Then I moved into a house and suddenly there is so much static in the phone I can't stand it. You cannot hear anybody with the static and it continues to beep like you are pressing the buttons while you are talking even when it is fully charged. I am so disappointed in this phone. I am off this weekend to get a different phone that works. I don't recommend waisting your money on this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not buy this phone","review":"I just bought this phone 4 days ago. Reception is very bad, and have a 'click' sound (same as other people have said). The earpiece reflects what you say on the speaker. Horrible sensation, like talking in a box.The phone is very cool and looks great in my nightable, but is only good as a decorative piece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real happy with this phone","review":"I've had this phone for about 6 months. It started out great, but the longer I've had it, the worse the sound got. It started making a clicking/staticky noise that doesn't go away even when you switch channels. The v-mail message indicator light doesn't work, and when you try to check the caller ID, you have to push the button 10 or 15 times before it finally decides to show you the names and numbers. On the plus side, it's comfortable to use, you can turn the ringer off, and the keypad lights up making it easy to use in the dark. It's a fairly inexpensive phone, so I would have to say I've gotten my money out of it, but I would not purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the Box.","review":"I loved this phone at first. It's nicely human-factored, and the sound quality was very good.However, it's now about 6 weeks old and the \\"3\\" button no longer works. I use the phone only for work, so it's been gently used and no one has been dropping it in the sink. This is not impressive longevity. Fortunately, the store where I bought it has a 90-day return policy. I don't think the replacement will be a Motorola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill, fast!","review":"This phone was good for the first few month, but has gone downhill ever since. The speaker is not very loud and the ringer is very hard to hear even in a quiet room. I bought one of these for myself and one for my mother, and both phones now have a lot of static when making calls even standing next to the base station. Range is good, if you can deal with the static (changing channels doesn't help). The base station is supposed to indicate when there is a message waiting with our phone provider, but it often gives false positives and misses other calls. We bought a panasonic now and everything is much better, even the message waiting indicator."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better phones Ive bought in recent years.","review":"One of the better phones Ive bought in recent years. The quality is not bad. Havent had it long enough to tell you if it stands up to wear and tear. But it has dropped a few times and still works. deleting the old calls on caller ID is laborious process. It is slow 2 step process. and instead of showing the next call, it shows the last call so its really a 3 step process. that is the worse part. volume control is very handy. Its a tad heavy, especially when you are walkign about the house and yard. The \\"brick\\" on the power cord is nice and small so you don't waste 2 or 3 spaces like some of the others. It aint cheap but its aint bad either."},{"rating":"1","title":"STATIC","review":"I just bought this phone 3 days ago and I have had a problem witht he static coming from the handset while the phone is one the base.

It will be returned today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermittant static when on base!","review":"I liked this phone until I got it home. When the handset is sitting on the base, the handset will intermittantly emit static every few seconds - CONSTANTLY. But only when its sitting on the base. I even took it to work and tried plugging it in at my desk and it did the same thing (I live in an older house and thought it might be the 50+ year old electrical - nope!) I've had it for 5 days and its going back tonight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorola Cordless Phone","review":"We bought this phone after a long search for a new phone. We have a Sony which worked wonderful and we have had it for over 5 years. We needed another phone in the house so we purchased this one. It worked in the room where the base was and that was pretty much it. The minute you went out into another room, the phone would get a lot of static. It was pretty annoying and we tried switching channels to move to a better channel and nothing seemed to work. We weren't happy with the product at all which is surprising considering it's a motorola. Be careful when you consider buying this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused Terrible Brake Juddering after Use on Race Track","review":"I have Performance Friction # 0731.20 and 0732.20 pads in my 2002 Corvette and I would NOT recommend them.

This CD surveys his career from '80-'95, and the live band playing here in Bolgona really rocks. Tuscan and Arabic sounds meld with disco-id and pop strains and support Mango's rich vocals. Sweet but never sentimental, Mango is instantly hummable. The version here of 1987's \\"Bella d'Estate\\" is a sizzling arabic/funk/trance classic that's been fed through an early 60s Italian jukebox.

It is a hilarious madcap adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of laughs!","review":"What more can be said about this movie that already hasn't been said. When it has Mathau and Lemmon, it's probably going to be funny and written to fit their styles. And boy does it ever.The laughs start and never stop until the movies is over.

This movie is seriously cheated due to its poor quality DVD. The worst problem is with images tracing behind when things move quickly on the screen (viewed on LCD or tube). Also annoying are certain times where frames are dropped and the picture skips. As if these things aren't bad enough, there is no widescreen version available.As for the movie it's one of the greats.

Reason: I absolutely REFUSE to purchase a full-frame DVD, on top of that in a flimpsy cheap case that makes the edition reek of sub-standard. When are the studios going to wake up to the fact that there is a growing number of movie buffs who want the WHOLE movie and not what some pan-and-scan technician decides we are allowed to see?Until they decide to release this great little movie the way it's supposed to be seen, in W-I-D-E-Screen with a good sound track, forget it.

Its tough to judge because I don't know the source material but I think this is as good as they could do and frankly given the age of the actors , too sharp much of the time! I should say that its mostly available light looking and mostly drab and overcast so I think its pretty good as blu-rays go. I paid a bit over $10 and I'm delighted...sure I'd have been happy for some PR interviews the actors did as bonus items but for a crisp and finally Widescreen version of this movie I'm happy.

The film really does a great job of showing two old friends being crazy during retirement.The problem is the DVD= it's a barebones edition with a horrible full-framing problem. There are shots where they barely have anyone in them at all. In the original frame they are both in frame so it looks like the cropper was drunk and just got parts of them. They've cut off so much of the film that I felt like I was listening more than watching. It's a HORRIBLE DVD. If you are on the fence about this then I'd recommend the Odd Couple DVD instead. If you get this full-framed version then know that it's a great film that's not very well served with this DVD.

After seeing it you can almost imagine it as a preview of things to come as people age. It was very enjoyable. Seeing two grown men fight and carry on over a woman. There are a lot of reasons to enjoy this film. One of which for me was seeing Burgess Meredith in it. I watched all the Rocky films so and most of them included him in the cast so seeing him cast in this film as well was very delightful. I also enjoyed the work that Ossie Davis did in this work.

In this popular comedy they do so to the nth degree as John & Max, two bachelors fighting over the same woman. That woman is the eccentric and interesting Ariel (Ann-Margret) who just moved into their Minnesota neighborhood snowmobile in toe. She almost immediately takes a liking to John (Lemon) who is smitten with her, but as his age long feud with Max (Matthau) heats up he is almost driven away from the idea of romance, leaving Max to swoop in and try his turn with Ariel.

The gloves were not really a small, which I have had before, but more like a medium.They were poorly stiched at the right knuckle area and gave me a re-occuring blister/raw spot at that place.They also smelled so strongly of mothballs that I had to leave them outside in the garage for several days before I could even wear them. I ended up going to a store to try on and buy a pair of new gloves to use. I will not ever buy this product online again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can help it - DO NOT GET THESE","review":"Awful, I am very displeased with these gloves. First of all they are not completely leather. They are cheap though, that's why I guess they don't have to be. They do not offer enough padding to protect your hands, they are to tight to put any wraps on and then you have bleeding blisters. I do not work on the bag often but I'm pretty aggressive and these are NOT the right gloves for that. Cheap - yes hence 2 stars instead of 1, once again if you can help it get something better, that's built to last because of the good quality and not because they sit in the bag because you can't use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for heavy bag","review":"In terms of quality of design and construction I will give the gloves 2.5 stars - they are leather, which is a plus, but they are rather flimsy in construction (the leather is very thin) and they are sewn to a very minimal standard. The diamaeter of the fingers is too large which causes the gloves to move around and chafe. No, I did not buy them too large.These gloves are probably ok if you are going to hit a speed bag but that is about it. If you use them to hit a heavy bag you will have bloody hands in about forty minutes. My first and second knuckles on both hands were bloody on my first workout. After my hands healed I wrapped them well and tried again but the gloves simply do not provide enough protection to hit a heavy bag for any extended period. These gloves should not be sold as \\"bag gloves\\". You have been told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"I bought a new pair to replace gloves of the same type I have use for years (they were stolen). While I loved the old ones, Century seems to have changed the lining to a rougher material almost like canvas. Now I have no skin on my knuckles.

Its a horrible smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gloves","review":"These gloves are great because they really protect the fingers and are easy & fast to put on & take off; quick to break in as well. This is my second pair of Century gloves of this type and I absolutely love them and give a high recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gloves for the money!","review":"These gloves are light years better than the MMA Everlast gloves. Real leather, finger padding that extends down far enough to protect the second knuckle. Even with chewed up knuckles from my Everlast experience, these protected them so much that I didn't even break anything open!Note: There was a slight chemical smell to mine (leather or the dye used), but that seemed to go away with a workout, some Febreeze and Odor Eater powder.Durability seems good, although I just had one use.I would probably still recommend using wraps with the gloves, just to get extra support and protection. The gloves were a little tight with my hands in wraps. I would err on 1 size up if you use wraps. A medium was barely big enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed.","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie, closed captioning very distracting.

If this were a book about JOHN Kerry's military career, it might be timely and relevant. But, Robert Kerrey? This is old news.Under the guise of \\"pursuing the truth\\"--\\"honestly\\"--the author tries very hard to sell the reader on the notion that Robert Kerrey is war criminal. The big problem with the author's presentation: there is absolutely no evidence, whatsoever, that Kerrey intentionally, with premediation, set out to kill innocent civilians in Vietnam.Vistica relies heavily on innuendo and conjecture--and very few facts--to build a flimsy case for the idea that Robert Kerrey was an evil soldier. Unfortunately, innocent civilians do get killed in war. I suppose that a book could be written to indict every single American soldier who ever served his county in combat.Thankfully there are those who serve their country bravely in combat. And, then there are those who...write books about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey into the depths of despair","review":"The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath is an excellent novel, portraying the down ward spiral that almost anyone could take. In The Bell Jar, Plath allows the reader to see first hand what it is like, to be truelly depressed. Unsure of your future, and not sure if you want to continue your life. Using Esther Greenwood, Plath tells her own story of suicide attempts, and thus is able to add real insite. The story brings you on Esther's downward spiral into the depths of despair and allows you to follow her on her path to recovery.

She goes to church and takes us with her in \\"I Can't Wait to Meet You.\\" The song will have you shouting \\"amen\\" and thanking the creator for making those platinum pipes. Sure hits are the upbeat and twangy \\"Going Nowhere\\" and \\"He Rocks.\\" The rest of the album is too daring for country radio because it incorporates blues and funk, but it sure sounds great. Wynonna continues to go down her own musical road keeping us fans wondering where she will take us next. The Judds songs are fun and each has its message. The poignantly sweet \\"That's What Makes You Strong\\" is a gem. Wynonna's musical genius makes this album like a late Christmas present and I paid her for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"I loved Wynonna's first solo album, so based on that trust I was looking forward to the release of this one. She's got a good strong voice. Pity she doesn't know what to really do with it. I didn't care for either of her two cover songs. Also with the other cd with the \\"Judds\\" songs on it, I was expecting the Judds' style that I've known and loved.

This thing will work over 300 feet away! The Unidens start breaking up at about 30 feet.Other Pros: Good sound, single Talk button, 900MHz won't interfere with wireless networks, stands on its end, wall-mountable, very solid construction.The only minus is that it doesn't auto-answer when you pick it up from the charging station, something that would only be useful if it had Caller ID. But the large Talk button is easy to hit and the phone hangs up facing the wall so you don't have to flip it around like many of the other brands, most of which are no longer even wall-mountable.The ringer can be turned off but is not adjustable. The default tone and loudness are fine, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable, but perhaps so due to 802.11b wireless and apptmnt","review":"The phone was unusable due to high static, yet it might be because of the number of wireless data networks around my appartment. And yes i did charge the battery for 24 hrs before use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice pump","review":"This pump really works for me. I work part-time, and have to pump on other occasions too, and it works well. I can usually do both sides in about 20 minutes all together. It really helps the milk let down, and gets it at a fast pace. At first, it may seem a little too strong for suction, but you get used to it. It feels a lot better than the Single Deluxe electric pump. The breast shield is also very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"I purchased this Medela manual pump after being dissatisfied with the First Years electric pump. It worked great for a while but after only a couple of months it has begun to lose suction. I used to be able to express at least 5 ounces with ease (in about 15 - 20 minutes) and now I am pumping for 30 -45 minutes and barely getting 2 ounces from each side. There seems to be a leak in the suction and I can hear air escaping each time I pump. Now I am shopping around trying to find another pump to use, without a large cost since I have already purchased 2 types and not had any luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, efficient.","review":"I just used this for the first time and was very happy with the results. My baby is a week old and I've been using the Pump in Style to relieve engorgement. Although I can only do one breast at a time with this one, I got just as much milk out (3 oz) in about the same time. It took me about 10-15 minutes (I wasn't watching the clock). It was a little bit painful but no different than the PIS. I liked the let down mode and it was helpful in getting the milk out fast. It was comfortable to hold and I like the design of the pump. I am not giving it 5 stars because I've only used it once."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!! Pain with no gain.","review":"I haven't tried every manual breastpump for comparison, but I can tell you that the Medela Harmony I bought hurts like the dickens, and it isn't very successful in getting milk out of me - hand expressing worked equally well if not better. To avoid sinking more money into a device of torture I'll never use, I've rented a Medela Lactina from a local clinic in order to try an electric pump before making the investment in purchasing one. I'm WAY happier with it and would recommend it over a hand-pump any day. It is overkill for my pumping needs, but the comfort and effectiveness is worth the extra $$$ to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should've read the reviews","review":"I bought this pump based on the Medela name, however, this pump is worthless! I end up hand expressing into the cup which is more effective than this pump. When I finally do get a couple of ounces, it leaks from the seal by the bottle. I ended up purchasing the Isis and am very happy with it! I should've just spent the money on the Pump In Style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"former medela user","review":"I first used the medela breast pump a fews years ago with my son. I was in the military and pumping milk was the only thing I could do. I am now expecting my third child and am reluctant to get a breast pump of any kind, because of the pain the medela caused. Though pumping was my only choice since I wanted desperately to breast feed, I am afraid of the unneccessary pain I'll have to endure from pumping. It's been years now since I pumped, so I'm hoping technology has changed a bit to help the mother with some relief. I've heard about the Isis, but my experiences with the medela really were painful. I also didn't express much more milk with the medela than I would when I pumped by hand into a cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you decide on a hand pump this one is good","review":"I decided before having my son - first child - that since I was going to be an at home mom and occasionally pump before leaving the house I would go with a hand pump. After my son was born I used an electric pump at the hospital and rented it for a week at home. That one week turned into 3 or 4. I have used my Harmony hand pump and it works, is easy to clean and is definately comfortable but I was spoiled with the electric double pump. Now the manual pumping seems so tedious & my hands cramp. I have a few times had a problem with the pump popping out of place and not creating the suction but it's been easy to fix for the most part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this pump! I was planning on getting an electric pump when I went back to work after having my baby but someone gave me this at my baby shower so I decided to try it out. It is wonderful! The first few times I used it were hard for me because I wasn't producing enough milk yet (it was about a week after I had my baby) but I got the hang of it shortly after. I can get about 4-5oz in less than 20 minutes. It's great because I can just pump while watching TV :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!!!","review":"This pump was cheap and I know why. It was way to hard to use and when you finally figured it out it took way to long and was way to hard to get anything. I would not recommend it to anyone. Finally went out and bought an electric one. Do not waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia and Mothers","review":"Obviously if you are reading this you are interested in a CD saluting mothers. And for such an undertaking this is quite good. It is also quite a collection of some of the greatest talent of 80 or so years ago. To find Al Jolson, Arthur Tracy (the Street Singer), John McCormack, Sophie Tucker and Georgie Jessel on one CD is quite remarkable. And the jewel of this undertaking is Jessel singing his famous song My Mother's Eyes. For that alone this CD is worth the price! And in a note to Amazon, better fix your search mechanism. When you search for Mr. Jessel no recordings are displayed. Obviously this CD IS on the website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flat out, blasting Punk Rock'N'Roll","review":"Wild mix of the Dolls, the MC5, the Stooges, pre Rollins Black Flag and a whole lot of 60's garage rock hooks. These guys make it all seem so easy. The twin guitar sound is as big and thick as a wrestler's neck, and it's perfectly complemented by singer's WWF approved holler.Beyond the flooring impact of the sound, it's the songs that make this platter so hard to remove from your deck. Numbers like 'I'm not your nothing' have all the simple, stripped down, brilliance of the early Ramones. Pefect for greying punks like yours truly - as for the young 'uns, their future is safe in these tattooed knuckles: this is the real deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I was overjoyed to find this series of books on history from the perspective of how lives were lived, only to be utterly disappointed.The essays were difficult to read and more difficult to understand. That I was reading translated text might very well have something to do with it, but it surely cannot account for all the bad features. Sentences were unnecessarily long and windy. The tone was often condescending, disdainful and occasionally sarcastic. At times the author made a claim and then offered to illustrate it with material that was disorganized and irrelevant.I read the first essay on the Roman Empire and my enthusiasm about the book was completely extinguished by the time I reached the chapter's end . I had hoped that the second essay, by a different author, would be an improvement. Well, it was not. And that was enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I'd read this as a kid I'd be working in a zoo now","review":"I must admit I've never heard of the author. This popped up as a recommendation so I thought \\"What the heck\\" and got it. This is a quick read, and easy read, an educational read, and an entertaining read. I'd even be interested in meeting some reptiles, thanks to this book. Anyone who has even a remote interest in animals should be reading this; scientists who say animals have no personalities should be reading this. I think any human who takes the time to allow this information into their brains will realize we may be the loudest creatures on earth, but we're not the only interesting ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful and Practical Look at Death","review":"I bought this book shortly before my mother passed. I had not known that she was soon to die, but I had heard Nancy Poer speak on the subject of deathcare and it fascinated me to consider such a rational and loving approach to death. What I didn't expect was how her description of crossing over and the care those of us on this side of the threshold can give to the dying and dead would help me when I was faced with my own mother's dying process. This book was my sanity-saver during one of the most painful times in my life. I will continue to turn to it throughout my life.We will all die. We will all have loved ones pass on before us.

I have nothing more to say about this item so I am just typing to finish the amount of required words for review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for Kids","review":"This book in many ways reminded me of Lynne Withey's biography of Abigail Adams. The writing was forthright and easy to understand. However, sometimes the subject matter seemed more appropriate to an older audience and I often wondered why the book was aimed at a youth audience. Certainly, as an adult reading this book, I took great enjoyment from and interest in it. The inclusion of Abigail's letters certainly indicate the complexity of the woman and of the times she lived in, and there were many times where I felt my heart break for this woman who so loved her family, but outlived 2 of her children. Bober's attention to detail added much interest -- how many trunks of tea were tossed overboard during the Boston Tea Party, why Boston's streets were paved with cobblestones, etc.Bottom line: This is not just a youth book. If you love American history, pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abigail Adams', life, presented as it was here, touched me","review":"It touched my inner soul and heart. The authors tender care and indicated admiration for Mrs. Adams truly shines through. The author presents her lovely and harsh at the same time life in a way that gives you a new way of thinking.

Most start by \\"designing\\" a big chunk of plastic (like this model) then affix an even bigger belt clip to it. As you can see from the photo, the clip is as thick as the Treo itself, which can hardly be considered slim by today's standards. So if you want to look like a total geek/nerd with a giant Treo extending 2-3 inches from your waist, this is definitely the clip for you. It's worse than nothing at all.

No. Is this story historically accurate? No.","review":"I was excited to read a western starring a Secret Service agent, not cowboys or Texas Rangers -- especially since it takes place in my city. But the author ignores Denver's history and geography altogether. The story is set in 1887. Denver was founded in 1858, suffered from several natural disasters in the 1860s, and got a railroad spur in 1870. Colorado became a state in 1876, just before a silver boom brought even more wealth to the new capitol. Yet Ed Gorman ignores all this. He only describes a boomtown with sprawling slums where the state capitol now stands!?! The hero, Dev, spends more time remembering his pre-war crimes than following clues to find the counterfeiter's printing press. Worse, every woman in this non-historic story wears jeans instead of dresses with wide bustles!

However, it is definitely not a book for beginners without prior understanding of the design patterns found in the GoF book.

Many of these patterns are definitely tried and tested. I have some of these patterns (Property Container, Policy, and Extensible Item, in particular) from past systems that I've built or studied.

More enemies, more weapons (which are can be customized for more and different powers),more characters and more missions. You can also choose to play the game in a less linear fashion than the previous one. While the levels load, tips are displayed to help with the game. Players can also hold two weapons at a time and no longer have to hold a quantity of arrows. There are also many more magical spells that the 5 characters can cast.

Not only was it exactly like the last one, but it was apparently very repetitive and exactly like the last game. I heard the first one was great, but supposedly the second one is kind of a bummer.

The ability to create new and powerful items and weapons, and use parts from the ones you find, or to buy parts.Play Magazine (Hey, I like to site my sources) has done a wonderful job covering it past issues, giving it a B+ on review (pretty high for them), and the reviews from other game magazines (Gamers, IGN, OPM) sound favorable too. Yeah, its going to be like the first one... its a sequel, set in the same place.

But, given the fact that this is the same Elvis Presley who shone in \\"Flaming Star\\", \\"Viva Las Vegas\\", and \\"King Creole\\", and who turned the world on its musical, and social, ear ten years earlier, maybe it was just pure boredom or embarrassment that infused his performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Elvis' worst movies","review":"I've seen all of Elvis' movies, most several times.

Now if you've seen the scenes that weren't included in the extended VHS, but were for some reason on the cable version, you'd see that they were among some of the funniest in the movie. I'd really like to see this one get maybe a double DVD release with When Nature Calls, souped up and some of those great missing scenes including Ace singing onstage with Cannibal Corpse (funniest scene in the whole movie I thought), Ace conversing with a few drunks in Ray Finkle's hometown and some others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as funny as Austin Powers, but worth watching!","review":"This movie is so funny. Jim Carry's perfomance was totally good. I give him 2 thumbs up for doing this movie. Carry will make you laugh if you watch this. Jim Carry plays Miami's top (and only) pet detective Ace Ventura on his biggest case yet. Although Carry's role in this movie appears to be an idiot, he always gets the job done no matter what it takes. The movie also stars FRIENDS' Courteney Cox who plays the detective who hires Ace. The case is mainly about the kidnapping of Miami Dolphin's dolphin, Snowflake. Ace has a little competition in solving this case with the LT of the police, Lois Einhorn, who finds Ventura worthless. Ace uses every piece of little evidence he finds. Whenevery he tries out his theory, he ends up in some zany mess which will make you laugh. I really liked the part when he was in the tank with a shark. Miami Dolphin's QB Dan Marino plays himself who also gets involved with kidnappings. Get this movie, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" R EEEEEHHEEEHEALLY?\\"","review":"This is a brilliant comedy and one of Carreys most famous.

The quirky facial expressions and the clownish behavior became his trademark.The film follows Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) as he tries to solve the mystery of the missing Miami Dolphins' mascot - snowflake the dolphin. Hilarity ensues. If you haven't seen the film, this DVD is worth buying.For anyone who has already seen this movie,the DVD is a bit of a disappointment. All of the extras are text. There are no outtakes, no deleted scenes, there's not even director's commentary.

Calling it a film is an insult, but as an entertaining piece of tosh it is well worth the entrance fee alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early signs of comic genius 4 Stars","review":"It's interesting to look back on this movie that is now 10 years old, but demonstrates Carrey's range and comic talent in almost seedling form. A simple and funny pastiche on the private detective genre finds Carrey as Ace Ventura, a pet detective (as the title suggests) who's big break appears to be coming in the case of the kidnapping of the Miami Dolphins mascot. A better than average script with some excellent gags ensues, with some nice cameos for Sean Young as the tyrannical police chief, and not least Dan Marino playing himself in slapstick fashion. But this is Carrey's vehicle from start to finish, his wacky and bawdy character almost explodes across the film, and ultimately steals the show. Often very silly, but consistently funny, this movie should now begin to attract a second generation of viewers, which it will accomplish well, being neither dated, or too topical for the year of production.

With his shameless mugging, physical comic prowess and weird voices, Carrey takes the wildest of the Lewis films and creates his own manic monsters.ACE VENTURA of course is the one that started it all and it is shamelessly funny and occasionally ribald humor. Carrey soars in the role and receives some able support from a rather stiff Sean Young (You find out why later in the film), Courteney Cox as Carrey's Dean Martin and even Dan Marino as the heroic foil. There are several immensely comic moments, and the whole movie packs a wallop. Carrey may not be for everyone's tastes but there's no denying he can carry a zany movie like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you NOT like this movie?","review":"Yes it is stupid, ridiculous, and way over the top, but...

I'll also admit that at first I had a hard time getting past how much \\"One Fine Day\\" musically reminded me of Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" but after a few listens, I was very much over it. I don't know what pressings Amazon.com sells, but some domestic copies come with 2 unlisted bonus tracks, the Positive Light remix of \\"Estonia\\" and the acoustic version of \\"80 days.\\" If you can find a TSE with those two extra tracks, they make the album even better, but either way, this comes highly recommended..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort from one of my favourite bands.","review":"I'm not sure why, but this album doesn't do anything for me.

And when I got it I was deeply disapointed. After Holidays in Eden, this is their worst album. I really liked their last two albums, Brave and AoS, but this one really sucked. The lyrics are corny [\\"how many of people (my fans) can a guy love\\" (or something like that,... please ... give me a break!!)] and there is no catching melody. The songs even sound boring when heard live. The only song that caught my ear was the pop-sounding 'accidental man' and that got boring really quickly.

I suppose if you got a matched set of speakers the system *might* sound better, but I already had two different makes, one for the front and one for the surround. After balancing the output I think it performs just fine - clear speaking voices, no distortion. I'm pretty picky about sound quality so that's a high recommendation for a center. It can use either bare wire or banana plug connectors, so I used banana plugs and I disconnect it and put it inside the cabinet out of sight when I'm not watching movies.

We now can hear the dialog more clearly, but the dynamic range could be better.All in all this unit is worth the price we paid and will be a welcome upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Choice for your Center Channel","review":"I've completed several DIY speaker and sub projects so I'm familiar with driver / speaker construction.The drivers on these appear to have a rubber surround - this is good b/c it's a very long-lasting material unlike foam. The drivers themselves appear to be of (very) high quality. I haven't examined the crossover network (the electronics within the speaker box) so I can't report on that.The cabinet is also of pleasing quality, nicely finished black wood grain, doesn't look cheap, and the compact size is a big plus because it is as unobtrusive as you could ask for and still get a quality sound.Speaking of sound - it's very nice. I use it for movies only and it was a welcome improvement over an old 80's center channel that lacked high frequencies and often made dialog difficult to follow.I made sure I owned this a while before I reviewed it, about a month and maybe 10 movies, got this unit on sale 5-08 but I'd buy it again at twice the price and possibly more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Slim and Crisp","review":"I bought the Yamaha NS-C225 Center speaker from J&R for $99 + free shipping.

I don't feel like \\"You Will Go to the Moon\\" makes of Americans; I think it's just a fun song! Basically, I love all the songs on this CD except for \\"Your New Boyfriend\\", which is a bit harsh.

The most widely heard tracks from this album are \\"Michigan Militia,\\" a biting look at Americans; and a glistening cover of the BeeGees \\"I've Gotta Get a Message to You.\\"In addition, this album showcases witty, topical but still Beatlesque pop tunes such as \\"The Incredible Medicine Show\\" and \\"Lazlo's Career\\" and rhythmically complex pieces like \\"Sahara\\" and \\"No No Raja.\\"The real development for the band in this album is that the rhythms, particularly in Murray Foster's bass lines, are as important as the four-part harmonies on which Moxy Fruvous made its admittedly unusual name. You Will Go to the Moon includes a nice, polished surface; as well as depth of composition, both lyrically and musically.Book your ticket today."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice book","review":"Nice Book, i buy this book for my son school home work, and he love to do home work on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced","review":"i was very disappointed to learn that after I ordered it I saw it at Target for 7.99.

The protagonist had to be the weakest woman I have ever read about. I kept reading about her strength and all I saw was a sorry, weak women. It does not take strength to do what she did but true selfishness. The character of Rapheal was not developed properly either. He came across as first angry, then confused, then accepting, then forgiving, she was all over the place with this character.

Alex Carrigan's usually controlled life is turned upside-down by the sudden appearance of a 12 year-old daughter(his?), an aging, dramatic grandfather and a beautiful, smart woman trying to find her soulmate. Alex's grandfather missed his one chance at love and now will Alex let it slip through his fingers as well? Alex's grandfather enlists the help of Faith Christopher, a local bakery owner, to find his true love who he hasn't seen in 50 years and put to rest a terrible family curse. Faith's former fiance's family has taken her under their wing and so she struggles with her feelings for both these families. This is a heart warming story whose only drawback is the flashback dreams that plague Faith but they are relevant to this story so we must endure them."},{"rating":"2","title":"author never lets me down","review":"I read the negative reviews on this book and it only shows the obvious that we all have different opinions of what makes good or bad reading.

Having said that, I did find this quite readable and enjoyable and thought it was good that Freethy took a few risks and stretched the romance genre by exploring family dynamics in an interesting way (ie, not just the Porters adn the Carrigans but also the two protagonist's upbringings). I found the supernatural elements a bit silly but might be more to other people's tastes. I also noticed that she made numerous references to people wearing knitted clothes.

The first bulb broke off at the base just screwing it in--even with a light touch. It still lit, but obviously would be unsafe. The second didn't break, but my other complaint is that the mirror finish is not perfectly level around the bulb. If you are placing in a fixture with an opaque shade (or no shade), that's probably fine. But if you have frosted or translucent shades, the non-level mirroring will leave a vey obvious and very tilted shadow line on your shades.Overall, this isn't up to the quality or durability standards of the major brands. On a positive note: the mirror coating (inside the bulb) did not have any thin spots or imperfections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this DVD at all costs","review":"You will regret immensily if you buy this DVD.It is old.It is short.It does not give in depth information.There are some good interviews, but very short - and when you believe it is going to continue the DVD is over.There are no extras at all.Important conductors, very important and wise conductors could not elaborate it properly.It is an OLD dvd.

The result of my research - for the price, quality and features, Olympus Evolt 510 beats everybody else with one arm tied behind its back. You have to go with high grade lens like this Olympus 14-54 to get the full effect. This lens is very sharp, bright and lack any distortion like no other. It cost more than standard lenses but as everything else in life, you get what you paid for. Strongly recommend to anyone with average or above skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent 'Walkaround' lens","review":"This is the lens I use most. It is sharper and faster than the kit lens. It is also weather sealed. I use it on my E500. And it focuses faster than the kit lens and because it has a full f/stop wider aperture, It makes my E500 work MUCH better in low light. That extra f/stop makes the viewfinder much brighter as well.Olympus makes the best kit lenses on the market, but if you are still dissatisfied with the quality of the kit lens, this upgrade is most definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have lens","review":"This lens is completely different from the 14-45 kit lens. Not in the same class at all. This lens provides better color saturation, more accurate and pleasing tones, better contrast, faster focusing, and a wider aperture. In general, this will give you considerably better pictures than your kit lens. How much better?On a scale of 1-10, (1 being point-and-shoot lens/image quality and 10 being outstanding), I'd give the kit lens about a 4 and this lens about a 9) The 10 slot is reserved for the 11-22mm lens which is crazy sharp! But that's another review for another day.It's not all about image quality though. There's a lot to be said for the wider aperture size of this lens. You'll be grateful for a faster lens when you're taking those tricky-lighting shots, or when you want to speed up your shutter to freeze motion, and you're indoors with poor lighting. That wider aperture will save you!Seriously, get this lens. You won't regret it when you see how beautiful your pictures are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens!","review":"This is a great lens period. I bought it for my E-520 here in Afghanistan.

I'm an old Nikon user and not to impressed with the construction of many of the new digital lenses. Thr workmanship in many of the new lenses is done on the cheap. This lens is a little pricy, but you get everything paid for. The images are very sharp for a zoom with its range and the 4/3s intigrated system is beautifuly easy to shoot with.

DO NOT BUY if you like the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new YSL Opium...","review":"I've worn this fragrance for decades...Suddenly there's a new bottle (not the one shown). Pretty as it is---I'm not sure I appreciate it! Keep trying to take the lid off & it doesn't always spray well! Higher cost for this? If it weren't 'my scent', I might try others.

If you buy this product on line buy it from the manufacturer because if you don't like it they told me they would make it right. However it is more expensive. If possible, probably the best thing to do is buy it at your local department store.

Recorded in Germany, this disc contains some classic Free material that really showcase Paul's magnificent voice. The set opens with Little Bit of Love and keeps soaring from there, with Paul giving an inspired rendition of Be My Friend, in my opinion, Free's most underrated song. The middle section has a definite blues vibe with stirring takes of Louisiana Blues, Muddy Water Blues, Rolling Stone and I'm Ready. The first cd, Now, of original material has some really nice songs. Soul of Love, which was a minor hit, starts it off nicely. Other gems include Heart of Fire, Saving Grace, All I Want is You and I Lost It All. Really, if you appreciate the vocal talents of Paul Rodgers, anything he sings sounds pretty damn good. All in all, this is a definite worthy addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"New reprint available finally","review":"This is a fantastic book. I read it several years ago and bought several copies for my friends. Then it went out of print and I was so disappointed.

And by true, I mean false. It's mostly lies. But they're entertaining lies. And in the end, isn't that the real truth? The answer is: No. It is based on some true events, but in the process, the author switches from non-fiction to fiction. **"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment!","review":"A potentially good story told badly, poorly written, sloppily edited. Even the appendices in the back are shoddy. If the newspaper actually wrote the articles the way they are reproduced, it says sad things about the Worcester Telegram & Gazette in the 1800s! I can't make head nor tails out of what the authors are trying to say, and the way they try to say it makes it even worse. Based on a true story, the historical murder victims must be spinning in their graves! If the murders themsevles were tragic, the writing of this book is even moreso. How a publisher could even put this book on the shelves in the shape it is in is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non Fiction?

The detail is almost gone which ruins the tantalizing scenes featuring Miss Page. It also ruins the excellent wild animal footage included in the film.Only very serious collectors of pre-code films should bother with this one.

I think it would best for Rosie to stick to what has worked for her, for most of her career, to sing her songs with a good band backing her. Rosie, i still love you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugarland Shuffle","review":"This is a really cute book. A fun read. However, one thing drove me absolutely crazy. One character, Rachel, is from Sugarland, Texas. The author makes it sound like a dinky little town in the middle of nowhere. For those of you who don't know, Sugarland is a city on the outskirts of Houston. It is a busy little metropolis. Nothing backwards about it. It boasts gated communities, nice malls, movie theaters...picture a mini-Houston. I wish the author had done a little more research when choosing Sugarland as Rachel's hometown. Other than that little snafu it's a really cute story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Assistants\\" needs assistance","review":"If I could just get around some of the Jackie Collins-esque adjectives the author uses in this tome, I might me able to stomach reading on. Moreover, somebody forgot to proof this before it went to press! Page 34 has two glaring errors in fact and spelling. The one-dimensional characters are trashy people. Maybe that's the author's point? That \\"the business,\\" and its people are pure trash? I'm taking this one to the used book store to exchange for a real novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Read","review":"This a good book and a fast read. Working in the entertainment industry I'm privy to some assistant horror stories and have seen some abuse first hand so this story is close to being true. Its nice to see things end up as they do in this story. You really get to know and like the characters and care about the outcome. Pick this book up if you are looking for a quick uncomplicated read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Entertaining Read","review":"I really enjoyed this book, much to my surprise. I've worked as an assistant myself, not for celebrities, but for powerful and locally prominent people, and the sorry fact is that the depictions of the seriousness in which the people take themselves and their needs and the attitude and devotion expected of their staff is not exaggerated. While the happily ever outcome may not be realistic, I thought the stories of each character had an air of authenticity and believability.Somehow Robin Lynn Williams manages to keep the story from being depressing and makes the assistants likeable. If you're looking to be entertained and amused, this is a good pick, as I really enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"I guess I'm the only one who agrees with the opinion that this book was a disappointment. I read the short review by a favorite author of mine, Lauren Weisberger, on the back of the book and expected to thoroughly enjoy it. That's not exactly what happened. The beginning of the book was promising with the introduction of all of the characters but they never really developed.I was especially disappointed by the ending. Beside it feeling rushed, it was clear that the story took off when Rachel was introduced but it wasn't Rachel that explained how everyone ended up. Among the other upsets were the grammatical errors, overuse of Microsoft Word-like insertion of synonyms, random camera/direction notes, and overall lack of detail.Also, the comparison of this book to Office Space is laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious tales from the trenches","review":"This book is not only funny but the characters are real and likable, even with all of their flaws. You really feel for each one as they endure constant abuse and humuliation in order to please their impossible bosses. It's fast paced, very entertaining, and an overall great summer read!And to the reviewer who said there were glaring errors on page 34.....it's obvious to anyone that has read the rest of the book that the mistakes are intentional and one of many quirks that the Rachel character possesses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully boring, slows down time","review":"This is the most boring IMAX presentation I have ever seen. It is painfully slow moving. I couldn't play it through. It is only 35 minutes but it seemed like 2 hours. I couldn't make it anywhere near the entire 35 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY POOR TRANSFER","review":"I have a large collection of IMAX DVDs. I enjoy them because the video quality is usually stunning. Playing them on my 65 inch screen normally produces a very fine picture. I dont know what happened with the transer on this film, but it is poor at best. Black and shadow areas are filled with artifacts and the overall picture quality is very grainy and rough appearing. The company responsible obviously chose to go the cheap route on the video tranfer. Also, I agree with the previous reviewer about the cliff climbing botanist. Too much time was wasted on this guy climbing a cliff without a line or safety helmet. The whole sequence may have been staged. I cant believe anyone would be so dumb and reckless to do this without some basic protection. This DVD will not be a keeper in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome IMAX Movie","review":"IMAX always delivers great movies with even greater scenery. This movie focuses on the scenery that is nearly inacessable to the normal person. It takes you all the way from the edge of volcano at 10,000 feet, to the depths of 4,000 feet under the ocean to watch the newest island being formed.Hidden Hawaii does show the hidden aspects. It shows you the Silversword flower that only grows in Hawaii, and also the Alula plant that clings to the steepest and highest cliffs. This movie will surely not dissapoint.The only downfall of the movie, like most IMAX movies, is that it is rather short. It's a great 35 minutes, but I would have loved more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed.","review":"There are few redeeming qualities I can point to in this very boring presentation. I kept hoping it would just end already. While there are moments of majestic Hawaiian views, they are few and far between. Much time is wasted focusing on a self-important \\"naturalist\\" who just tries to show off that he climbs rock faces without a safety line. Please. I wanted more waterfalls and volcanoes, not sedating ego trips. Too late for a refund?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Well worth the price and I am very satisfied with the product. Overall very pleased. Just a few suggestions...The buttons could be bigger and the operating systems are very complicated... on several occasions I thought I had turned it off when the CD player was still on. The company was excellent. The first one did not arrive and they sent a replacement... no questions asked. I got it two days later. Highly recommend them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Player!!","review":"Absolutely love this CD/AM-FM Radio/TV tuner. It is sleek, simple to use and clear as a bell.

It worked great for the first week. Since then it has developed a high frequency noise that doesn't seem to go away. It has trouble tracking and makes a horrid noise every few seconds. It's going back to the store today....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on what you are looking for","review":"I bought this CD player as a replacement for the one I had been using for 6 years before. This one is kind of expensive, but it includes a lot of features. It works just fine for me, and the battery life is surprisingly long for just one battery. The only problem I really have with it is the center button that controls scrolling and the volume. It is difficult to move, and since it doubles as the play/pause button, it gets a little annoying. It feels kind of weak, and though it hasn't broken yet, I fear it will one day.Other than that, it is a very nice CD player. If you want a cheap CD player, buy something else. If you like the features of this one, then this is your best bet.Also, don't listen to all the idiots here that are complaining because they got defectives. SOMETIMES products are defective. Take them back to the store and get another. Stop giving the product a bad review because you are upset that yours doesn't work like everyone else's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-designed failure","review":"The main negative issue was volume control. These itty-bitty buttons that access the control took 10 or more seconds to activate the control panel items. The volume on radio was not equal to the CD volume so switching playback from CD to radio was a lesson in frustration to a point I thought the product was defective and returned it to Amazon for an exchange. The new one came and it was the same design flaw. I returned it and bought a similar product at Walgreens for one-third the price. The rating is a zero star. Amazon's customer support was so superb, it was almost worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I bought this player for my elderly dad, however, the buttons on this player are so small that my dad cannot use it without help. The antenna for the radio is not very strong - I was hoping he could listen to am radio but it gets no reception. Very disappointing for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed","review":"First of all the \\"off\\" button was in a lousy location. I kept turning it off by accident just holding it. It was also very fussy about what it would play. It also took a long time for it to recognise a cd or mp3. It completely broke down a year and a month after I bought it. Some water splashed on it while I was doing dishes and now only the radio works. I'm surprised because all my other Sony stuff lasted years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Menu & feature items not accessible","review":"Sony DNF430 MP3/ATRAC CD Walkman Portable Compact Disc Player with AM/FM/TV/Weather Digital TunerI bought this to play audio CDs and listen occasionally to the radio based on star ratings. After a lot of fooling around I was able to get the volume control to work about half the time. The radio works and it plays CDs. None of the menu and various setup features are accessible. The instructions are useless; it's all by trial and error, mostly error. There is a toggle switch that seems to be central to the operation, but it is largely unresponsive. Working it several times usually results in a volume adjustment, but other times it switches away to unbidden modes. This gadget has endless features with impenetrable secret codes required to use them. I would certainly never buy this model again. There must be better products on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Walkman Great Battery power ease of use","review":"This is a great CD player and radio. I use this to knit and listen to books. It works great and it takes only 1 AA battery that definitely gets a lot of time. Highly recommend. Also, the ear buds that come with it work really well. I use a headset unless I'm in an enclosed area near others and I have used the ear buds with great success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Sony's most user friendly products","review":"I bought this just to use as a CD player at the gym.

Would not buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boyfriend birthday present gone right","review":"Boyfriend loves his little walkman. This was a hit. In an age where $10.99 will buy you a personal cd player, $53 seemed a bit over-priced. However, I wanted some very specific features such as weather and TV bands and this was the only return on my search that was made by a company I trusted.Yes. I love Sony products because they almost always do exactly what they say they will do and tend to last as long or longer than competition.This product is no exception.All I needed was the big smile on my boyfriend's face for confirmation.

Rather than a continuous, plotted narative, it provides vignettes of \\"typical\\" Roman life. For my mind, it provides some of the strongest images ever filmed. Highlights include a totally irreverent ecclesiastical fashion show that is not to be missed, and a journey into an archaeological treasure beneath the streets of Rome. It features traffic, life during World War II, apartment life, eating, and delightful visits to the red light district.This isn't a film for children. It IS a film you simply must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"older Fellini flick-more or less documentary","review":"I remember seeing this movie many years ago when I was in the UK.

Hannah only writes about women in the most limited terms: as sexual objects, as the tragically frail pining for lost love, or as housekeepers. Hannah knows nothing about women. His stories from the female perspective are laughably bad, rife with p*nis envy. This is a collection of machismo stories that despite their occasional beauty, read mostly like a series of fart jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woefully uneven collection","review":"A collection of stories mostly about southern racists, misogynists or ignoramuses, this collection rarely gets on track.

And I'll admit, it was a damn fine story. It amounted to twelve dollars for one story, and, that, for me, didn't feel worth it. Or maybe I'm just stupid--maybe ever story made perfect literary sense. As an avid reader of Raymond Carver, I am not easily impressed by short stories, since, being an English Major and a student of writing and Carver, I have certian expectations of short story writers. For one, don't be too literary--I get enough of Lit BS from going to class, and second, don't try to showboat or reinvent the short story.

I can only hope he left at least a manuscript or two among his papers that have yet to see the light of day.AIRSHIPS was one of his early collections of short stories, a form that he returned to throughout his writing life. Funny, deep, Southern, universal, sexy, and chock full of love and hate and truth and lies all at the same time. This volume is a good place to start with Hannah's work. It may even be his masterpiece.

What a difference! It has almost doubled the rating that Windows 7 gives (from 4.6 to 7.1 - OK, 66% faster). As for the seller, no complaints. He was very fast with a response to a question I had, the product got here in a timely manner and packaged very well. So far this processor has worked perfectly and was recognized by my system and Windows immediately. Maybe not quite up to i7 processing speeds, but this will extend the useful life of my system quite a bit. Very happy that I spent the money and happy that I don't have to drop $1000+ on a new system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Processor!","review":"Great product! Overclocked to 2.5 Ghz on a XFX 680i SLI LT, idle temperatures for the cores is usually around 44c (CPU Itself is 38 C), at maximum load it's at a max of 57 C. I have the stock fan, and the air flow in my computer is not good, so it's safe to say you can overclock this safely to 2.5 ghz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair","review":"I love the Quad Core I just don't like the heatsink. I initially had a problem where my computer was constantly shutting off when I would play a game. I returned one to amazon due to Intel's tech support. Amazon sent me another Q6600. I installed and had the same problem. I purchased a bigger exhaust fan, after market heatsink, and another fan to help circulate the air inside my case. Everything worked fine after that and my temperatures went down drastically. Would recommend but buy an after market heatsink."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cpu going for the price","review":"Why get the Duo when you can get the Quad for the same price? measures 5.9 on Vista Ultimate performance index. this is one smokin' processor. figurativly speaking, not literally. the chip runs acceptably cool using the supplied CPU fan. installs flawlessly on the Intel D975XBX2 motherboard. buy them together and save!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best processor for those hoping to skip I7","review":"Just got this processor as a replacement for my E6400 2.13GHZ. At the time the E6400 was a best bang for buck purchase and so is the Q6600! Though newer technologies have come along, this processor is everything I had hoped for despite being released a couple years ago.Based on the way I use my computer (mostly gaming and running a couple virtual machines) I should have no trouble holding out for I9, or whatever intel comes up with next. If you are looking to upgrade your socket 775 system so you can hold out a little longer before having to replace your motherboard and not pay Q9650 prices, this is the processor for you. The 8MB of cache and ability to easily overclock to 3.2GHZ on air really makes this processor a steal.Overall, I feel like I got a very good performance increase for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up for Q6600!","review":"I'm very satisfied with the product.. works very well on my new computer,has a very good performance under Linux (amazing though!) compiling is really really fast using the 4 cores (make -j4) and it's really good on games and 3D Design / Rendering.

But when I was looking for a processor for my new computer, comparing quad cores, I just had to go with Intel. And I'm glad I chose this one. This processor is great for overclocking. While stock is 2.4GHz, I was able to overclock to 3.0GHz on the stock heat sink/fan and without changing any voltages. I'm currently running 3.2GHz. You really get your money's worth out of this chip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent processor for an ideal price!","review":"The Q6600 Intel Core 2 Quad processor is obviously one of the best in the market right now. Four processors at 2.40 GHz each is A LOT of power. The fan and heat sink used on it is huge and effective. Compared to my old PC with a Pentium 4 2.8 gig, there is no comparison.

Excellent product nevertheless, and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Processor","review":"I purchased this in late 2007 from amazon for my gaming system, it cost me $275 back then.

I successfully reached 3.2GHz (FSB=356, step=9, vcore=1.35v) the MB is P5B Deluxe and CPU cooler is Zalman 9700. System is very stable. 15% increase of PC vantage. CPU Temp is 35 C at idle and 45 C at load at ambient temp 20 C. Q6600 is the most charming CPU in term of overclock ability. Some overclocked Q6600 to 4GHz. It worth every cent you pay for it.

I paired mine with a nice motherboard from EVGA (but you can find a nice cheaper alternative). Now there should only be the G0 series that are being sold as appose to the B3 that they started with. This means that if your motherboard will allow it you can easily overclock these without any modification from stock parts. I wouldn't go too high but its possible. Excellent reliability and price for such a amazing processor. I know the I7 is out and you can get the extreme versions of these processors but its not worth it. 4 core 2.4ghz is more then enough for almost anything a normal user (even gamers) would need for some time.

Hell no. \\"It's No Good\\" was released the same year, and deals with the same 'come back to me, despite life's decisions we'll be together' type lyrics, but was handled in an adult way.

During everytime of personal crisis, the song can help. With it's simple guitar riffs and basic but beautiful lyrics, you just can't help but love it. After the World Trade Center was attacked, I dug through all my old CDs looking for some sort of solace. This is the only CD that not only calmed me down but also helped me think.

The single star review of my book is okay in and of itself. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. But the reviewer states that my book is a rip-off of Conybeare and Howson's 1851 book on the Apostle Paul -- and that is a flat-out lie. There are eleven pages of footnotes in \\"Evidence and Paul's Journeys,\\" most from twentieth century works dealing with historical evidence that C-H had no knowledge of. Even the main nineteenth century authorities that I cite are all post-Conybeare and Howson, as is their evidence. (On Paul's letters, I relied heavily on Paly, who is actually before C-H). Indeed, I did not use C-H as a source at all because they are just too dated.

The film is different than the novel, which was written by Alistair MacLean, and MacLean was a better writer than 99 percent of Hollywood hacks. MacLean's novel makes sense but many parts of this movie don't. In the novel there is no traitor on the ship. In the movie there is, but what I assume was added to create suspense just created incoherency. The ending is different in the film, reflecting, one assumes, the leftwing politics of Hollywood. (The U.S. shouldn't be allowed to win a Cold War battle. Has to be a draw.)However, the acting is superb, led by the magnificent Patrick McGoohan, who has any number of noteworthy lines. Even the silly ones sound sensible when McGoohan says them. Excellent theme too.Recommended but if they had stuck with MacLean's novel it would have been a better film."},{"rating":"2","title":"ice station zebra","review":"Good plot, special effects, I love underwater scees, this movie had them...I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again,,,Thanks Ted511"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unrevealed plot","review":"Some good excitement through an unrevealed turn of events.

To Warner Bros.'s credit, it does state on the front of the box I bought that these are the original NBC episodes. To their discredit, it does not explain why they felt it necessary to mention the subject at all. There were, apparently, several hours of extended material on the DVDs.

Real friends fans will know the difference and will be annoyed just like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the upgrade!","review":"I owned all the DVDs and I realize these aren't the extended episodes but the picture quality alone makes up for it. Even Season 1 looks phenomenal! I don't know how they did it cause the DVDs in the earlier seasons are awful. If your considering getting this as a gift I'd highly recommend it! I'm so happy I took the chance and ordered this cause I am loving it! The casing is beautiful also, now all we need is Seinfeld to get this nice of an upgrade and I'll be set.

It is my favorite sitcom of all time and I couldn't wait to buy it on Blu-Ray but they decided to release it without the extended versions I will not be buying it.

Also, with 12 episodes per disc, you spend less time changing out discs during a marathon viewing....I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No extended, no money.","review":"As many people have said already this box set only contains the broadcast versions. Well I also know these episodes like the back of my hand and cannot watch them with missing segments. No thanks WB! I'd gladly pay close to 200 dollars for the extended episodes in HD.

No Sale!","review":"Friends is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I was so excited to hear that the episodes were going to be released on Blu-ray. But then, I found out that this set only contains the BROADCAST versions of each episode, meaning each episode is significantly cut down to fit a 1/2 hour TV time slot.This is totally unacceptable. Why should I (or anyone that owns the Friends DVD's for that matter) downgrade my episodes to the Broadcast versions? I already own the complete DVD set, and that set has the FULL-LENGTH episodes! Yes, they are now being presented to us in HD, but that is not worth it if we are losing so many hours of unbelievable comedy!My word of advice: Stick with the Friends DVD's, because buying this set will mean losing out on SO MUCH Friends comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friends finally on blu....Could This BE any......","review":"AWESOME! Yes it is. Ordered it on Saturday and received it today!Now to get something straight these are the Broadcast episodes!!! Now I've been watching this amazing set, and I'm barely on season 1, but so far I'm not missing the extended cuts. There are three reasons.1. These episodes are the way these episodes were meant to be seen!!2. All the episodes are stunning in blu ray3. There are a few episodes extended and the original \\"The One Where Ross Tells Rachel\\" in it's unedited glory.Bottom line: Friends are finally on Blu; enjoy!!! For all the bad reviews out there: own the set and then write your reviews.

But you don't need it as the case has an indented 'grip' built into it to grab onto it. We used this to replace an overstuffed nylon one that was larger and it fit many more DVDs into it in a smaller space.

There is a little pocket on the inside which I found to be a convenient place to store memory cards. Won Downside is that the sleeves do not hold mini-CD's or mini-DVDS well.

After the death of my brother from a year long battle with cancer the last thing I needed was a heavy detailed trip into academia. Dealing with my own grief as a single parent and caring for my daughter was exhuasting.

One night, he over-hears a conversation between someone in his building and a woman who appears to be a hooker. The next day he reads the paper, only to find out that the women he heard was brutally murdered. So, our main character goes about trying to find out who the killer is.This movie isn't super-high budget, but also not a classic B movie.

His heart didn't seem to be in it. He did have a couple of good songs, and I enjoyed his daughter's performance. Part of the problem is that the band drowns out his voice in a lot of the songs.

A great set list and loads of talent in his band made this tour and album a huge sucess. Everything from Floyd's back catalogue and Roger's solo stuff appear on this album. The songs are played very well and sound great. I gave this album 4 stars because you can definetly hear where David should have been. Sorry, Doyle and Snowy but noone can play those solos like David. This can really be heard on Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Dogs as there are notes being skipped or altered. The notes being altered don't belong. Otherwise if you like Roger and like Pink Floyd. I do recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Impressive Live Outing","review":"After two Pink Floyd live albums and two live versions of The Wall, did we really need a Roger Waters live album full of Pink Floyd material. After one listen to this, the answer is yes. Roger not only offers versions of Floyd standards such as \\"Money\\", \\"Another Brick In The Wall Pt II\\", and \\"Comfortably Numb\\", but he gives us more obscure Floyd tracks such as \\"In The Flesh\\", \\"Mother\\", and \\"Set Your Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\". Also, \\"Welcome To The Machine\\" has never sounded better. Roger's solo material fits in nicely among the Floyd songs. If you were lucky enough to catch the \\"In The Flesh\\" 1999-2000 tour, this serves as a nice souvenier. If not, this is a chance to hear what you missed. Having also attended the 1987 Radio K.A.O.S. tour, I was hoping he would perform such tracks as \\"If\\", \\"Nobody's Home\\", and \\"Not Now John\\" instead of the above mentioned Floyd standards. Oh well, you can't have everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"dogs","review":"Finally animals gets some respect hear it in 5.1 dolby youll like it. The other songs arent to bad either. Its great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good. you will feel the absence of the three HEROS","review":"Lets be honest, Roger failed to resurrect the old PINK FLOYD songs. For example, Just listen to these songs , The Happiest Days Of Our Lives , Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2 ,Mother ,Comfortably numb and all the songs from the DARK SIDE OF THE MOON album, they are completely ruined , feels like a Pink Floyd tribute band is playing. Listen to that funny voice of that guy who is trying to imitates Dave Gilmour voice in MONEY , or to the guitar player who completely destroyed Comfortably numb ........and more .... SO the album is not a PINK FLOYD live show. But the other solo works of Roger were nicely executed such as Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert , Southhampton Dock from (FINAL CUT which is consider it as Roger's Solo album), Amused To Death . So if want to buy this album to listen to the old Pink Floyd songs .... I tell you this ..DON'T BUY IT But if you like to listen to Roger's solo works then, OK BUY THE ALBUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning--mispackaged discs","review":"This didn't play in 5 different CD players.

The concert was awesome and this two disc set is a much better memento than any t-shirt or other souvenir you could ever purchase. Now, having said that, I have only one complaint...where's the passion of the concert? The songs are great and the band is fantastic but I guess Roger's passion and stage presence could not be capture. However, if you have a doubt about buying this live set it is worth the price for the solo songs, Each Small Candle, Dogs, Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun. Hearing all of these and the PF catalog songs it is easy to decide which one is Pink!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the Music","review":"Roger has proven he is/was Pink Floyd. This is no longer a debate. In the Flesh was a great tour and album about what Roger's music means to people, In Roger's words \\"love\\".

The Water's solo material serves as a nice overview of his solo career (Each Small Candle is a highlight). But the inclusion of so much Floyd material is disappointing. Sure, Roger created most of the Floyd songs, but do we really need another live version of Comfortably Numb? And nearly the whole \\"Wish You Were Here\\" album is presented.

Enough already..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"A great Pink Floyd fan. I Can appreciate the quality of the performance but of the recording as well as the fans response on some of the tracks is horrable. At some points during quite parts of the songs, all you can hear is grunts groans and wooo's from fans. Sounds like someone recorded it from the audiance. Sometimes you can hear one fan clapping off beat as well as singing off key. I want to hear the band and the music not the tone deaf fans.

IT IS DEFINITLY A MUST HAVE FOR ALL ROGER WATER AND PINK FLOYD FANS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waters is Alive and Well!","review":"I'll start by saying I've never been a big fan of 'live' recordings. The sound quality is often inferior and the crowd noise is distracting. Not so with \\"In the Flesh\\". The crowd noise is mostly only heard between songs and never distracts the performance. The sound quality is better than many studio recordings. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of missing material from Radio K.A.O.S., one of Waters' finest efforts. These performances are arranged just differently enough to add a different approach to listening, but retains much of the integrity of the original recordings. Some fine old favorites from the \\"Floyd\\" days as well as some stellar work from Water's solo career. I was skeptical about getting this 2 CD set, but now I'll never part with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great concert","review":"I play this in the office frequently.

The four \\"missing\\" stars are for: 1. The \\"dull\\" sound of the album 2. Lip sync during \\"Every strangers eyes\\" 3. Choice of songs, it's fun to hear some old \\"Pink\\" songs but not the \\"same old same old\\" all the time. 4. Lack of a concept, since each album since \\"Dark\\" has been a concept album why not tell at least one of these wonderful \\"stories\\" live? Amused to Death re-arranged would have been nice.... This album simply has nothing new to offer and the boring soundscape created is a sleeping pill. They should have left it \\"un-produced\\", the bootlegs off the tour are more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real let-down","review":"If you are a Pink Floyd fan, go listen to Dark Side, Animals, and the Wall again, and leave this album on the shelf. That Waters uses mainly women to sing Gilmour's parts is a disgrace. His attempts at Pink Floyd songs fall flat, and his solo stuff is fair at best. I deeply respect Waters as an artist, but only when he sings with three other guys. I was excited when this album came out. Sadly, I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Pink Floyd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have been a Pink Floyd fan since 1970. I love Pink Floyd and Roger Waters.

Roger used to be cool.","review":"I hate artists who feel a need to play their old material without reuniting their old band. Even if Roger Waters reunited with Pink Floyd, they would still be awful, because they would only play the crap from Dark Side of The Moon and The Wall. Sadly, that's the material Roger Waters chose to play. I'm not a big fan of those albums, but Roger Waters felt the need to put 80's guitar solos in such classics like \\"Welcome To The Machine\\" and put a saxaphone in \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun,\\" which automatically makes it a turd-fest. Plus, add some female backup singers to just about EVERY song, and you have In The Flesh. Don't bother with this album. Get Ummagumma for true Pink FLoyd live, or just stick with the Live at Pompeii DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD's?????????????","review":"I gave it a 1 because it is a CD. Forget these CD's. Forget all CD's. The format along with stereo is dead. It's around 20 years old now and is showing its age. Buy the DVD instead. You won't believe the difference and it's cheaper in this case...Don't invest in old technology and inferior sound. The video enhances the surround audio which is spectacular in comparison to the CD.

It holds about 6 small medela/avent bottles w/ cap or about 4 with their nipples along with the icepack. The little pouch on the front it nice...especially to put new breastmilk bags into before use. And it should hold about 2 of the bags and at least 4 bottles with caps of milk comfortably along with the ice pack. That's perfect for pumping a few times a day while at work and then transporting home (unless you decide to do all bottles and then it would hold about 6 w/ caps)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I wish I had this bag with my last child. It's great! Although I use the skinny Medela bottles to pump in & can fit four-five in the bag. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag","review":"Great bag for transporting pumped milk to and from work every day. It is sleek and slim but large enough that it can hold multiple bottles or storage bags. Comes with a cooler bag, which can be frozen and used many times. The first bag that I ordered came with the cooler pack leaking, but I sent it back and it was promptly replaced. It's cuter than the cooler bags that come with the typical Medela and Similac and other baby kits -- with a color accent, either baby blue or pink. Pumping every day at work can be grueling, and it's the small things that can add a hint of fun to your day...."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"It comes with an ice pack but i found that the Medela 4 bottle ice pack works better and fits your cooler perfectly- Then you have cold around both sides and not just on the bottom, like with the ice pack it comes with.Its a good design and clips to almost anything. Its good not just for bottles, but as an upright lunchbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I purchased this cooler mainly to transport expressed milk from work to home. I got the cocoa/pink one and I really like the color. The brown bag looks very discreet, but that pink lining adds a little bit of personality. The zipper on the top is great to seal in the coolness. The handles have a button so that they can snap together and hang from stroller handlebar.I fit four Medela 5oz bottles along with three ice packs, one of which came with the bag. I added two of my own, about the same size as the included one. They're all about 5-6 inches tall and about 1 inch thick. I put two ice packs on the side and one on top of the bottles. With my setup, there's still a little bit of room on the top (about 2-3 inches), therefore, it's easy for me to zip and unzip.My commute from work to home is about 30-40 minutes, and when I get home, the bottles are still nice and cool. It definitely met my expectations. This is great value for under $10 bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Include Smaller Tote and Extra Ice Pack, As Described","review":"I order this set and when I got it, I only received one tote and one ice pack. So, I returned it since it explicitly states you get two ice packs, a large tote and a single bottle tote. Once again, I received just the larger tote and one ice pack. If you are fine with just the one tote and ice pack you will probably like this product, but I really wanted the set so I was not pleased. I do hope that they fix the wording on the product to reflect the set is the tote and ice pack alone.

I wouldn't say we were particularly hard on it, but after 2 or 3 uses, it began to leak blue gunk everywhere.

Ummmmmm, I'm not quite sure why they advertise that this thing can fit 4 bottles, because I fit 3 (8 oz) EXTREMELY TIGHTLY and then once I added the ice pack there was NO POSSIBLE way to close it. Not to mention if you have wide neck bottles; (like Avent, Born Free, or Dr Browns) good luck. I tried my NUK bottles too without success. The only ones I could fit in there were the 4 oz bottles, and only 3 with the ice pack; it was still so tight I nearly busted the zipper off trying to close the darn thing!

I particularly disliked the unpleasant turn it took with Sharpe's wife, and it doesn't help that Sharpe seems to betray an old friend. The plot also feels somewhat contrived and farfetched, even for Richard Sharpe. There's a very clever twist involving a light artillery piece at the book's climax, but the denouement felt perfunctory and unconvincing. This isn't my least favorite novel in the Sharpe series (that would be the equally morose and even more farfetched \\"Sharpe's Prey\\"), but it's far from one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revenge is sweet","review":"At first a little disappointed as Cornwell spends a lot of time away from the battlefield, but he cleverly drags us along as Sharpe's outlook changes, so does ours.

But hope is created by one special character, and a desperate plan is executed, taking advantage of a major curse.

The audio narrator interprets the most egregious of the lead character's painful baby talk. (an Amazon's audible.com audio book)The two lead characters are painfully flawed and dysfunctional and their abuse, particularly by the father, continuously ladled out to the children is painful and ever present.There is no redeeming value to this story and its characters.

I ended up just skipping the passages where the father speaks to his children.Stead's most common strategy for character development is for her characters to give long lectures out loud (either to themselves or to an audience), and these lectures are tedious and repetitive.And finally, if you do get the book, don't read the introduction by Doris Lessing until you're done with the novel.

It is mostly concerned with overall strategy and campaigns; less with individual battles and operations. The book severely criticizes the Johnson Administration (with a particular venom for Robert McNamara) but is much more positive about Nixon. The author's attitude towards the South Vietnamese government and Army is critical but quite fair, and he gives the North Vietnamese their due. This is not really a book about American military performance, and does not really mention problems within the military, such as drug abuse, racial incidents, massacres, etc., but he does believe that any problems were a result of having a bankrupt political/military strategy. A few OK maps, no photographs or footnotes, but a nice bibliographical essay.

Several problems are evident when trying to record from TV feed as mentioned in some of the reviews for this product.As if that wasn't enough of a problem , I also found out after contacting customer service that one can ONLY use the device w/ the two provided applications that come bundled with the package. Indeed very limited in my opinion especially for such an expensive device.For all parties interested: I suggest just using a firewire/i.link cable if camcorder/camera supports it.

Each attempt to capture either never started, or froze shortly after, or simply locked up my machine. This was working on a new machine with a fast processor, a ton of ram and a buttload of available hard drive space. Not ready for prime, and surely not worth the best part of two $100 bills.

I'm reduced to entering each recording manually (a fairly tedious process that runs across several screens), but about 30% of the time the scheduling service crashes and misses the show (nothing gets recorded until I reboot). There have been no driver updates since July.In addition, the \\"electronic programming guide\\" is actually a web page, and the only way in which it's integrated with the program -- the ability to record a show by clicking on it in the browser -- doesn't work at all (I get a dialog that says \\"Load Fail\\" most of the time).Unfortunately, this product is worthless due to fatal technical problems.

We must stop these bad people from begetting before they beget more bad people.That's where forced sterilization comes in. Pioneering experimentation done on adopted kittens led Dr. Frist to his conclusion that the cheapest, most cost-effective means of forced sterilization is execution.

Coming from a family of mildly despicable cheats, the Frists had a leg up on normal human beings...but it still took an enormous amount of laboratory work and careful training to produce not just a self-involved twit but an unspeakable monster.This book is Frankenstein of our century, a marvellous account of the line between science and morality, and the \\"Dr. Frist\\" character is a chilling reminder of the true evil inherent in all humanity...even if readers will find Dr. Frist himself an impossibly overdrawn character. Surely, no actual human could be so evil. Neverthless, he stands like Shelley's monster as an emblem of the path we as a species must never take.By damning this \\"Dr. Frist\\" character and the bizarre process that created him, this sterling work serves as a moral guide, a hope for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A monumental bore-a-thon","review":"Really, this has got to rank as one of the worst excuses for biography ever written.

If read slowly and deliberately, paying attention to detail, this story will absorb you into it causing you to undergo the same transformation as Duncan. You will feel yourself becoming Mri.

The Mri are extremely well developed in terms of culture, religion, history, etc, and a completely original concept for a book. I've read it three times and found new understanding each time.

Strangely, this was my first introduction to Cherryh. I was impressed so much that I am now on a quest to own her entire body of work. The Faded Sun is so rich in plot, location, and prose that those traits alone would make it worth reading. The story is exciting and full of wonder. However, the true beauty of this book is in the development of character. I am sure we have all read works in which we enjoyed the story but could have cared less about the characters. This is not the case with Cherryh. The characters come to life. They become the reader's \\"friends.\\" I cared about what happened to them.

C.J.Cherryh can, like few other writers, make aliens feel real to the reader while preserving the striking differences between \\"us and them.\\" The detail of the mri culture is unbelievably rich and fully realized, just like Cherryh's also-excellent more recent creations, the atevi of the Foreigner universe.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys scifi, or even just a really well-written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Major and Important American Poet","review":"This is an unusual book. It tells a story. It's about \\"the defining moment of the Twentieth Century--the dawning of the atomic age and the destruction of Hirosima.\\" It's all rhyming sonnets, 150 of them. Despite its form, it's conversational. It's an epic, although some critics claim epics can't be written anymore. It's a dramatic monologue, in character. It won an international prize. No one has written anything like this since Browning.

The band itself is based in Birmingham Alabama and this is their second release.While the liner notes are very sparse, it does list 62 people as being members of Dick's Hat Family Band, with at least 22 of those listed performing on this CD. Those individuals come in the way of a 7 piece horn section, a quartet of background vocalist and two separate rhythm sections that alternate throughout the CD.The band can loosely be categorized as a jump band in the same vien as the Roomful of Blues. Their sound however, mantains a distinct R&B; revue quality with wide ranging material from R&B; to Soulful ballads to swing to vintage slow blues.

It immediately involved the audience in the world of the play. It is also amazing how well the entire cast can dance in addition to singing so well. If I'm not mistaken, these were opera singers-no?

It is about a migrant family (in this case, an African-American family) who are bused from one cotton field to another to pick cotton in which the children have to help. The book is really an indictment against child labor. It shows the hardships of this life, how important the \\"family\\" is, how tired and exhausted everyone (especially children) are at the end of the day, and how much children miss playing with other children. Reading the book with other children should lead to some fruitful discussions. It is beautifully written and illustrated.

Despite our efforts to squeeze out all the water at the end of bath time, after a few months the inside of the shower head had so much mildew that we had to cut it off of the toy. We thought they could still play with the track part, but without the shower my girls soon got bored with it and it has not been played with in months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not toddler friendly","review":"I bought this bath toy for my 2 year old. It's not very user-friendly - the cars can barely squeeze between the car wash and roller functions. It took a lot of effort on my part and my son couldn't do it himself.

Any normal person would assume the car \\"drives through\\" that spot to get scrubbed, like a real car wash. But apparently the engineers who designed this toy has never been through a car wash. The sponges are too close together so the car won't fit through. Same issue with the purple spinning things on the other side. The orange thing with white polka dots is a squirter that is so stiff, even the adults have trouble with it.Although I like the fact that the cars flip upside-down to become cups, I'm sorry to say the Sassy company screwed up and missed the basic concept of a car wash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"I bought this toy for our 19 month old son. Even though it shows rated for a 9 month old. He loves to play in the bath and have a variety of toys. I thought by the description and all the different things this toy could do it would be fun for him. I was wrong....The idea is to have it run like a car wash with of course some imagination involved as well. Well the scrubby pads do nothing, the rollers you have to use such force to even push the car through, how a child can even do that is beyond us and the spray hose feature by the time you put the car under it there's no room to spray. Also, you have to keep pumping the spray hose to even get a good spray from it after squeezing 10x.For the money I spent I am VERY disappointed. I got this as a Christmas Gift and now less than a week later we put it away and don't even use it.

The green squirty car is a hit along with the orange water/rinse feature. One review commented that this feature is hard to operate, but that has not been the case with ours. You have to pump it a few times first to get the water going, but it's easy to squeeze. My 1 year-old has no trouble.

The author provides no insights at all into either Richard Wagner or even the author's family. There is little here that we did not already know from other sources: Wolfgang Wagner is a power-obsessed despot, for example. Winifred was an unrepentant Nazi and a virulent anti-semite. Who doesn't know that?Most of this book appears to be the author's attempt to (a) settle old scores, particularly against family members, and (b) publicly atone for his sense of personal guilt at being a member of the Wagner family. Very little of what is in here merited publication. Gottfried comes across as whiny, self-indulgent, and not a little self-righteous. His recurrent theme is, \\"Everybody Hates Me, Nobody Loves Me, I Think I'll Go Out And Eat Worms.\\"Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I wish I had read the other reviews of this ponderous whinethon before I spent the money or more importantly the time enduring it. I had heard the author interviewed on NPR several times, and he is reasonably interesting in an interview. He is, however, an apallingly bad writer. This should have been pretty compelling stuff, but Gottfried Wagner has managed to turn it into an almost unending diatribe with repetitive and uninteresting details about his family's conflicts. There is also an uncomfortably consistent thread of self promotion present throughout most of his longwinded tales of his exodus from Bayreuth.While I can appreciate his angst over discovering the dark secrets of his family background, he could have covered that territory in a lot less time and paper. If you want to read a fascinating book and one that will give you a far better idea of what growing up in Nazi Germany was really like, try \\"Stones From the River\\". It, unlike this lump, is brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes You Feel Sympathy for His Father","review":"I've never seen a book backfire the way that this one does. Gottfried Wagner wants the reader to sympathize with his position, to feel the suffering of his terrible childhood, and to blame Gottfried's father Wolfgang for all of these woes. What actually happens is that Gottfried comes off as a whiner who blames everyone else (loudly and viciously) for his failures and who wrenches his arm patting himself on the back for his few, really rather undistinguished successes. The first fifth of the book is a fairly interesting \\"behind the scenes\\" look at Bayreuth in the 1950s. The rest of the book is an embarrassing rant. I was surprised to find this book offered by various vendors on Amazon for literally $.02. I now realize that you truly do get what you pay for. My respect for the challenges that Wolfgang Wagner has overcome increased tremendously as I read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Zone","review":"Gotfried Wagner gives us the inside story on the Wagner dynasty. He is certainly an nonconformist Wagner: a supporter of social - democracy and a promoter of German - Jewish understanding who wrote his doctorate on the Jewish composer Kurt Weil. Dr. Wagner tells us what it was like growing up in the strange world of Bayreuth and about the infighting between the heirs to the dynasty.He leaves no doubts as to the historical anti-semitism of the Wagner legacy as well as the war time collabaration with the Nazis (Hitler was endearingly called \\"Uncle Wolf\\"). That anti - semitism lives on today. He considers Daniel Birenboim as somewhat of a careerist and a dupe who purposely chooses to ignore the anti - semitism of Bayreuth. Dr. Wagner completely broke with the Wagner heritage and for this he has my admiration. An interesting story but the book cold have been better edited and reduced by say, fifty pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"So close yet so far ............................","review":"Very promising.

This is one of the few books that acutally details history in the eyes of those who served.

Beyond Valor demonstrates that no matter what time in history, wars are very serious matters and the actual people doing the fighting will most likely end up wounded or dead.

I found the fine wire brush did a better job, though I will say she enjoys this brush better--sort of like a massage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle on Short Haired Cats","review":"We received one of these brushes when we adopted our cats. Because the cats like it so much, I bought the second one so we can have a brush on each floor of our house. The only negative about the curry brush is that I have to frequently stop to pull the hair out of it. It's gentle on the cats' short fur and they like it so I can put up with this little inconvenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitty Curry Brush","review":"I have a 5 month old Singapura and he has buried the other two brushes I've bought for him in his litter box. But before he buried them he would bite all the bristles out. I couldn't figure out why he hates being brushed so much but I figured I'd give this one a try. He loves it! He actually goes to sleep while I'm brushing him. And will even meow at the brush for me to brush him. It does remove a lot of hair BUT it doesn't stick to the brush very well. His hair is on every surface in a 3 foot radius- my clothes, the bed, my face, it's just everywhere. But since he loves it so much I'm willing to lint roll everything just like when I wasn't brushing him at all! So if anyone has any tips on getting the hair to stick to the brush I would appreciate it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would work for my short haired cat...","review":"One of our (many cats) has difficult to comb fur; his fur is too short to use a bristle brush, too silky to use a comb or pin brush (slips right through). Thought a curry brush would be the answer because a curry brush for our short haired, no undercoat dog, worked so well. Alas, it does not work at all. The pins are too close which seems to work against picking up the hair. And it's nearly impossible to clean the hair out if you do manage to pick up some hair. And kitty HATED the rubber brush, but that of course is just my psycho cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeetness","review":"It's about time alice put out a live cd.
