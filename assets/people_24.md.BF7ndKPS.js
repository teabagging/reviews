Van Tils exposition of reformed theology, presuppositionalism specifically, though difficult to read at times, is simply brilliant. I had to re-read it to understand what it was he was getting at.He really gets to the difference between believers and unbelievers in a way that is so uncompromising.

Idiots to the right of me...","review":"Mr Galloway is quite the 'personality.' Please go to youtube and watch the full clip of his support for the suicide bombers in Iraq. It is under= Galloway Praises Iraqi Insurgency (w/ Add'l Real Time Intro). Mr Hitchens is also addicted to being in the media, but wait until he is done and there is a clip from Al Jazeera showing Mr Galloway essentially encourging continued insanity in Iraq- not stability. Hiding behind his glib manner and monologues is a mercenary mind. Remember that he is the author of the book. It is not in his best intrest to be totally forthcomming.Anyone who says there is an easy answer to the middle east problems - crazy. Iraq is the collision of two different delusional world views. Blame to go around. Mr Galloway is wrong and quite probably guilty of profiteering.

To really drive the point home, have a look at some of his other reviews - one band, evidently, is a favorite because they are \\"sick\\" and \\"truly evil.\\" Fair enough. Presumably, such judgment went into the evaluation of Galloway's screed as well. It certainly would explain the 5-star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't want it to end!","review":"My only complaint with this book is that its too short! I wish it were longer!

One case in point: the author says that the 3,000 figure for Jews killed in Zagare is more likely 7,000. Where does she get this figure? According to census records, in 1938 Zagare had 5445 residents, not all Jews. In 1942 it had 2,936 residents, mostly non-Jews. So about 2,509 were killed, not 7,000, perhaps not even 3,000. This of course does not make the crime any less horrendous.

Yet the cinematographers art is what is most brilliantly expressed. The opening sequences, though devoid of dialogue, totally capture the viewer, making the tragic situation of poverty vivid. To cite just one further example, when the line is spoken about the workhouse as a \\"place of entertainment\\" for those of that class, and the camera focusses on workhouse inmates avidly trying to complete gruelling work, the single shot speaks a volume.The adaptation is tasteful and elegant, and the film may be viewed by those of any age - though new viewers should be cautioned that this is no light-hearted romp (...unlike a few other versions I could mention) but pure Dickens. For literary and artistic merit, few films could match the brilliance of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"Great character acting.This is an example of great writing.Though in B&W,low tech,good actors and a good story trump an anemically thought out story dressed up in a hype of tech.I do not collect DVD's' per se,but this one is a keeper.Has cross generational appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD","review":"While the the product was packaged nicely and I recievedit on time; the dvd was not compatible with my dvd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until when?","review":"2010.... for the David Lean collection!

The push-to-talk button is very awkward and there is usualy a slight delay between the time you press the transmit button and the time you can begin speaking.

They're certainly useful, we know if one of us gets separated from the others they'll be able to radio in and figure out where we are. And for what we use them for, they're just perfect.

Band is a little big for me (my ring finger ring size is 4-1/2, but I am atypical), but it should do well for most other females. Lit dots in dark light are okay but not like a backlight at all, so you might find it not bright enough for your needs. Warning: I played volleyball and one of the pins for the strap flew off, but that was probably my fault since I had swapped out the original band for a leather one; however, I reused the same pins, so I don't know why it didn't hold too well. Well, it is more like a casual diver's watch than something you would wear for volleyball. Overall, if you like the analog look and feel, water resistance, slightly sporty design, functional chronograph--the features of this watch could be the ones you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his other novels...","review":"This is Mr. Grimson's first book and it is rotten. I am sorry to say this because I am a huge Grimson fan (Stainless and Brand New Cherry Flavor are two of the greatest books I have ever read). In this ne'er do well novel, a doctor swallows pills and deals with weird, insane requests from his equally weird, insane patients. It's unmoving and the purpose of the novel is lost on the reader. It lacks all the glamour, sadness, tragedy, and rock'n'roll rebellion of his better writing efforts, Stainless and Brand New Cherry Flavor.

I had all three concerts on VHS and they are about shot. My favorite is the Grace Under Pressure DVD which I have awaited for many years. Exit Stage Left has some excellant performances as well like Xanadu. A Show of Hands is very well produced and the sound on all three is very good considering the time it was recorded. I have seen Rush live five times starting in 1979 and have always enjoyed thier shows. They are a true fan band that performs perfectly live as these DVD's demonstrate. If you like live concerts that are not full of gimicks and filler than these are the shows you need to see. Excellant musicians playing thier hearts out. Most bands could learn a lot from these guys, especially the more modern bands of today's Hollywood type produced bore bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal Band!","review":"I heard my first rush album (2112) in 1979 and have been a fan ever since!

Too much new stuff not enough old stuff.... I wanted to hear some old stuff and how it sounded years after it was recorded. I dont know why they put Tom Sawyer on all 3 discs plus on the bonus CD disc of GUP. Weird, I would rather have heard \\"Red Barchetta\\" or \\"Between the Wheels\\".

The energy and performance of these shows are still contageous and enjoyable to watch and it is good to have these \\"markers\\" of their career.However, other than some nice packaging, menus and the GUP soundtrack, there is nothing new and most disappointingly, no improvement on quality, except for the audio. Could they not have dug up the original masters for a digital transfer that would have imporved the picture quality, especially on ESL?Well, the improved audio mix almost makes up for it. I was content to put it on my laptop and just listen to a very clean mix through my earphones. I hope to hear the 5.1 mix sometime soon.For a really great quality video and audio Rush show, see \\"R30\\" - that is magnificent DVD concert mixing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I have only watched Disk 1 so far (Exit Stage Left) and uh, that is not the audio from that concert, that tour, or EVEN that Decade!! I am a huge fan of Rush, and particularly Neil, being a drummer myself, and I can tell those drums on this audio mix are his newer DW drums, NOT his old Tamas or Ludwigs for that matter. What a crock! I have Exit Stage Left on a VCD, which was dubbed from the old VHS, and yeah.....different audio. I would rather see a VINTAGE show (if you call 81' vintage yet) with it's original sound, not repackaged with the audio of their 02' tour or whatever. Amazing...you would think RUSH wouldn't try to pull one over on us....but it may not have been there call anyway.

I have everything they have done on both CD and DVD. Second, I will say that this set ROCKS!!! OK, the video for \\"Exit...Stage Left\\" is a little grainy, but as others have pointed out the footage is 25 years old and the whole DVD/CD set is priced around $30. Not bad for all these concerts. If you can get over the \\"Exit...Stage Left\\" grainy video, then you will love this set. The other 2 DVD's are AMAZING!!! It is great to finally have all of these in a medium that will last for a long time to come. My suggestion is buy these now and buy them while they are at a low price. They are more than worth the price.

The whole reason I rushed out and purchased this set was because I had watched the laser disc release of \\"Exit Stage Left\\" in the early 80's. Gone was not only the long drum solo I have come to love when listening to the CD release of the concert. Not only that, only a small section of the song was overdubbed by speaking of the band members while unconnected video plays. The \\"YYZ\\" in the credits isn't even the full version. The remainder of songs and DVD's are everything I'd hoped. I enjoyed the 5.1 mix and the visuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean as a whistle","review":"I'll not bother reviewing the content as I've seen these on video a good 1000 times over the years (although I will say I was never much impressed with A Show of Hands - something about reproducing all that technology live was a bit lacking on that video and Ged's voice!) but everything is clean and very well remixed. I'm glad to finally have these on DVD - especially Exit... Stage Left. Some people need to stop pissing and moaning about the lack of \\"Extra's,\\" it's all-extra since it's been out of print for over a decade.

Seven-year-old Marisa is old enough to help out with the wrappings. Little Marisa, however, worries about the shape of her dumplings and feels insecure about how her concoction might not measure up with other dumplings. Marisa's Granny decides to cheer up and encourage her little princess. Granny features Marisa's dumplings as starters at the dinner table on New Year's Day. Dumpling Soup is more than a picture book-it is a celebration of cultures that have rooted in the Hawaiian Islands: Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Hawaiians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book...but bit confused about the recipe at the back","review":"I loved this book for the sweet story and the way it weaves in family relationships through all the steps of cooking dumpling soup to traditionally celebrate New Year's. But the recipe at the end was hard for me to follow - it calls for 1.5 Tbs of sesame oil, and then 3 Tbs of sesame seed oil? I thought they were the same thing so I as a bit confused. Also, in all the versions of this soup that I've eaten and helped to make, I've never had it with chopped chicken floating in the soup.

I just don't find their plots-or lack there of, very interesting. The Long Winter is my least favorite-I found it as boring and long as the Winter it describes. I am surprised of all the Little House books, this one made the top 100 Children's Novels on Student Library Journal.While this one is a little more heart-wrenching (seeing Pa start to break down, people freezing), there is still lack of plot development and it drags.Many children seem to like these books and find them interesting, though, They are just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"by Samantha","review":"The Long Winter is a book you'll start and just can't stop.

I'm glad I didn't buy it. I have read the book several times, and it is a great book. As a native Minnesotan, I can verify the authenticity of it's descriptions of winter. However, the Ingalls family were of Norwegian descent and orginally from Minnesota. Despite stereotypes of pioneers from the TV show, the Ingalls would have had Midwestern accents. I really do not want to hear this book read with the flat prairie twang of the far west. Furthermore, Cherry Jones may be a good actress, but her reading is pure literary sing-song, the kind that makes you stop listening to the meaning of the words after about 3 minutes.

I love survival stories, and this is easily one of the more grueling ones I've read, even as an adult. A whole town starving and freezing, and freezing and starving. Apart from one act of courage (and luck), there's not much to take away from this tale except that freezing and starving is a hard way to go, and that the social safety nets that we take for granted are relatively recent creations. A good lesson in perspective, perhaps, but one more appropriate for older kids (say, junior high) than younger grade schoolers.Read it to your kids as punishment the next time they complain about how hard they have it.

I've tried to get past it, but it sort of starts to grate on you. And when she tries to do Carrie's voice, or the girls laughing, it is like nails on a chalk board. And oh, when she tries to sing Pa's songs with the fiddle I have to turn it off. She hits the notes and is in tune, but the texture of her voice is infuriating.

Once it overflows, it is impossible to clean the coffee and grinds out because the drip basket is not removable.Yes, the coffee does stay hot for a long time, however another major design flaw is the fact that you can't get your hand inside the carafe to clean it, and over time, residue builds up, a film forms and the coffee then smells and taste burnt.

And not pleasantly surprised. Everything about it indicated that this was not the same quality Cuisinart that I had come to expect. It was flimsy, the filter holder did not line up when shut, and it took several attempts to get the lid to align properly on the carafe. But it was a Cuisinart after all so I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately my first impressions held true. After three uses, the spring mechanism in the filter holder came apart. Also, pouring coffee out of the carafe is a time consuming activity - the coffee dribbles out when set to \\"pour\\". When the carafe is almost empty, the coffee splashes out, making a mess if you are not ready for it. At twice the cost of several other insulated carafe models, it is time for me to try another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pain relieving patches that actually work","review":"I have been using these patches for over ten years.

Wife dropped the first one and broke the latch - a very important piece. Only two drawbacks we have found is that once the bottom sheet is placed on the cooker, it is very hard to figure out exactly where to put the stuffing. Edges are not a good place and it is hard to find the dips in the 6 triangles. Also takes a while to heat up the first time, but after that it is a rapid turn around. Remember to keep the drip pan under the spout. Cleans up easy and stores vertical so very little cupboard space. This new one has a slightly looser latch, so even with a bit of extra stuffing, the system closes to seal the Quesadillas. I recommend this unit highly. Was quite a bit cheaper on Amazon than at 3 local stores (and no I don't work for them ((:-)> ) and I got it during a free shipping gig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a lazy person. lol","review":"I've had this for couple years now.It works perfect with the costco bought tortillas.

After 2 years the tephlon on the plates began to really flake and stick to my quesadillas! I bought the Cruisinart Griddler to replace this product.

I had tried making quesadillas on a griddle and lost some of the filling trying to flip them, so this is much easier. If you put too much filling in, you won't be able to close it completely, but it only takes one or two tries to get it just right.

The tomatos and salsa leak and leave a not too bad mess. If you use velvetta instead of small amounts of real cheese, then the tomatos and cheese combine to make one giant mess.

There's a latch that helps clamp the top part of this clamshell device to the bottom part. It is made out of cheap plastic. It broke very easily within the first 3 times I used the device. Now, the only way to clamp the top part to the bottom part is to use a clamp I bought from the hardware store. Without this clamp, the quesadillas will not cook properly.

On the plus side, it cooks nicely and cleans up easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Seems a little ridiculous to own something like this when a pan works fine.

I have seen several that come out of the box with the outside edge of the deck out of parallel to the blade. This problem makes it impossible to use a BCI cut guide or to simply hold the edge of the saw to a speed square for quick, precision cuts. If you buy one, take your framing square to the store with you and make sure that the blade and the edge of the deck are on the same plane.

There is absolutely nothing original about them, and this album reads like a paint-by-numbers effort thrown together by a band that can't play. Warrant took the cheese factor to a nauseating extreme. Some of the lyrics in clunkers like \\"Love in Stereo\\" or \\"You're the Only Hell Your Mama Ever Raised\\" rank as some of the most juvenile ever, making Spinal Tap's \\"Big Bottom\\" seem intellectually stimulating. (Those who've seen \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" know what I'm talking about).

Low and behold I was so worked up about Cherry Pie that I missed what this album was actually about. Song after song I found greatness in. The stand out tracks are Uncle Tom's Cabin- a good story based song, I Saw Red- a great ballad, Song and Dance Man- a great rocker, and Mr. Rainmaker- a great song that reminds me of what a good girl can do in world that seems to constantly rain on us.I wish that Jani and the Down Boys would pull themselves together.

There were some interesting and familiar aspects to it, but overall the writing was rather flat. It was dull and repetitive, and there was no sense that the author really tried to perk up his prose.

A Yeti is captured after a cave in that kills his mate and cub, and gets shipped back to the good 'ol USA for exhibition. Amusingly, things get held up at customs by immigration when it can't be determined wether Yeti is man or beast. The creature escapes to the sewers of Los Angeles, occasionally popping out of a manhole to kill or terrify someone. Wouldn't you be agitated if your family was murdered and you were kidnapped, held in a refrigerator, and dumped in a strange city? Pity the Yeti, children, pity the Yeti.

The rest of the characters were just as bad.There was absolutely no foreshadowing of any of the events.

Once again, this is not a professional level mic and one should not expect that level of performance from it, BUT, it is a whole heck of a lot better than using your camera's onboard mic."},{"rating":"1","title":"hiss and all","review":"I purchased this mic expecting it to be low noise and good pick up. But when I used it, it was horrible. The noise was extremely noticeable and the range of picking sound was bad also. I used a preamp with this and nothing better. I raised volume and it increased in noise. Unless your camcorder has a horrible mic, don't spend money on this one since my pv-gs12 camcorder has a mic with the same noise as this one!!and the movie I'm making is called \\"Aspire\\" its a musical starring Marilu Bustamante and directed by Alphonso Sanchez. Since its musical it really needs good quality audio. Yet if you're making a movie and can't aford a good shotgun mic, simply redub all the audio and use a condenser mic. Its worth the work instead of audio noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk - Doesn't Work","review":"Mine was dead right out of the box. The battery installation is very stupid. Poorly engineered, but even after I did that, there was a lot of buzzing and hissing, but no actual audio output. Azden is a low-end company that makes trash. Buy the real thing. It's worth the extra cash. I have been a professional videographer all of my life, so I know what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I was pleased that Ea sports finally decided to release rugby in the USA. However if you are expecting the allround excellence of Madden 2001 you will be disappointed. it seems like they just chucked it together in a rush. The graphics are poor, every player is the same size,compare this to Madden where the players are indiduals and have a resemblance to the guy. There is no sidestep button, and the players do not have name/number icons, so you never know who has the ball. This is a major fault, would you want the hooker kicking the ball upfield? or a prop making a long pass from scrum half?? This is a major weakness. I'm just very disappointed that the guys that brought us an amazing comparable game like madden on PS2, could also bring us a game that looks like it shouls be a sega game from 1991!! oh dear."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is AWESOME!","review":"As a fellow rugger, this game is awesome.

I was excited when I saw this game, but am very disappointed by the performance. The camera angles make it very difficult to tell when you have the ball. One second you're running back on defense and the next you have the ball and are running backward. The graphics are very poor, not anywhere near PS2 quality. More control of how the backline is set up and being able to reposition players waiting for the kick off would be handy.On the other hand my son who has never played rugby loves the game.I echo the advice of the people who say rent this game, unfortunately it appears to have disappeared from rental places and toy stores alike.

The price is reasonable for the quality and quantity and the nutritional value is good.

To use them just take one picture with the card in it and shoot the rest of your pictures useing the same white ballance and color settings in the camera. load the picture with the card into your favorite editing program and equalize the RGB levels, use LEVELS in photoshop, for the white and the black. do the grey last as you will probbably need to match it useing color curves instead of levels (or else you'll change your white and black settings at the same time). save the color corrections (or remember them) and apply them to all subsequent photographs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made of thin paper - easily damaged - got wet - worthless","review":"I was disappointed with these - you can't tell how light and thin they are from the photos.

He brings a new and unexpected phrasing to \\"Aguas de Marco.\\" He is at his most playful on \\"Eu Quero um Samba\\". And three tunes virtually do away with words altogether--\\"Undiu\\" finds him hypnotically chanting the title word, \\"Valsa\\" finds him humming a lullaby to his daughter, and an astonishing instrumental version of \\"Na Baixa do Sapateiro\\" finds him at his most dexterous on the guitar.

It's an electronic trivia game where 6 contestants hold small remote controls which signal the main hand-held unit when a button is pressed. The biggest problem is the questions (which appear on the main unit) are far too easy. This is supposed to be for adults, but the questions are more appropriate for children. My second complaint is that the main hand-held unit must be passed around and manipulated by contestants who are already holding and manipulating remote controls. Great idea - poor execution. \\"Cranium\\" is a much better electronics trivia type game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best game I've played","review":"This game has the potential of being great but at this time it lacks a few features that could make it much better. First off, when someone clicks their remote to buzz in, if they get the answer incorrect, the question is over and it goes to the next question. There is no ramification for getting the answer wrong so someone could just buzz in first every time and not get any points taken away from them, nor do the other players get a shot at the answer. I think that other players should be able to guess after someone has answered incorrectly and a point should be automatically deducted for a wrong answer to discourage people from buzzing in when they do not know the answer. Also, the music and the voice instruction seem to be of a quality from electronic games years ago. I think I was expecting a little more from this game than I received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great couples game!","review":"We played this with five other couples and had a great time!

The group's sound is other-worldly, and the close, weaving harmonies will give you tingles all over. I only gave \\"Winter Songs\\" 4 stars because at times Anuna's sound is thin and lacking in its usual strength and warmth. But its signature sound really shines on \\"Away in a Manger,\\" \\"Silent Night,\\" \\"Riu Riu,\\" and \\"Ther Is No Ros.\\" Slide this CD into your player and immerse yourself in a talent like no other."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Invitation to Voyeuristic Readers","review":"This book has the attraction of a car wreck. Ooh, look, somebody's worse off than me!It's interesting in a time-passing way, but the evidently low priority it occupied in the author's and publisher's minds is evidenced by several howling bloopers, of which the worst is on page 187 of the hardbound version, where pathetic proofreading produces the sentence,\\"A death row psychiatrist's allegiance is torn between Hypocrites and the state.\\" Umm, really? How about Hippocrates?If you can get the book free and wish a pastime of creepy head cases, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author is Guilty of being Delusional","review":"I had the misfortune to waste several hours reading this tripe and would have to put it down, shake my head, and marvel at how naive a \\"trained professional\\" could be. I am a criminal defense attorney and have become a pretty good detector as to when I am being conned. Dr. Lewis fails to possess this quality and actually manages to feel compassion for someone like Ted Bundy and many other cold-blooded killers that she profiles. Sure, a crummy home life can scar you for life, but there are plenty of people who had crummy lives as children and have managed to live their lives without harming anyone - much less brutally murdering someone. Give me a break - some people just come out of the box broken and the only way to \\"fix\\" them is to remove them from society...permanently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money","review":"This has to be the worst book I have read in a very long time.

We geteverybody's name whether they matter to the narrativeor not: e.g. the author's children. They are Gillian andEric and who could give less of a damn? She recountsan interview with a murderer from \\"...the Deep South\\" andthen has to go to the \\"Deep South\\" for the interview. Thekiller's words are rendered in a kind of Dogpatchese (\\"I'd\\"is spelled \\"Ah'd\\" and so on) that the author seems tofind amusing. We don't. But it typifies the odd, abruptand off-putting shifts of tone that fatally undermine thewhole enterprise, bringing it perilously close to drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Reviews that I read rated this book very highly. I expected to read about agressive adolescents journey into homicidal adults and what we, as a society, can do to help these children and prevent the tragedy of a wasted life. Instead, the author \\"boasts\\" that she is the last woman to kiss a convicted murderer who was a known necrophiliac (Ted Bundy). The first 102 pages deal more with the author and her gastrointestinal problems, her commute from New Haven, CT to New York City, and to be sure and always have a Snickers bar with you. The author does not even begin to discuss the subject of the book until the 102nd page of the book. The book has 332 pages (paperback). If you are expecting insights into the world of troubled adolescents, let alone the mind of death row inmates, you will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought-provoking thriller","review":"A non-fiction collection of violent murder cases in which the author-psychiatrist was involved in assessing the sanity of the killers.

They also work great between cars if you are on a long trip with multiple cars.The only warning is that even though they are extremely sturdy, just don't get them wet! They are not good for fishing or canoeing trips, or anywhere else where they are likely to be exposed to water. If splashed heavily with water, or, heaven forbid, submerged, they will malfunction and become useless. Unfortunately this happened to me.

Nice features like a backlit display lets you see the display in the dark and lock alows you to prevent accedental channel changes.

We used them to communicate between the cars on the road trip to the river, as well as passing through the locks on the river (used to communicate between the helm, aft, and stern of this large houseboat), and to stay in touch with any crew who heading into town to shop when we docked. We had also taken a small boat to use to check the depths at the sandbars before landing for the night, and these radios allowed us to stay in touch with them the whole time. We found these radios to be a great help, and I don't think we would consider going again without them. We had no problems at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Family Fun","review":"We purchased a pair of the Motorola TalkAbout 250 a year ago for my son's birthday since we had a family trip planned to Disney.

We would definitely purchase the TalkAbout 250 as a gift for other family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorola TalkAbout 250 2-way radio","review":"Great product for use in my industry of running cabling in homes. The sound is clear, and finding an available channel is not a problem. I have two problems with the units however, that prevent me from giving it five stars. The location of the talk button is obviously an issue, the other is the design of the volume control knob. It is larger that it needs to be, and located on the upper corner, and it is too easily snagged on things. I have had to replace or repair the volume control knobs frequently. It should possibly be located to the side, with only enough of the dial exposed to adjust the volume.Great quality everywhere else however.

Through heavy woods, the range dropped to about a half mile. Range is more than adequate for most uses.The radios are great for team shopping in large stores.

The opening and closing essays, however, are true gems. In the opening essay, Sir Michael Howard reflects on just what it means to draw lessons from history; in the process, he goes beyond the stale and cliche-ridden stuff that most historians generate when asked to reflect on the question. In particular, readers should ponder Howard's enlightening juxtaposition of the mindset of the military historian, who focuses on the uniqueness of past events and their differences from the present, with the mindset of the military strategist or tactician, who wants to know the past so that he or she can apply historical knowledge to the present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch!","review":"Ordered 13 sets of (12) as advertised... received 13 individual pens.

The main character, David, is so shallow and dim, it was very difficult to muster any compassion for his struggles. The writing style was hard to read as well. The author uses a lot of short choppy sentences which made me feel like I was reading a telegraph! It was really depressing to think that a human could actually exist in the main character's condition; there was no depth to this man (or anyone other character in the book for that matter)!

Mebus' world, however, comes as a breath of fresh air with its very real look into a group of New York friends. These are relationships I recognize. And when Annie and David are sitting on the stoop at the end, looking to the future with only their friendship as a certainty, I was right there with them.

The best scenes are the ones that open the book. Unfortunately, as the story goes on the main character and his puppet show become first tiresome, then irritating. The women especially are just cardboard figures and you wind up not caring who the guy hooks up with. Also the book starts to seem like an endless slog. I have to admit, I finally gave up about two thirds of the way through it. In the end, there just isn't enough wit to sustain an entire book.

Don't be fooled by whatever award this book won. If you're a literature fan and value insight and meaning in a book, you'll be highly disappointed. Fiction? Yes. Literature?

The book slowly unfolds and has the unexpected twists you get in mysteries and at the end you are still puzzling - it isn't so neat in fact like a good movie it makes you want to go out and discuss it with others. The reviews here make me think the people who are reading it prefer action novels and would be the last people I'd like to discuss this book with.But I really loved it.

The image of Lake Geneva in the fall is so vivid. This book reminded me so much of Virginia Wolf's \\"The Voyage Out\\" both in its language, hotel life and general sense of melancholy.The review of Marzipan on Amazon sums this book best in my view"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it...does it get better?","review":"Ick. Really boring. I was really in the mood to read, and after 10 pages I gave it up. Very flat and airless.Is this one worth being patient about? Might read 'Falling Slowly' instead since that one seems to be a Brookner favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and disappointing","review":"Had just read Altered States, which I loved. Thought, if Hotel du Lac won the Booker Prize, it must be great, right? Wrong. As interesting and entertaining as Altered States was, this book was not--dull people, dull story, all in all, a waste of an afternoon. Luckily, it was a Library book and not a wasted purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and very enjoyable","review":"I really enjoyed this book, which I read in one enjoyable afternoon. The author made me laugh, kept me in suspense, and provoked my thinking. I wrote down numerous quotations to remember later. Two of the main issues the author looks at are: the idea that two people will never be able to create a peaceful existence together, and; the notion that the key to happiness is found in perfect selfishness, renouncing love. Brookner makes a great case for these two ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the Booker Prize Committee thinking?","review":"I looked forward to reading this novel and, having finished it, I can truly say that if Anita Brookner was trying to create an atmosphere of upper class ennui, then she surely accomplished her goal -- unfortunately, this reader was filled with ennui while reading it. I have no idea what competition this book faced to win the Booker Prize, but it must have been an abysmal year in British fiction. I can't imagine where the so-called \\"wit\\" of this novel was, and I couldn't have cared less about its shallow characters. BORING and turgid. I needed to take a shower when I was through with it -- blech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Prose","review":"What a pleasure to read intelligent, descriptive prose with a purpose! Not that I am a prude in any sense of the word, but it is such a relief to read modern fiction that is not filled with harsh language or violence. Anita Brookner's writing is so beautifullly structured: her precise descriptions allow the reader to get lost in the setting and emotions like few modern (dare I say it?) American authors; her vocabulary is precise and challenging. This is a book that should be on any serious readers list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A so-so book about a bourgeois writer.","review":"An english writer of romance novels takes an excursion to a Swiss Hotel in order to \\"settle down\\" after committing an unspeakably embarrassing act back home. The characters of the novel are the people she meets at the hotel. Much is said about clothing, manners, and other bourgeois topics. Each character, except for our mediating exiled main character, is essentially a flat character that promotes a certain way of life - one a free-lover, another a chronic shopper, etc. This book about ideas is mildly interesting, but fails to achieve a structural beauty which, in my mind, makes a great book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"I don't get it. I know I'm behind the times, but as I was traveling through Morocco I found an old copy of Hotel du Lac and paid about 20 Dirhams (about $2.25). I was robbed! Not only does nothing happen in this \\"book\\", but I got nothing out of it at all. Was 1984 such a bad year for the Booker Prize folks that THIS won???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotion seethes beneath the surface of this quiet novel","review":"British author Anita Brookner poses many difficult questions in Hotel du Lac, not the least of which is what, really, can women expect to achieve in this world? This novel, which won the Booker in 1984, like her others, has a main character who is sensitive and solitary - not the stuff of which an adventure tale could be told. But at the book's end, a lot has happened. Her family fears Edith, a 39yo romance novelist, is headed for a nervous breakdown when she stands up her fiancé on their wedding day. They send her to Switzerland, where she spends her days working on her next book, observing other guests at the hotel on the lake, and communing with her married lover.Doesn't sound like much, does it? Suspend your disbelief and read it. It's excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder why doughnuts are bad for you!","review":"You can tell why the world is in the shape that it's in, from the attitudes and accounts of it's people.If we turn to the \\"arts\\" to improve our out-look on life, then as any nutritionist will tell you, avoid doughnuts! Likewise, avoid this blaphemous debacle of God, The Catholic Church, life and education.There is certainly a lot of trash that targets the \\"good\\" things in life, and this deserves to be on the bottom of the heap.The author displays a lot of pent-up frustration, but to attack God, the church and to bug a confessional, that just \\"scrapes the bottom.\\"I only wish that I could have given this trash a ZERO rating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful and powerful story","review":"Is there a place for you? If you think you can judge, can you be judged? Do you think a doubter can believe? If you fit into any of these categories, you have got to read this book.Its a story of a young high school senior guy, who's trying to be cool and earn a reputation. Somewhere between peer pressure, reaching for the brass ring, getting laid and dealing with God, the story's main character goes through a whirlwind of troubles, changes and successes.Its a fast moving, fun read that will keep you guessing and occasionally rooting for trouble.This is a great book for those who have had trouble believing in God, or for that matter, anything substantial. Its also a story of hope and conviction.Its a little on the steamy side and because of that I couldn't give it a five. But its a real strong four!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out, here's one with potential","review":"Without getting too involved about who I am, let's just say that my job gives me daily access to celebs and stars. I'm able to find out about things in advance of most, and know that there is a lot of talk about this book.I couldn't find the time to read it and when I finally did, I couldn't stop. The content of this book provides non-stop laughter, tears and emotional swings. It's thought provoking and from a religious aspect, has quite a soul!This book is therapy! Its a test!It takes you places and allows you to become part of it! It challenges you and tempts your morals. It allows some to take a glimps into the future, while it takes others back to simpler days from their past.This is a book that you'll pick up once every couple of years to center yourself and to smile.You want to feel good, then read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To good to be true","review":"Give me a break, nobody ever went through the things that this guy did during high school. There's too much death, too much fantasy and too much crap to believe in these pages.So that makes this story too good to be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Doughnuts","review":"When an author trys too hard for either laughs or over emotional responses from his readers, you usually get a book that lacks direction. This book falls into that catagory.I'll admit that it had some moments, but in general its a gringing book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat donuts and get fat, read donuts and drop IQ points","review":"You know why books that are not published from major houses fail, because they were not any good from the start. Such is the case with this book.The writing is mediocre at best, the story is flat and the language is childish. I felt like I lost 25 IQ points just by opening this up.Let me save you some time, girl problems, blame somebody else. Social problems, blame everybody else. Problems with life, blame God. I have a better name for this book than it's title. It should have been called the Blame Game.Just read the first page, \\"F\\" this, \\"F\\" that and \\"F\\" God. Well Mr. Szekely, \\"F\\" you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"Yes, I agree that this was good from cover to cover, but I wouldn't, as some of my fellow book club members say, that it was \\"great.\\" It had it's moments, but it spoofs \\"American Pie\\" and others that focus on the high school experience.Granted that there was more in the way of substance and storyline with this book, but it's sexual exploits and religious tauntings take it way over the top.A decent amount of laughs, some tears, but it was hardly what some of the other reviews indicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good treat","review":"I really thought that this was an emotionally charged book from cover to cover. It also has an incredible way of making you part of the story, more than just an observer.Granted, there are some events that will leave you scratching your head in doubt, but it has a gripping way of making you want more. This is a very hard book for you to put down after you first start it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"I can't help think that reading this book was a lot like listening to a Dennis Miller or Bill Mahar comedy act. The writer is sarcastic and flippant, much like the two comedians. The stories and situations were entertaining, but it was the style of writing that made this book enjoyable. Again, much like the listed talents, anyone can tell a story, but its how its sold that makes it either just words on paper, or a moving experience. This book will defintely move you."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waist your money","review":"This print is of the poorest quality. The picture they show as a preview of what you're buying is 100 times better than the print that will show up at your door.

Don't waist your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true gem","review":"Rare is the book that significantly alters my framework for thinking on a topic. This was such a book.Much of conventional (or, perhaps, lay) development economics wisdom is done away with by Anderson's analysis. He effectively argues, for example, that developing countries should NOT to try to privatize state monopolies into widely held, publicly traded companies (though privatize in other ways, they should). Similarly, Anderson shows that a regulated banking sector, far from being a goal for developing countries, far more often opens the door to giant, government-guided Ponzi schemes.Read the book to understand his compelling arguments. I came away from this well written, accessible work even more convinced that the best policy for developing markets is for paternalistic governments to \\"just get out of the way.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I think that this is a great book because I wrote it.

It puts into words so many feelings that artists across the world are borned with. It is delightful reading, the way only Kundera makes possible! This novel will wrap you, touch your heart and surprise you with its unexpected conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"As flawed as Kundera can be.","review":"I feel like a fool admitting it but I must...Life is Elsewhere although deeply interesting was not deeply satisfying. Kundera does not quite pull off his ideas in his usual breathtaking manner, I mean it is almost there but it is the almost that rips my heart out because it lets me feel like all those philistines I know who disdain Kundera for his arrogance and pompousity. So because I respect Milan too much I refrain from rereading this work which is something I cannot say about every other title of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Inspiration...","review":"Loved it, just an amazing book, the style of Milan Kundera is just fantastic. Very well delivered to the reader, combines wittness, humor, seriousness, and most of all reality with the humans' nature way of thinking, jeaulosy, imagination and the continuous discovering of one self from childhood to death...Jaromil the poet (Kundera' favorite character) finds himself struggling with his mothers' obsession in directing his life, in his uncertainty of his painting, poetry, his manhood, and his security and trust with the opposite sex...Jaromil, Xavier, the redheaded girlfriend, each ones role and influence is totally inspiring and contemplative...The simplicty in the philosphy created by Kundera and the reality of the story makes the book a master piece to keep, and the ending of the story is the best part of the book by far..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your time elsewhere.","review":"I bought the book after reading the 1st chapter where \\"the Poet is conceived\\". Unfortunately, it was downhill from there.This book tired me out so much with the way it rambled on and on. It seemed far too self righteousness and preachy; it was almost pretentious. It was also difficult to empathize with it's main character who was a pathetic, untalented, mama's boy poet.Having read and enjoyed a few other Kundera books, I really tried to give this a chance. It was a struggle to finish it. If you don't like ending up hating the protagonist, your time is better spent reading something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother Ink Cartridge","review":"No problem with this order - arrived in good condition and in a reasonable period of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"Brother LC41M Magenta Ink CartridgeDeceptive!

A very consistent record, seeing as he works with his production partner \\"Chase\\" for most of the record. Unfortunately, alot of the record is far too monotonous to be fully appreciated. His decision to perform his own BGV's for most of the record really hurts him, esp on \\"Can't See Us\\", \\"Still Preachin'\\", \\"Rhyme Skillz\\" and worst case on \\"Our History\\". Though a few West Coast classics are delivered - \\"Dippin\\", \\"Pop ya collar\\" and \\"Welcome to California\\". His decision to work with KRS-1 on the title cut is no doubt the low point on the record. The cut \\"Our History\\" gives props to christian rap's elders (Steven Wiley, SFC, PID, JC crew, D-Boy, IDOL King etc).

I quickly went out to purchase \\"Gospel Boogie\\" for my wife since she was high on the Bone. I listened to it on my way home and it was horrible! It was a lot of rap and little gospel.

This is an excellent introduction into the Vietnam War. The book does focus on the politics and policies of the United States rather than more palatable topics such as the human stories of the war. The book gives a firm background into the years preceding American involvment in Vietnam. The first edition needed the perspective of communist sources to make it a more well rounded work, but of course at the time that was near impossible. A good book for anyone interested in a general history of the Vietnam war."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to look at the big picture...","review":"This is a well crafted overview of the major events of the Vietnam War.

A set of now classic tales of time travel. Anderson was a prolific writer, and had several series of stories. But the Time Patrol remains one of my favourite. Even though the first story was written some 50 years ago, it and its successors are still fresh. With a crisp, clean narrative style and a compelling storyline that Anderson was able to flesh out. The stories have never gone out of print for long. Attesting to their enduring popularity.Perhaps one reason for which is due to the wide appeal of well posed time travel plots. These let the reader vicariously partake of an extended longevity, that can span millennia.Sadly, Anderson himself was all too mortal. He died a few years ago.

Amazon just reminded me about reviewing! This stand is great. Figuring your best way to mount your specific saw to it in the fashion that will suit you the best is your task. I mounted my 10\\" Hitachi Sliding Dual Compound saw on a piece of plywood and then to the mounts that came with this stand. I can use the saw on the floor by itself if I want to or quickly mount to the stand.I do think the wheel design could be a bit better but I just carry it over to where I'm going to work anyway! It's light enough to do that but sets up very sturdy with adjustment on one leg for out-of-level situations.Also has a repetitive cut stop but won't work for all applications of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice stand - very bad instructions","review":"I like the stand - it supports my saw nicely. But setting it up was a bear. The directions are very badly written. I don't think the person that wrote them ever tried to put one of these together. Just use your common sense and you will get through it. Over all I think the stand is very nice to have and I would buy it again. It really helps out on the job site. Also it is a little on the heavy side but one man can carry it if needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Stand","review":"I think they've listened to everyone about the assembly problems. It now comes assembled except for the saw mount section. But the instructions for what's left are totally incoherent. If you have an outhouse you'll know what to do with them. A good picture is your best bet and then it goes pretty well. As noted by others it is important to balance the saw. I centered the saw fence front with the center of the stand and that worked well; you can fine tune from there if you wish. Aligning the fence parallel with the stand is not easy. My Bosch 5412 has extention bars so I aligned with them using a straight edge and that worked, you can fine tune from there if necessary.When UPS delivered this the box fell completely apart and scattered everything on my porch. I think that's the norm, not the exception. I'd give this 4 stars if TracRac was capable of writing an instruction manual and providing a decent box, and it comes with Bosch's name on it so they are culpable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money or the effort - even if you're lazy or new","review":"I am both lazy and new to woodworking, and I'm already planning on replacing this thing. I am a big fan of Bosch stuff - it typically just has a neat feel to it that lets you know they put a lot of thought into the usability of their products.In this case, as other readers have mentioned, this thing was a pain in the neck to put together. In the end it is flimsy and the adjustments lack the ingenuity and refinement I expect from Bosch. You are without a doubt better off throwing something together with a sturdy base and cleverly configured stops.If you really need something like this for portability (outdoors or on-site), you might be better off with a sturdier multi-purpose stand and repeatable cutting jig. This thing just does not make the grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be OK.","review":"I bought this stand because I already had the Bosch saw and I read that none of the other stands fit it as well.Haven't used it yet but I can't see any reason it will not perform admirably, sturdy, good adjustments, easy storage and removal of saw.I will say this though, the assembly instructions are terrible. Hardly any explanation, just poor line drawings by which you have to figure out what goes where. The parts were all there but the parts list didn't jive with the actual stuff.

Stand itself comes assembled, but the extentions and stops require quite a bit of assembly. Allow maybe an hour. But when you're finished you'll have something to be proud of indeed. Beautiful craftsmanship and materials make this a solid piece of eye candy for the technically inclined. Extremely stable and strong, I have no reason to doubt the claimed 500# capacity. Just well thought out, except for the wheels. Why won't anyone make a stand with larger wheels? The now discontinued Delta and the HD stand are the only ones I've seen with the larger, more functional wheels. The small wheels work fine if you're moving around inside a house, but at some point you're going to want to leave and rolling this thing out to your truck with 4\\" wheels isn't going to be easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for the U.

Their only differences appeared to be how much gold to leech out of the U.S. to start the agency, $5 billion or $25 billion! These agencies operate without restriction, the employees ride high wide and handsome, travelling at whim in a manner no U.S. employee would be free to do, while the record shows 70% of the projects undertaken end in failure.

This story could maybe have worked at about half the length, but with all of the padding, I was beginning to wish that something would fall on the main character's head and get it over with.There are approximately thirty reminders through the book that Jantzen used to be a cop. The author is only slightly subtler--the equivalent of getting bludgeoned with a Wiffle bat instead of a baseball bat--is that SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED IN THE PAST TO HIS FAMILY.Jantzen is a self-absorbed man (another thing you hear again and again) and, because of this, isn't a very sympathetic character. This isn't necessarily a bad thing if the character changes or grows through the course of adventures. Jantzen doesn't. He's still a self-absorbed man at the (very abrupt) end.Usually, when I finish a book, I lend or give it to a friend or the local library.

Maybe Schmidt should have titled it as such.I don't like animals being hurt or killed, even in stories, but even that didn't make me hate this cult more than the main character. However, the cult was corny! They chanted the usual stuff, and all the Satanic and evil symbols were thrown around haphazardly. Black circles, inverted pentagrams and crosses, black candles, and body parts are just put together without rhyme or reason. And I never exactly understood the bald-headed leader with the black eyes; was he human, possessed, or what?This story might have been better had the main character drank himself to death in the very beginning and let someone else be the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"ughh, what is this?","review":"When people whine and moan about In Flames new stuff, this song instantly comes to mind.Not only does it sound popish, with keyboards and whatnots, but it is absolutely unlike anything In Flames have done.

You can play a complete game or two before your toddler loses interest. The game requires matching abilities but you can focus just on color or expand to learn counting.

I have a call in for repair of these problems.What cannot be repaired is the poor design, no doubt to keep the cost relatively low: 1. no rear S-Video jack (just one in the side panel). 2. not magnetically shielded (my receiver on the shelf above was turning the top of the picture green). 3. seperate buttons on remote for vid1/vid2/s-vid/ant & component1/2/vid1/2. 4. no dvi input. 5. no picture-in-picture.I was going to get the Sony KV-30HS510 but thought I'd save some money with the Samsung; Forgive me Sony, you are clearly worth the extra $500.

In fact, one will recognize a lot of exercises from Suhalia's and Rachel's films, but this video takes some of the best bits and fits them altogether for a challenging, but not overwhelming workout, one that works out the whole body, but is easily broken down when you just wanna work, say, your torso. Furthermore, Sharon places more emphasis on the using the back and shoulder muscles, and gives a few new (to me, at least) techniques for 'pop' moves. I would recommend this with the first Rachel Brice video (the practice companion, I haven't seen the new one yet), then try out Suhalia's buns workout (very, very challenging.) Kudos to Sharon for making sure to demonstrate moves from multiple angles so we can see the weird muscle contractions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"If you don't expect much out of this tripod, it might work for you. The head basically doesn't allow for any positioning of the camera.

Since I can't really point the camera on the tripod, it's useless for macro work.

The plastic wrapping was torn at the top and side, giving me the impression that someone previously opened and returned it. After further inspection, half of the DVD's are either scratched or have smudges on them. Additionally, the audio on one of the DVDs I tested was out of sync with the video. This is probably the result of \\"bootlegged\\" or bad DVD burning, which is further evidenced by the store bought DVD-Rs that were used to burn the content on to.In conclusion, I imagine that the lessons on these DVD's were probably good.

I suspect those reviews were written by the author and his friends in order to boost sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have book for short-term traders","review":"I have found this book to be a must have manual for anyone doing short-term trading. Everything is well presented, and well thought out. It is a great manual on technical analysis, and trading disciplines. Even if you have been trading for quite some time, you will find this as a great refresher and reminder of the discipline that a sucessful trader must possess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to start with","review":"I found this book to be of great value to traders who want to learn simple technical analysis and level II strategies. I like the KISS methodoligy the author uses in the book. The only thing I did not understand was the intraday scanning strategies which I have become very interested in. I should also mention that the webpage the author refers to for the overnight scas does not exist anymore. I did e mail him, and his staff sent me an updated link though . Overall it is a great book for beginners and maybe even intermidiate traders. If you are savy in TA and Level II order entery than you might want to pass on this one. My only complaint is that I would have liked to see more case studies like the one he has at the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Book But Price Is Way Out of Line","review":"This book certainly has some helpful information which you'll probably find in most any of the good books on trading. But there is no great revelation in this book to the point that it warrants such a high price tag. There are many, many other very good books on trading for half the cost of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"15th Ave.","review":"This new CD is smooth, mellow and funky..A great stress reliever..Perfect for cruising down the highway. Its got these mellow funky grooves that mixes the old school with the new... I love all the songs but special favorites are \\"I Like\\", \\"VIP\\", \\"15th Ave.\\" \\"Out Tonight\\" and a classic!! \\"Caught Up\\".Belinda's got the lyrics,delivery,and arrangements thats Grammy potential. For a so called old school act, Midnight Star has broken the rules..and has not lost a step..This CD's a sleeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midnight Star fans get ready to be disappointed","review":"when I first saw this new CD I couldn't get to listening quick enough. If your looking for the Classic style of dance cuts, the melodic mid tempo movers, or the melting ballads that these guys produced over most of their LPs, even after the departure of calloway brother, then think again!The only track to my mind that is worth any kind of praise, is the title track, but only on the (OLD SCHOOL MIX).Like many, on seeing the name of a band that I grew up enjoying, I was so, so looking forward to at least a touch of that former glory, but no. I know things have moved on over the years, but surely the repetitive dull ballads here are not gonna help sell this CD. Sorry guys!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure to Read","review":"This book was an excellent read and was difficult to put down. Intriguing view of history of the organization as well as many other organizations such as Rotary, Elks, etc. It definitely answered many questions I had regarding Freemasonry and is written in layman terms so those without knowledge of Freemasonry going in can grasp the subject matter fairly easily.As mentioned by at least one other reviewer I did detect a slight bit of bias, but then again every author has some bias based upon experience and beliefs. However, the book provides so many references that I would have difficulty doubting the credibility. The book also provides beautiful illustrations that accent the points in the text.My recommendation is to purchase the hardcover as this book is a beautiful bookshelf reference. Whether you are interested in the organization or just a history buff I highly recommend this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK","review":"As a people who is interested in Freemason staff, I feel happy for this book 'cause it tells much information I want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light on details","review":"Although a handsome book with excellent and interesting photographs,the author makes no attempt whatsoever to enlighten the reader to even the most simple, everyday symbols of the Freemasons. For example, I was able to search the web for 10 minutes and discover more information regarding the beautiful symbolism and history of the Freemasons than I could find in this entire book. I did not expect the author to divulge sacred rites and rituals, but this book was far too watered-down and repetitive to be of interest. From a historical perspective, there are some interesting bits but they are too few and far between."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine addition for all Masonic libraries","review":"Mark Tabbert has done a fine job exploring the evolution of Freemasonry in America and giving us a small glimpse of its possible future. It is obvious that he has great affection for the \\"craft\\" but its very refreshing to see that he has taken the time to respectfully recognize the ties Masonry has had in the development of other fraternal orders and their organizational descendants. There is no mysticism here, only clear documented history and analysis (coupled with outstanding illustrations) which should be of interest to Masons and non-Masons alike who are truly interested in learning more about the world's oldest \\"secret\\" fraternity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A survey of Freemasonry throughout three centuries of American history","review":"Written by an elected Masonic lodge master and the curator of Masonic and fraternal collections at the National Heritage Museum in Lexington, Massachusetts, American Freemasons: Three Centuries Of Building Communities is a survey of Freemasonry throughout three centuries of American history. Tracing Freemasonry from its origins in 17th-century Scotland and England to its role in American history, fluctuations in its membership, and seeking to explain why it has attracted so many men to join it over the course of centuries, American Freemasons draws from an extensive body of research to portray numerous anecdotes of Freemasons helping fellows and others, and explore reasons why some have praised while others have questioned or reviled this organization. Black-and-white and color photographs illustrate this engaging survey, that captures the Freemasoner's point of view in a thoroughly positive light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda Scary, But Fun","review":"Strange mix of tracks, but isn't that what Grace is afterall... delightfully strange. For me the best tracks are \\"I'm Not Perfect\\", \\"Victor\\", \\"Hollywood Liar\\" (especially the part with the frenetic french lyrics)...the other tracks are ok, a bit on the 80's pop-ish side, yeah somewhat cheesy. The gospely track \\"Inside Story\\" just isn't befitting for this put-some-grace-in-your-face dominatrixxx. Grace redeemed? HA! I'm not that gullible. Don't get me wrong, it is a fine track. Just that it is easier for me to picture Ms. Jones with horns and a snarl on her face. I also liked \\"Scary But Fun\\" here Grace pokes some fun when she sings towards the end of the track \\"I'm a little scary...but so much fun\\". That song, by the way, is about taking chances in life so you don't miss out on the good stuff. Heck every Grace Jones fan should get their fangs on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMO her worst album","review":"A couple of years ago I purchased this at an online auction because after having all of her Island albums which are classics, I had to get all of the others.This one stuck out as the only bad album she did, in my opinion.The sound is very thin, very 80s, but mostly the tracks are annoying, very repetitive and what's worst, the sound pretty much the same. The choruses are the parts that stick out as just plain bad, kinda like they started to write the music for the songs by trying to make the melody for them, but they are just bad.Bulletproof heart on the other hand, her other Manhattan album, done 3 years after this one, is a jem of an album, with much more texture, more melody, tunes that sound very different from the others.If you need to get this, don't pay too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she perfect for you??","review":"Grace's rise to fame in the music industry was largely due to two singles\\"Pull Up To The Bumper\\" and \\"Slave To The Rhythm\\".While her albums found their way into an artsy crowd,most of her work was ignored including this one...Inside Story fails to really capture the listener's attention.The opener I'm Not Perfect may've been a sizeable hit but it probably remains the only memorable tune here.Despite having Nile Rogers as producer, the songs lack depth and expression.Hollywood Liar,Victor,Party Girl etc. all sound like b-sides.On White Collar Crime however,she perks up a bit and sings about the rich and the elite \\"getting away with it\\", which makes you want to listen to the words again, briefly.Let's just hope that one day Miss Jones returns with an album that recaptures our attention.After all she does have a good voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good product, very bad price","review":"The product quality is great, but the seller is really taking advantage of the limited distribution of the Stella D'Oro brand due to the ongoing strike. The retail price clearly marked on each package is $2.79, so a case of 12 packages should retail for $33.48 plus shipping. Since the cost of this product is $47.95 plus shipping for a case of 12 packages, make sure you really are desperate for a Stella D'Oro before ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still fails to please","review":"I have never really liked comps as i always have to get up and skip tracks which i dont like and there is usually a few, much as i like some of the bands on this fat comp it still just does'nt work really i mean some tracks are great on it it's just a bit of a let down thats a waste of money considering i bought it for 15 when i should have been 5.

For a mom like me who is not too big into organized religion I've struggled with how to pass along some basic beliefs to my kids. The book is filled with specific ideas and examples that make the process much easier. Just as important, it has helped me think about God and religion in new and positive ways. While the scripts on teaching virtues got alittle tedious for me, the ones on teaching trust in God, learning patience, and saying no to drugs and teen sex look to be of value. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live the Great Elvin Jones!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When Elvin touched the drums, he made works of art.

Belief in Hollow Earth theory is rare, and as the book describes is often found only among mystics and fringe scientists. Mostly it is a fantasy storybook describing strange creatures and inner earth homonids with marvelous, unknown powers. It does, however, discuss the Nazi command's occult belief in hollow earth and their numerous quests to reach it and come in contact with the 'original Aryans.' If you are one who is led to believe in international conspiracies and the like this book will be of interest to you. It presents the best evidence for the reality of hollow earth- nevertheless, that evidence is thin and often anecdotal.

The authors who come to my mind are Edna Ferber and James Michener, who were both more adept than Fast at using the trivial genre of \\"family saga\\" as the basis for a good adventure story. \\"The Immigrants\\" is a skin-deep, boring travelogue of events in the lives of a dull selection of character stereotypes.

It sounds like he was galloping through his two performances, annoyed that he had to re-record them. In addition, the rendition of \\"Body and Soul\\" bears NO resemblence to any recording of that song I've ever heard.Terribly disappointed.

If you have a problem with shipment or delivery, good luck.

The DVD is divided into three parts: The interview with \\"Bobby\\" and \\"Cindy\\", which is fairly interesting (they talk about their remembrances of the variety show, even though Mike Lookinland seems to have blocked much of it out). The other two parts are the first and second BBVH installments. Guest stars include Tony Randall (what was HE thinking????), Vincent Price, Rip Taylor, H.R. Puffnstuff, and Donnie & Marie.The first episode has a truly surreal \\"number\\" featuring a bunch of clowns jumping around in a swimming pool (some of the clowns being Bradys). Very strange and incoherent! This whole Variety Hour concept seems like something Ed Wood had a hand in!

The cast introduces the musical numbers in character (as in, \\"Ladies and Gentleman, our brother Greg\\"). Also, Alice inexplicably wears her blue maid uniform on stage.But the fact that they're supposed to be related occasionally seems to be overlooked. Skits where the brothers are cruising the sisters, and Donny and Marie are playing boyfriend and girlfriend are two examples. However the best is when Greg \\"moves out\\", and he and Carol sing a lovelorn duet to each other. Remember, they're mother and son, people!

Poor Robert Reed...as if he didn't hate playing Mike Brady enough, he was turned into a song-and-dance man for this show and he was anything but. At one point, you actually see him stop dancing and laugh at himself because he was so far off his mark. Another time, you actually see Greg wipe out on a roller rink and the editors completely miss it. It's almost unwatchable, but for those who appreciate great cheese like I do, it's a goldmine!

She's an overlooked performer who brings a female perspective to formerly 'men's songs' - Hallelujah, Let It Be, and her version of River I prefer to the original. She's still young and her voice will mature, but she's a joy to listen to right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"a vital talent","review":"It's refreshing to hear such an authentic voice. Allison Crowe's passion and conviction shines on every song track. Tidings is an one-of-a-kind creation. Though I've heard other artists combine the sacred and the secular, the singular presence of Crowe unifies the whole into something entirely unique and her own. It's simply marvellous. The popular song choices from the Beatles, Stones, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, and Sarah McLachlan are exciting and distinctive. As are the traditional Christmas carols from a yearning Silent Night to a swinging What Child Is This.Allison Crowe's piano style and unmistakeble, emotionally communicative, voice combine to make her a favorite talent. I love this album (played all in order, or on shuffle)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag of efforts?","review":"On some songs, her style and interpretation meld wonderfully. A very alternative version of Hallelujah is both melancholic and refreshing. A job well done on In The Bleak Midwinter, a woefully under-covered song. My other favorite is What Child Is This, perhaps her best piece on the album vocally where she demonstrates her best power with control.Allison has a pure, penetrating, and beautiful voice, one part Jewel, one part Cher, one part Allison. Unfortunately, I think she overdoes some of the vocals, trying to 'Aguilera' up a song a bit much, and some tonal miscues are the result. She gets a little carried away on O Holy Night, trying to simultaneously embellish and go up-tempo, a little too ambitious for her, IMO. River, a Joni Mitchell cover, suffers from chord over-simplification, and the interpretation doesn't really work for me.All in all, not a bad effort, but her rapid vibrato style doesn't fit most of the tunes, save Hallelujah and What Child."},{"rating":"1","title":"big gun poorly aimed","review":"An on-line review recommended Allison Crowe's version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah as the best of the cover versions. It's not. Crowe has a powerful voice and excellent taste in her material, but her approach lacks either sufficient bombast or sufficient subtlety to be comparable with Janis Joplin or Kate McGarrigle. These are plain and predictable readings of good songs and have the sense of a talent being squandered."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new, nothing interesting","review":"I hate to just dismiss an artist as not interesting, but I am surprised to see another reviewer claiming that her voice is both technically stunning but her soul is what is singing.While her voice is technically very good, I wouldn't call it stunning, and I just don't feel the soul in this music.

We love this series because it explains the basic concepts of the Kama Sutra and how to keep the spirituality in lovemaking. The DVD is part workshop, with couples talking about their likes and dislikes, and learning how to better please each other and satisfy each other's needs. The workshops are hosted by Dr. Patti Britton, who is very knowledgeable about the ancient Kama Sutra and very comfortable talking about sex and sex acts. There is good emphasis on setting the atmosphere and putting yourself in a mood to enhance sex. There are also hot, steamy, explicit sex scenes featuring the couples from the workshop. It's great seeing sex addressed as an ancient philosophy as opposed to current society's tendency to present it as sinful or dirty.

How do you sell out ? You alter your sound so it reaches a larger audience . More often than not its a sweeter, less aggressive, radio (or MTV) friendly sound . Its target audience is usually younger and more female . There are actually a few good songs on this - Reckless, Locked In , Out in The Cold and even the title track isnt bad --- that is if your name happens to be Def Leppard or Bon Jovi . I find the song Parental Guidance to be particularly offensive -- \\" We dont want no , no, no no parentel guidance here \\" - If your name happens to be Twisted Sister this song is a work of art , if its Judas Priest ... its a joke . If you do like this album and some of the 80s priest stuff , try getting your hands on Stained Class , Sin After Sin, Sad Wings' and even Hell Bent'--thats the real Priest - dont settle for Priest lite"},{"rating":"1","title":"painful","review":"Cannot recall a more disappointing release by a major band.

So, when JUDAS released TURBO, I think they succumbed to pressure from the record company and had their hairs made and make-up all around. A shame, a thing bands like AC/DC or Iron Maiden never did (the maximum Maiden did was to dress some tight pants!!!). Anyway, I think they knew then what was better for their career and tried to improve upon that.

Trying hard to compete with the prevailing horrible scene of glam-metal and MTV/oriented music, Priest sold out everything they had fought so hard to develop: hard and heavy music, well played solos, different styles of songs (all under the realm of metal).In their place, came puffy hair and make-up, dreaded song titles as \\"HOT FOR LOVE\\" and \\"WILD NIGHTS HOT AND CRAZY DAYS\\", all in an obvious attempt to make America once and for all.

It's almost impossible to conceive that a band that was this influential in the 70's sunk to this all time low.They did regain their composure for the almost comeback Ram It Down, and then the HEAVY Painkiller, before Halford had the good sense to call it a day (the band didn't and got worse)."},{"rating":"1","title":"HÁ!!!

Do not buy this album unless you like Ratt or Krokus or any other mid eighties cheese rock. At least after the next album \\"Ram it Down\\" (which I will not even bother to review because I would have to remember listening to it and that would make me sick!)the band released \\"Painkiller\\" a metal Tour de Force (to coin a sorry cliche')from begining to end.When I saw them live on the Painkiller tour all the \\"Turbo\\" and \\"Ram it Down\\" songs were mysteriously missing from the mind blowing 2 hour set.

Thankfully, the tape did not contain pictures - so it was the videos that brought the full horror into focus.This album was synth drenched pop-syrup, polished to the point of sounding more like Fine Silver than Heavy Metal.I would recommed this album only to die hard Priest fans who would buy any body of their work - irrespective of excrement therein.I have re-purchased all the Preist albums....and I buy the current Priest & Halford catalogues, but I can not bring myself to buying \\"Turbo\\" or \\"Ram It Down.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrrgghhhhhhh","review":"I bought the tape of Turbo the day it came out, as would any other normal Priest fan, I mean, Priest was a promise of quality right?

My mouth dropped open...I fast forwarded...then again...then I placed it carefully back in it's case and chucked it out the window. (True story) If you have never heard Priest before (hard as that is to imagine), I recommend British Steel or Defenders of the faith to any 30-ish guitarists who want to hear how it's done.

I listen to a lot of ambient, non-lyrical music because I think that bad lyrics ruin most otherwise fantastic songs. This song is a perfect example: \\"get me a drink, take away all sorrow...take away my reason\\" and other ridiculously common lines completely distract from the powerful underlying structure of this song. None of the lyrics in any of the rest of the songs are extremely insightful...but they flow and mix with the rest of the music well, and aren't so woefully obvious.

Often it's the guitar taking the mbira part, playing out long meandering repetitious tunes with the vocals droning over the top. The songs easily fall into a timeless groove and play long but never tiresome.The sound may be grounded in the traditional, but the songs are enlivened with electronic arrangements and reggae/pop sensibility. The result is an enjoyable, light, uplifting message of love and hope.

We're glad to have finally found something that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most complete conversion","review":"This device is good for your everyday appliances, perhaps, but when it comes to sophisticated electronics (e.g. cell phones, portable video game systems), this adapter cannot fully transform the voltage and frequency of an Indian power outlet to actually make the device work. I found that this was a problem with older outlets. I had to search throughout an entire house just to find an outlet that would let me use this converter to charge my Nokia cell phone. I couldn't charge my Nintendo DS system at all most likely due to frequency differences or other discrepancies between American and Indian power outlets that this adapter wasn't sophisticated enough to resolve. Particularly since such small and advanced devices are what people usually bring when they travel (i.e. nobody will lug around fans and toasters with them on vacations unless maybe it's a camping trip), this device has proven mostly useless for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for short person","review":"After researching online, this product looked like it would work for my needs. I'm a 5'2\\" approx 115 lb female. And I do all the shoveling at my house. I live on a corner so have approximately 200 feet of sidewalk to shovel. My driveway is about 20 feet wide by 50 feet long. The suncast big scoop helps me get the job done without having to lift and heave lots of snow. As earlier reviewers indicated, the best way to use it is to create a mound at the end point so that the scoop can slide onto that mound before you tip it to empty it. We got 8 inches of snow last week and I got the shoveling done in about 45 min. Good workout of course.I've only used it three times, and I'm hoping it lasts through this winter and a few more to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I don't take time to write many reviews, so for me to write a comment says a lot. I used it in the recent snow storm were we got 6 to 8 inches. The snow was wet and heavy, and I was never more thankful to just push the snow. That is the real beauty of this item. You don't pick up the snow you just push it out of the way, and when the snow at the edge starts to get high you just tilt the blade up and push the blade right over the high snow. It does have a small learning curve, but it is easy to use. I would recommend it to anybody. I am not sure that I went any faster, but I can tell you I felt a thousand times better afterwords than with my traditional shovel."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better products available","review":"One reviewer wrote they wished they had read reviews before buying. I can't believe the favorable responses this product has received. If you are of short stature and you only average a couple of inches of snow, this scoop may get you by. Otherwise, consider other scoops on the market that are much better both in capacity and ergonomics. The following are some examples: the Garant YPSS26 Yukon 27-1/2-Inch (found at Amazon) or the AMES 24IN ERGO POLY SLEIGH SHOVEL (found at Home Depot). Both of these scoops are far superior and will move snow efficiently while saving your back. The handles are adjustable and long enough to give you leverage to dump or slide the scoop over banks when you have to stack snow.One exception for the Suncast scoop is that it's light and small enough to use to clear a flat or shallow-pitched roof. After buying one of the larger scoops, I left my Suncast at camp for just such chores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Only In Principle","review":"Well, it looks good, right? Big wide mouth to gather up the snow. However, there is a reason old fashioned snow shovels were made as they were: you gotta get rid of the snow once the mouth/shovel is full. With the \\"handles\\" on the side of the unit, pitching the snow off of a drive or a sidewalk is awkward at best. I end up pushing as much snow as possible forward, filling the mouth up, and then kicking the back of the shovel to get rid of the snow off of the path. In the meantime, you leave a film of snow behind you, perfect for slipping on and the like, as you can't really dig in with this shovel. Don't waste your bucks, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"tried several specialty products","review":"I tried this product and another type of pusher that had a small wheel under the front edge. The problem with them, is when the snow is heavy or deep you cant (like with some other products) lift or throw the snow to get the piles high enough or off the area you want cleared (so the piles kept creeping out and I had to shovel them into taller piles). So it was ok for a few inches of snow but not great if you have to really move the snow where it is piling up.."},{"rating":"1","title":"For short to average height people","review":"I can't believe I didn't read the reviews before buying. I'm 6'3\\" tall and as other tall people have mentioned, this shovel does not work well for tall people. I had a pan shovel several years ago that worked great. It had a bigger pan, was about 8 to 10 inches wider, had wooden runners on the bottom and the handle was longer and at the right angle. It was about the same width as a sidewalk so one trip was all it took. Because the Suncast shovel is smaller, you have to make more trips up and down a sidewalk and you have to empty it much more often. And if you're taller, you have to bend much further to get it out where you empty it, especially when the snow starts to pile up. I wouldn't recommend this shovel for anyone over about 5'8\\" tall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Effective","review":"I live in southwestern Colorado--ie, we have lots of snow. I already own one Suncast Big Scoop--it's about 11 eleven years old. It works so well at moving LARGE quantities of snow that I'm buying a spare. In terms of manually removing and moving snow, there are two superb products available--the Super Scoop and the Snow Pusher Plus ([...]). I use both and swear by both. If you're not into vehicle plows and snowthrowers, then you can't go wrong with the Super Scoop."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more lifting","review":"You have to \\"learn\\" how to use the unit, but once you get the hang of it, it makes clearing the driveway or street a lot faster and uses a lot less energy. Don't try to lift to get the snow off the shovel, just push it off to the side. Walkways that use to take 30 minutes to clear now takes about 15 minutes with no heavy lifting. Once you get the hang of it, you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - for a 10 yr old","review":"while writing this the only other poor reviews lamented the size. I agree. I am tall, but not a giant, and the handle comes up to mid thigh. Ideally this would be up to waist at least. So who can use it would be those who are much shorter than even average, or kids.

Use it like a sled full of snow and just dump it wherever you need. Can easily clear my 100'X45' driveway in a matter of minutes and no sore back.

February 2011I have been using a big scoop for the past 15 years. This is my 3rd big scoop purchase. But it is my second Suncast scoop. The handle design is alot stronger than my first brand that i bought.This scoop can handle my 65 foot walkway and 2 car driveway.Also able to remove what the snow plow leaves at the end of my driveway with no problem. I grab a big scoop, tilt it back, use it as a sled to where i want to dump it. Usually a snow ramp i make over the snowbank across the street(a Wooded area not the neighbors yard). No lifting involved.Just remember to use Newton's Law of motion to get snow off the shovel.\\"A object in motion stays in motion.\\"WHen emptying the scoop from a brisk pace stop short, and the snow keeps going.

The first storm,The scoop made big snow piles and the 2-stage snowblower was run on the piles:fast and effective. Second storm, the new snowblower broke (stick jam/belt break),and the scoop just had just light shovel assistance. The scoop shifted very heavyplow-drift snow from driveway entrance and in front of the mailbox to the snowbank onthe other side of the street, the way some plows do. Saved literally tons ofback-breaking work. It works your arms+legs a bit, but really saves the back (if youare careful to use it right). It can also shove the top of a snowbank back for you,usually (there are limits). The handle is low, but you would need a high bar and alow bar to make it work better.

It glides on the snow, when you get to your dump site, just twist and turn, or life up and bump with your knee. No more lifting a snow shovel.

There's a shaky camera technique that gets irritating only a little bit during some driving sequences, but overall the production and the director's sensibility are sharp.

Throw in some ignorant tourists along with the mutated children of the family's least-favorite sibling and you have pretty much got the movie right there, and it's been done plenty of times before. They even throw in other cliche parts such as the night-vision camcorder with shaky movement as well as some gratuitous torture scenes and achilles tendon cutting.I literally didnt find a single original part in this movie. I would have given it a single star for blatant \\"plagerism\\" had it not been directed and produced fairly well. You will find this same story line in plenty of other movies, most of which do not need subtitles.

I am ambivalent about Joanna. Surprisingly enough, Paul's turn-around struck me as quite believable.Unfortunately, the ending didn't really work for me. It's almost as if McFadden ran out of steam. By and large the character development is very well done ... until the resolution. We watch the characters change and grow until nearly the end. For some reason, we are not allowed to witness the growth that leads to the conclusion, and I felt cheated as I finished this book.I truly enjoyed her writing style, though, and so I do recommend this book as a good beach read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Done That","review":"While it is well-written, I found it predictable and dull. Anny Tyler's book, \\"Ladder of Years\\" is very similar and has more depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grammatically Well Written, But Stylistically Boring, And an Uninteresting Story","review":"This book suffered from a severe case of overwriting. Too many adjectives and too many characters with too little development and a disjointed perspective.Like its characters, the book suffers from an identity crisis. It can't decide which story to tell so it jumps (in a joltingly obvious manner) from story to story. And, because it started jumping so early in the book, the connective tissue that usually makes a multi-perspective book flow was missing.I read the first half of the book before skipping ahead to the ending.The writing isn't bad, but the storyline was both obvious and schizophrenic. It wasn't a horrible book, but I could have lived having never read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"I enjoyed this, as I am especially fond of Pawleys Island. It is an easy read with a decent story - although the main character is not particularly likeable nor plausible.But the author's comment about Amazon playing games with her (relative to the pink edition of her book) was rather irritating. After all, Amazon is making her book available to the masses - I wouldn't have found her book if not for Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life at Pawleys Island","review":"I especially enjoyed reading this book because I leave in Pawleys Island, SC, the setting for the book.

It definitely leaves very little chalk residue on the equipment, so it is less messy than regular chalk. I found that it was about equally effective as using chalk; had to reapply a few times during the workout. It definitely does puff out a cloud of fine dust when you remove it from the little bag and use it, which ended up on the floor (not ideal). So, I will be putting it in a much larger gallon ziplock bag tomorrow, so that I can apply it to my hands within that bag and keep the dusty mess down. I haven't found that it dries out my hands too much, yet. I guess I will see after several days of use. In summary, I think this is a good solution for gyms that don't like chalk getting everywhere, or don't allow chalk at all. Much cleaner and seems to work just as well as regular chalk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mine is pink.","review":"I didn't order this for rock climbing. I ordered it to take to my gym and what I got was a pink one! Not a huge deal but i would have preferred one like the one in the picture.

I use it for barbell deadlifts, pullups, kettlebells, and dumbbells when I'm in the gym, which is to say, just about every time I'm in the gym. It feels a bit like having a base of anti-perspirant on your hands, in addition to the \\"grip\\" feeling you'll get. It barely leaves any visible residue on the bars, although I do see a bit of it on the rubber-coated weighted plates my gym has, which are black.The \\"ball\\" itself still \\"leaks\\" quite a bit of residue, though, so I store this in a freezer-lock ziplock plastic bag which I reach into when \\"chalking up\\" with this. You can't just keep it in your gym bag \\"as is\\". If you have a rock climbing chalk bag you can keep it in, like a ABC Ultralight Chalk Bag Chalk, that would probably work well too and look less bush-league.I use this 2-3x a week and it's lasted me approximately 18 months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for kettlebells, clubbells","review":"I was looking for a product to help keep my grip sticky when swinging clubbells and kettlebells.

My copy finally got here and I read it cover to cover (which, by the way, is easy....it's not a long book, about 160 pages, and flows pretty nicely, in my opinion). Anyway, I read it and I totally disagree with the most recent reviewer. I think it has an interesting story line with creative sex scenes. The contrast of the two main characters is very interesting. It's good and evil, conquering life, opposed to many stories with good against evil. The two main characters, William and Eddie, have struggles that they overcome during their lives as they grow up. During which, one of them has an unbelievable amount of sexual escapades, while the other seems to never have any luck with women. It certainly has enough story line and enough sensuality to have kept my attention as a cover to cover read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"I ordered this based on other reader reviews and disagree with what the others said.

In this book which I couldn't read but for a third, you find essays on many aspects of film viewing and making which, in the best of cases, any film fan already grabs intuitively, without so much wordage being spent on them; others that are just an endless exercise in rehashing liminar theories set forth by other obscure \\"students\\" for the twenty people who care to read them; others try to reach conclusions on themes which are just waiting for some other academic theorist to reformulate them and that, being generally based on psychoanalisis, are generally undemonstrable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Half","review":"Age of Innocence was incredibly promising for the first half of the book. The writing was funny, the characters were developing well, and the relationships seemed fresh and pleasing.However, in the second half, Wharton loses much of her mirth, the characters become horribly unlikable, and the back-and-forth between Ellen and Archer becomes a game of ping pong that's more annoying than satisfying.The style of the prose is good throughout and Wharton's criticism of her own society save the book from being ultimately disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Age of Innocence","review":"I did not expect to find this book as good as it turned out to be. But, Pulitzers aren't given out to just anything, and Wharton's book deserved it. This is a story where nothing happens and everything happens; where the emotional underpinnings ultimately surface and swirl the reader away in tears.

I especially liked her humor when she wrote that society thought having a ballroom in your home dedicated to only dances was wasteful, but it was very good if it could also be used for something else. The book really invites you into pre-WWI, pre-Titanic society. Whorton also points out some valuable lessons such as how good liars explain things but really great liars explain nothing. (More or less) Her vocabulary is also a plus; I needed a dictionary about twice in every chapter, but it was very fulfilling. My favorite \\"new\\" word is \\"confabulation.\\" From now on, when my grandmother makes up sunny personal history, I shall compliment her unrivaled ability to confabulate. :) Very worth the time it takes to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels... EVER!","review":"It is rare to read a book and hope that it won't end. Few people can write like Edith Wharton.

Dick Hill never holds back. He consistently emphasizes and underlines the point of the language: nothing is hidden and nothing is understated. Anyone wishing to project their own interpretation on the text will be disappointed as Hill does all the work for you. I found this a great ride through the work but some listeners may find it laboured and over-characterized.A couple of carping criticisms: Hill's voice for Ellen Olenska is a fully-fledged foreign accent. She was, after all, brought up American. And the sound-quality is a little on the boomy side. At the price, however, strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Edith Wharton's novel about the suffocating nature of 1870s New York aristocracy is a fantastic read. The story is centered around Newland Archer, a man torn between the acceptable love of his society (the adorable but painfully bland May Welland) and the disgraced, fiery passion of the Countess Olenska (May's cousin). While Newland is engaged to May, he finds that he longs for life outside of the ever-enclosing walls of these New York socialites. Countess Olenska in many ways represents a new kind of love, one that is daring and passionate and throws caution to the wind. However, if Newland were to call off his engagement to May, the scandal could destroy the Archer and Welland families forever. A beautifully tragic story about lost love, The Age of Innocence is a haunting and moving work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Society as a Whole","review":"The Age of Innocence is a touching love story set in the 1870's, but there is much more than just the love story in the book. Edith Wharton writes a delightful narative of society and its influence on people's decisions. It is about a young Newman Archer and his conquest for love. He is married to a practical wife (May Welland), but loves another (Ellen Olenska). Ellen is the quintessence of a radical young woman. She has left her husband for his secretary and then had left him. The strangest part is that Ellen is May's cousin so Newland loves both girls of the same family. Who does he end up with in the end? You will have to read it and see. I had to read this book in a limited number of days so I do not think I had enought time to throughly enjoy it. . . but I will probably read it again soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathless!","review":"To appreciate this story, you have to understand moral obligation, which has become a foreign concept in our day. The majority of today's readers cannot comprehend the audacity of walking away from unquenchable passion to consider the best interest of others. The story howeverleaves me wondering whether or not Newland Archer really did what was right. Perhaps his wife could have been freed to avoid living with the reality that she was not the all-in-all of her husband's heart. In Wharton's own words, this story remains on my shelf as \\"the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this novel and understand more about the human heart!","review":"In our modern age of \\"do it if it feels good\\" this novel is a worthwhile read. The love affair between Archer Newland and the sensual Ellen Olenska is all the more passionate and romantic for its restraint proscribed by the rigid social conventions of late nineteenth century upper-crust New York society.Newland eventually does \\"the right thing\\" in spite of his insight into the hypocrocies of the social class to which he belongs. He gives Ellen up, acts the gentleman, and carries her memory with him to warm his conventional passionless lifestyle.Beautifully written with one negative caveat. If any of these people had to worry about actual food and shelter, they would not have had time to obsess about unrequited love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I bought this for a literature class. It's the best book I've read for a class yet. The characters are all well written, even though Wharton made the protagonist (Newland Archer) a hard character to like. I really enjoyed the plot. The end of the story is suprising, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat Etchy but Still Very good","review":"The book itself wasn't the most interesting and modern thing to read, but it did focus a lot on the hypocrisy of society and the laws that still govern our world today. Edith Wharton does a fine job of depicting the lives and roles of the characters in rich detail.I suggest that if you want to read this novel, you better have a good (1)imagination and (2)patience. You're going to need both of them to get through this story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Age of Innocence","review":"The Age of Innocence is the first book I have read by Edith Wharton. I love the way she portrays New York society in the 1870's and the way she truthfully reveals the corrupt nature of the gilded age. The repression of individualism and true thinking during this era is sickening, but the way Wharton sets up the plot, makes the reader see the sadness of a society so built on appearances. It was hard for me to believe that the characters in this book could sacrifice so much happiness in the name of morals soley based on appearances and \\"duties.\\" These morals are as hollow as the society surrounding the gilded age. The sad irony in this book is enthralling and Wharton's style of writing is very precise, helping the reader to see through the masks of the characters and into their true emotions and thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Age of Good Writing...","review":"I preface this review with an admission: any and all of Edith Wharton's works so far are like candy to me. Once I start one of her books, it will take quite a while before I put it down.Age of Innocence to me is like a good Monet painting. It is surreal, interesting and sad, and yet there are so many layers to it. How you interpret it and how you decipher it's layers, is the key to enjoying it. Her verse is also intricate, careful and precise.Note of caution: The movie is much better after you've read the book. There is great meaning in the pregnant stares and the social layers of society, something that is not easily expressed in a two hour long movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edith Wharton is a master of prose","review":"Every sentence is finely crafted; every word carefully chosen. If I lived to be a thousand I could never capture Wharton's knack for turning a phrase. As for the book, it is captivating, intruiging, and in the end vastly satisfying. I think the book could have stood on its own without the last chapter, but it offers a resolution for people like me who want a 'happy' ending.I don't know what this world would be like without Dover Thrift Editions. I probably never would have read this book if I hadn't gotten it for $2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfying","review":"I knew I was going to like this novel when I read, on page 3, \\"...an unalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the German text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be translated into Italian for the clearer understanding of English-speaking audiences.\\"And it did not disappoint. I won't repeat the detailed analyses here by others; I will only say that this novel is by common consensus a classic of literature, and that is no accident. It is worth your time, and then some.Incidentally, as I write this (March 2010), the Folio Society has just issued a beautiful new edition of this book. If you like fine books, you can't do much better than a classic work in a Folio edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredibly Beautiful Book.","review":"I found the Age of Innocence to be an incredibly beautiful book. It has been a long time since I've read anything so masterfully written. It is a book that resonated with me on many levels and won't be forgotten very easily. The characters are wonderfully portrayed. It is a story of a romance that struggles against the norms and unwritten rules of the upper-class of NYC in the 1870's. More fundamentally though the book is also about the constraining/bounded environments/communities/affiliations that we all operate within. How some of us strive to breakout or go against the grain of these realms and take the associated risks. It is a novel of breaking free and seeking something more meaningful and deeper. It has my highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great book, horrid kindle version","review":"The formatting on this Kindle version of the book is horrid. I do not recommend it.

I have read many of her others and while I throughly enjoyed House Of Mirth....Age of Innocence far surpassed it.The prose and storyline has such a haunting,nostalgic and sad qaulity. Her using of Newland to protray just how much society had changed in since 1870 was masterful and done exceptionally.The description of the way of life she records is breathtaking and at times almost unbelievable when a 21st century reader devours it. A novel not to be missed, to be savoured and read slowly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic from Wharton","review":"Simply great book in every way.

I would spend hours at a time reading, but make little progress. Everything was too descriptive and it took too long to get into the novel. The overall story line was a good one, but I didn't like the way it was developed.

I think it was my extreme dislike of all the characters--all shallow, manipulative people who rigidly followed the aristocratic social mores of the time. The language was stilted and the social scenes boring. Read \\"House of Mirth\\" and forget this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful portrait of old New York high society","review":"This book paints a fantastic portrait of the tightly controlling high society of the late 1800's New York and it's repression of individuality. Wharton tells the story of Newland Archer, a young man raised in this society, but who possesses a unique ability to question the rules. During his engagement to May Welland, he meets a woman of questionable background who knocks down the beliefs embedded in him through his upbringing. The story of their relationship and its effect on his marriage show the tensions in this society and how its members worked to preserve their culture. Early in the book, the abundant details of dress and decoration of the times become tedious, but Wharton's portrait of individuals, their thoughts, and how the society affected their life choices is masterful. An enjoyable and educational read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely, dignified story","review":"Before the days of \\"Sex Sells\\" this author presented a rich portrait of psychological and emotional love and obsession.

I cannot deny that it is a beautifully written book that deals very well with the constraints of the social norms of the late 19th century.That said, I found both of the main characters remarkably difficult to like. The only character for whom I felt any sympathy was the hapless May Archer who managed to put up a good front in spite of her husband pining away after \\"love lost.\\" At least the ending was satisfying as it showed some personal growth on the part of Newland Archer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made my daughter want to make snow horses right away.","review":"This book has a great story.

But alas the remixes were too 'experimental' and not more danceable. I can appreciate innovative and different styles of remixing, but to strip down something that tends to be already blase only makes the song more boring.

Agatha Christie weaved such a coherent and fascinating tale of murder and mystery without resorting to gore or sensationalism. In Miss Marple, she created a relateable and loveable character reminiscent of one's own nosy but likeable aunt. It took some time for the mystery to develop.

She eventualy figures out what the task is and performs it for him. Once again, Miss Marple comes through. I like Miss Marple better than Christie's other characters, so this was a natural for me.

The premise in the Miss Marple story is particularly unusual in that the detective is set upon the trail by a man who is now dead. Miss Marple has virtually no clues to begin, not even whose murder she is trying to solve. All the clues are presented for the reader to solve the mystery; no \\"you had to have been there\\" sequences to interfere with solving the murder. Christie's style is the simple straight-forward narrative of an elderly protagonist in England. The perfect novel to chose when bundling up beside the fire on a winter's evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT!","review":"This album symbolizes what I believe to be a wasted effort to pump some life into an album that wasn't good to begin with. Steve needs to invest some time in coming up with single guitar rock songs, not silly sounding fairy rock that nobody with any kind of taste would listen to. Alien Love Secrets is in my opinion the greatest rock instrumental album of all time. It was a simple three piece band playing with a minimum of guitar overdubs. This represents the best of Steve's talents in my opinion. As far as Flex-Able Leftovers is concerned, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!

We often have just 5 minutes to set the tone and create a first impression when meeting with someone, and we have less than 10 seconds to convey what we do in a memorable way that they can remember. The memory hook approach emphasizes developing a communactive as well as catchy tag line to use to describe your business in such a way that the person you are talking with will both understand and remember. For instance, \\"At Glass Doctor, we fix your panes!\\" is an example of a tag line or memory hook using word play and humor.Misner gives hundreds of examples from various industries and people, and also provides a tool chest for the reader to use to develop their own memory hook. He does a good job of showing the importance of an effective memory hook, as well as gives the reader ideas and tools to develop one of their own. A good resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this item @ my local Home Depot store to cut some 1 1/2 in. pvc. All I can say is that it is a pain to use.

At first, perplexed and hurt by her parents' decision to have her stay with the often taciturn, but always loving and engaging gran, young Elizabeth learns through a young neighbor boy the importance of seizing the day and not missing a moment of life, a lesson that becomes all the more poignant by the novel's melancholy, but hopeful ending.

The compass is highly accurate and easily re-calibrated when needed.But the band breaks about every 18 months. Nothing you do can stop it. And I, at least, have to get a jeweler to replace it because I can't manage the tight fit on my own. And the band is $40 retail, though you can find for $20 online.So some people here say it's worth the hassle and some say not. I think it is, but it IS a hassle.

First, the user interface seems overly complicated. I rarely could figure out how to do anything other then switch screens on this watch without the manual. I've owned other feature full watches before and this was the hardest to use. Second, the band sucks. The first two years I had it the band broke twice and it uses a custom band so you have to pay $$ to get another one, just to have it break again. After the 2nd time it broke I threw it to the back of the drawer in digest. I will not put more money into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable watch with lots of options","review":"I have had this watch for over 3 years and the only problem I have found is the compass has to be frequently recalibrated.

It would be nice to monitor both, though not sure if this is feasible due to the watch using pressure to monitor both. This was difficult to keep up with while over seas (the resources to obtain the barometric pressure aren't as readily available as they are here)."},{"rating":"1","title":"great watch for sitting in my desk drawer","review":"I've had my Observer since 2002.

The functions are all very cool and it's a great looking watch.HOWEVER: There are many times that the watch has sat in my desk drawer waiting for parts while my G-Shock and Timex IronMan carry the load. Today is one of those times. The Observer's wrist strap breaks every 18-24 months - and that occurs even with preventative maintenance on the band on a weekly basis. The replacement straps cost $40. My straps have broken for the 4th time. So, if you think that a $20/year cost of ownership on top of the price of the watch is a good bargain, then get this watch.

To be fair it's the same situation with other similar internet camera products, but I would definitely not recommend that anyone new to networking take this on without expert help. The setup is complex, the manual is sketchy, and there are some bugs to overcome. Once you get past the initial installation and setup, it's easy to connect remotely and see what's going on in the vicinity of the camera (silently though, there's no microphone). I can connect successfully from my WinXP notebook (Firefox), my Nokia N800 linux tablet, or my Windows Mobile cell phone.

Downing are truly Metal Gods! And the fantastic vocals by Rob Halford make \\"Vengeance\\" on of the greatest rock albums of all time! This was the golden age of metal for Priest and if you have been hesitant in buying this disk because you thought that maybe the music wouldn't hold up after twenty years, think again! \\"Vengeance\\" is still as exciting and fresh as when it first arrived.

How else to explain Screaming for Vengeance? Awesomeness. Sometimes you're at the right place at the right time with the right stuff.More than once, observers have questioned if Electric Eye on here is their best song ever. Priest don't fess up to it, but they don't deny it either. I feel 'Take (these chains)' may be the best song on here. It's supposedly a cover, a song-writers song. This was it's first release I believe. After Priest's cover of Green Manilishi and Diamonds and Rust there's a bit of mystery or even humor surrounding this song. Is it a country western song? It's certainly titled as if it is, Take (these chains). At one point the lyricist ends a phrase by saying 'world war three' it would make just as much sense if he said, 'poor, poor, me'. Never mind, that's what he actually sings. The mystery deepens.That's all I have to say about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Metal Album?","review":"I had no thoughts to buy this album until I find it on a list in which it was ranked as one of the essential metal albums of all time.

You could say that many Priest fans were happy while listening to this in 1982. It was a great improvement from \\"Point of Entry\\" which was a big disappointment for many Priest fans. I am not saying that this is a bad album at all. There's many great songs, such as \\"(Take These) Chains\\" and the title track.

You GOt Another Thing Coming, established Judas Priest as MTV icons back in the 80s, and Devil's Child is one of the greatest songs ever made. It contains a greta chorus and guitars.Like 80s metal, you gotta have this album!

It is Halford at his screaming best and then you have the two greatest Heavy Metal guitar players of all-time, Mr. K.K.

The result is still fine, with heroine Ella Neal retaining the \\"Lois\\" name and secondary heroine Dorothy Hebert showing riding and stunting expertise that makes you wish you saw more of her.

A bit o' Devil's Anvil, but what Devil's Anvil just touched on, is here in force, and 100 times better. If you love the oud and love a smart rave beat, you'll love this, and if you don't know the oud, here is your chance to fall in love with the fretless lute that to millions of people is the soul of Middle Eastern music. A bit like Fretless bass in a higher register, a bit like the sequencer of the Egyptians, the oud is the missing link to the musics of our common ancient civilizations.

The little boy wants to drive but his older brother won't let him so he tries anyway. He falls backwards off of the tractor and dies because he gets tore up in a plow. A while later the boy goes to a baseball diamond that's near his house. He finds other boys about his age playing and thats when he falls in love with baseball. Some things I liked about the book was that it starts right off with action when the boy is thrown from the tractor.

The 1st time, he basically rapes her, but makes sure she enjoys it, which just seemed a bit odd for a rapist. The woman fell for this guy anyway, which just seems sort of sick.

The writing style the book uses is full of rationals and logic, and if you like that sort of thing it is great, but really... The American philosophical writers such as Thoreau and Emerson cover more ground and do it better.There's nothing really that I would call \\"new\\" here.Ford's curious way of using words seems more related to his Harvard Law school background and I found it hard to get into his writing style. Not a criticism, that's his personal style, but it did not whet my appetite with the content, nor did it tickle me much in the way of style or substanceAnd why not print as softbound? ... is a lot of money to spend for a throw away book."},{"rating":"1","title":"When a High Initiate in ECK becomes twisted by the Dark Side","review":"What so many past and even some current chelas overlook is that there is a difference between Sri Harold Klemp, the man, and the ECK which uses and continues to use him as ITS divine channel in all the worlds of God.Recently I took the fourth initiation in ECKANKAR. Yesterday, while in contemplation I sang my new secret word with my attention on the current Living ECK Master and experienced the Light of God.Ford Johnson's assertion that chelas are prevented from becoming Masters is a falsehood. Before Millie Moore translated she had reached the Ninth Initiation, the point at which ECK Mastership commences.It's sad to see a former High Initiate like Ford Johnson who has become 'twisted by the Dark Side'."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever piece I have read","review":"This book is marvellous indeed. The Part IV, in particular, is amazing me more and more I read it. The most important feature consists of the close relationship the author establishes between spiritual or philosophical concepts and the everyday life. No spiritual or philosophical concept is of much value unless it is practised in daily life. The closer a seeker comes to truth, the closer she comes to discovering the tools that bring success in life. This is, in my opinion, the biggest contribution the author brings to the discussion of spiritual paths. That's why the book is a must read for everybody with interests on spiritual affairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS MADE UP NONSENSE","review":"THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN DECIEVED BY THE KAL.

I had the first reading of this book, over 500 pages, in a couple of days. It was really hot! The information was so intense that I am going over the second, more thoughtful reading.In my humble opinion, this book, surprising little known so far, offers to everybody a new perspective for our relations with God. It is true that such a perspective is very challenging and it takes some time for people to fully understand it.

It was so obvious to me that Ford Johnson's ego got bruised because he got chastised by his spiritual leader. I read his letter or resignation and it smacked of someone bitter because his leader did not share his opinion about a manuscript written by his friend. Well, Ford, as high as you might have been on the path, the truth is ... YOU ARE NOT THE LEADER OF ECKANKAR. NEVER WERE. The fact that Eckankar is still strong and growing proves that you are a small minded, bitter man. Did you really think you were so great that you would make the tiniest dent? All you did was shake out the riff raff. And for that, I thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eckankar Facade--Only the Beginning","review":"This book was a real confirmation about some feelings and questions I've had concerning Eckankar for quite some time. I have been researching truth in all aspects of my life and the truths contained in Ford's book came not as a real surprise but more as an inevitable conclusion. My own research was heading in the same direction.However, Ford's uncanny ability to piece the whole thing together was brilliant. His expose pieced together a very clear image of the truth and lies behind Eckankar. In spite of the fact that his research demolishes its facade, Ford maintains a high level of love and detachment throughout.I suspect the information presented in this book will help many Eckists around the world who find themselves without answers. For many in the organization this is only a beginning. Ford's book lays a good foundation for the next step towards truth and self-discovery. I tip my hat to him and thank him as well.Happy"},{"rating":"1","title":"no max comfort here","review":"Got this seat to replace schwinn stock seat. I think the stock seat was more comfortable!

The idea of Outkast, JayZ, or some other accomplished hip-hop artist covering Iron Maiden could actually be pretty cool (at least to an Iron Maiden fan!). Unfortunately, this CD is anything but cool.

I cannot emphasize it enough.This does not sound much of anything like Iron Maiden at all, and don't get me wrong, I love the use of unconventional instruments in tribute albums, such as The Piano Tribute To Iron Maiden, or the orchestral versions of the songs \\"Dance Of Death\\" and \\"Blood Brothers\\" found as the b-sides to the Wildest Dreams and Rainmaker singles.If you're still not convinced, as to why I hate this, I'll explain:It's not the instruments, nor the vocals, it's the slaughter of the songs themselves, they don't sound anything like the songs themselves, the riffs are completely different, and even The Trooper could be easily mistaken for something else.This album is a scam, probably created under the assumption it would sell because Iron Maiden fans are typically hardcore collector fanatics.DON'T GET THIS ALBUM!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you kiddin'????","review":"GARBAGE!!!!!

It is better than the pleasant but redundant Fireman albums, and it is the most forward-looking project Macca has been a part of since he was in the Beatles. This album is high on irony as well. Wasn't Paul the one who wanted \\"Revolution 9\\" removed from \\"The White Album\\"? And here is Paul, 32 years later, doing \\"Rev 9\\" (especially on \\"Plastic Beetle\\" where all the studio chatter is guided by John's overdramatic singing on \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" -- remind any one of the \\"ALL RIGHT\\"'s from \\"Rev 9\\"?).

Definitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Walrus Still Is Paul","review":"This project has nearly nonstop drumbox, preventing it from working as a soundscape (viz. \\"Your Favorite London Sounds\\" by Peter Cusack) but it has too many interruptions by voice tapes to be a good bass&drums album either.

We always know we were going to get songs and performances that were as good as it was ever going to get in the rock/pop genre.

Highly critical of the sounds I listen to and through the headphones delivering the highs, mids, and lows. These are very good headphones. Not the best but perform solidly. Nice isolation of removing the outside noise... but really warm low ends (deeper bass response) and nice mid and high end frequency responses. I have heard many headphones... Sony MDR-V500's, MDR-V700's, and MDR-V600's. These offer a suitable replacement without the high cost. These headphones could easily double for DJ use or reference listening purposes. They are well constructed and most of all comfortable. The single wire conncetion to the left side makes them even more less likely to tangle and are reinforced to make sure they last a long life. Lifetime warranty included. Hmmmmmm. We'll see. Initial impression? Very surprised by the cery good sound and affordable pricing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must be too old...","review":"... but these were much louder than the headphones these replaced. I use them on my PC, at work, and needed to turn the volume down. Also, the bass is quite strong, which I think is a good thing, although I put the speakers half-off my ears until I got used to it. On the strong plus side, the cord is nice and long (and I'm now the envy of the office because of it; I can reach both of my computers without losing the headphones).

The bass seems rather weak and the audio for music just sounds really off. I tried messing with an equalizer to try and get a better sound out of it but no matter what I tried it just didn't sound right especially when compared my other headphones. These headphones were comfortable but were almost too big for me as well and I consider my head to be an average size.

The Koss UR-20 headphones had numerous rave reviews and I decided I could try them - at less than $20 including shipping I couldn't go too far wrong. The bass is just right - there but not overpowering. The highs are crisp. I heard parts of familiar music that I hadn't heard before.

I did not find it in the Koss R-80. This set exhibits a sharp db drop-off in both high and low frequencies, and what I can only describe as 'mushiness' in the mid-range. I did not find the set to be as uncomfortable to wear as other reviewers have noted, and the cushioning is effective at blocking exterior noise. However, this does not compensate for the poor audio quality. After an hour of listening to the R-80, I returned with relief and new appreciation to my original inexpensive set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality sound for a low price.","review":"Was not suprised with the good sound of these headphones.

I had contacted Koss directly about getting replacements because they were defective, and they said they would charge me a 15 dollar repair fee and I would have to pay to have them shipped to the repair facility.

I'm really happy with them, especially for the price.Also, they are very comfortable. The most comfortable headphones I've ever owned (but I haven't owned a plethora.) They sound great with games as well as music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, really comfortable, good product","review":"These headphones are very comfortable, they might be the most comfortable pair I've ever owned. The sound quality is pretty good, there are obviously better sounding headphones out there but for the price these work very well. The 8ft cord is a little much for my setup but better too long than too short I suppose. The cord and jack seem very durable with the cord being quite thick and the jack very sturdy. Also I have a big head and some headphones with plastic bands have cracked after a few months of use, with these there is a loose cloth band and two very flexible rubber cords that contain the audio cables, so there shouldn't be a problem with cracked bands in the future.Pros: Very comfortable, Price is awesome, Convenient flexible headband.Cons: Cord is a bit too long, Bass is a little lackingOverall a great pair of comfortable and good sounding affordable headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Very comfortable. but stuffy sounding","review":"I am an audio professional.

Great Bass,sound quality was above standard for the price. But I cannot recommend this product to anyone because of the faulty construction. The plug-in bent almost right away distorting the sound almost the first week I got it. I didn't have an option at the time so I used them tell I found my earbuds. Then they broke again completely severing the right side of the headphones from the rest of it. Don't buy it. Oh yea, went on vacation forgot about the return policy time (my fault) then boom. I got stuck with broken headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I had the Koss UR55 in the past, so I figured that these would be a cheaper alternative. I assumed that the sound quality wouldn't be as good, but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad. it has an underwater sound like nothing I have heard. They are, however, really comfortable. Basically, these are earmuffs. I bought a pair of UR55s for $10 more, I will update when they arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this","review":"I've had this headphone for just over a year and it is now broken. Those who said the plastic hinge above the ear cups is flimsy were right. One side just suddently broke off, leaving the ear cup dangling by a thin wire. I tried to superglue the hinge but it didn't hold....poor engineering design puts too much stress on the hinge point. Stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks Very Easily","review":"As I was putting it on my head one day it just broke. There's just no excuse for that.

The headphones seem robust (time will tell) and sound just fine. Good price too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality, Great Price","review":"Headphones are pretty good quality in my opinion, and I only paid ten bucks through Amazon for them. I go through headphones like water, and these seem to hold up pretty well. I especially like that the connection pieces from one phone to the other phone are really really flexible; they can bend quite a ways, which for me has made them last longer because I've always got them rolling around in my bookbag with other stuff or doing stuff with them that can bend them. The one thing I didn't like was that they are not as loud as I'd like on max volume. Max volume with these is probably like 70% percent volume when compared to other headphones, but that's me. I like it loud, and these aren't the kind of loud I like, but they serve their purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound too bad they're defective.","review":"I recently purchased a pair of the Koss R80 and all I can say is they have a very nice clean sound and despite what people have said about build quality they seamed decently built for a pair of $34 dollar head phones. The problem is the cord was defective on both pairs I ordered (I had to replace the first pair), the right channel would cut in and out. I wish I could say that all the negative review it gets are unwarranted but I can't. I would avoid the Koss R-line of head phones and look else where."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent for the price","review":"To emphasize a couple of points made on other reviews. 1) These are fairly comfortable, passively block noise pretty well, and sound quite good. 2) they look and feel like inexpensive headphones, not bad, but no better than the $35 they cost. 3) I thought the detachable cable would have a standard 1/8\\" connector, but it is actually a phone jack connector on the headphone side, not very robust. 4) The impedance on the Koss website says 60 ohms, but on the actual package it says 112 ohms. 5) The wire from one side to the other is under the band, i.e. against your scalp, so if you are bald like me you have a soft, lightly padded band with a wire bump against the top of your head - its not terrible, just not ideal. Overall, these are acceptable given the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, Comfortable, Over-Ear Headphones","review":"I bought these to use at work after seeing a co-worker with them. These are big over-ear headphones that naturally muffle surrounding sound even when not producing sound. They sound fine, given their price. They certainly work great for what I'm using them for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the long haul","review":"The Koss R-80 headphones have great sound and eliminate most external noise.They're also reasonably comfortable. But if you're looking for headphones thatwill last a long time, keep looking. The earpieces attach to the headband withplastic connectors that weaken and snap after a relatively brief time period,leaving the earpiece dangling by a thin wire. My set broke under warranty,and were replaced without a hassle, but the new ones died the same death.Really a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsung DVD-RW Disk","review":"Bought Samsung DVD-RW's to ensure 100% compatibility with my Samsung DVD recorder.

There is nothing wrong with missionaries when they are honest about their beliefs and goals, but trying to convince Jews that they will be more Jewish by believing in Jesus is about as dishonest as it gets. Jews for Jesus in name alone is an oxymoron (like \\"Kosher pork\\"). Honesty is the best policy. This book does not portray true Judaism OR true Christianity, and does a disservice to true believers of both faiths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrified","review":"This book implys that there is something terribly wrong with being a Jew (all us Jews will be going to a Christian hell, and so forth).

My husband Alan stated he didn't feel like a novice coming into this lovely tropical paradise thanks to these guides.The books were pretty right on when it came to restaurant prices, only a few had varied their charges. One restaurant was a nice surprise as we were expecting to pay twice as much.To add to the information, besides the buses running to the capital city of Oranjestad, they also have $1.00 taxis and these vans function well when you don't want to wait for the next bus. Oranjestad is a must visit for shopping, eating and touring.The books also didn't include the native poverty that exists beyond the resorts and touring areas. Few Arubans own a decent hacienda.

I download the data using Suunto's Activity Monitor software - which allows you to export the data to Excel! Plotting HR versus altitude is very useful for training.I only have a few minor complaints: (1) Battery life is terrible - this thing (and the chest strap) eat up 4 batteries a year. (2) When battery life starts to fade interference is a big issue - fortunately the data can be edited so you can remove \\"spikes\\". (3) PC interface is serial cable - should be USB.

It is an excellent heart rate monitor, compass, alitmeter, and barometer. However the serial PC link is terrible and stops working frequently. I have had my X6HR for one month and it no longer connects to the PC (the main reason I bought this watch in the first place). For some reason, Suunto still uses a serial connection, claiming on their website that this is the latest technology (more like the cheapest). If you plan to use this watch for its PC data transfer function, be very cautious and keep an eye on the warranty. Also the Suunto Activity Manager software is terrible and crashes frequently. I haven't lost any data (yet) but its very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you think it's a tough watch, think again","review":"I wear my X6HR in a regular environment (office, home), nothing near extreme condition. However, in less than a year, I foung the rubber band of the heart monitor is broken in many placed and the rubber became brittle with many hairline cracks. This is clearly a quality issue with the material used for the watch. In a trip to the Keys, FL, I found that the little rubber ring that holds the band of the watch in place broke in two piece much like what happed to the heart rate monitor band. The band itself also has many small cracks. I am sure the band will break in half sooner or later. The LCD on the watch also became fuzzy when I wear it around beaches. This is supposed to be a watch that you can bring to an expedition, yet it failed miserably in a everyday environment. If you are looking for a tough watch, look elsewhere.

Drawn together in the midst of conflict, they must bridge the huge differences in what they have been taught and what they have found to be true. One of the best recipes for fantasy is to bring a carefully rationed amount of magic into a meticulously real world. Betsy James has made a such a world, down to the ecology, the folk songs, the children's games, and a complex social network where the bad guys are not all bad and the good guys are divided, challenged, and complicated. These construction details are not just painted background, they are part of the energy that makes the story move. This one won't put you to sleep and it won't go down with \\"a little bit of sugar.\\" Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening At the Gate","review":"I am a middle school counselor.

What a novel idea and a excellent twist to war and SCI FI. Keep up the great work Dave, WAHOO"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Original...","review":"Dave's first fiction outing is something with a truly original concept and is overall a damn good read.True, it is a little patchy in places and I hated the damn monkeys, but throughout you can see this is a work of passion.As a soldier, I can identify with what is going on here, but one or two of the ideas might be a little difficult for a total civilian to grasp - but then again, in this day and age, which of us is really merely a civilian?I really liked it and I want to see what comes next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read!","review":"This is an excellent book. It's about time that Grossman's subject matter was incorporated into fiction. With time, this book should become a classic, and many other writers should be looking to this work (and Grossman) for inspiration. I applaud Frankowski for a well-written and scientifically based piece of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new way of training reluctant warriors","review":"I just finished \\"The Two Space War\\". I have to say that it was awesome. It was Heinlen, Jack Aubrey, and Killology all rolled into one great book.

Grossman's seminar or other seminars, to learn all of the survival skills that are so important.I'm eagerly anticipating the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Again","review":"Dave Grossman, and Leo Frankowski manage a coup!!! With a back-story that is just plain FUN, and a leaveaning of practical information (Straight out of On Combat, and On Killing) on how the action really affects the characters involved, I cant reccomend this book enough. With bows to some of my own favorite authors, paying Homage to O'brian's Aubrey/Maturin novels, Forrester's Hornblower series,and with references to such Sci-Fi Greats as Heinlien, Weber, and Ringo..the storyline keeps you entertained and engrossed from beginning to end!.. Can't wait for the second installment. Also, the other two novels of their collaberation, The war with Earth, and Kren of the Mitchegai, are also great reads, and definitly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two-Space War","review":"I was very impressed.

Grossman and Frankowski have blended two unique subjects into a delightful tale that is both compelling and easy to read. I could not put it down! I'm a student of sci-fi and killogy, and I was surprised to find the two fit so perfectly together. It was like finding a dessert made from two of your favorite sweets that you never considered mixing, each enjoyable on it's own, but together they provide a wonderous experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-impressed and Under-par","review":"Unlike almost everyone else here, I am totally under-impressed with this book. The premise of two-space is interesting, although I have to stretch to suspend disbelief enough to get into the storyline. I was willing to do that, but I just cannot overlook the constant author intrusions and cliches in this book.Did Baen even bother to have editors take a look at this? I can't even get past page 43. This one is going to the second-hand store.

Guns, guts, glory, and poetry (?) in the far reaches of the galaxy. Grossman and Frankowski have blended science fiction and warrior combat into a 362 page trip into a future time with current ramifications. Most people in the military or law enforcement will enjoy this book and should be intrigued enough to check out other books by the authors, especially, Dave Grossman's \\"On Killing\\" (an texbook truely NEEDED by every law enforcement officer on duty).Keep 'em coming, gents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for the Warrior tribe","review":"If you are a sci-fi fan or just love a really rousing action, adventure tale you will want to read this book. If you are in the military, law enforcement, martial/combative arts or are in any way a part of the warrior tribe then you MUST read this book.The writing is skillful and entertaining. The action builds in scope and intensity until it seems there is nowhere left to go, and then it powers up and takes you further in the way that only fine science fiction can.Woven throughout are priceless lessons from fighters, scholars, poets and Col. Grossmans own groundbreaking research. Vital lessons on combat mindset, technique and living with consequences of surviving life and death battle come to life through the story and characters.A really good book reveals more with each reading, this is one of those.My only disappointment was that it ended.

This Album has so many dynamics and varying qualities that should appeal to a wide range of tastes.In my opinion, The best work they have ever done. Cutting edge Rock with their old 70's sound also mixed within the newer sounds of today. Comes off perfect and unique. They also slow it down on some songs too with a few Folk type sounding songs. This Album will continue to grow on you and has something for each individuals own music taste. Rock, Folk, and also in the middle range as well. What really stands out the most, is the songwriting and arrangements in this Album.Welcome back Heart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a grower","review":"This CD is a grower. I have to admit that upon the first couple of listens I was disappointed but after several times through I have really come to appreciate it. I used to feel the same way about the good Elton John albums in the 70's. I would open them up, put them on the turntable and hate every song because they had odd lyrics and quirky arrangements. Now I wish Elton would return to his adventurous and interesting musical arrangements. Well, Heart has done just that. What I didn't appreciate at first listen has grown on me and I appreciate their creative arrangements. It makes music much more fun and interesting. I find that the records that I did not like right of the bat end up being my favorites. I am just glad that I give them a fair chance to get to know them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart still rocks.","review":"Just got this yesterday. The Wilson sisters still have all the chops -- the voices and Nancy's guitar work are as great as ever. And the band they've assembled sounds great, too. OK, so how about the songs? Terrific. The shlocky power-ballads of the 80's Heart are nowhere to be found, and all the quasi-Zepplin influences from the early days are. Great tunes, great singing, great playing -- what a pleasant surprise. This might actually be their best album ever -- it's right up there with Dreamboat Annie. Now, I hope somebody is listening, 'cause Heart still rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jupiters Darling a Breathe of Fresh Air","review":"Jupiters Darling is Hearts newest album, and it is definitley a winner. Hard rock songs give the album an edge over their earlier material. This album rocks hard on songs like 'The Oldest Story in the World,' 'Fallen Ones,' 'Move On,' and 'Vainglorious.' I will say that songs done by Nancy Wilson on this album are not really that great. As usual, its Ann Wilson and her voice that grab the listener. This is a must have record for anyone that likes previous Heart material."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Shouldn't produce their own album","review":"the purchase from amazon was an excellent experience, but Heart doesn't seem to be able to self-criticize. the only decent song is #10 and they didnt write it. i have ALL their music published and am a serious fan of their work EXCEPT this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jupiters Darling review","review":"I have been a fan of Heart's for twenty years and this has got to be one of the best CD's this band has ever put out. It is a unique balance of hard rock and slow ballads. but more rock on this one than ever. And the slow songs have serious taste. Not the ballads of Heart's hair band days in the 80's. They are really solid and substantial. And if you are looking for some Zeppelin-ish blow your doors down rock check out the song Fallen Ones.Definately well worth it and for non Heart fans, it will grow on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment !","review":"It's been a long time since their last album, and \\"Jupiter's Darling\\" just doesn't measure up to the standards this great band had set for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've Done FAR Better...","review":"All I can say is that this new cd isn't all that great. As a matter of fact, it's rather poor. I've listened to it a few times and I just can't get into it like new cd's that I own. I play a lot of other cd's over and over while Heart's isn't played any longer. Truth be told, I've shelved the thing. People who see Ann and Nancy as gods who can do no wrong will love it and that's fine. I guess I'm not much of a fan anymore. I hope all the rest who buy this cd find things they like.And I'm hoping that someday they will make a followup that will have stronger material. This sure isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learned My Lesson!","review":"I bought this CD entirely on the strength of the reviews here...guess I must be on another planet, as this is (in my humble opinion) the worst music Heart has ever produced. I found many of the tracks downright painful, and there's not a single one I'd ever want to hear again. The lesson: ALWAYS listen to some sample tracks, even when you know & like the band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Done the right way","review":"This is Heart true to form, with rockers, acoustic gems, and some of their best songwriting in decades. Read the other reviews for the details of the music, but know this too: this is a rock album done the right way. The sonic production of this CD is outstanding. Unlike so many of today's releases with their squashed dynamics and \\"normalized\\" levels just shy of digital clipping, this disc is a welcome relief. It is wide open, with the various acoustic instruments so well recorded they sound like the Sisters are right there in your living room.It simply doesn't get better than this. Go buy this album. Why are you still here reading? Put it on, turn out the lights, sit back and just listen to this album end-to-end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad? Not good? Not bad? bad eh ?","review":"I honestly tried to like this cd. Im a die hard Heart fan but this cd reminded me of someone trying to cling on to the music biz. What a price to pay. Nothing thrilling stood out on this cd. A few twist and turns with shabby guitar work, but even that is questionable. No one song stood out and i didnt even feel any real powerful vocal output that is Ann's trademark."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After reading many reviews that said this album was reminiscent of \\"old Heart\\" (as in thier 1970s music), I have to say I don't believe it. Too many songs are loud and aggressive just for the sake of being loud and aggressive. It's hard to find a memorable melody. If you're a fan of the Dreamboat Annie / Little Queen / Dog and Butterfly days, this album will be a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...and gets better","review":"I have been a long time Heart Fan. Even when it was \\"before my time\\" I heard it because of my older sisters.I really liked the earliest Heart (Dreamboat Annie and Little Queen), and the Capitol Years the best.When I got Jupiter's Darling, I loved it. I thought that there was a little \\"lighter, pop\\" sound to the hard driving rock. And....as I listen, I like it more and more each time.I think there is a lot of \\"catchy\\" music, as well as some incredible instrumentation (I'm a sucker for all the instruments Nancy plays....just wish Ann would have gotten the flute out) :)At a time when there is Retro gallore, a GREAT time to bring the Old Heart Logo out....and very indicative of what you find on the CD.GREAT new effort for Heart. They say they made this CD for the fans....and they apparently know just who the true fans are.Thanks, Ann and Nancy, for an incredible listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"time warp..","review":"I just finally got around to getting this. i'm a bit slow, what can i tell ya. well, after listening to it once, i knew one thing: these guys just wanna rock. Mike Inez brought more of Alice in Chains with him than i think we anticipated and helped put these guys back in the Seattle band category instead of the tp 40 adult category. This record just plain rocks. Some songs are the heaviest things they've ever written and delivered with pretty sincere conviction rather than trying to sound conntemporary. Sure there are a few songs that lag but as a whole, this is the best record Heart has made in years and really good indication that the Heart of the 70's has returned. I look forward to the next record which i won't wait so long to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really wish this cd wold have clicked!","review":"Heart is my favorite group of ALL time. I have enjoyed most everything they have recorded. My favorite album is DREAMBOAT ANNIE. This cd, JUPITER\\"S DARLING, is one of their best. I really wish this was marketed better because I think a lot of people would have enjoyed it. My fav. trck on the cd is ENOUGH I noticed most people did not menti this song but it's quite haunting to listen to. Turn up the volume loud on ENOUGH and yoou will be blown away by teh whispers of Ann's voice that gradually lead to the powerful screams....it's an amazing song. Nancy stands out in I NEED THE RAIN...a very pretty song that reminds me of THESE DREAMS...Another stand out track is NO OTHER LOVE...it's a great love song and once again ANN proves she still can sing the hell out of a song. LOST ANGEL also deserves an honorable mention..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing to Prove Yet Prove It They Do","review":"Their glory days long behind them, Heart has nothing left to prove on Jupiter's Darling, their first release of new material in 11 years. And damn it if they don't remind us all over again of what a solid rock band they can be. Ann and Nancy Wilson's Led Zeppelin jones having been tickled in their side project as the Lovemongers must have unleashed their inner-Page/Plant, because they're writing and raging as they haven't since their debut. When they get folksy here it's Led Zep III and not Dog & Butterfly, when they rock its classic in all the best ways, and there isn't a ballad anywhere near as obsequious as \\"Alone\\". Proving one more time that chicks rock, and proving anew that old chicks rock, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reply to that last reviewer","review":"I don't understand why you think that who someone is married to, or a person's weight deters them from making great music. You are an idiot. Rock on Heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.L.A.N.D.","review":"Ann Wilson's Voice is still stellar. Too bad the material for this album IS NOT. I was hoping for at least a couple of stand out tracks...maybe something like Black on Black (from the album \\"Desire Walks On\\"). Nothing like that here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait!","review":"This is not the 80's Heart that was very commercial sounding, but still good. This is a \\"new sounding\\" CD from a band that has talent plain and simple. Make me,Oldest story,Move on,Vainglorious and Fallen ones flat out smoke and Perfect goodbye,No other love and Lost angels are well done mid-tempo ballads. For something completely different, Things, I give up and Down the nile foot the bill and also are great songs. This may be the best CD this band has ever put out from top to bottom.

He, at first, is not believable but as the movie gains speed, he is perfect for the role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless?","review":"Really still haven't figured why Connery agreed to this project.

The transfer is grainy and poor, and what format is this anyway??

A pity because it's a wonderful movie. Scientifically it may be a little simplistic (finding a cure for cancer in a wooden hut) but the important points are well made and convincingly integrated into the story line. I wonder if the \\"official\\" reviewers were watching the same movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great promise, greater disappointment.","review":"Medicine Man is seriously flawed. Some of the photography is very appealing, but the writing is amateurish with a silly plot and ignorant repartee. Even worse was the casting. Connery is a believable male lead, and anything that makes the movie passable is to his credit, but why was Lorraine Bracco cast opposite Connery? There is zero chemistry between the two, and she is just completely inappropriate for the role. Acting is more than yelling and screaming and exhibiting obnoxious behavior. It was a struggle to actually finish watching it.There is yet to be made a quality movie on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Man","review":"...It took a provocative idea and turned it into a silly action movie instead of a thoughful drama. Connery is fine as always, but Bracco grates...There's even a preachy save the environment message thrown in at the end..."},{"rating":"1","title":"People actually like this dud of a movie. Give it a try.","review":"A king sized helping of irritating with a dollop of boring. I can't believe this movie is liked by so many people. It was mildly interesting as far as \\"old jaded scientist hates greenhorn until he starts liking her\\" formula movies go. But the chemistry between them bit! Which made the musical score really funny when you hear the first \\"triumphant\\" symphonic piece. You frown and say, \\"I don't get it, I thought they still hated each other...is this 'Gone with the Wind' drama because she likes the view from the ropes?\\" And Lorraine Bracco's character is soooo annoying. The fact that he wants her to return with him isn't even believable. Connery's okay, but a bad match for his style. I watched the whole thing though, and other people liked it. But, like one of the other reviewers wrote, I figured out the cure for cancer before the characters did. And so will you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Medicine Man","review":"If only the good parts of this movie were true and the bad parts were untrue.

I am a movie buff so when say \\"The worst\\", I mean \\"worst.\\" I have watched \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" junk movies that looked much better than this.The movie fades in and out, the focus is off many times, it even jumps in two places, you cannot see anything when there are fog shots, super grainy in all dark shots (many), and the artifacts are downright distracting.Honestly, the VHS is of better quality.Do NOT WASTE your TIME or MONEY on this fantastic movie until they re-master it for Blu-Ray.It has been 20 years, so you would think an anniversary edition was in the works but since nothing could be found that is why I bought the DVD. It was a MAJOR mistake.Movie: 5 Stars DVD: 0 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck in the Amazon","review":"Sean Connery and director John McTiernan wanted to try something different, but \\"Medicine Man\\" (1992) was the wrong project. Cranky scientist Connery gets saddled with an obnoxiously miscast Lorraine Bracco in this dreary environmental jungle adventure. A disastrous attempt to emulate \\"The African Queen\\" and \\"Romancing the Stone.\\" Jerry Goldsmith's overlooked score remains the sole redeeming feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up!","review":"It was terrific.

One of my all time favorite mature actors now that he is out of the 007 genre, this is probably one of his least know movies but a real gem. Powerful story line that really makes you think about what we are doing to our planet and all the living things around us in the guise of 21st century man and his developments along with the absolute greed and destruction inflicted on the world by corporate america and corporate world.The premise of a mysterious hidden cure for cancer in the depths of the Amazon jungle is not all that far fetched when you research what has been found there to date and the fact we are quickly destorying one of nature's real treasures on our planet that affects every living being. If you want mindless fluff I'd suggest another movie, but if you want something that makes you think seriously about our current world with good acting and scenery I'd check this movie out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite movie ever!","review":"Very interesting and different.

I use them to keep all my hooks and swivels organized in my tackle box. I usually put my tackle box in a backpack in a sideways position. The bags prevent all the little hooks and swivels from flying all around the box when I walk up and down inclines and banks. The only issue I have with them is that they might be too thin for my applications. Hooks, especially treble hooks poke through the bag fairly easily. That is not to say that they get shredded to pieces because of it, it's just that I have to watch out a little bit so I don't prick myself with the hooks.

Sometimes with small ziploc style bags it can be easy to tear the side seam when opening them, but I've had no trouble with that here. One thing that should be noted is that the internal dimensions are not 2x3 inches. I measure 2.75 inches from the base to the bottom of the zipper.

It has worked out great and I agree with the positive comments about the mesh bag. For my older son, I have a plastic baby hamper with a vinyl lining. That hamper is a nice size and doesn't take up too much space in the closet, but the vinyl bag has completely ripped and is not usable. The mesh bag for this hamper is definitely a great feature. The only potential issue with this hamper is that it is rather large and takes up a lot of room in a closet. It does look nice if you have room to keep it outside the closet. I would definitely recommend this hamper versus the traditional vinyl baby hampers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain, simple and convinient","review":"I like the wooden legs as they go with my maple furniture.I like the simplicity of it, as when the kid grows up, it does not sream \\"baby stuff\\".Nothing fancy and very practical.BUY IT, you won't regret it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good hamper for kids or baby!","review":"I am happy I picked this hamper too! I love that the entire thing is washable in case of soak-through from wet baby items. My only complaint is that after the first year the seams of the mesh inner bag came apart in a few places.

I washed it to get ready for the baby and it fell apart at the seams on the first wash. It shrunk so much that it won't even fit back on, so I'm not going to bother sewing it. Waste of 20 dollars. I might just buy a plastic laundry basket to set on top of the frame and at least get use out of the frame.

The mesh netting provides ease when doing laundry - just pull it out w/ all the clothes in it and take it to your laundry room...no need to take the clothes out and place in a separate laundry basket.

Unfortunately this book is nothing to get excited about. I don't know if this guy is trying to affect some postmodernist ecriture or is just dotty, but the style makes the book unreadable. But if you do convince yourself to forge on anyway, all you'll get is what seems like breezy lectures notes of someone who probably thinks he's a really hip lecturer.

Dr. Lowman attacks every issue she faces head on, candidly describing her emotion and scientific endeavors as if the reader is a personal friend. As a female, I myself can relate to her described frustration of being a woman in a primarily male field. Even my closest male friends look at me with doubt and treat my five year love affair (ongoing, of course) with science as a joke simply because I am female (as the butt of their jokes imply). It's wondorous to read of other accounts involving similar emotion. On a scientific note, Dr. Lowman makes no adjustments for fear of the reader who does not care for biology; she writes about science just as she writes about emotion. For that, I urge parents to prod their children to read this memoir, adults to read, and all others to digest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly listed!!!","review":"I realize now \\"Four Square\\" may be the brand of the bowls, but it appears to be 4 square bowls for sale, especially with the photo showing multiple bowls.

I recommend \\"Flying with out Fear\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, not reassuring","review":"I have to agree with another review that said this book made them feel worse about flying. I figured I would just skip the chapter about air disasters, but in many other parts of the book, the author explains a concept, then proceeds to give an example of how some pilot or airplane went wrong in this area and everyone died. Now I know just how many things can go wrong ... I think ignorance is bliss."},{"rating":"2","title":"How about an update?","review":"ASK THE PILOT was a whole lot of fun and delightfully well well written (I'd love to see an update by Patrick Smith - not just an addendum, but a new edition). Not full of the prurient sort of thing the \\"mile high tell alls\\" usually have, and frankly a little dated, but completely worth the (quick!) read for the amazingly prescient look at the silly places where TSA was likely to go (and, in fact, [i]did[/i] go) and the entire absurdity of the \\"security theater\\" it provides.Plus general info on plane stuff that was fun for the ten-year-old boy in me. I knew a lot of it, but certainly not all of it. :) And Patrick Smith's talent for natural storytelling had me laughing out loud several times - I've handed this one off to my wife and suspect she'll like it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're the curious sort, it's perfect","review":"First you should know this about me: when I'm in a new-for-me airport, my first stop is the gift shop, where I hunt down an airport postcard. Then, at the end of my trip, I turn the postcard over and write down each airport I visited, and the airplanes that took me there. So I guess you could say I'm sort of the target audience for this book.ASK THE PILOT, as others have noted, is a bit disjointed and would benefit from illustrations. But that's picking nits, in my opinion. Even if you've read most of the material in Smith's Salon column, it's nice to have it collected in one place. And if you haven't already read it and you're fascinated by commercial flying -- which describes me pretty well -- then you'll devour this book within a day or two. My only regret is that I didn't see (and buy!) ASK THE PILOT just before my last trans-continental flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Information and fun","review":"This is just a collection of the columns that appear on salon.com. I was hoping for a little more than that, since I regularly read his columns, and there wasn't really anything new.

A good read, but probably not much new to reader's of his column."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are the least bit nervous about flying, do not read this book","review":"Though this is an informative book on air travel, it is not for those with a fear of flying. Mr. Brown illustrates almost every example of safety equipment on an airplane as the result of such and such crash. He details at least 10 seperate crashes in painstaiking detail. He obviously can't relate well to those nervous about flying as he even mocks the idea of being fearful a couple of times.

I have to give the author credit he did manage to tell a story, just not one I found interesting. I was stunned to find out it won the Pulitzer Prize!!! I may be harsh on this one but, I just didn't like it.

In what way is not known until late in the novel. The same suspense trails the father's actions, and the sisters', in the wake of their trips to Chattanooga, where they work at cross purposes to end or save the son's love affair. We hear his voice throughout the novel, and grow close, as if a stranger of his description had walked into our reading room, taken a seat, and over the course of an hour becomes a person we care about, hurt when he hurts. A tribute to Peter Taylor, of course, whose sketches of scenes and characters fill the pages as artfully as Monet filled his canvas with water lilies and weeping willows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't really get it","review":"Peter Taylor has a very nice writing style and I didn't necessarily find the book boring but I did question what it was about?

If there was something deeper there, I didn't catch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intimate Read","review":"I was surprised by how much I liked this book. The main character (I don't have the book right here and I'm too lazy to look it up) grew up in Nashville and moved with his family to Memphis when he was in his early teens. The story takes place when he's in his 40s, living in New York. Both of his sisters and his father still lived in Memphis and were products of the social structure there. He was above it and found the whole thing to be quite ridiculous.Upon his mother's death, he received several phone calls from his sisters, summoning him to Memphis, because his 80 year old father was marrying some young hussy. The story was mostly told through flash backs and memories of his younger days in Memphis.The story was told very slowly and intimately. It really felt like I was sitting down with a close friend and he was slowly uncovering fascinating stories from his childhood in the south."},{"rating":"1","title":"the fragrance does not smell right","review":"la fragancia no huele bien me parece que esta como vencidad. no huele como yo esperaba. not if you miss fragrances but I do not like smelling like this"},{"rating":"2","title":"You pay for what you get","review":"I pay good money for this saw blade and i'm very happy.Glass smooth cuts joints so smooth you can barely see them.No chipping on broads you put a lot of work in.All the sanding,staining and finish coats you want it to look good after you cut it and this is the blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to tune","review":"This is unbelievably poorly designed.

I am really disappointed. I want to stay safe from the sun, but look professional while doing so. The hat just makes me look like I am wearing some dirty rag on my head.I liked the idea of ventilation, but there is none. In order to keep it on your head, you have to use the drawstring, which negates any possibility of ventilation, making this hat extremely hot.Perhaps if you're just wearing this for a day trip things will be better, but if you're wearing this on a daily basis, know that it is not comfortable, durable, colorfast nor washable in the washer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you say Disney World in July","review":"We took the family on vacation to Disney World on our first family vacation.

You walk around awkwardly adjusting it because every time you turn your head it gets shifted about. If it were longer and weighted down it would stay put.Finally, I thought the material would be nice (looks like canvas) but really its just a cheap nylon/cotton towel shaped like a hat.

One of the joys of this sort of music is staying with the groove, and you get long versions of quite a few of the tracks, including the 10-minute take of \\"Papa Was a Rolling Stone.\\"Perhaps I'll get a few \\"not helpful\\" votes for saying this, but the contrast between this music and today's rap is striking and more than a little depressing. Many emotions are expressed here -- rage, joy, determination, longing and fatalism. But this is music about surviving in a harsh environment.

This past week I watched and thoroughly enjoyed all episodes of Marple 1 thru 3. They are wonderful! I was really disappointed that Geraldine McEwan was replaced in series 4.

I thought perhaps it was because I knew the actual story and this production is so VERY far from the book, but my husband didn't know the original story and STILL found it an incoherent mess.Whoever is behind all the new \\"adaptations\\" is working too hard to rewrite stories--which are still incredibly popular and really don't need rewriting.

She really was superfluous. The story lines are changed all out of recognition. In one McEwan Marple, Miss Marple is inserted into a Tommy/Tuppence story, and the writers made Tuppence out to be a lush. Agatha Christie would never have stood for that!

Since it's already tied to you, you can't see what you're doing and the baby can get tangled in all the weird knots and folds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby Wrap","review":"I thought this would be perfect for carrying around my newborn but it was so complicated that I have never used it.

I really, really wanted it to work. On those rare occasions when I can get my 6-week old daughter into properly, it does work. The problem is that since it's yards & yards of fabric that you have to re-wrap every time you use it, you never know if baby is going to be in it properly or not! I tried 10 times this morning to put my daughter in it. She was awake & fidgety, and her head kept popping out. GRR!!! I took her out, put her in the Baby Bjorn instead, and we were just fine. I might try the Moby later when she's able to hold her head up (like in ALL the pictures), but for a newborn, I do NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby wrap","review":"I purchased a moby thinking it would be a great way to have my baby close to me. In the end bought an ergo instead and hid the moby in the closet. It was hot to wear, I never fully felt secure that I was wearing it correctly, and was annoyed by having to re-wrap when ever I was needing to take my baby with me. Felt like I always needed the instruction book to put it on, and always needed someone to help me wrap it around. Not my favorite item."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO COMPLICATED!","review":"This thing is way to hard to put on. Particularly when my baby is crying.

Well, I'm confined to a chair or walking and holding without any free arms to do something simple like wash my hands because thevwrap is too small to wrap and hold my baby safely. Terribly disappointed because I'm maybe a size 14 postpartum, not incredibly large. What a waste of money that has added nothing but frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed","review":"I got this wrap for my newborn.

Super soft fabric."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this...","review":"...but it just didn't happen. I was never able to get a tight enough wrap, no matter what I did. I tried so many different ways but the baby never felt secure in it. The material is a really thick, high-quality jersey, but I found myself overheating every time I wore it, even when it was winter- and don't even get me started on how hot this thing was in the summer.Pros:-Really soft, available in tons of nice colors and some patterns.-Machine washable, and it washes nicely.-ummmm... that's it, really.Cons:-Hard to use.-Doesn't feel secure.-Really hot.I ended up selling mine for about half what I paid for it, and the girl who bought it ended up loving it for her very small baby, so I really do think that for this carrier is great for some people, just not for me. I ended up with a few different woven (non-stretchy) wraps and I like those much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Size Does Matter","review":"I really enjoy the possibilities the Moby wrap offers. I put my son on, and he falls right asleep...I absolutely love being able to get some chores done while keeping him near.The only issue I've really come across is that it doesn't mention how your size actually matters as far as the different positions you can wear your child. My son was three weeks old, 7-8lbs, so I tried the cradle hold...but since I'm 5'2\\" and 103lbs, my tiny frame makes this hold dangerous...I don't have broad shoulders, so my son was scrunched in this hold with his chin pressed to his chest. Couldn't really figure out what I was doing wrong at first, but after studying the pictures in the book versus what I was seeing in the mirror, it became kind of obvious. Just wish the manual mentioned this, so I wouldn't keep cramming my kid into a hold that simply didn't fit us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Strong Odor","review":"This is a great product, but beware: It takes multiple washings to get the factory, chemical smell out of the cotton.

Neither my wife not I--and especially not our baby :)--had the patience to take the time needed to learn how to wrap this correctly and efficiently. We recently got together with several other couples of new babies and other parents had the same comment. Baby bjorn was the hands-down favorite for carrying baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly complicated, and uncomfortable.","review":"The Moby Wrap was recommended to me in a parenting class and I was drawn in by the number of ways you could wrap it. Unfortunately, I found that that is where the benefits stop. It is one of those things that is good on paper, but not in practice.It is quite long and very cumbersome to wrap in even the most basic way, and you never seem to get the baby seated properly. It was not through lack of trying that I could not make it work, I was home the first 3 months of my son's life and after 2 months of trying daily, I gave up. The knot makes an uncomfortable lump, the fabric wrapping around you so many times is hot and binding, and the baby is held so close to you it makes them hot too.Plus, the price for what is just a long piece of jersey knit with a serged edge is insulting. Find a Baby Bjorn and do yourself a favor. You may only be able to use it one way, but you arent exhausted by the time you get the baby in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Stupid.","review":"I bought the Baby Bijorn which my son did not like. He may like it as he gets older, but for now, he lasts about 15 minutes in it, and then starts crying. So next I tried the Moby Wrap. I suppose it's a good idea in theory, but it's just not very practical. It takes practice to get it tied correctly, and frankly it's quite comical trying to put it on. It's so long that it drags on the floor while you're maneuvering it, and then after the baby is in it, it takes some adjusting to get it just right. What you're left with is a ton of fabric wrapped around you, and you're hoping your child is secure. I think I'll put it in my upstairs bedroom and use it to shimmy down the side of the building in case there's a fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you live in a warm climate, not so good.","review":"I bought this because of the high user ratings / comments & a recommendation from my Doula. I also love the idea of wrapping him on because it seems more organic and natural.THE GOOD*Might be decent to use once the weather turns really cool (winter time).THE BAD*Too bulky:: Even with directions, I found the Moby tedious to handle and tie due to its bulk and length.*Thick material:: The material wasn't very breathable due to the thick cotton. In the S. California climate I live in, it can get pretty warm during the day and this just creates way too much heat.OVERALL*If I lived in a mostly cool/cold climate this might work for me but I don't. I put the Moby in storage and currently using (and very satisfied with) a Baby Bjorn carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my moby wrap","review":"It took a little practice to get the hang of wrapping the Moby, but it's been my baby's favorite mode of transport since she was a newborn. safe, cozy, pretty. i wish i could buy one in every color!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be great, but not so much","review":"I bought this since other Mom's I know raved about it. First I paid $50 for what is basicly a HUGE piece of heavy fabric. You then have to practive wrapping this thing around you. It takes time to learn how to wrap it properly. If you want to go any where in public with this thing on you better put it on before you leave the house since you will never figure it out once you are away from a mirror. My daughter cried EVERY time I put her in this. She didn't like it at all. The two times I did get her to calm down and stay in it she got over heated quickly even though she was just wearing a onesie. This material is so thick and having that on the baby plus your body heat and your baby will be cooking! I gave up and returned it and so did some of the ladies I know after they had the same issue. Great idea, but huge fail. Not to mention if you really want to try this buy some fabric and wrap it around yourself for less then half the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infant Nap Lifesaver","review":"The Moby Wrap has been a godsend for my baby's nap times. While he sleeps well through the night, he's never been able to nap well on his own. A friend mentioned that she used the Moby Wrap for her children's naps. We decided to try it out, and got somewhat mixed results in the beginning.After getting a bit more experience with the wrap, we found that the most important thing was to make sure his legs were properly and comfortably folded underneath his bottom. Secondly, we've found that keeping the wrap looser works better for him to nap easily. I used to try make it as snug as possible, but found that this makes it very difficult to keep his body straight (which makes me have to keep my body in a weird position).Overall, this is probably one of the best purchases we've made for our little boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I could never get this thing to work.

Just feels safer with the other products."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love love love my Moby Wrap!!","review":"I purchased my moby wrap after seeing a mom with one while shopping at a garage sale. I had not had my baby yet and was looking for and alternative to the slings I was seeing in the stores. What a great product!! It came with an instruction manual that gives great directions and shows many ways to wrap your baby! I used mine very consistanly for the first 6mths with my daughter because she did not like being in the car seat or stroller if we were not in the car moving. So anytime we were in the mall or store or going for walks I strapped her to me with the moby wrap and she loved it!! Now she is 11mths and likes to move a lot so we dont use it as much but I still feel like we got our moneys worth!! I will be passing mine on and will be sure to recommend it to other new moms!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept, but hard to use","review":"PROS: my baby liked the snug feel. allows me to free both hands to do other things.CONS: hard to wrap properly without someone else helping me do it. if i do it alone, the fabric gets all SHRIVELED UP like a tight rope around my shoulders and back. the product itself is very elactic/high quality though."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome baby carrier","review":"I bought the Balboa Sling before my son was born--when he came, he absolutely hated it. I was disappointed--I really wanted to be able to wear my baby and not be tied to the stroller everywhere I went. I looked at the Moby Wrap--I love it.It looks intimidating, and it is VERY long-but he loves it. he is four weeks old, and was crying when I put him in it the first time. He fell asleep within five minutes, and I was able to go for a long walk. He does like to be upright, so maybe that's why he didn't like the Balboa, and loves the Moby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent item!","review":"I just had a baby 2 months ago, and just as with my first son, I can't use the Snugli we received as a gift. His poor little head gets squeezed because of it's design. So I started looking for alternatives. Slings just didn't seem comfortable to me, and I worried (although I know it's unlikely) that it would slip apart and my baby would fall. Then I found the Moby. It took a few tries to get it right, but now I can tie it right every time, never too tight or too loose, in about a minute. It's much more comfortable than the snugli could ever be! I love how versatile it is. I'm working from home a couple days a week, and it's nice to be able to hold him and still be able to work. And when he's tired, I pop him into it and he's asleep in minutes. I couldn't ask for a better carrier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for front and side carries - too stretchy for back carries","review":"Our family loves the moby. Both my husband and I use it several times daily with our high-need son. But it's too stretchy for a safe back carry. Also, now that our son is 5 months old and squirmy, he can get out of it too easily when he wants to. If you use a wrap lots or really want a secure carrier, you might want to look for a woven wrap. Check here for more info on those, as well as suggestions for many more carries than are noted in the moby instruction booklet:[...] and[...] (Note, I don't have any affiliation with these websites)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more trick in your bag","review":"I have a pretty mellow baby who only gets cranky when he is tired and needs help to fall asleep. In the beginning I would always tie the wrap too loose because I didn't want to squeeze the baby. Then I started to wear it tighter. It takes a while until you figure out how tight to wear it to make it comfortable for yourself and your baby. I find it particularly helpful after I tried nursing, changing diapers, burping, and the crying baby only wants to be held. After my back and arms are sore and I start getting in a bad mood I get the moby wrap. When the baby is not happy in the wrap at first I try some bouncing until he relaxes. I always tighten the wrap while holding the baby. I've found it impossible to tighten it first and then put the baby in. It's always too loose or too tight. I would recommend this wrap as it's one more trick in a parent's bag to survive the first year of the baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"The moby wrap is a good product because I can take my baby around without putting too much weight on my back. The only issue is it keeps a lot of body heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Cool","review":"I like the MOBY a lot but it is a bit time consuming. Definitely put it on at home before you go anywhere because the ends will trail on the ground. My little man loves it but he also tries to escape from it. He is 6 weeks and doesn't like to have his head in it so that leaves me holding his head up, not hands free. Probably will be awesome when he is doing that himself. I really like that he is wrapped to me. Seems a lot less sterile than other baby carriers. Dad likes this too. I'll need to update this review as time goes on but all said and done I'm glad I spent the money because it cut out stroller hassles, allows me to feel close to him, lightweight and comfortable for travel on a plane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for a mother of 2, allows you to carry baby hands free","review":"I have a 4 year old as well as a 2 month old and have been challenged when io comes to spending time with my older child or simply doing chores around the house because my baby wants me to hold her. The Moby Wrap is the answer to all my problems. I have to say I read many reviews, spoke to mothers as well as out pediatrician and all recommended this product highly. I was hesitant to spend a good deal of money on a piece pf fabric but I thought what do I have to lose since the item could be returned. The Moby Wrap is worth every penny. It does take a few times to get the hang of putting it on but I did a few things that helped. 1. I watched You Tube Videos online of mothers donning the wrap. 2. put on my wrap in front of the mirror. 3. practices placing a toy doll in sling before my baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carrier but wish there was more head support","review":"I got this Moby wrap as a shower gift and started using it when my son was a week old. I first used the cradle position, but he hated having his head covered. When he was a few weeks older, putting him in the cradle position made him wrap around my body like a banana. Not comfortable looking and he fussed and kicked. Now that he's older (4 months) I can put him in the front position and he can hold his head up but when he falls asleep, his head still teeters over to one side and I need to use my hand to support his head. He can't seem to lean forward on my body for some reason, but he leans to either side. Even if I pull up the middle panel, the material stretched out in such a way that it doesn't support it anymore. Another downside is that the material is so long that its cumbersome to put on. Since my son was born in the summer, the Moby wrap would make him (and me!) very hot! Pros: it seems very versatile and doesn't hurt my back at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A soft wrap that works","review":"Unlike other soft baby wrap carriers (i.e., vs. the Baby Bjorn, which I call a \\"hard\\" carrier), you can actually feel safe leaving your baby in it hands-free. Yes, the yards of fabric are a little cumbersome, especially if you're outside and cannot find a clean place to drape the fabric. But I love the fact that I can hold a newborn practically upright in a hands-free mode.I owned one a while back that was a gift, and the new instruction booklet is much improved, with details on a breast-feeding hold (which I like), and exercises you can do with baby in the Moby Wrap."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"didn't like it at first at all.

Once you get it on properly it is very comfortable, and usually puts our 3 month old to sleep right away. We have a local hockey/ice arena that allows people to walk laps during the cold winter months, and I have never had a problem keeping her warm because she shares my body heat.If I had a complaint, it would be that it is somewhat complicated to wrap and tie, and generally requires some help to keep it from getting on the floor. This isn't a big deal in our house, but in public it can be difficult to keep the fabric from getting on the ground. That being said, its just something that takes a little practice, and the more we use it, the better we get at it. The fact that it is more versatile, and much more comfortable than the Baby Bjorn far outweighs the minor inconvenience factor.I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a baby carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby Wrap -- too much to wrap","review":"I bought the Moby Wrap, but I found it was too much to wrap and my crying baby doesn't have the patience for me to figure out how to wrap it. The material has to wrap around front to back, then flip over both your shoulders in a criss-cross f-f-fashion across your back, and then wrap again in front and knot it on your side (maybe not all in that order). I will try it again when she is 5 months old to see if I have figured it out by then.

It does get VERY hot with him in there so dress yourself and the baby appropriately. My son only seems to like it for about 20-30 mins. maximum.

Unfortunately my daughter wanted nothing to do with the cramped quarters and the way it forced her head down as a newborn. She has held her head up since day 2 and is quite the wiggle worm! It was just too constricting for her.Also, I don't think the Moby is practical anywhere but at home. The fabric is incredibly long and I'm not sure there is a way to put it on without some of it dragging on the ground. There is also so much fabric that it is like wearing another piece of clothing which is anything but ideal in the South during the summer months!We are currently using the Bjorn classic carrier which she has loved since day one but are in the researching stages of finding something more comfortable for my back."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby always falls asleep when wrapped up","review":"Watch the video on the moby website and youtube to learn how to tie this wrap.

This makes it difficult to put on when you're outside and don't want it to touch the ground.-it has the potential to be inconsistent, especially if you're in a hurry while putting it onPros:-once in, my baby seems comfortable, calm and usually falls asleep-it's easily washable (just throw the whole thing into the washing machine)-it's fairly comfortable, I can wear it for a few hours and my shoulders are only minimally sore-several carrying positions: baby can face in, face out and a the newborn position doesn't need an extra insert"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complex","review":"I can only get the wrap one way and the baby in the wrap one way.

I didn't end up using because I couldn't figure it out. It is not as user friendly as they make it seem. For me, it's always too loose or too tight. I would love to use it more but I can't figure it out. Also, since it uses your \\"whole back\\" it's supposed to be more comfortable but the times I've tried it out I always get back cramps. Perhaps it's because I can't tie it right. If you're going to get one, I suggest going somewhere to try it out first (like Babies R Us) and that way you can check out other carriers too. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great wrap, but not for heavier babies","review":"We bought a Moby for our 8 month old, when she outgrew another sling carrier we had. I was concerned it would be too stretchy to support her 25lbs. At first, it seemed to work out fine for us, but the more I used it with a hip carry and tried to carry her for longer walks, the Moby stretched a little too much for my liking. With the hip carry, I had to keep retying it because it stretched too much.It seems like a great product for newborns and even less heavy older babies. If yours is in the 95%+ or above for weight (ours is 8 months, 24-25lbs and 30.5 inches)I wouldn't recommend it for long-term carrying. I know that it says the Moby will support 35lbs, but it didn't work for 25lbs in our case. Moby makes a very, very expensive woven wrap that will support the weight of even heavy babies, but I'm going with Etsy.

We have returned the item and got one of the ready to go sets. The pictures are deceiving and they don't say this is just a piece of cloth and you have to fold around yourself.

I've tried every kind of wrap, sling or carrier, and the Moby wrap made me so uncomfortable I almost had to ask my husband to cut me out of it. First off, I'm tall and slender, and when I would wear my daughter in it, I looked pregnant again. It's so unflattering. Too bulky. Also, even in the dead of winter, it made me so hot I couldn't wear it. I'm sure I was having hot flashes because of breast feeding hormones, but isn't it inferred/implied that the woman wearing the Moby wrap might be breast feeding?! If you're looking for an easy way to wear your baby, IMO go for a ring sling. On a daily basis I use the Sakura Bloom linen slings. It takes a little practice, just like any baby carrier does, but once you get it you just slip your baby in and go. And you don't have to take it completely apart to take it off. And it won't make you look like you're twice your size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make your own wrap","review":"Whoever buys a moby wrap in these economic times is an idiot. Go to the fabric store, get 6 yards of stretch cotton, make it 2 feet wide and you have your self a moby wrap!!! HURRAY!!!! Its so awesome! You can then watch on youtube on how to wrap it. No way im paying 45 dollars for this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only use if you are an octopus!","review":"I was so excited to get this wrap. My baby constantly wanted to be held and I thought this would make us both happy. I was very wrong. It arrived and when I opened it I knew we were going to have issues. It came with a very thick instruction manual and the option to watch a video online. Still, I gave it a try. Many tries. The thing is very very long. First you have to fold it in half lengthwise, then you have to drape it this way and that way, pick up and position the baby, then wrap and tie it. Perhaps if I had eight arms or someone to help me, this would have worked. However, after using it a few times, I returned it. I opted for a more traditional type carrier that I could get the baby in and out of myself...with my own TWO arms :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh..its not the best","review":"I do believe I made a mistake buying this product! I did not think it was going to be extremely long to tie around. I didn't think to look at that when I bought it. I only bought it because the reviews said it was great and lightweight also it didnt hurt alot of others peoples backs. I really did not like it I think I will resale this. If it even is a good product to sale...anybody want it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never recieved the product.","review":"When I ordered this product I was very excited! During check out, I left my old address on the shipment and didn't notice until a day later. I was upset! I decided to email the seller to see if there was any way they could cancel it. They replied with a ride e-mail. I understand that they can't refund a product that has already been shipped, but I did not show that it had been. I replied to the e-mail stating that I would not reccomend this company's services and recieved a string of personal attacks! Calling me unstable! I am extremely dissapointed in the lack of professionalism. I would not order from this company again. I can't believe I've been attacked over an order. And they still got paid! DO NOT order your moby from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a MUMMY WRAP","review":"Its horrible, I dont know why anyone would pay 40 bucks for a length of fabric you need to wrap yourself and the baby up with.Beware, if you do not do it correctly and tie a good knot, the baby will fall out."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsafe","review":"I've been struggling getting the wrapping right on this - it's just a really long piece of fabric and a book of instructions about the various ways to wrap it around yourself to form a sling. Sometimes the baby has adequate head support, sometimes I basically support her with my free arm to make sure her head doesn't snap back, or to make sure she doesn't have her chin too close to her chest. Anyway, I was just doing some work around the house and thought the baby's head was secure, but it wasn't, and her head snapped backwards, hard, out of the wrap. I am so upset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"Even though it comes with instructions, it is way too complicated to use. I was hoping to use it around the house but you need to know some acrobatics and balancing skills to get the baby securely in this thing. Not to mention, it shrunk 2 feet after I washed it (following the instructions, mind you). Now I have to tighten it in the back versus the front. It's now destined for the donation pile. The Baby Bjorn is easier to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"There's a little bit of a learning curve with this, but with a little practice you find out what's too tight or too loose or whatever. Instructions are pretty clear. Not much to it, you just have to wear it a few times to get used to it. If you leave the cloth wide across your back, then it helps give more support.Otherwise it holds the baby great. Our baby usually falls asleep in it. My husband carries her around in it all the time. He uses it around the house and out in public. It much more versatile than something like a Baby Bjourn.Its also more accommodating to different body types. We got a Baby Bjourn as a shower gift, but it wouldn't fit over my very ample chest. My husband likes to carry her on his chest, whereas I like to carry her farther down, more by my stomach, this makes it possible to do both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby wrap","review":"I love the Moby wrap, it's comfortable and there's so many ways to wear it. The only problem I've found is it's very warm, so make sure you and baby are dressed lightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entirely too complicated","review":"This was entirely too complicated use it a whopping 2 times. I would spend 20 minutes each time trying to place it and my baby correctly and still did not feel safe carrying her around in it. Conceptually it seems awesome, but way too much work than i really want to spend when there are other products that are cheaper, faster, easier, and that my baby liked more. I preferred a baby carrier instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I read such great reviews on this product, and I was really excited at the idea that I could carry my baby and breastfeed discreetly and hands-free! Unfortunately, learning to put it on and having the time and space to tie the damn thing was ridiculous. As a new mom, time is non-existent. I needed something that I could put on and just go! In the end, I reverted back to my Baby Bjorn carrier. My suggestion is to ask around, even try a few out before purchasing if you can. Save yourself the waste of time and money to see if you will actually use the thing. Gonna be posting mine on Craigslist now."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY! VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I read so many good reviews on this and bought it. Very very disappointed and pissed off. The baby didn't like it. It was too uncomfortable for him. He was barely a month old. The material is sooo bad. My husband washed it and came back shrunk! I couldn't wrap it around my waist anymore and I'm not a big girl. I'm average size. I just lost $60 bucks for this crap. Better to buy a real baby carrier at BabiesRUs or something. They should make this preshrunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"size matters","review":"I like the idea and was excited but it did not fit. I wish they would make different sizes.

Granted, we only practiced with it a few times but in my opinion, if I need to practice with something, with a newborn in my house, it's not user friendly. Thus, we gave up on it and returned it for something we could easily just throw her in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us","review":"I was very excited about this modern \\"rebozo.\\" I thought I would love it. But when it came down to it, my baby HATED it. He cried every time I attempted to put him in. I didn't particularly like it, either. It was hard to put on and I couldn't deal with wrapping so much heavy fabric around me. Once on, it was hot and overall felt like a straight jacket. For the price, I would give it a try, it might work for you as for so many people, apparently. If not, I would recommend an Ergo Baby. (But I can't comment on the newborn insert though, since I got it when my baby was already 6 months old.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute MUST HAVE for a new baby","review":"We tried another sling for our first baby, and when we discovered the Mobi we found out how inferior all other slings are.The Mobi isn't a sling; it's a wrap. The way the wrap works (which is described in the instructions that come with the Mobi means that the baby is held securely, close to mom in a way that makes it impossible for them to fall out, while supporting them in a way that is safe. Our Mobi wrap was recommended by our pediatrician, and she was right!We've shared this with other new parents, and every one of them has loved it as well. After using ours, I know at least three other families who later bought a Mobi.You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty Annoying Wrap","review":"The long wrap drags all over the ground and picks up whatever disgusting ick is on the ground. Imagine putting this wrap on in a store, parking lot, camping, park,playground or even at home where it will pick up lint, pet hair, carpet fibers, etc. And then imagine wrapping the disgusting ick all over your body and your baby.It takes a lot of time to wrap it around your body and multiple adjustments to get it feeling right. Then, when you put the baby in, you have to readjust again for the baby. If you have to do this while the baby is fussing or crying you will be going out of your mind. And if it is warm out, you will get all hot and sweaty.Basically, the wrap is dirty and annoying. I'd rather just carry the baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much too figure out","review":"I recommend this product before your baby arrives. Trying to figure it out with a newborn is no fun. Honestly it's a huge pain to put on!! It's super long and I'm a skinny person. I also have zero patients. I also felt like I couldn't get it tight enough and didnt feel safe putting my baby in it! But that's just me and lots of people use the moby and love it. It's just not for me. I tried various products and the only thing my baby will sit in is a balboa sling! Used safely and properly of course. Good luck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loooooong learning curve..","review":"My daughter is still settling down from 3 failed attempts. I am a very coordinated guy. I can figure out anything. I swear I can pack 3 car loads of groceries into one.I watched the videos then tried to get her in. Mind you she is a very quiet baby, cries only for the basics, diaper, hungry ect. First try she was upset, second she was distraught, third she was clearly pissed.If you can figure this out your a genius. God bless you and the week you took to do it.I gave it two stars because I found a wonderful use for it. I cut it up into blanket sizes and the elastic properties make them into wonderful swaddles. Heck I might just by more for that. I mean it is what 15 feet long."},{"rating":"1","title":"THe worst.","review":"This thing is like 10 feet long and super hot.

It's comfortable and convenient. Much better than the old Snugli frontpack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and comfortable","review":"I bought this wrap because I had problems with wrists, so I can get some weight off my hands. It served well.The wrap is comfortable to wear and has many options how to wrap it (you can even use your own ideas). My baby really calms down in it and falls asleep deeply.The only disadvantage is that the fabric is a bit heavy, so you need to dress lighter not to overheat yourself or the baby. It's also a little too long and difficult to put on, so you either pull the end on the floor or end up being wrapped so tightly that it's impossible to put the baby down without wakening him up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have!!!","review":"I bought this product after reading how other baby carriers were bad for babies' hip development and spines. Let me just say it is wonderful. This is my first review ever, that's how good it is. I bought it for my four month old and she loves it too. I carry her around with me and still have my hands free to do everyday tasks. Babies are meant to be held, not left in carriers!

I wish I had gotten one that wasn't so complicated to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated","review":"I bought this because of all the great reviews. When I received mine, I was surprised at how complicated and time consuming it is to put on. It is basically a long piece of fabric that you need to wrap around yourself. Since a lot of parents seem to be happy with this sling, I'm wondering if it's just me that finds it too fussy to use. Being made of cotton, I can see how this can be comfortable for the baby. However, if you are like me who wants to put a sling on easily and quickly, I would suggest going the Baby Bjorn route."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating beyond belief","review":"I am so disappointed in this ridiculously long piece of fabric. It is soft and the sand color is pretty, but thats it! It drags on the floor and you have to spend time adjusting it so it isnt tangled.I still cant get it to crisscross properly w/out the front hanging all over the place. I am not happy and would never recommend it. There are less complicated wraps out there I will try. Waste of $$$!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointing","review":"We were less than impressed with this product. While it's functional, it's not always the most practical carrier. If you're in public, trying to put on this EXTREMELY long piece of fabric is hard to manage and difficult to keep from dragging the ground. We wanted it for trips into the grocery store, etc. so we wouldn't have to use the car seat as our son's getting heavy and the car seat takes up a lot of room in the buggy. But to stand in the parking lot of a grocery store trying to manipulate this piece of fabric without letting it touch the ground is not easy. I guess we're just a couple of germophobes, but if something touches the ground in a parking lot, we not putting it next to our baby's face."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not for us.","review":"A friend suggested we purchase this. She had one and loved it, but it was not for me. I spent an hour attempting to figure out how to put the stupid thing on before I just gave up. It is crazy long. I'm petite, (5'2 and 110 pounds). I could wrap the \\"extra\\" around my waist 3 times. I did eventually sort of get the wrap on only to discover my baby hated it. He kicked and wiggled the entire time. I ended up ordering a Bjorn, which I love. If you are short, I would think twice about getting this."},{"rating":"1","title":"multiple yards of fabric is HOT!!!!","review":"Loved the product, it felt comcortable especially with baby in it.

I wish I would have gotten one when my first child was born. I love that my baby's weight is distributed evenly so that even after walking around a zoo for HOURS I was not hurting, even just 4 weeks after a c-section!I also have to say that the shipping from this seller specifically was amazingly fast! I had my order in TWO days. I was thrilled!There are only two \\"cons\\" that I can see and one is the price, fourty dollars for what is basically a long piece of fabric is pretty steep. If you know how to sew, find out the dimensions, get some fabric and make one yourself for about 75% less money.The other is that living in a very warm climate, the fabric that the Moby wrap is made from is a little thick for comfort. The other wrap that I have (wrap n wear) is made from crinkle cotton and it's much lighter and more comfortable in the heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"I originally bought a hotsling for my infant and she did not like the cradle carry which was the only way you could carry an infant. I bought the Moby Wrap because she loves being held upright. She loves the moby wrap! My husband uses the baby bjorn which i also did not like because it was giving me backaches. I think the moby wrap distributes her weight better and causes no pain while wearing it or after its use. Once you get used to knowing how to tie it, its great and i can fit it in her baby bag (although it takes up a good amount of room and i have to be selective on what else goes in) unlike the bjorn so whenever i need it, i can just pull it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"not practical","review":"It's useful in the house, but not practical for anything else. If I wear it out on a walk with the baby, we are both sweating (i tend to be cold, but there really is a lot of fabric!). I can't use it outside the house because it drags on the floor when you are trying to put it on (which can be difficult by yourself as it is). But if you are in your clean air-conditioned house, it is useful especially for newborns. My two month old does not like it unless she is nursing to sleep, but then I always wake her up getting her out! So, useful but in limited settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't say enough good things about the Moby !","review":"An essential pice of baby equipment and the most comfortable of all the carriers I have tried.

I bought it when my daughter was 2 months old. She was always fussy during supper time so I simply put her in the wrap and she would sleep the whole time I was making supper for my family. I also use this wrap when I'm shopping since my carseat does not fit properly in the shopping carts. This wrap keeps curious strangers from touching my baby as she is all covered up! This wrap is comfortable to wear, it does take a couple of times practicing to figure out how to use it, but distributes weight evenly! I also like all the different positions to choose from."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!","review":"If I could give this item over 5 stars, I would!! It's fabulous! The Moby Wrap has made my life soooo much easier. I was unsure of whether my baby (3 months/17 lbs) would enjoy this but he adores it, as do I!

Get it, get it, get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for New Babies!!!!!!","review":"There really is no other way to love and nurture your newborn baby like you can with a baby wrap carrier. I bought a similar handmade wrap from another website, and while I got to pick the fabric and the pattern, it in no way can compare to this wrap! With the Moby wrap, I love the finished edges, the tapered ends, the length and the width. My 8 week old baby feels very secure and snug in it all day long =) Makes for a very happy household!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice fabric","review":"The Pacific color is gorgeous! and the wrap works as advertised but my little guy only likes it for short periods of time and won't fall asleep in it so it hasn't worked out as well as I had hoped.

But it was a pain to get in and out of and the fabric dragged on the ground. Just not cool in dirty parking lots. I found myself constantly fiddling with it since it didn't seem like it was on right, or the baby looked like she was in crooked, or her head needed support, etc. It was also tough on my back and the baby was only 7#. I used it a few times and ended up with a Baby Bjorn, which was much easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality but not made for small people","review":"I bought a Moby Wrap after much research about babywearing and slings. The product is very good quality and I really wanted it to work but it really isn't made for small people. I'm barely 5 ft. tall and about 100 lbs. and it just didn't work. The fabric is overwhelming and I could never get it to wrap like in the photos or online videos. The large amount of fabric totally enveloped me and not in a good way. I'm sure this is a great product for more average sized people, but I recommend that petite moms get a more traditional sling rather than a wrap-style one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slips and slides_Baby didn't feel secure","review":"We chose the Moby Wrap and the Baby Bjorn before the birth of our son. Our pediatrician advised us not to use either really until our baby could hold his neck up. The exception was if we used the Moby wrap in an infant style hold.After using the Moby, I would not recommend it for three reasons:1. Slips and comes undone if you are moving much or on the go. This means you are constantly adjusting and readjusting and worrying if your child is going to slip and fall out of the wrap.2. Awkward to put on and take off.3. Baby's head constantly slips down under the folds and you worry about your baby being able to get enough air.When our son could hold his head up, we started using the Baby Bjorn and never looked back."},{"rating":"2","title":"mobywrap","review":"I love love love this thing.

I ended up purchasing the moby and I recieved a sleepy wrap as a gift. They arfe both wrap style carriers but the big difference is that I think the sleepy wrap is a bit cooler and I live in south Texas, so any little bit helps, another thing is that with the moby I felt as though I had to constantly re-adjust my baby. The Moby is a pretty good product I just perfer the sleepy wrap. I will say that it is a bit confusiong to wrap at 1st but once you get the hang of it, its very quick.

I found it difficult to figure out, not as comfortable as I thought it would be, and too time consuming to get in and out of. I think it might be good if you aren't looking for anything quick and you have someone help you put it on the first few times. A one piece carrier that just snaps into place like the Ergo or Baby Bjorn seems to be easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I'd only known!","review":"I ordered the Moby for my 3rd baby, heard it was \\"hands free\\", and I need my hands to wrangle my 2 year old and 4 year old. I LOVE this thing! My baby is now about 5 weeks old, and he sleeps as soon as I get him into his wrap, a head adjustment here and there is all it takes and he'll stay there peacefully for a couple of hours straight. You can do housework, shopping, play time, whatever you need to do, with out using your hands or arms to support baby. It's not hard to put on, just takes a little practice! I have 2 other carriers, the \\"back pack\\" type you can wear front or back, and both of those give me a back ache in short order. The Moby Wrap puts absolutely no strain on back or shoulders, seriously. If I'd known how awesome it is I'd have had one with my first baby. If you're on the fence, GET IT. It's well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands Free Must!","review":"I purchased the Moby while pregnant with my 3rd. She was born in July, I already had a 4 1/2 year old and a 15 month old. I needed my hands free! The Moby allowed me to do that without a doubt. Whether it be just chores around the house or going to the zoo. It sure served its purpose. I had a Hotsling with my 2nd, though it was more convinent to just \\"throw\\" on, it was not comfortable for me nor did my baby stay in it long. The Moby is kind of a pain to get used to. It's A LOT of material, but once you get the hang of it, life couldn't get much more simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"More complicated than it should be!","review":"I ordered this carrier because it had promising reviews and seemed less intimidating than the Bjorn carriers. What a mistake. Putting this thing on is very very involved, and its also very hot. On top of it all, my baby was completely squished when inside it, and hated it. Get the Bjorn (or something analgous) they are actually easier to use, and a lot more ergonomic for you and for your baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Moby!","review":"For the first three months of our little ones life this was my MUST HAVE item. Now, at 6 months, we don't use it as much but still bring it with us just in case. It was a great way to not only give me free hands to do things with my older two, but also to keep my little one close. I never really like nursing in it as the baby seemed to get way too hot and that made him not want to eat as much, but we used it to carry him ALL DAY long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but...","review":"This was exactly what I was looking for. It is a great idea but it was too much material.I really tried hard to make this wrap work but it was quite difficult putting the baby into the wrap.

I was disappointed when I got the product only to discover I could've used my king size flat sheet for nothing instead of this piece of fabric for $40. If you have time to practice the various techniques, you may like this product. But if you're like me, and you don't have time to practice & want to use it right away, you'd be better off with the Baby Bjorn or something similar. Seriously, I think a flat sheet could do the same thing as this product. Very disappointing for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning Curve","review":"I got this as a shower gift on the recommendation of a friend. Eventually we loved it. There is a big learning curve and the directions are not as helpful as they could be. I started tying it in the manner the directions suggested but my baby never seemed to be secure in it. After several frustrated sleep deprived days I called my friend for advice. The directions say that you should start at your waist and wrap. This might work for a bigger, older baby but it won't work for a newborn. Start at your diaphram and tie it pretty tight. After a while you'll get a feel for how tight you need it for your baby. I really started to like it when she was about 5 weeks old. From about 5 weeks to about 12 weeks that was the only place she would take a nap.

Even then, I found it way too complicated. I read the book, watched all the videos, had people help me. I loved the idea of the Moby Wrap, but it was too much fabric and took too long to put on. I ended up getting an Ergo, and could not be happier. I can put my baby in the Ergo in a snap and it feels much sturdier than the Moby did.

It relives pressure off of my back and evens out my sons weight perfectly. The best part is I can continue to do household activities like vacuuming and computer work while my son is sleeping. The closeness that the moby wrap brings is great comfort to me and probably my son as well. He also can probably hear my heart beat which is also comforting. I've used it since he was just days old and he is now 9 months and still enjoys it. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for comfort, back relief, loves snuggling your little one, and also enjoys getting a little work done if your little one does not like to be put down all the time. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds baby close, but has a learning curve","review":"This sling does a good job holding your baby up and close to you so that you are hands-free and can do almost anything that doesn't require a lot of leaning over: laundry, washing dishes, getting dinner ready. However, having used this for 2-3 weeks on my newborn (nearly 7 weeks old now), I have to say there is a learning curve and we are still on it. Sometimes the baby slides in great, other times it's a struggle to get him positioned correctly so that his head is supported correctly and he is not in danger of squirming his way out. It took 3-4 tries for me to be able to get him in the first time. (Tip: walk around jouncing the baby up and down until he is eased into the sling. Don't try to put him in all at once.) Getting the correct position is a negotiation between the sling, your baby and where the slack in the sling falls.) When the baby is positioned correctly though, it's great! I can just throw a large coat over both of us and head out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Carrier!","review":"I purchased this wrap based on reviews on Amazon. The sales clerk at the store assisted me in tying for the first time. After purchase I took it home and used the instruction manual once to put it on once more and haven't needed to look at the instructions again. I find it easy to use. My 3 week old infant loves it and falls asleep quickly. I also have the Baby Bjorn with lumbar support but my son does not seem to like this as much.

But, this is now my new favorite carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wrap For Beginers and Veterans Alike...","review":"This is a nice comfy stretchy wrap, your baby will love it. Despite what the instructions say veteran baby wearers know that stretchy wrap tend to get uncomfortable once the baby starts to get heavy, also, even though the instructions say you may wear your baby on your back in this wrap, as someone that has been babywearing for several years now, I am going to say IT IS NOT SAFE IN A STRETCHY WRAP!!! Your baby could lean back and fall out. If you want to do back carries in a wrap buy a woven wrap!This wrap molds around you baby and they will snuggle down in it and go to sleep! Which means you can still get done all the things busy parents need to do. I love this wrap for the first few months.

Pulled out the Moby and fought the 12 foot long unmanageable contraption that when finally put together properly (which seemed to take much longer than I remembered when I tried it before baby was born) the baby screamed the whole time and in the end I was exhausted, muscles strained and the baby hated it and spit up all over me and him and the Moby several times.I have always been good with instructions and putting things together and taking them apart. I'm not one of those people that can't handle something complicated. If your are taller than 5'2 then maybe the yards of fabric won't be so unmanageable and suffocating.

I returned it and bought some thing else that we both can wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Didn't Like It & Confusing","review":"With all of those wonderful reviews, my wife bought the wrap for our cranky 7-week old baby. Unfortunately, we returned it right away. The procedure to wrap and unwrap is a bit complicated and your baby needs to be pretty comfortable just \\"hanging out\\" while you hold him/her and spin the fabric around you. Speaking of which the product is literally just a long roll of fabric, cut to the proper dimensions of course and made from really soft material, but their is no magic happening here. Unfortunately we ended up returning this product after two days of failed attempts to really get the wrap snug and the baby didn't really enjoy being in any of the positions suggested in the manual. A bit disappointed because the baby does enjoy being in \\"standard\\" carriers with buckles and clamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby hates this.","review":"It could just be my little one, and you may have better luck, but I wish I hadn't wasted the money on this. I tried it several different times during her first month of life. The \\"cradle hold\\" she cried in and I could never get her to the correct position so that her chin wasn't on her chest. The other hold, the \\"newborn hug hold\\" she would tolerate, but only if her head was out, so I'd end up supporting her head with one hand, so I wasn't totally hands free. Now I'm stuck with and over-priced long piece of fabric. Maybe we'll try it again later when she has head control, but I ordered the Ergo today and have a feeling she and I are going to love it!Another thing to think about: the fabric drags the floor when you are putting it on. Not an issue in your own home, but when you are out....ewww."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for preemies","review":"I bought this wrap because the description said it was good for any size baby up to 35 pounds, including preemies.

When you are out and about, the last thing you want is to have to put that stinkin thing on because the fabric is so long, it drags on the floor as you put it on. Once on, it begins to ride up my torso, so I'm constantly pulling the wrap down. It really only works when your baby faces your chest, however, my daughter dislikes that position. I'm gonna try a Bjorn, which is what I should have just gotten to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"I got one of these as a gift and was excited to use it...until I tried to use it. I have followed the instructions, watched videos etc and I despise the Moby Wrap. It is awkward to fold (or even to bunch up) awkward/annoying to put on and my baby HATES it. Also, I overheat even when it's 65F outside while wearing it. Once it's on, I can't wait to take it OFF.I'm going to save up for an Ergo carrier, fits my lifestyle MUCH better than the Moby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy, affordable, versitile","review":"I used this wrap with my newborn and he is now 14 months and we STILL use it! Last night at the basketball game daddy carried him around on his back for hours.

She likes it better than the backpack style of baby carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Baby carrier","review":"I like the Moby wrap, but I know it can be confusing to put on. My son is 2.5 months and I still don't tie it correctly sometimes. He liked it a lot when he was 2 weeks old, but then hated it until about 8 weeks. I'm not sure if I was tying it too tightly, or what his problem was, but we finally are making it work most of the time. However, he's about 15 lbs now and is starting to get to heavy for it. I can support him just fine, but if I don't tie it tight enough in the beginning he starts to sag. But I have to be careful with how tightly I tie it, because otherwise he'll complain when I first put him in.It's great for walks - it puts him to sleep about 5-10 min into our walk. I feel like he's secure it in. I just wish I could use it for a longer time. I'm sure it'll work great for my next child, now that I know what I'm doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very practical...","review":"I really wanted to like this product. Maybe I didn't try it enough or give it enough effort, but it was very frustrating to figure out how to tie it and even when I got it I didn't like it.I tried to use this on a vacation where we did a lot of walking. I am 5'2 and it was just way to much fabric, and in the heat of florida it was a torture to wear. I ended up using a stroller 90% of the time and I really didn't want to.A few months later when my son went through a phase where he didn't want to be put down, I tried using this again around the house and It just wasn't secure. My son is a pretty big baby and it just was not comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favority baby holder","review":"This worked pretty well when my baby was a newborn because he didn't mind facing towards me, but even then he would get tired of the wrap and scream out in protest to get out of it pretty quickly. I'm wondering if he got too hot. I got annoyed with having to undo the whole thing after I only got about 15 minutes of wear time out of it, so I really didn't use it much. Plus, we have 4 dogs and 3 cats, so there is always some animal hair on the ground that the wrap picks up during the wrapping process. Now that my baby is 4 months old and only wants to face forwards or looking over my shoulder when being held so that he can see what is going on, the only option is the \\"Lotus\\" wrap, which is awkward to get just right. I hate feeling like I am just cramming my baby's legs into the front flap like a little pretzel and expecting his contorted little legs to take some of his weight. I am a physical therapist and therefore very cognizant of joint development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult to use, waste of money","review":"I decided to buy the Moby wrap after reading all the great reviews. It must be great, right? Wrong! As soon as I unrolled it I knew I was in trouble! The directios aren't the easiest to follow, and it's hard to manage over 8 feet of fabric. By the time I managed to properly put on the wrap and then wrangle my 6-week old daughter into it, she was screaming. Over the course of the day, I tried several different holds with the wrap (some I never did figure out how to do, and I have a college degree so it's not my lack of intelligence). Each time my daughter was crying hysterically by the time I got her in. I pulled my Baby Bjorn out and she loves it. I'd save my money and buy a simple, easy to use carrier like Baby Bjorn.

I have looked all over the web for more instructions on this but nothing helps.Also, I think this product is a bit too pricey for just buying a piece of material~ because thats all that it is!!

It was also hot and took so much to wrap and unwrap everytime.Cute, but inconvenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It for High Maintenance Babies","review":"The extra 30 seconds it takes to put on this wrap is absolutely worth it! My daughter was one of those kids who was constantly crying unless they were being held, she wouldn't take naps in her crib until over 6 months old, so I ended up toting her with me everywhere I went. Other carriers gave me intense backaches, but I could wear the Moby for hours straight and not even feel it. Once she hit about 7-8 months she was too big and too wiggly, but I used it almost every day until that point.It did take me a little while to figure out how to adjust the wrap so everyone was comfortable, but once I got it, it saved me so much time and backache. If you are looking for a casual carrier that you will only wear once and awhile, this is probably too much work and too bulky.

To cut down on baggage, I did not want to bring a stroller or car seat, but I still needed a hands-free way to carry my 7-month old through the airport. The Moby wrap was great. I was able to carry my 18+ pound baby around several aiports without any back pain! My daughter loved being in the wrap. I used a front-facing technique so she could look around. The instruction booklet comes with detailed steps on how to do the different wraps. Be sure to practice the different wrapping techniques at home (with the baby) before taking the Moby out in public. One word of caution, the wrap is VERY long, so with my 5'3\\" frame, the wrap did end up touching the ground while I was putting it on (hence the 4-star rating). Also, I was allowed to walk through airport security with the baby in the wrap, on my chest (but I didn't think that was permissible)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't work for me.","review":"This is another item I was so excited to get, from the reviews, and from the different ways you can carry your baby that it provides.However, once I received it and started trying to use it, it's just a mess.I read the instructions over and over and watched You Tube.I have everything correct, but once I had the baby in it, he always looked like he's getting smothered.So I don't know what I'm doing wrong and I'm too sleep deprived to investigate.The very few times I tried to use it,a) My baby would cry more because he's doesn't like his arms and legs constricted (I know, not really Moby's fault)b) Once, I was standing and all of a sudden his head just lunged forward and almost hit the corner of the table!

I started using it while still in the hospital so I could have skin-to-skin contact with my daughter without being constantly exposed. She loved it immediately, and she sleeps very soundly in it. Now that she's 3 weeks old, I credit the Moby Wrap for enabling me to get things done. I can tidy up the house because it keeps my hands free and her securely snuggled next to me. She'll easily sleep for four hours in the wrap. If we put her in her co-sleeper, we're lucky if she stays down for 45 minutes. I even use it at nighttime so we can sleep together without me having to worry about blankets smothering her or rolling on top of her. My only advice is to buy at least two. It's a challenge in our household to only have one wrap, because it has to be washed some time -- and I'm hesitant to be without it for any stretch of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I ordered this after a friend of mine told me about how much her baby loves it.

The wrap is very long about 5 or 6 feet so if your a thin person it's a lot of material. It would take about 3-5 minutes to put on, and if your baby is crying, that's an eternity! I could never get my baby in it in less than 2 minutes, again too complicated to slip a squirming baby in to this. Once in it, I never felt that he was secure, I always had to keep one hand on him, which defies the purpose of the thing to begin with. Then if he fell asleep in it, I could never get him out of it without waking him. I only used it half a dozen times and finally gave it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby saved our sanity!","review":"I am not sure how we would have dealt with our son's colic without the Moby wrap.

I used this all of maybe 6 times. There is a lot fabric, it can be cumbersome. It's also hot and my son who weighed 8 lb 12 oz at birth never could fit comfortably in it. It was probably a user error but I never could get him adjusted correctly. It was either too loose and he would slide down or too tight. He did not enjoy this wrap and if he would let me carry him in it, he could take it for about an hour and no more than that. The idea of this is great, just not for us.

Overall, not as good as the previous 'Play', but far better than the overbloated radio remix of current single 'I'm Real'."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you are about to build a boat","review":"The book really contains everything you need to know on the subject and is regarded, rightfully so, as the standard reference.

The nautical vernacular is a learning curve, but all in all a solid read, and adds a lot of detail (i.e. Chine Log, or Shear, etc.. make much more sense to me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Directions","review":"Although there is a good variety of trails in this book, I got lost every time I used it. The directions were not unclear- they were completely wrong. The book was written in 1995 so maybe some of the roads have changed, but there has to be a more reliable book out there. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"very mediocre","review":"I picked this up because it looked like it was a new angle for a fantasy novel. However, the first time I tried to read it I never got past chapter three because it lacked depth, and the continually changing viewpoint made it tedious to read. I picked it up again last week however, and slogged my way through the entire thing.I was unable to reach any rapport with the characters except possibly for Evayne, and her role mostly raises questions. All of the other characters are two-dimensional and indecipherable.The book raises lots of questions it doesn't answer, particularly with regard to the Hunter/Huntbrother relationship and the customs and conventions of their homeland. Another major question mark is Evayne and her role. She promises to bring interest and empathy into the novel, but doesn't live up to that promise.I do not recommend this book unless you want to fail to enjoy empathy with under-developed characters in a circular plot that goes nowhere and ends in a cliffhanger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read!","review":"When I first bought a book from Michelle West it was the second in this Duology.

Who the hell cares about a bunch of dogs hunting!I did however, still read the book and was suprised with what I found. I really like the the book! I even read it again, right after the first time I read it. The reason that I read it again was because of all the unanswered questions that I had from the first time. I was able to find some of the answers but hopefully the series is able to clear up a couple more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy","review":"The process was a snap.

After so many years of hearing what a great movie it was, I finally broke down and watched it. It was not the uplifting story I expected.I gave it two stars only because of the talent of some of the actors. The story, however, left a lot to be desired. You watch all these talented (and some not so talented) kids try to get in this school for the performing arts and learn their respective crafts. You begin to take interest in some of their lives and can't wait to see how things turn out for them. Well, guess what, you're never going to know. Based on the mostly dark mood of the movie and the promising alumnus we later see waiting tables, the chance for actual fame for any of them seems slim to none. Basically, your hopes build up for some of these characters, but you're just left hanging.

What you get is a tour of the actual school in New York - that the film makers weren't even given permission to use in the film!O.k. kids, but again, not the real deal. Couldn't Warner's track down these people to sit for interviews and reminices like other DVDs (A Christmas Story)?

The movie was great for that - but some of the R-rated scenes were even hard on me. I do not know if I will watch the movie again soon. As a presentation of 'what it's like' to enter one of these firecely competitive schools, it was very good; and as a sober revealer of how much anger, disappointment and immorality there is in such a society, it was great. It was a much ROUGHER version of \\"STEP UP\\" (the movie). For parents considering putting their kids into performing arts high schools - it's probably informative, and not too far off.

Some of the scenes and sounds are good visuals and some are just plain stupid....like a scene of a cat sleeping or cartoon sheep jumping a fence.....a few others I find fairly entrancing. The main problem I found was that the visuals, clouds, etc., moved much too fast. I was able to slow them down with my DVD controls but that cuts out the sound and the motion was good at a 1/7 speed. But my real problem was that, even with my TV adjusted to it's lowest light level, the visuals were far too bright and lit up the room. One should be able to have them very dim as the room is darkened for sleep! I simply can't believe the producers of this DVD ever tried it and believed it works.

It focuses too much on espresso carts considering it didn't represent itself as being for that (if that's what you want to do, it'll be more helpful) and even goes so far as to be condescending at times - reminding you to be polite in challenging a demonstrator to pull a better shot of espresso if the first one is lacking.

He admits that he is not a Mormon, but he found Joseph Smith an intersting person. After reading the book I can see that Remini does like Joseph Smith, yet he didn't appear to write the book to raise him up, nor tear him down.As a member of the Church myself, a lot of the information he presents is from Church sources, and I've read a lot of it before. But I really enjoyed the material he gave from other sources. I got a feel for Joseph Smith as a person, which, like all prophets since Adam, he really was. I would recommend this book to members and non-members alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as unbiased as claimed","review":"The auther says this is an unbiased historical statement of facts, with no bias for or against Joseph Smith. All information presented against Joseph Smith is presented as factual while all information in favor of Joseph is presented as unfounded opinion or passed off as \\"according to Smith...\\". I believe the author tried to look into Josephs life, but was extremely resistant to accept any information in favor of Joseph Smith. It was quite dissapointing to listen to on tape. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Though Remini makes a sincere attempt to objectively evaluate a prominent religious figure, the work is poorly written, poorly researched, and quite dull. Remini commits a myriad of chronological mistakes, spelling errors, and factual missteps that are glaring to both LDS and non-LDS audiences. It appears as though this brief work was rushed to the press without thorough historical analysis. He also uses a number of questionable sources with dubious authenticity.Remini frequently inserts a variety of wild conjectures without appropriate justification or explanation. He also makes an obvious effort to link Joseph Smith with other subjects that Remini has intensely studied (e.g. the Jacksonian era), however irrelevant the connection. On the whole, I regard this book as very low quality among biographical works, particularly in the examination of a complex religious figure that demands a more rigorous approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoughtful but ignores too much church history/RLDS","review":"I admire the author's thoughtful words, but by ignoring the Reorganized LDS church, which the Prophet's son Joseph Smith III founded in 1860 with Emma Smith's assistance, a huge part of church history goes unmentioned. The RLDS (now called Community of Christ) has in it's headquarters in Independence MO, two portraits, one of Joseph Smith Jr, and one of his wife Emma Smith. I believe these were painted during Joseph's lifetime, thereby making the statement in the back of this book's jacket that the cover portrait is the only one painted during Joseph's lifetime inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is a pretty boring account of Joe's life and his founding of the Church of Mormon.

Most good biographies are more balanced than this one so we can learn more about the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for being short","review":"This is a very good short biography by a great historian. Remini is very fair in his interpretation of Joseph Smith. Remini basically tells the story of Joseph Smith as Joseph Smith himself told it. Remini being an expert on the period that Smith was born in makes his opinions of what influenced Smith very convincing. The only reason I rate this only a four star is it is very short and leaves out a lot of details. But if all your looking for is basic knowledge on the life of Joseph Smith I highly recommend this book. For a more detailed book on his life I would recommend \\"Joseph Smith the First Mormon\\" by Donna Hill as Remini himself recommends in his bibliography. Currently there are other biographies being worked on about Joseph Smith which will further our understanding of his complex life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've read","review":"It is hard to find a book on Mormonism that doesn't push for or against its truth. I think this is a good book for a non-Mormon looking for a balanced portrayal of Joseph Smith or for a Mormon open to an outsider's view. I enjoyed this book because I didn't feel like I was being led to a conclusion, but left to make up my own mind about Joseph Smith. This is one of the best books I've read on Mormonism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old school","review":"If you like old school 80s with some powerful and in your face lyrics this is a must have.

I used this cable to connect my antenna to my house over the roof. The construction quality is not bad, however it starts peeling in just a couple of days. The flexibility of this cable is not the best because I tried to screw on the cable into the antenna and it was very hard. The reason it was hard because it was not flexible enough to get under the antenna and screw on. This is why I rate a two star. Because of this I had problems with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cable to nowhere","review":"This arrived and looked like a nicely made, strong cable. It was easy to install.

It takes a while to get started, but once it gets going, it's amazing! My copy is falling apart because seven different people have read it. It's one of those books that is so realistic it's difficult to return to reality after reading a few chapters. I read it when I was a child, but didn't understand it until later. My best friend and I created a make-believe world based on Unicorn Highway. We were so positive that one day Infinity would come gallopping through the woods in her back yard and take us both for the ride of a lifetime. There was a shack near my house that to us, looked exactly like Mr. Tucker's house in the book, and we felt like part of our childhood was taken away when the city demolished that shack last winter. Unicorn Highway is a remarkable book! Get your hands on a copy as soon as possible! You don't know what you're missing if you haven't read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you believe in magic?","review":"NOT just another unicorn story, this fine first novel casts a rich golden glow that lingers with the reader. As much Americana as fantasy novel, \\"Unicorn Highway\\" makes such phrases as \\"heartwarming\\" and \\"uplifting\\" seem fresh and new again. Fans of both \\"Field of Dreams\\" and Ray Bradbury\\"s \\"Dandelion Wine\\" will find much to love and savor here - but this tribute to the power of the imagination is in no way derivative of those works, weaving its own down-to-earth magic in deceptively simple prose as clean and beautiful as Shaker furniture. What a wonderful movie it would make! I hope we won't have to wait long for more from this promising author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality","review":"Although the CD was marketed as \\"used\\", when the CD arrived it was in mint condition and looked perfectly new. The shipping time-line was fair; not super fast but not too long. The shipping cost I was charged seemed a little exorbitant, especially given the amount the postage on the package showed. But, all in all, I was pretty satisfied with this dealer and definitely impressed by the quality of their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For Fans of Jancis and of Wine!","review":"I have been shocked to see Jancis Robinson's books and videos being slated by Americans. Maybe her European style and English stlye of writing aggrevates Americans. I found this book absolutely charming! (Then again, I am European!)It's not a guide to wine in itself but more a fascinating tale of Jancis' involvement with wine and it's producers. If you bear this in mind when you order it, you will not be disappointed. Her turn of phrase makes this the ideal book to read whilst sipping a nice glass of wine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A new tonic for insomnia","review":"My wife found a damaged copy of Confessions for a few dollars, and bought it for me as a joke. She and I have both laughed for years at Jancis' smarmy tone in her column in Wine Spectator, though I also found her very knowledgeable about wine. Writing about herself rather than wine, Jancis has lost any sense of what the reader might possibly care about. It is the single most boring book I have read in my life, including chemistry textbooks. I seriously use it to fall asleep at night. It puts me out cold in 1/2 page, on average. That's worth a star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry...Dry...Dry","review":"I have to admit I didn't read the entire book.

It wouldn't eject the tape, and after repeated calls to customer service, we've been told that they'll pay for parts, but the labor to fix it is just over $200. Unfortunately even though we've only used the camcorder for under 15 hours, we're outside the 90 days for labor warranty (who'd have thought the camcorder would be unusable after under 15 hours of use?).Still waiting on a callback from customer service, but having gone up 4 levels already, it's not looking like they'll fix the product.Think our model will be headed for the trash - and we'll be looking at anything BUT Sony for future purchases.

But still USB Streaming isn't a main feature. The picture quality under a little low light is horrible. But just normal like is fine. There is no video input for this 140. Also I noticed on all Digital8 models at the side view on a straight line kinda turn in a fisheye lens veiw. (only on side of screen). I would buy this is u just plan to edit Digital video and not a big person on excellent Picture quality.PICTURE QUALITY : 8 (out of 10)SOUND: 9 out of 10FEATURES: 7 out of 10LEARNING TIME: About 20-30minutes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Camera - but now it is broken with little use","review":"I am very dissapointed with SONY products in general. They have always been my preferred brand for TVs and other electronics over the years. But in the past 5 years we have purchased a home entertainment center and this camcorder and with hardly any use they are both broken and obviously out of warranty. The home entertainment center was fixed by Sony by them sending us a completely new unit - and it has the exact same error message as the old one - and we hardly used the thing and now it is broken, out of warranty and stuck on the \\"Standby\\" message which blinks continuously :( And For the Camcorder - we only used it occasionally and have recorded a total of 3 of the mini tapes and now SONY wants me to pay $211 flat rate to fix unit since it is out of warranty... Very dissapointing - especially since I always believed they made quality products. We will not purchase SONY products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY IF USED FOR FIREWIRE EDITING","review":"Basically, this camera is great, but I bought it to do digital editing (so I would transfer the video with the firewire port). Well, to my surprise, Adobe Premiere didn't support the camera, Ulead's VideoStudio didn't either, and neither did the software provided with it (Pixelas ImageMixer). All in all, the firewire is really just a buzzword to make the camera sell, because its ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS. So I'm stuck with this USB Streaming feature... Personally, I recommend if you bought this camera to return it immediately and get a Sony MiniDV camera where you can actually use the firewire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"The title song is one of the two or three best pop Christmas songs ever - the writing, arrangement, and performance (hard to believe Stevie was only 16 or 17 when he cut it) are outstanding. The rest of the album doesn't quite have the strong social message or originality of that modern classic, but it is warm and friendly and very pop savvy. It can easily become a regular part of your holiday season, as it has mine for nearly two decades. It manages to strike a nice balance between secular and religious songs. (Though I have to disagree with those below who say you'll never hear a better \\"Ave Maria\\" - that's been recorded by a lot of very talented singers. Stevie more than holds his own, but he doesn't make you forget the many other fine versions that are out there).A lot of Christmas albums come and go; there's a reason this one has survived for over 30 years. Other than Mathis's and maybe Streisand's, how many holiday albums can you say that about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the music","review":"I got my order right on time.

This book exploits women who experience FGM and portrays them as barbaric torturers or, alternatively, as pathetic, victims. There is no reason to encourage Westerners to view FGM as a disgusting, foreign practice. This work of fiction only encourages the belittling of African women and the continued mis-understanding of FGM, which varies, family to family, culture to culture over a huge area. Women in the developing world face many challenges. FGM is only one facing fewer than half of African women. FGM is a human rights abuse. It is dangerous and abusive in any form and leads to many deaths every year.

And three people can play at the same time. Aside from that the game is not very much fun. There is no camera control, so it is hard to see all around you which is really annoying. There is also no jump button, so you cannot explore anything. Unlike all the other harry potter games there are no wizard cards to find. I always thought that was the best part, finding secret passages and wizard cards. all of that is gone in this game. In fact the gamecube game is exactly the same as the PC Goblit of Fire game. Don't waste your money on this game. There is no freedom to do what you wish in this game. It is not challanging at all until you get to voldemort at the end and that part is so frustrating and stupid. don't bother with this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like any other HP game they have for Game Cube","review":"This game was more of a standardized game, than the free-play type of the first three.

This fan has 3 speeds, 3 modes; normal, sleep and natural, and you have a choice to oscillate or not.All that, yet I was disappointed because it does not produce the amount of wind I like and need, especially at this price point. I live in a hot climate and this does not cool as I'd like. I have it placed next to the computer desk area. It stands less than 2 feet away from me while I am surfing the web. The output is fine, but even at the highest speed selection and pointing directly at me, the wind is still mediocre.It is pretty quiet and as I mentioned before looks great.

I can see layman and students in undergraduate sciences with no prior knowledge of the history or philosophy and reap great rewards from this work. It fashioned as a collection short essays on topics through history. If you are looking for a hardcore introduction with all kinds of depth, this is not it. For advanced HPS students, look elsewhere.

The menus are extremely plain and only get you to the episode you want to watch. This first half of season 1 includes episodes 1-26. There aren't even any subtitles available for those who either need them or can't watch with the sound up. If this is the extent of the plans for the US releases then I would recommend that fans invest in a cheap all region DVD player(often a code can turn your DVD player all region) and just purchase the R2 copies for their extras etc. You can pick up the Region 2 FULL season sets for less than they are selling this half of the first season anyway.

Not designed for serious cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grill and I love using it","review":"I have owned the grill about 2 years now. The older model does not have the doors and I dont miss doors. The open rack shelf is fine and I think being able to see what is dripping in the bottom pan a benefit. The grill is kept on my back patio and gets used very often. I have the cover on it and it does not show any weather damage. It is very easy to use and clean up. I have nothing but good things to say about this grill. I have had no problems with it at all. I also have the Weber Big Book of grilling and everything that I cook from ham, steaks, fish and vegetables comes out good. You will be happy you bought this grill. My husband used to be the grill king of the house but now I do most of the grilling because it is so much easier to use the grill than use the stove for alot of cooking tasks. We have owned several different grills over the years in the $250-350 price range but this is by far the best and is worth the extra money because of how well it is made."},{"rating":"2","title":"cane seat purchased at Amazon","review":"I have already used this cane seat when shopping because I have trouble standing for awhile, and there aren't many seats or benches at most stores. I am amazed at how light it is, and easy to carry. Once you get used to sitting on it the correct way (facing the handle) it seems very easy to work. I do wish the seat were maybe 2 inches higher off the floor, and a little bigger, but all in all the seat does its job very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a dud if you want to sit.","review":"I tried this product because I REALLY needed a place to sit down every 200 yards or so.

In my experience it just doesn't fill the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folding Seat Cane - I use it 5 days out of 7","review":"The cane works just fine. The only problem I had with it, is it would not close completely into the little plastic \\"snap\\" piece. My husband filed it down and now it works a lot better. It would be nice if this little problem could be fixed on all the canes or maybe mine was the only one with the problem. I use the cane seat daily when I have to pick up my youngest grand son from school. I have to park and wait for school to let out. It's too hot to sit in the car so I take my cane seat and sit under a shade tree. So many grand parents have asked me where I got it from. They are all very interested in having one for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver!","review":"This little seat was a life saver for \\"Grandma\\" while on a 2 hour ghost walk.

I'm gonna be listening to this CD even when I'm 80 years old, I don't care!!Standout tracks: Just listen to the whole thing.

I don't think they have even come close to ever killing anyone. In \\"When the Sh** Goes Down\\", they talk about gettin the \\"sawed off Glock\\", which makes NO sense. A Glock is a handgun. What are you going to do, saw off the grip?! Even Biggie used to say some totally uneducated things about firearms (taking the safety off a Glock? Glocks don't have external safeties, genius!) Just because you smoke weed doesn't make you gangsta. Try picking up a gun and actually learning about how it works before you spit all this b.s. about your gat-toting hardness.

Hoping for a sequel, if you read the reviews on this site you will notice how different this game is, I wish I would have bought this game when it came out in 2000, it's 2005 now, I truly regret not buying it, this game is amazing, so amazing I rank it up there in my list 1.Xenogears 2.Final Fantasy Tactics(tie)Valkyrie Profile 3.Chrono Cross. If your tired of the same boring stuff like the Final Fantasy Series I suggest you get this game, it has a good storyline which the FFS (except FF3)lack. Like Xenogears this game will become an underground classic beloved by those who have it and played it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most original RPG out there...","review":"This is the most original game that has come out since...since...uhhh...Chrono Trigger? The battle system is great. I like the combo deal, and the graphics are nice. They include paralaxxing, side scrolling, and NICE pre-rendered backgrounds. The sprite-based character models are animated very nicely, and they have loads of detail. The music is very nice! (It is one of my favorite features). I like the whole idea of training warriors, then sending them up...very fascinating. I am also a fan of Norse mythology, so its all the more better. Nice story and nice character development, i mean, GREAT character development. Dungeons are very fun. I know this review didnt make much sense, but oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining and enjoyable game.","review":"I was skeptical of the side scrolling RPG when I got it, but it proved to be a great game. I played through it several times before finally stopping to try another video game. The battle concept is great, but a little hard to get the best result (mashing the control pad usually won the battles, but not with all the treasure and bonus EXP). The plot was nice, but a little thin. The focus seemed more on getting characters and leveling up. Very little character interaction (unless you working on the best ending). Overall, a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great RPG, it should not be missed.","review":"Valkyrie profile is unfortunately one of the most neglected games of the year. It's release date was smack dab in the middle of Chrono Cross and FF9, so not many people had money or were willing to buy it. I played CC and FF9, and I thought neither of them were as good as VP. It has a great story that is based on norse mythology and follows it extremely well. It has a battle system that is fast-moving and never gets old. Last but not least, it is one of the few RPGs that breaks the 5 and 6 digits barriers. one of my characters has 60000 health and another can do 300000 in a single hit. It is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valkyrie Profile","review":"I've heard that this game is alot of fun and I'd really like to play it. The only problem is that Amazon doesn't sell it!

So she and her boyfriend run away, and they freeze to death in a poppy field.That's before the opening credits, folks.Valkyrie Profile has the most unique plot you will ever see in a video game. Characters must die (sadly and tragically) before they can be selected by the Valkyrie for battle in Valhalla.These are deaths so sad you'll want to lie on the floor. Melancholy, lachrmose, morose, just plain ose.But it's an unmissable opportunity.Much like Final Fantasy Tactics, this had a small print run, and demand has long since outstripped supply. I bought if for 40 when it came out, sold it for $150 and it'll cost me $300 to play it again, as I bought a PSP for the exress purpose of playing this game again. It is that much worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enix returns to the US in a blaze of glory!","review":"This is a beautiful game. No question. As a fan of the Dragon Warrior series, I am thrilled to see Enix back in the US, and their first published RPG stateside in 5 years is Valkyrie Profile. The game is gorgeous; the voice-acting is top-notch. I will not rant on about the physical characteristics of the game, though. It is addictive, moving, and epic, and THAT is what RPG fans crave. This game is heartfelt, sweeping, and very entertaining. I can't recommend it enough. Enix returns with a bang, and this game is the start of good things to come! Support Enix and buy their new masterpiece, a sure-fire sleeper hit! You won't regret it! On a side note -- you may want to pick up the strategy guide with the game; while the game is certainly playable without it, there is a steep learning curve, which the guide helps overcome.

He covers the deceptions of five different presidents, 3 Democrats and 2 Republicans. Part of the appeal of this book comes from its nonpartisanship; he is as tough on Johnson as he is on Reagan. Throughout the book Alterman is consistent in his belief that American leaders owe the American people the truth at all times. He has no patience for neo-Machiavellians who would pardon politicians for lying in the name of a greater cause, e.g. national security. Or, of course, for the peoples' \\"own good.\\"From Yalta to Gulf War II, Alterman shows the deleterious impact of presidential lying. His history of the Vietnam War is the best part of the book, as it was the lies of LBJ that led to thousands of deaths.

You can find this toy in most big box retailers for around $12-15.Second, the buttons are very stiff and hard for young toddlers to use.This was our experience too. Our baby liked seeing the animals pop up, and she figured out how each lever or knob or button was supposed to work; she just wasn't strong enough to make it happen. You really have to have some strong fingers to use this toy.Since doing the right thing doesn't work, the educational value is nil.

It was great for him to learn how to manipulate the different kinds of switches, buttons and knobs. It took him a while to figure out the knob that turns. That one proved annoying for me as well because the knob has to be turned just right for the pop-up animal to latch closed again. The toy is extremely durable; my son likes to throw things down the stairs and this is one of the items that has been down them. It doesn't require batteries and doesn't make sounds/music.

Also included are the relatively rare 420M \\"Eldorado\\" Indy type racer, which was entered into the \\"Race of Two Worlds\\" at Monza, and the 1992 Barchetta.

I was very disappointed in this aspect of the book. The author totally glossed over the Niagara Falls project, which was a major part of Tesla's contribution to electrical distribution. The book spends too much time on Tesla's failed business dealings and with all the secondary people that he seemingly had contact with throughout his life. The organization of the book also is disconcerting at times. You finish one paragraph and then the next paragraph is about a completely different subject, person, topic, etc. with absolutely no transition or introduction.I expected more from this book. I feel I still don't know who Tesla was or what exactly his inventions were and for a project that took 20 years of the author's life, it is still lacking in important details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Full of distorted opinions and biased nationalism and very vague book.

I have been through this book twice and still find myself overwhelmend by the accomplishments of Tesla. The Author was detailed and objective in his writing. Considering the family ties he writes about. What I especially found interesting is the later chapters, addressing the so called occult theory's about Tesla and his works. For the most part, he laid them to rest. Again Bravo! However I am a bit disapointed that there wasn't more on his Invention's and Patent's. I was hoping for a detailed list or drawings on his invetion's. Still, the pictures and accounts of his life, is one of the best I have seen. Over all a must to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh","review":"After finishing this book I have decided to throw it in the trash and find a better reference with which to try to learn if Tesla was a \\"genius\\". The first book I have ever felt deserved such an honor. The information presented in the book is totally lacking in any technical detail with which one can determine if this guy Tesla was as stupid as it seems. Granted he may have started off strong with his AC motor inventions-as presented in the bok the rest seems like it was hocum-a conclusion that is based on Teslas apparent inability to finish any working models of his subsequent \\"inventions\\" as well as to get anybody to commit any money to their developement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"The book was a nice overview of Tesla's life and accomplishments and painted an interesting portrait of the inventor, but was unfortunately riddled with the authors own pseudo-scientific views.

The author obviously conducted a great deal of research. On the other hand, I found myself wishing for a clearer explanation of which of Tesla's ideas were clearly scientific advances, and which were fantasy or unworkable.

His dealings with men like J.P.Morgan who helped to finance Tesla in the early years but later refused to continue to finance Tesla in his quest to energize the world. In fact, to me, Tesla sounded a bit pathetic in his continually begging Morgan for more money. Especially since Tesla's designs would do away with many of the raw materials that made J.P. Mogan rich in the first place such as copper. The book points out some of Tesla's foibles as well as his genius.I thought the book was a good read even though I found that a good dictionary within reach helped because of some of the words the author used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard","review":"I just finished Wizard in a marathon two day read.

The collage illustrations are big and clear for an entire class to see well. The media is also helpful to tie into for a class project of a collage too!

Please write more art related books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read all the Marvel novels and anthologies printed to date, I had high expectations which this book failed to meet. While I feel that Friedman is an excellent author, this book was very weak. The story is a continuation of one from the very early history of the X-Men, which apparently wasn't quite resolved. For those not well-versed in X-Men knowledge (if there are any who would be buying an X-Men book), this might be a difficult read, as there is very little background given for the characters. Also, there is essentially no character development and the plot was rather weak. Also, while not the most important aspect, there were numerous and repeated spelling (The country is spelled C-o-l-o-m-b-i-a, not C-o-l-u-m-b-i-a! Come on!) and grammar errors. No offense, but when I shell out for a hardback book, it would be nice if someone had proofread it. If you really wish to own this book, at least wait for paperback and save a few bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Characterization","review":"The X-Men rely on good characterization. The author of the book does a poor job of showing the characters that many fans know in depth. The characters are written as if the author only knew a few aspects of those characters and reiterates it numerous times throughout the book. It begins to get very repetitive, and does not hold the reader's interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaay too fluffy","review":"This is an okay story by itself, but Friedman writes as though he's talking to an audience of autistic 12-year-olds. If you skip every third paragraph, you'd get the same story and eliminate some of the tiresome and repetitive verbosity.And WHERE THE HELL IS WOLVERINE? Does Friedman think he can ignore the existence of major X-Men characters? Not even mention them?All in all, I'd tell you to skip this book and look to the new Batman: No Man's Land novelization by Greg Rucka for entertaining superhero fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and tastful","review":"I absolutly LOVED this book! The plotline is creative and exiting,the personalitys of the characters are wonderfully depicted and true to the origanles. I love that some of the story is told from the prof's point of view,because it shows that he is only human. It shows that he hates being pitied for his crippled legs,that he feels sorrow that he has to send his students into the field and can't go with them,that he loves all his students and is as proud of their accomplishments as a father.This book doesn't have much background info,but it's still a delightful read. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a fan since the 1960's","review":"I have read X-Men comic books since the beginning. Most of the current marvel novels are very good.

I am very disappointed and would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What...is going on?","review":"This was an amusing read, but not one I would really impose on others; the simple problem is that the characters spend too much time reminiscing about past battles than doing anything. This book would have been much better if it was about 100 pages shorter. If you aren't a fan of the X-men with a good deal of back ground knowledge, you won't have a clue what's going on.

The rest is fluff, filler and advertisements and it appears to be a home made production.Surely there must be something better on the market than this.

Showing how you can clicker train a puppy, and that it is so easy, even a kid can do it. For the most part, the DVD achieves that goal, but some poorly chosen footage, and kids who need to be clicker trained ruin the disc.

Very close to \\"Radical Son\\" as one of the great political books of this decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horowitz gives a description of a political psychosis","review":"Much of the detailed points about this book have already been made. So I'll keep it short.One of the symtoms of a psychosis is detachment from reality. This has been the case of the Left at least since 1917. In more mundane terms, we have the popular definistion of insanity as trying exactly the same thing that didn't work a dozen times before and expecting a different result.Horowitz exposes how the Left hides and denies its flaws, failures, catastrophes, crimes, and criminal associations (Black Panthers) all in the false hope of advancing their utopian vision.He illustrates continual denials by the Left of of solutions for situations that would be absolute no-brainers for a neutral observer (AIDS in the early 80s).In other words, he shows how the members of the Left have produced a mountain of corpses and then waved bloody hands about while denying their responsibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody Knows the Left Better.","review":"This is an essential book for young conservatives. It's slight, distilled and commanding. David Horowitz may well be one of the most underrated writers of our time. I find his prose to be excelsior. His style renders a sober political analysis, like The Politics of Bad Faith, into a page turner. This work is a collection of essays and they are all worth reading. The Marxist roots of today's political correctness is fully investigated and the attempt to substitute the proletariat as the dogs of the world with race, class, and gender is well-developed. Horowitz's essay on AIDS is entitled, \\"A Radical Holocaust\\" and it is inspiring. One sees the ways in which the radical, revolutionary idea have sabotaged our public safety. He also does a wonderful job explaining how today's liberals are anti-liberals and are the forces of censure and oppression rather than freedom and liberty. I loved this book and heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little stilted at times, but....","review":"a good examination of the inherent contradictions of the politics of the modern Left. Horowitz is at times dull and self-absorbed, as when he repeats ad nauseum the story of a failed reconciliation with a childhood Marxist friend, a story documented well enough in *Radical Son*, but at others provides an excellent argument on how the Left cannot see the world as it is due to ideological blinders that allow its adherents only to see the world as they want it to be.The book is at its best in a chapter looking at how the ideological agenda of the leaders of the San Francisco gay community caused them to oppose basic public health interventions in the early 80s, allowing AIDS to spread. Laurie Garrett (*The Coming Plague*) and Randy Shilts (*And the Band Played On...*) both have discussed this elsewhere in greeater detail, but without showing how this relates to the larger, coherent if detached paradigm of left-wing social and political thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cautiously recommend this book","review":"I would only cautiously recommend this book. Having read portions of both \\"Destructive Generation\\" and \\"Radical Son\\", I believe that this work is mostly a recitation of those. What I would heartily recommend is the introduction. It is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit short","review":"I was quite disappointed with this book. I expected a good analysis of leftist thought and its contradictions. I didn't find it. Horowitz thesis is: marxist experience failed, today's left radical thought stem from Marxist roots, so it has been proven wrong by history and lef radicals are enemies of freedom. It is a little bit short. The only convincing chapter is when Horowitz shows how political correctness prevented the adoption of efficient measures at the beginning of AIDS epidemic."},{"rating":"1","title":"How little has changed...","review":"In the old days, when Horowitz edited _Ramparts_, his workswere among the most fact-free and vitriolic on the left.

David Horowitz is a preacher of the neo-conservative faith with all this impliesIf you are the type of conservative who realizes that most conservatives have some ideas others think are \\"liberal\\", that is mature enough to know that there are no simple answers, who has been wrong on issues on more than one occassion, and who is more interested in finding the truth then in reassuring yourself of your own superiority... then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest","review":"This book is not worth reading because it merely employs the common conservative tactic of equating all progressive or left-wing thought to communism (or really to Stalinism).

Tired premise of twins impersonating each other, and all through the story, you either knew what was going to happen, or you just didn't care. There was such a build-up of the Bullet Catcher guys not knowing the real story of their assignment that their boss was withholding from them, but the real story was nothing to get upset or excited about, and certainly was nothing to be withheld from the guys!Overall, this was a pretty lame book, and I doubt I would bother to read another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best new author","review":"Roxanne St. Claire is the best new romantic suspense author in line to be GREAT!

I decided I needed to 'really' learn how to play the game. I read that Harrington's books were the best, but being a beginner, I could tell that that book might be too complicated for me, so I got the Illustrated Guide instead. I think it's a great book if you're only interested in learning the rules of the game, and how certain hands are played. I thought this book was an easy read, and the illustrations made it easer to read. I would read this book first, before trying to read one of the more advanced popular books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book may have some merits. It is easy to read or entertaining.But it is incorrect in so many places that I would not recommend it to anybody. It claims to make winners out of beginners and advanced players. Believe me, it has nothing for advanced players. Or even for intermediate player. The most severe errors in the book are in the odds calculation. The hand selection is questionable.

In fact, if an opponent held any of these hands the result would be a split pot. Both players would hold the five card hand AK999. The kicker card does not play.After reading this I immediately returned the book to the shelf.

Very good books and a must read for anyone interested in playing poker well. Have been playing dealer's choice poker variations for about fifteen years. Have been playing Hold'em, specifically, for about four months now.The Sklansky and Harrington books give you a lot of theory. They teach you how to think about poker. This book gives you all practicum, which is especially great for the beginner and intermediate player. The author provides very straight forward explanations for his decisions, and in the process reinforces proper play, while also discouraging improper play.This book is a great complement to the other two books mentioned. Will help reinforce the basics -- plays that we take for granted, forget about, and therefore get wrong under pressure. Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning solid basic game play, or for reinforcing the basics as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great LIMIT Texas hold em book","review":"I agree with most of the other reviewers and won't bother going into details that they have already covered but I want to make one new point. This book is geared to LIMIT hold em games, not pot limit or no limit. If you play limit, this book will probably improve your game. It did mine. If you play pot limit or no limit, the book may improve your starting hand play but there are better books out there for those types of hold em. When I bought the book I figured if it kept me from playing one bad hand, the book would pay for itself and I think it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic, and covers only LIMIT hold 'em","review":"The illustrated concept is a good one, and makes the book a lot easier to read and use than most text-only books. However, there are two very important facts to know about this book.First, it covers ONLY limit hold 'em. This is not evident from the title of the book, and if this is intentional, it's rather shameful.Second, the content is extremely basic. The sub-title of the book: \\"Making Winners out of Beginners and Advanced Players\\" is completely untrue. I am an Intermediate player and I didn't find one single new idea, concept or thought in this book. Everything in here is of the most elemental nature.Having said all that, if you've never played Hold 'Em before and are looking for a nice picture book to help you get started, then this is it. Keep in mind, though, that the negative side to the illustrated format is that there is little organization to the book and even slight variances to each of the 150 situations discussed are not shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the few quality Civil War movies","review":"Finally on dvd...This is certainly not a \\"western\\" as virtually the entire movie takes place in Virginia...William Holden plays Texas cattleman Alverez Kelly, bringing his large herd of cattle to Virginia to feed the Union army...Richard Widmark is Confederate Colonel Tom Rossiter, who is given the mission of stealing the cattle...Kelly is captured by the Confederates and is \\"persuaded\\" to train Rossiter's cavalry in the art of cattle-rustling...Holden plays the cynical Kelly very well and Widmark is very good as the gritty Confederate cavalryman...I felt this movie could have been better; however the interaction between the two characters is excellent...I also rated this as a 5 star because Civil War movies are a rarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Western Misfire","review":"\\"Alvarez Kelly\\" (1966) wastes an impressive amount of talent.

The sound quality of this live recording is excellent. I believe it was the first of many recordings Ruby made for the Arbors label. It's certainly one of the best. The music is warm, delicate, and enchanting. It will likely leave you with a soothing afterglow.

Each is made in another country, the Ash is marked 99% cotton and made in Dominican Republic; the blue one is 100% cotton made in Honduras.

His weight was near 300 pounds, and he was barely having hits. His live performances were not what they used to be, either. Gone was his dynamic stage presence. He now seemed like an overweight king impersonator rather than his legendary self, as prooven by \\"Tucson '76\\".Most of the performances on this cd don't seem like Elvis. He sounds so out of it here, it's sad. His voice has lost its glimmer, too. He now sings with a drawl, most obvious on average versions of \\"Hound Dog\\", \\"Love Me\\", the \\"Teedy Bear\\"/ \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", \\"Jailhouse Rock\\", and \\"Can't Help Falling In Love\\". On the plus, he does great versions of \\"Hurt\\", \\"Burning Love\\" and \\"Danny Boy\\". That shows why I gave it as much stars as I did.Overall, not essential.

Boessenecker describes Morse as a \\"gunfighter, manhunter, and sleuth whose career is without parallel in the history of the American frontier.\\" More importantly, the author, like other western historians in recent years, shows the difference between the blood and thunder school of thought about Old West gunfighting lawmen who occasionally pinned on a silver star, and those individuals who saw law enforcement in the American West as a profession. As a career minded peace officer, Morse spent decades learning the techniques needed to investigate crimes and to track and capture outlaws and desperadoes.

Their past movies have identity, poetry...the distribution agreement and increased collaboration with Disney (especially on the last 2 works) negatively impacted the purity of the story, and the original style. They could have used original Japanese songs, instead of using low-level english pop songs to increase the commercialization of the product. What a shame...back to the roots is my advice. Don't try to emulate Disney products to increase the number of potential customers...you risk to lose the ones who have been following you from the beginning.

Stuck in a rut storytelling of little beings we don't see living around us which when added to Studio Ghibli's using the same \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" format and it all felt like a story that's been told too many times.Graphics:Studio is stuck in a Manga comic book graphic style of a non-living, non-moving backdrop with all the graphics focused upon the 2D movement of the central character for each scene. Nothing to do with cultural minimalism; it's just copying paper minimalist print style graphics.The French have surpassed the Japanese and to a great extent the Americans in producing engaging fantasy storytelling and CGI. Witness the attention to detail, even in subtle background scenes, and the individualization for each character in \\"Arthur and the Invisibles: The Minimoy\\". Same theme yet far more intelligent, engaging and graphically conveyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secret World of Arreity has no Plot!","review":"I went to see this movie with a few friends and parents, and it was so boring. The people walked and talked at a snails place, and all the characters besides the sick boy were one dimensional. All the mom does is cook and worry, and we don't even know what the dad does. And any time something a little bit scary happened, it was over in two seconds. Also, there was really never plot for the first half of the movie except the occasional \\"don't go out, you could be seen\\". I'm new to animi, but my friends all love it, so I agreed to go. I was disappointed, the graphics were pretty good, but the mouthing did not match the speech. I would much rather watch a disney movie, like The Little Mermaid, Mulan, Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast, they have a moral, great characters, who are strong but not dumb, and a great plot.

I am saying this to establish that I'm not a hater, a huge fan if anything.I love the notion of new Ghibli movies but this is absurd. As I'm sure you already know, this story is a redone (and overdone) well known tale called The Borrowers. Normally remakes and reimaginations are something I am always up for but this a boring story with several already well done animations out there. It was great when I first read and later watched this story, at this point I think its tired.This was a complete waste of talent and lacks the unique and intriguing script of Studio Ghibli's previous masterpieces.

Add to my frustration the 40+ minute wait I had each of the 3 times called. Then to be told that there was \\"no XBox Harmony Remote\\", not once, but multiple times. . .well, that's simply not the way to support a higher $$ product and to win customer loyalty.

The setup was easy for me with the included software, but I'm likely more technical than most (since my day job is as a web developer). The two big problems with the remote are that a) it sucks batteries like crazy and b) the LCD screen is of poor quality. If you're a day past the 12 month warranty period, Logitech support will tell you you're SOL. What happens is that over time the LCD screen will begin to not display every other line, making it difficult to read. Mine crapped out at about the 18 month mark. If I wasn't treated poorly by Logitech's customer service department, I would just buy another one, but with the blowoff they gave me I think I'll be buying another device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Remote Ever","review":"This is truly the best remote ever.

Although it took a full hour to program correctly, it now works seamlessly with all my devices. I have replaced four remotes with just this one. The inclusion of the activities button is brilliant. By simply selecting an activity such as ' watch TV' the remote will turn on the TV, select correct input, turn on the sound system, select the correct input and turn on my satellite receiver. Many other activity types can be made such as playing Xbox, watching DVDs or whatever you like. In addition, by clicking power it'll turn off all your devices at once. Fantastic.

Their online database was also able to list my 13 yr old Sony 5.1 pro-logic receiver which I thought was pretty cool. This remote controls every home theatre component which I use. A few items which the remote is slightly annoying. One, when you set it to turn on a component, you need to keep the remote pointed for a few seconds for everything to turn correctly. If you dont, it may not turn on certain devices, but you can just press the help button and it will fix it for you. Two, sometimes the buttons are hard to press. You have to press down straight otherwise, nothing happens. What I like about this remote is that it works with my XBOX 360.

You might notice that the Xbox 360 harmony control looks a lot like the Harmony 550. Well it's because it's almost exactly the same thing. Here's the difference. The 550 has more buttons. The AXBY buttons on the Xbox model are dedicated to Xbox 360. 550 model has extra programmable buttons. The 550 is also in a different color. Also the 550 can control your 360 but allows you to control more devices.

I read some of the other reviews and I was concerned with the button layout. It does take some time, but you get used to it after awhile.My one complaint is that the remote does not give you the option of selecting your audio input on your A/V receiver. My Onkyo has two digital inputs. I use one for my DVD and one for my Satellite. When I use the Harmony 360 to turn on these devices with one button, I still have to get up and manually switch the digital inputs on the front of my receiver. That's why I can't give this 5 stars. What's the point of using it if I still have to get up and make a manual adjustment.Otherwise, great remote. Just make sure it covers all of your bases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks button durability","review":"Logitech makes superior products and the ones that I own have performed well over time, except for this remote. After four years of use, buttons that control DVD playback have failed. It is a physical problem . . . the contacts under the buttons started to lose connection and slowly deteriorated to make the unit useless.This is an expensive remote, and there is no excuse for a product of this type and design, used exclusively in an adult-only household, to fail from its physical design and construction. As with most consumer items, repair will likely cost as much as I paid for the remote, new. The alternative is to discard it into the global Himalayas of electronic device garbage. Totally unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!","review":"I have to admit that this takes a little getting used to but once you do........you'll laugh about the days that you had (in my case) 4 remotes sitting on the coffee table.

Insane.....the highest level of laziness. It's what I've always dreamed of........\\"tear\\".... I would recommend this product to anyone that considers themself an average computer user.

I have replaced remotes for 4 devices, as well as using the functionality of the xBox buttons. Very handy.After setting up your remote via your PC, be sure to change your preferences so that the Harmony software isn't running in Windows all the time; after you set up and tweak your devices, you won't need the software until you change something in your system - like getting a new AV receiver, a new DVD player, a new TV, etc.The 'Activities' process works pretty well, although it took me some tweaking to get all the buttons programmed for each activity I wanted to define.All in all, this product works very well.

It is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phooey!","review":"Although I would encourage anybody looking for a good (if not deep) read to pick up \\"Blind Justice\\", the first book in this series, I would advise those same people to avoid this book. Everything is too pat: Sir John Fielding is too wise and knowing; Jeremy (his assistant) is too nobly naive; their comrades too goody-goody; the bad guys are identified by wearing (no joke) black. The attempts at poignancy are as phony as a sit-com. Samuel Johnson would probably not recognize the sentimentalized version of him. There isn't even a mystery to solve. Shallow on most every account."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was a little bit disappointed!","review":"I was very expecting and excited after reading reviews. Besides this book was applaused by many establishments: I think that I was too naive! As a matter of fact, this book did not meet my expectation. I was looking forward to the style of Agatha Christie's mysteries, but it was not. The ending was pretty clear from the middle of story. But, overall, it was fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy sequel, but not as good as \\"Blind Justice\\"","review":"I read and loved \\"Blind Justice\\", and really looked forward to the next book. I had gotten involved in the characters' lives, and wanted to know what was going to happen next. This sequel was good, but not nearly as good as its predecessor. For one thing, the mystery started off with a bang--but then rambled on, getting ever more complicated. The characters weren't as finely drawn: especially Sir John. The alteration to his domestic life in the last chapter was hardly unexpected, but came from nowhere. I look forward to the next book, but I doubt that it will live up to the first in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Sequel","review":"The sequel to Alexander's excellent \\"Blind Justice\\" is a disappointment. There is no solution and no surprise; the culprit is obvious early on, and the story ends with an all-too-familiar chase scene instead of a triumph in detection. The setting will once again please some readers, but the plot leaves much to be desired. For devoted fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"underdeveloped and predictable","review":"Murder in Grub Street is a lot like Columbo: you know who the killer is from the beginning (with the book, the middle of the story); the rest is sitting back and watching how the detective(s) figure the murderer out. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of Columbo or this book. There is no suspense. There is barely even a hesitation as to when Sir Fielding believes that the Brethen of Spirit is the killers. The author, from the introduction of these characters, almost singled them out as the bad guys; sure, he paid attention to what the other suspects were doing, but he made sure that the detectives (a.k.a. Fielding and Jeremy) knew about all the mean things the Brethen did. Like I said, all the talk about the Brethen left no spaces for any \\"surprises\\"; no twists, no sudden revelations revealed. Murder in Grub Street was mediocre at best, nothing short of boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graham Greene in a different role","review":"It has been a while since I viewed this movie but I do recall that I found the role of Arthur an interesting turn for Graham Greene. Most of the exposure I had of him to that point was his role in Dances with Wolves, Maverick and his occasional appearance on the Red Green Show as the bumbling explosives \\"expert\\". I appreciated seeing him in a role where he isn't portrayed as the nice guy or \\"Noble Savage\\" (for lack of a better term). I thought the story was solid enough and I'll admit I was shocked to see Mr. Greene commit the acts of violence (the finger removal scene was unexpected). I think it is a must see for fans of Graham Greene."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Graham's Best!","review":"\\"Clearcut\\" is one of Graham Greene's best actings!

If you don't, it's a lesson. Good Luck and try not to destroy the World.

Otherwise,I thought that, in addition to being a poorly made film--bad script, bad directing and poor film quality--this was a ridiculously violent and gory movie. I love Graham Greene and no one can fault his acting, but he must have just needed a job at this point--nothing else explains his judgment to be in this one. I think his character came off as pathologically violent and cruel, not as one zealousy guarding his way of life. The confrontation scenes between Native Americans and loggers in the beginning were ludicrous. The story did not progress in any logical way and the ending was flat. I didn't find anything mystical about the \\"message\\", as some other reviewers did. I, too,would love to be able to return this tape.

This was one of the most confusing and awful movies I have ever seen. I could not finish it. (I don't like horror movies.)Yes, the trees are beings and they bleed too. I detest the current logging practices and the disenfranchisment of first nation peoples! But the uncontrolled rage in this movie chased me to the off button! All most people saw was some cold-blooded beserk guy mutilating another guy without really understanding why. I guess it was one of those 'arthouse films' with a message. Well... it's not a message I want to hear. I've seen too much violence in the world to want to invite that into my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"This was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I kept watching it in hopes that it would get better but it never did. Graham Greene as well as the other Native American actors did a wonderful job but the others in the movie lacked credibility. The plot may have been a good concept but was certainly not delivered well. It made all parties in the movie just look stupid. It's a shame Graham Greene had to appear in such a movie considering what a wonderful actor he is. It definitely doesn't do him justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THE REVIEWS CAREFULLY-A LOT OF VIOLENCE","review":"Low quality, too violent, not worth the $10 - I would return it if I could. The idea is good: we should not ravage the environment, we should respect nature and each other. Unfortunately, the message is delivered through \\"an eye for an eye\\" method: the wronged native american severely and violently tortures the callous white american to demonstrate how nature is tortured. The net result: I could have skipped (and did, after the violence started) viewing the movie, and would have been better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but harmful","review":"I enjoyed the movie, but I found the depiction of Greene's character disturbing.

It may help that I live only eight miles from the Garmin World Headquarters in Olathe, Kansas.One feature that many people miss because they don't use it, is the 6 million points of interest. If you'll let it, it will select a restaurant for you, according to what your palate hankers for, or a place to stay (motel/hotel) or which casino is closest.It's just a jim-dandy little gadget that's very handy.

The only unit not worth the Garmin brand is the GPS 76CSX. Since I have several units, I can compare accuracies. The 6CSX is normally off by 10 to 20%. Garmin has replaced the unit three times and finally they told me that this unit is so sensitive it can be off a \\"bit\\". A \\"bit\\" in my book is not 10%, much less 20%. I bought the 76CSX to replace a Forerunner 305 and have since gone back to the 305.I would not recommend. Those that say it is very accurate have nothing to compare it to. I have compared to a Nuvi 660, and Edge 705, and a Forerunner 305 with the results being not very good for the 76CSX. For example, a 24 mile ride on my bike had the following: Edge 705 - 24..1, Forerunner 305 - 24.2, and the CSX - 29.6 miles. I walked 3 miles at a high school track and the 76CSX recorded 4.3 miles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin GPSMAP 76CSX","review":"Good overall.

The one thing I've found lacking is that the tide feature the 76S had only comes with another $120+ of marine software for the 76CSX. We live near salt water and it adds to the usefulness when we're camping if we know what the tides are doing. Is there anyway I can download this into my new GPS?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big boy toy","review":"I bought this for the husband and it is his new best friend.It provides all the information he requires to do various types of fishing.

The only way around this is to add waypoints in the Mapsource routes to force the handheld to follow the routes you create on the PC.

I like the shape of the 60 series better and the screen on top. I like the ability of the 76 to float and its moisture tolerance. Expect to pay $100's for maps and you can only download Garmin maps except I have seen maps of ski areas advertized that are supposed to download to Garmin receivers.

I like that I can put a 2GB memory card in it and load lots of maps and change cards quickly. I have the City Navigator NT product, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron on the 2GB card with room to spare. The battery life is great. I can get more than a day out of a set of alkaline batteries. Navigation mode works very well for sailboat racing.

Unlike some other people's, my spoon is easy to use when open, but it fits too tightly in the lid, and must be pried out with a pen each time I use it.I'd recommend passing on this product.

I saw this movie when it came out in the theater in '69. I remembered it as being really good....ha! Yes, it is entertaining, but certainly not anything to take the least bit serious. Was it meant to be a comedy?! The cast pops from one locale to another faster than I can get anywhere in a car...one minute Monument Valley, next a wooded Black Hills-lookalike. Next, back in the desert. Those were some fast horses back then. Beautiful Indian gal-with nicely-done makeup and a Wonderbra. Beautiful white girl with nicely done makeup...and beautifully highlighted hair. In summation, what I'm trying to say is this movie is just plain dumb. The soundtracks from almost any movie made in the late 60's and most of the 70's are always hideous, but the \\"theme\\"-although sung very well by Jose Feliciano-was worse than most! Just too funny from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Movie Marvel","review":"Although, it has been trashed in the West, it was one of the biggest hits in India in those days.

Every now and then, its re-release in the local movie theater sees it run for atleast 6-8 weeks.There is a gorgeous charm that emanates from this movie.

The fabric could be a little nicer. I love the side impact headrest. You get all the good stuff the britax boulevard has but for half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just too HARD to tighten!!!","review":"I had to give the seat a low star rating. There are features that I do like about the seat - easy to clean, roomy, strap height easy to move, cup holder, looks comfortable.BUT every strap on this seat is HARD to tighten!! The strap for the universal anchorage system is basically impossible to tighten once you have it attached. And the harness strap can be very difficult to both tighten and loosen.I've had this seat for about 6 months. It was rear-facing and I hoped that things would get easier once it was forward facing. The only thing that is better is that it is easier to fit in the back seat but the straps are still hard to pull tight.I'm really considering going out and buying a different seat because my elbow is starting to bother me from pulling on those straps! So if I have to do that, this seat was basically a waste of money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3-In-1 Car Seat Review","review":"I like this seat because it is a 3-in-1 and keeps you from having to buy multiple seats. It is very flexible as your child grows. My child seems comfortable and secure in the seat. The things I don't like are: It is a large seat and takes up alot of space (especially when rear-facing), it is difficult to level when rear facing (we had to use several towel rolls to level). The strap that you pull to tighten your child in the seat is difficult to pull tight.Even with these dislikes, I still recommend the seat for its overall use and value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Review as Colton's Mom","review":"I bought the Eddie Bauer about a month ago and can't seem to get it tight in the seat (rear facing). The car seat moves from side to side and lifts up off the seat. I have a 01 Ford Taurus that provides ample room. The instructions say it may have some \\"play\\" but good grief the thing moves over 3\\" on each side using the anchors and there is no way to get it tighter. We had the fire dept. check it out and we are returning it to get a different brand. Might have to go with the Britax. The Eddie just doesn't get tight enough. Very dangerous in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult to adjust, install","review":"I got this as a gift from my registry and just installed it in my husband's car now that my 6 month old son has outgrown the infant carrier. I have a Britax Roundabout in my car. The Eddie Bauer can't compare to the Britax both in terms of the ease (or should I say difficulty) of adjusting the seat (moving straps higher, lower, etc.) and the installation. My husband and I had to read the instructions three times to figure out how to remove the infant headrest and adjust the bottom strap. The seat is so large that we didn't even attempt to install rear-facing in my husband's pickup (he only drives my son three blocks to daycare in the morning). I have the prior model and it wouldn't be worth it to return it and get the Britax...but if I could have done my registry over, it would have been Britax all the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to install","review":"My husband and I loved this car seat when we saw it in the store. My 9 month old daughter fit in it well and she seemed to like it. When we got home, we tried to install it for an hour. We first tried the middle belt. That belt wouldn't get tight enough. We tried the shoulder belt and the seat tilted so bad that we couldn't use it. We eventually decide to take it back and get a Britax, which has worked out much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this car seat!","review":"I just can't say enough about this carseat...nicely cushioned, headrest pillow, tasteful design, arm rests, cupholder, snack holder, and easily adjustable. It's also perfect for moving from car to car/easy install and my two year old LOVES his \\"perks\\" (like the cupholder)...he's completely spoiled to them! We've had it for over a year and it is worth every penny. Everytime anyone new sees it they immediately \\"oooo\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall the seat is good","review":"I do like this car seat. The only problem with this car seat is that it is difficult to install (rear-facing at least). My infant seems to be comfortable in the seat. The other aspect that I like is that the car seat is rear-facing until 1 year of age or approx 30lbs. I think this car seat is reasonable priced for all that you get from it as well. Very easy to adjust as the child grows. All-in-all the car seat is good in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harness Straps Keep Twisting","review":"My wife and I each have seat in our car for carrying our 18-month-old toddler. She has a Britax Marathon convertible car seat. I have a Cosco Eddie Bauer Deluxe 3-in-1 car seat. Neither of us has had any problems using the Britax seat with thick harness straps that don't twist. The lap-buckle system on the Britax harness is easy to use and can be undone with one hand. The seat cover was also easy to remove when my daughter spilled juice all over her seat. In contrast, within 2 weeks using the Cosco seat and wrestling my toddler into the harness, the thin harness straps on my Cosco seat were a twisted mess, that just kept getting worst. The overlapping buckle system is a pain to line up and use. I've finally decided to give up on the Cosco seat. I got tired of trying to straighten the harness straps and to fasten the complicated buckle. I just ordered another Britax Marathon."},{"rating":"1","title":"installment","review":"I have not yet tried this car seat out in the front facing position, but rear facing it is a pain to install. It is near impossible to get it reclined as instructed. When I put this in my car I refused to drive with her in that car. When we took a trip where my baby fell asleep her head would plop down to her chest which is VERY dangerous, especially for newborns. When the police came to help install it they placed 3 pool noodles underneath it and it was still not reclined as instructed. Actually, every car seat I have had needed noodles and it is ridiculous and should be against the law. If a car seat needs to be \\"rigged\\" in order to be installed correctly, it should be taken off the market. On a good note, the harnesses are easy to pull tight and loosen."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!","review":"We have had this car seat for almost a year now and we love it. It is super comfy. My daughter is almost 2 but is as big as a 3 year old and she fits in it perfectly. I love that it can be used as a booster seat also. I admit that it is a bit difficult to install but we took it to the seat check people (seatcheck.org) and had them to do it, that way it was in safely."},{"rating":"2","title":"very practical, but difficult for rear facing in a car","review":"The seat is fantastic, mainly because you will never need another car seat. I can't say for myself but it looks very comfortable to sit in. It is a little difficult to install for rear facing, especially in my car, which isn't small, it's a four door Nissan Altima. But you need to have it fully reclined for rear facing so it does take up some room. It's not the car seat you will want to take out and move from car to car until you can front face it, but the fact that it holds your child until 100 lbs is the BEST!! So as long as you don't mind struggling to secure it for rear facing it's well worth it. Once you can go forward it's cake! And not to mention it's very fashionable. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat, Problem with Fabric","review":"This is an excellent car seat. It looks great and my eight month old is very comfortable in it. It's nice and spacious (need a bigger vehicle for it to fit rear facing), and when he sleeps, his head doesn't droop. However, the area where his feet are, has pilled. It doesn't bother me too much now, but I'm wondering how long it will last. He's only been in it for two months.

It may be helpful to those Americans who begin to sense that they are not \\"insync\\" with the Europeans with whom they live and work. The sense that there is an indescribable defensiveness, a manipulative art of \\"non\\"communication that baffles the American sensitivities. That feeling of being \\"held at bay\\", regardless if with Germans or Brits, French or Italians. A feeling there is a collective European attitude passed on through generations born out of institutionalized horror, surviving war and poverty, concealment and distrust.It is NOT tourists, those who only experience sights and foods. It is for those American expats - or those living and working in Europe more than 6 months - who have gotten beyond romanticizing about those quaint tourist traps in which they settled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anecdotal evidence on Europe","review":"I found this book to be offensive, arrogant and an extremely hard read. The author uses anecdotal evidence to support his case to slight the European hand at every opportunity dwelling on the past and lamenting change. It does give an insight into how Americans are different and how their history has shaped a different perspective on life. It glorifies America's achievements both at home and abroad and glides over similar social problems that exist in America today.

The content and pictures are great, but what doesn't work well on the e-version, is the text and formating. It is difficult for the early reader to find the text, and some pages are blank which causes delays and disinterest in the child. I do think this would be a great book in paperback just not so great in the e-version.

The plot is thick and full of unimportant descriptions and unbelivable situations. Characters have not a life of their own: they rather enter or go out according to the needs of the writer (Brock is substituted by Midwinter in Armadale's company, Midwinter by Pedgift Junior, ans so on). The worst of the book is how previsible situations can be, and when they are not previsible at all, they are left without explanation (for example, why immediately after their marriage, Lydia losses Midwinter's affection?). I give the book two stars because of the two characters I have just mentioned: Lydia Gwilt and Ozias Midwinter. Both are intelligent, passionate and have a will of their own. They recognize each other among the dull flock of characters that surrounds them. It is a pity the plot was not as fine as its starrings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mystery","review":"I love Collins' character development,writing style and storylines.

As you advance, there are distinct differences. If you are a beginner interested in target shooting, buy this book. If you are interested in self-defense, then you may want to look elsewhere.

The sparkle and wit that permeated the first book is not as prevalent (maybe I just missed Winston the dog) and because much of the Harte/Madison conflict had been resolved by Rafe and Hannah in \\"Eclipse Bay\\", the feud as a plot device was lacking!

This is one of the disappointments. She bailed on sensual scences and she didn't fully develop the plot. I didn't care about any of these people.

It follows the continuing story of Boy and Willow from the first novel. But the story from the first doesn't really continue with them, I think only because when Valerian died, it was a closure to that story for the most part.

The one-star rating is unfortunately for the poor sound quality. Only the 4th CD (live from Osaka) is above bootleg quality, while the other three (for these ears at least) are rather poor. Not even as good as Werewolves of London and at the rather hefty cost, not really worth it. Gary Barden is uneven in the mix and then the keyboards are way too high on the 3rd CD (being the Built to Destroy Tour). On the plus side, some nice photos of the boys, being Paul Raymond, Cozy Powell (RIP) et al and some decent liner notes from Paul Raymond, although more details from Paulie would have been nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The books that brought back the Force!","review":"There was a time almost a decade ago when SW was dead, a thing from the past, then one day passing by a bookstore something called my attention \\"Heir to the Empire\\", What's this?

Undoubtely this trilogy (completed by \\"Dark Force Rising\\" & \\"The Last Command\\") are as close to the original vision of George Lucas as they could have been and it is the best story of all the Expanded Universe.

I'm not a big fan of Sammy Hagar and his squealing and strained singing style, and I can never come to terms with a Van Halen without David Lee Roth. But believe me, that has nothing to do with my low rating. Most of the songs are just not captivating and they are forgettable. If you prefer Sammy Hagar over David Lee Roth, like I know a lot of people do, you better buy \\"5150\\" instead of \\"Balance\\" since it's the best Hagar/VH album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"The main issue with Balance is tone.

A heavier sound than most of their other album's material. I thought it was generic. Key tracks are: The Seventh Seal, Can't Stop Loving You, Don't Tell Me and Aftershock.

It's sad where Sammy took this once outstanding and timeless group of icons. Now Cherone (who wrote WARHEADS w/Extreme \\"...I'm a warhead, he's a warhead, she's a warhead, etc\\") is taking over. Suggestion to Eddie, \\"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE choose a lyricist first and a strong singer second next time around, okay? Sort of like you did the first time!\\" Name a song which will live on forever in the Sammy Hagar era. It's like trying to rhyme a word with orange.

But the album shows clear signs of tiredness by the part of the band, with Anthony and Alex delivering the most predictable rhythm section as always, and Eddie annoying the listener with messy guitar solos, mixtured with uninspired guitar licks and riffs. Above all this, comes the limited and weary voice of SAmmy Hagar. Not the mention the usual silly lyrics.. All in all, a great waste of time, but VH fans will always swallow anything these heartless and commercial rockers ever put out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst VH release with Sammy Hagar on Vocals!","review":"Hagar never really fit Van Halen the way David Lee Roth did. Roth was there from the start and his presence was known greatly and he, like Vince Neil with Motley Crue, made the band work with the other members. Hagar took over in 1986 and he gave the band a more radio approach. The songs were more poppy, Eddie played piano and keyboards more and the lyrics became more serious than Dave's \\"party-hearty\\" anthems. However, when Roth left VH, he left them with a DYNAMITE CD, \\"1984\\". With this, Hagar's last release with VH, he leaves with the worst album the band has ever released (besides the VHIII album that awaited). The songs are flat and only \\"The Seventh Seal\\" gets kickin' like Van Halen. The rest are Hootie and The Blowfish-esque crap. This isn't Van Halen, this is a middle-aged band that resembles the once powerful VH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VH's WORST ALBUM","review":"Don't waste your money on this. This is the worst VH album of all time. Even Van Halen 3 is better than this. Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?) and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now. The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Halen Rocks!","review":"This is good because it has the hit \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" but the lesser known songs are also very good for anyone who likes Van Halen and good guitar licks."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 or 5 stars?","review":"Well, I don't know. It's a tough call. But since I'm listening to this CD right now (and loving it!), I'll be generous and give a 5. Every song on here is strong, even the supposed \\"filler\\" instrumentals like \\"Doin' Time\\" and \\"Baluchitherium\\", which REALLY rocks with Eddie's smooth-as-silk guitar gliding over the crunchy riffs in the background. There are the typical great VH singalong tunes like \\"Can't Stop loving You\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\", a cheesy (but still good) ballad in \\"Not Enough\\", but also some real thoughful, darker songs like \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"Feelin'\\". And the 'epic' song \\"The Seventh Seal\\" recalls the \\"Poundcake\\" riff, but by no means rips it off in any way. It's an original, and great, tune! If Van Halen 3 is really THAT bad (I haven't heard it yet), I don't see why they slipped so much. After all, Sammy sucks (according to the DLR fans), so him leaving wouldn't have made a difference. ;) (yeah, RIGHT.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sammy's Best","review":"This album is quite possibly Hagar's best since 5150, there are many rockers such as the title track and the silly but brilliant Amsterdam.

I recommend every fan of the Hagar era of Van Halen to get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best VH CD","review":"Without a doubt, this is my favorite Van Halen disc. Eddie's playing is superb, especially on Don't Tell Me. I always wondered what a follow-up with Sammy to this CD would have sounded like..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purely Awesome","review":"This is an example of REAL musicians writing excellent pop songs. Songs like \\"Take Me Back(Deja Vu)\\", \\"Amsterdam\\", \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\", \\"Not Enough\\" and last but not least \\"Feelin\\" are written with such talent that you can hardly stop listening to it. The istrumentals are fun as well. The \\"Seventh Seal\\" is not my favorite but it is still a good Sammy-era song. It was an excellent last(?) album for the Red Rocker. Hopefully, the band can come to it's senses and get back with one of the best rock singers of all time. Nobody can match his vocal skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wam Bam Amsterdam!","review":"Some of their best songs are on this cd. Great improvement in song writing compared to previous VH albums. I wish they had never gotten rid of Sammy. I really dig this one. I'm not going to get into the Sammy vs DLR debate. As far as I'm concerned they are both great for Van Halen. The songs on Balance are certainly darker than typical VH. There seems to be more layered guitars than before and it actually works out to sound great. I don't understand why people are complaining about \\"Amsterdam\\". Sure the lyrics are silly and somewhat of a departure from the rest of the album (except \\"Big Fat Money\\") but isn't that more the typical VH partying rockin' music people love? Amsterdam rocks as far as I'm concerned. The ONLY song on Balance that I don't like is \\"Big Fat Money\\". Van Halen is back with Sammy now in '04, and I can't wait to see them in Atlanta.

There was a Geronimo, Chato, Mangas, etc. Gens. Crook and Miles, Lts Gatewood and Davis and scout Al Sieber, et al. But other than that this film was nothing but a typical Hollywood hodgepoge of loosly taken incidents jumbled together in a totally unconnected and out of sync historical sham. For instance, Lt Britton Davis had resigned his commission long before Gen. Crook resigned as commander of the Dept. of Arizona and Gen. Miles replaced him. His resignation had nothing to do with feeling bad for the Apaches but he had finally burned out after numerous long, hard campaigns. It goes on and on but if anyone is truly interested in the history of the Apache wars there are any number of reliable historical accounts available.

This should have been done as it was shown in the theaters, wide screen. It might look ok on a small tv set in full frame but it would only be a good buy in a dollar store! Considering what a good movie this was it deserved to be done wide screen. I bought it new from Amazon four months ago and as usual i have bought so many films in the past few months i finally got around to looking at it and was stunned to see that it was full frame format but advertised as anamorphic which to me means wide screen.

To top it off, even the Amazon.com \\"Editorial Review\\" shown above gets it wrong. What gives? Not that he is necessarily the greatest presence of this exemplary ensemble; I was highly impressed with all of them, and even remarked to my wife that Jason Patric must be a fine horseman before learning that he did all the stunts himself.The story and scenery are all first rate too. The next time you get out to Moab, Utah you can check out the spectacular locations (near or maybe in Canyonlands National Park for some of them).

Listening to the tape was so much easier. Plus the reader does a terrific job of making it seem like Feynman himself is talking. A 5-star recording!I listened to this tape on my daily commute, having just returned from a trip to Los Alamos the week before. Feynman worked there as a young graduate student and shares personal insights about Oppenheimer, Fuchs and the others on the tapes.This set of tapes is a terrific collection of short pieces on everything from The Bomb to how his father whetted his interest in science as a child. A must-listen for anyone remotely intrigued by brilliant teachers, science, and/or raising children. Have I forgotten anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writer, but the worst publisher","review":"I bought the book so that I can enjoy reading the brilliant thinking of Mr. Feynman. But it's painful to read this book from this publisher - Basic Books of the Perseus Books Group. The book paper is not of good quality. I can live with that. But font is so bad. In the middle of some paragraphs, a line is changed to smaller font. It happens all through the book. It just make my eye sore. I will avoid this publisher as possible as I can in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasurable reading","review":"Feynman expresses a love for discovery, starting with his father's walk in the woods ... not identifying birds but rather trying to discover why the birds do things. He sees science as fitting in the mold of asking questions of the form: \\"If I do this, what will happen?\\" and of doubt being a continual part of the scientific process. He views religion as not having this doubt, but I would offer Paul Tillich as a counter example. His chief area of conflict is with the metaphysical aspects of religion.He has little patience either for sociology or psychology, pseudoscience or the ponderousness of philosophy. In some ways he is still a \\"kind in a candy shop\\", for example hob-knobbing with physicist at the Los Alamos lab, but never afraid of any of them when he is talking about physics. He exhibits a quest for truth, for example if the Challenger inquiry. The articles on understanding physics reveal his enthusiasm at its best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This is THE best book I have read all year. Excellent insight into science, government, and religion.

And it's wrong.'Not true for physics. We derive our common sense from the things around us--if the laws we use to describe the world strike us as any more complicated that their phenomenon, we should be suspicious. Feynman's physics always inspires me with the same simplicity as I find in the world--it's a joy to read.Just because it's simple, though, shouldn't make you doubt his intellect. The great dancers always make it look easy, too. His chapters on computation, for instance, are the grist for the yet-to-be tested quantum computer, still very much on the cusp of QM. Presented here for anyone to understand. If beautiful physics carries a sort of necessity, this thing has got to be built."},{"rating":"2","title":"great used","review":"the book is in good look , there are no torn papers and no scratches , i really liked the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book if you haven't read much Feynman","review":"All but one of the 'shorts' in this book have previously been published - if you have extensively read Feynman (or even moderately) you'll learn/read nothing new about him.If you are a new Feynman discoverer however it is a superb book and may well lead you on to wanting to get hold of his other works.For me though, I was looking for new stuff and was a little disappointed although I did read the whole book and am pleased to have it in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing to say the least.

I'd love to trade them my ball for the one in their picture!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am using it right now","review":"Overall I like this product. There are some problems: The pump is amazingly cheap-o and I needed a plus one to blow it up initially (someone to hold the pump nozzle up against the opening in the ball since the nozzle does not fit into the opening, it just rests on top and someone to pump the pump). Another minor annoyance is having to re-fill the ball. The plug is hard to remove, it has broken my nails and caused much consternation and minor pain. That said. I would still buy this product because it looks good, I've only had to refill it twice (at the beginning), now it seems to have settled into it's self. I use this as an alternative to my office chair, maybe I will use it as an exercise ball, but for now it just helps me be more comfortable and active while sitting at my desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"peels paint","review":"I do not like this exercise ball.

The pearly white looks decorative.P.S. I'm noticing that someone else has mentioned a strong chemical smell coming from the ball. I, too, am sensitive to these smells. The first ball I ordered arrived in early January (and was given away as a gift) and did not have any problematic odors. A second ball which came more recently is very smelly. We're putting it outside to air out and hope it will get better. The odor is quite strong -- can't be too \\"green\\" an item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too soft","review":"I had to return this ball, when inflated to 65cm, it was still a gummy, soft plush ball that my body sunk 1/4 way into.

The texture is shiny and sticky, which may be fine for exercise, but not comfortable for sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Squishy","review":"I bought this item for myself to work out. I expected it to be amazing for the price, but when I opened it and pumped it up I learned otherwise.The ball is the size it's advertised as, BUT is way too squishy to work out on. I was expecting a firm work out ball but this one is near impossible to use unless you want it for seating. I wouldn't buy this again. My Walmart work out ball was 1/2 the price and better than this product. The packaging was nice but the product is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Smell/Out-Gassing","review":"I received this item about two weeks ago, but have yet to put it to good use because of the strong chemical smell due to out/off gassing - particularly disturbing since I'm hoping to use it as a birthing ball. I've let it air out on the fire escape and in a small storage room; the room took on the odor after a few days.I haven't been particularly sensitive to smell throughout my pregnancy, so I'm reluctant to chalk it up to that.

Rubber seems to be average or better thickness, and I expect it will hold up better than a couple flimsy ones I've seen/tried in the past. The pump is mostly a joke. Pump/tube/connections kept falling apart, probably faster to blow up manually, (but that would put some water in the ball then.) Luckily, after abandoning the joke of a pump I was able to inflate it in seconds with spray nozzle on my air compressor, nice!No instructions included, so no indication of how much air to put in or any other use guidelines. Fill nozzle just comes with a plastic plug that goes in hard and comes out much harder (almost felt like I might damage the ball when I opened it to add more air.) In short, the total package is junk. Still as it was near the lowest price out their, it gets 4 out of 5 as a solid value and because the actual ball seems to be fine quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Customer Service","review":"This company provides lousy customer service. I originally ordered the ball with basically no problems at the time; however, when I moved recently, the plastic \\"pin\\" got lost (that holds the air in).I left two voice mails and sent two emails over a one month period, asking them if they sell replacements, and how can I buy another pin. But I've received absolutely no reply from them, whatsoever.When you call their company, it's one of those automatic, electronic voice mails without any business message, etc. This does not bode well for customers if you have a problem order. The feeling I got was that there was no \\"there\\" there.Given this vendor's complete lack of customer responsiveness, I DO NOT recommend buying from them. I suggest you order a different ball from another vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the size advertised","review":"I was looking for an exercise ball to use as a desk chair, I tried a 65cm one and it was the appropriate height.

Although the book is listed for ages 9-12, it's really more appropriate for 12 and above. My son found it difficult to stay interested in this book as it's not written in a format that keeps a 9-year-old intrigued. My son is an excellent reader, so being unable to read wasn't the problem.

Allen's life reminded me of a true Greek drama; he started meekly, earned success and then went through a period of soul searching and redemption. A true journey that Borelli captures with passion and zeal.

I personally have found it frustrating that the authors did not go into more detail on some of those suggestions as I have difficulty writing Director code, but that has motivated me to put more effort into learning it. Unfortunately, the completed examples of the game that the authors indicated would be posted on their web site are not there and it is difficult, if not impossible, to contact them.

Luckily, I caught it from the beginning. It moved me in so many ways from laughter to tears. The relationship between 'Jumper and Splendid' was a classic father daughter relationship. His sensitivity to her concerns and fears after he finally heard what she had been saying from the beginning of the movie was a tear-jerker. The evolution of Talbot and the education of Bear were equally as heartwarming. This movie was somehow overlooked by the general public, I am glad that I found it. I have shared it with my daughter. I found the movie and I am currently looking for the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Movie","review":"My wife and I stumbled onto this movie two years ago and we have been trying to buy it ever since.

Some might counter that 4...Qf6 usually transposes to 4...Bc5 lines, e.g. 4...Qf6 5. Be3 Bc5, but that is actually all the more reason to cover 4...Qf6: knowing the possibilities for transposition is arguably one of the most important facets in one's opening preparations. Besides, there is certainly some independent significance to 4...Qf6, i.e. 5. Nb3 does not attack Black's Bc5, and after 5. Be3 Qg6 can lead to very sharp but balanced play after 6.

Despite some promising settings and characters (the hills of Kentucky, the factories and schools of upstate New York, the Depression), and the potential to say something about the big issues of the times such as poor industrial conditions, segregation, anti-British setiment during WWI, the book in the end does nothing except follow the mopings of the protagonist from emotional failure to disappointing moment.

Maybe this is because the movie is so boring that it is hard to be drawn into the movie.

Moreover, he shows you why you should agree with him even if your initial reaction was quite the opposite. Many of the reviewers remarked that he would be a good person to have a conversation with.

What I found was an annoying, over-blown polemic that tried desparately to locate deep sociological, demographic,and cultural trends in EVERY television show selected. The author's quest for meaning frequently stretches both the reader's credulity and patience. Just as a cigar is sometimes just a cigar, sometimes TV programs are just diversion or entertainment, and nothing more.

After reading Computer Privacy Handbook, I've taken several steps. First, I never surf the web without using a service such as www.freedom.net. Second, I use encryped email and/or www.hushmail.com for my email. I have yet to figure out how to protect my financial and medical privacy, but I'm working on that. Thank you, Mr. Bacard, for changing my life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"privacy paranoid","review":"I bought this book first because I needed to read on PGP however when I started reading i forgot the PGP and found the privacy issues very interesting and made me more aware!

A haunting story, beautifully filmed, with a superb cast. Cinematography and music score could not have been better. The sound and video quality were so good that the Blu-Ray version is not necessary. On the second disk, there is an an additional section of scenes, around ten minutes, that was included. These extra scenes, however, were not necessary for the story. The brief interviews with the author and several cast members was also enlightening. Having watched BBC Masterpiece productions for over thirty years, this production was by far my favorite. I am thankful for all who were involved in this production. For the price, this is a terrific value.

Most Masterpiece movies I have seen are not vulgar. It was not rated (NR), so I took the chance on buying it. Because of Masterpiece Classic ratings especially in the language category. I started to look at it, and I couldn't believe what was said. I couldn't wait to dump it in the garbage. The filthy words was too much to bare. I just got to the first vulgar word spoken in the movie and that was enough for me. I exit the movie so fast someone would have thought my hands were on fire. Better to burn my hands now then to allow the soul to burn eternally.It is not a movie that (some adults) care to look at. This movie should be rated so people will know it's rated R, and beyond.

I'm still not sure I have seen her dance, because there were no close-ups and the picture was, as another reviewer noted, fuzzy. The audio problems were not simply a matter of recording but also of the musical performance itself. The orchestra, band, or whatever provided the accompaniment was not identified-- for good reason.

These are international folk songs collected from around the world and done in the New Christy Minstrels style - from what I have read about them, some people did not like their style of folk but it was the only style I had heard up to that point - I fell in love with both Karen Gunderson and Ann White's voices as a young boy, and I still enjoy them to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old days","review":"First heard \\"Yamao Toko No Uta\\" playing in a store while walking through the shopping area in Naha, Okinawa over 40 years ago.

I'd like to say it was sturdy when it was installed, except that the bottom mounts for the metal supports were so warped there was no way to mount the seat. You may think this is a rare occurrence, that is until you look at the non-'New Classic' model reviews (still listed as model 109459).Also, don't bother if you have a quick-release seat on your bicycle.

Ok, so far so good. Then I got on the bike. I'm 5'9 180 pounds and she couldn't sit there without hitting my butt/back as I rode. She lasted about 20 feet before she asked to get out because it was so uncomfortable. Nothing was adjustable, so I had to take it back off, and begin the search again for another carrier...

I put it together myself and noticed after just step one (putting the bottom brackets on) that there was a problem... the bars are completely warped and crooked. Well, I take that back. It was only one that was warped. I continued to put it together, then took it out to put on the bike... and I just couldn't make it work.

Which means that even when you should be looking another way, you have to watch the screen constantly to know if it's time to do something else. I have an enormous collection of workout DVDs, and this has one of the laziest productions I have ever seen. With the technology available on DVD, there should have been an option to have a voiceover or not. Thus, one could learn with the voiceover, and later practice without it for a more zen session.

The roller coaster of ups and downs provides the reader with a set of emotions different from any other book. Just when you think the plot has settled back down, it throws you right back into suspense. For example, right after they receive the phone call it seems like they're not going to the island. Then in the next chapter the reader is surprised to find them going to Bornholm. The climax and ending are so good it's very hard to put the book down.The details of the book are also superb. When they have the problem on the way back to Bornholm it's almost as if you're there. I recommend this book as well as the whole Young Underground Series to readers who love conflict and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean, Interesting, Cheesy","review":"The book is an enjoyable piece of historical fiction for young adults, however, the constant references to Christianity were rather cheesy and unbelievable. One of the characters, a young boy named Henrik, was unable to comprehend why anyone would be nice and help his mother escape from being held wrongfully in prison, and the book's explanation was that those helping were Christian. As a Christian myself, I do passionately believe that Christians should be known for their love for others, but sadly recognize that that is not always the case, and that often it is rather the non-Christians who can be the most accepting and helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of how KM is done with Lotus Discovery","review":"This book does an excellent job of putting in plain english what the various knowledge management concepts are and how they are supported in the Lotus Discovery System.

While many articles on car leasing seem to lean toward the negative, Mr. Doering clearly describes how leasing can be much better than purchasing.I like the idea of pocketing the difference in payments and investing or utilizing that amount over the term of the lease. I also like having a new car that is in warranty. If you purchase, your warranty would expire in the third year with perhaps 2 more years to go on the financing.Thanks Mr. Doering for your easy to understand ideas!Angelo Stalis"},{"rating":"2","title":"In defense of Laura Dern!","review":"I must disagree with the reviewer who so strongly criticized Laura Dern's performance. While it is true that 'Rambling Rose' has its weaknesses (the abrupt, rather unexplained ending, for one thing), I found the story line humorous and even charming. Dern's performance made the movie, in my opinion! Diane Ladd overacts a bit, as usual, but this is a minor flaw with the film as a whole. What stuck with me was Dern's 'little girl lost' expression mixed with her coy devil-may-care flirtation, which made for an entirely winning performance. I loved the music too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant diversion","review":"Contrary to another viewer, I though Laura Dern's acting was very good in this film, unlike in \\"Jurassic Park\\" where she really did seem gawky and unnatural. The film has some nostalgia, some laughs, and some pathos. Not a classic, but an enjoyable diversion about a free-spirited young woman who creates havoc around her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly beautiful!","review":"Decent film-making here, a decent performance from the cast and Laura Dern was indeed a good surprise. After having witness her in films like Jurassic Park, it was good to see her in a warm, engaging drama like this film that had Laura Dern as the main attraction. Beautiful cinematography and score that suited the warm atmosphere of the film. A fabulous performance by Robert Duvall, Lucas Haas and Diane Ladd. It was good to see John Heard in a brief role. Overall, the film is quite a journey, a perfect film for a quiet rainy day, watch it and you will surely find yourself engaged in the film completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whose body is it, anyway?","review":"Another movie that kept me on the edge of my seat. I originally was intrigued my Lukas Haas, of whom I have been a fan since \\"Witness.\\" The theme of \\"unbridled female sexuality\\" and how it was often \\"handled\\" in more primitive times is unsettling, as it should be. The concept of a woman not owning her own body is one our society continues to struggle with, and it is a tribute to Laura Dern's integrity that she was willing to take on a film that made such a statement - the footprint of a career that continues that work.I am uncomfortable with the sexuality beteen Haas and Dern, in spite of the Rose's endearing remorse. Again, is sex between adult and child something we want to continue to normalize in a culture that claims concern for the safety of children? Or is art beyond that kind of responsiblity? I wish I knew. It's a powerful question, though.And we wonder why our young actors end up in trouble.Witness (Special Collector's Edition)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!

In the brave new world of CDs a single is now something you buy in addition to the album because the very best CD-singles offer you tracks you cannot get on the album. That is the case here with the CD-single \\"Fly Away\\" by Lenny Kravitz. You have the original single from his 1998 album \\"5\\" along with a live acoustic version of the track and \\"Believe,\\" both recorded at a Seattle radio station. Obviously, it is those live acoustic tracks that make picking up this CD-single worthwhile for Kravitz fans. Kravitz built his musical reputation on being a master synthesis, which is more accurate than simply labeling him as \\"retro.\\" But behind all that there is the craftsmanship he brings to the studio. That makes the live cuts even more interesting, because this is Kravitz without the advantages of technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great song!","review":"I am not a huge Lenny Kravitz fan, but I love the song \\"Fly Away\\".

I don't think I have ever gotten pissed off from a guidebook before, but this one definitely got to me. Finally, there is no picture... of anything. Just lots of words. I don't want a guidebook with words! I'd get a history book in that case. I don't want to look for words in a paragraph when I'm lost in Hong Kong!

Highly recommend this book to all VB.NET programmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mastery of the material does not make a good book","review":"Mr. Richter has an incredible mastery of the elements of the .NET Framework. As others have observed, Microsoft development teams could indeed benefit from reading the book. (In fact, there are several instances in which Mr. Richter critiques the implementation that Microsoft has provided and offers his recommendation on how it could be improved.) Unfortunately, you would have to be a member of a Microsoft development team to have enough grounding in the concepts presented here to benefit from Mr. Richter's expertise. What it comes down to is there's a difference between presenting material and providing the tools that enable a learning experience to occur."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for advanced .NET","review":"This is a good book if you are serious on becoming an .NET expert. This book shows the right direction and clarifies the .NET Framework. If you are experienced with VB.NET, then this book is more useful. I am an experienced VB.NET/COM professional . This book helped me to master the overall .NET Framework. I recommend this book to all VB.NET programmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Read","review":"I am a technical person.

It's slimline look makes for easy and attractive storage but no abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joss can't go wrong","review":"The creator of the Buffy universe, Joss Wheaton, is a master in his own right. The Buffy-verse is filled with magic, wonder, love, death and life. The thing that really made people get into Buffy was how they could relate to it. These characters, however powerful they were, still had many human flaws and triumphs. Joss seems to create very powerful characters with many related qualities that can be translated very easly back to the very people who watch the show. So take some time to sit back and engage yourself in the world that is Buffy. You never know you may end up at a convention someday :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy the DVDs seperately, it's only $132!!!","review":"Yup, it's true. $20 for seasons 2-7 and $32 for season 1 = $132. Unless you want to pay $55 extra just to get the official \\"collector set box\\", you're better off buying each season on its own (plus then you can buy the new-used ones and save even more!). How has no one noticed this?!?This is a great show, thus I give it 5 stars. Amazon, however, is just trying to get you to pay extra. Hint: a box is not worth $55, nor is any of the special packaging you get in the collectors edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy Complete Series","review":"I always loved the Buffy series.

Don't make the mistake of buying the first season to see if you'll like it. Then you'll be like, \\"Oh man, I should have just bought the 40 disc set, which I will now anyway, but then I'll have not needed to buy the first season.\\" I don't know, heh...The writing is _SO_ well done, in sharp contrast to the movie -- I was quite shocked. Having seen the movie in the theatre those many years ago, I was not really inclined to care too much about the television series. Holy cow did I miss out on a lot of hillarious goodness.This is definitely the way to go too... no commercials!There are some real adult themes goin' on by the 3rd season, so just be aware for the kiddie's sake. That said, this truly is the best 6480 minutes of tv that you'll ever own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Region 1 vs. Region 2 - Are We So Different????","review":"Apparently there is a disconnect between the Region 1 and the Region 2 marketing gurus - have they not figured out that the Region 1 audiences want special editions, too?Why buy Seasons 1-7 as a set if they are exactly the same thing as buying them individually? The ONLY reason to buy this set would be if you have never purchased a single season on DVD and want to take the leap and buy it all at once. And how many fans do not own at least one season on DVD? I would think a low percentage.(...)Last complaint....the Region 2 version apparently comes with \\"a book containing a run through on all 144 episodes and a list of Joss' favourite episodes\\" (according to a review on amazon.co.uk) - I want that!!!...can we buy this separately?Buffy is phenomenal and we in Region 1 just want the right to separated from our money just like our Region 2 peers. Thank you for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chosen Collection","review":"I'm not critiquing the show itself, but the packaging for this set. The box has a very nice look to it, but seems very flimsy. Also the cases for each individual season seems easily breakable. I put all my DVDs in a separate CD holder so as not to damage the cases. Also who designed the box? They left Anya off the front! How dare they! Everyone else is there, except minor characters. Also the cast photos on the cover of each season case is weird. Especially season seven. Xander is absent from the photo. Weird. Other than that I really liked the collection, but I really only bought for the DVDs so those little things aren't too big of a deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Buffy Skeptic","review":"When I first heard there was going to be a show entitled \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" I, like everyone else i knew, laughed and thought about how ridiculous that sounded. i never watched it, until, that is, I got my tonsils out two years ago and was forced to stay home during the day. I channel surfed past the WB and saw the most beautiful man i had ever seen in my life. Chisled cheek bones, bleached hair, long leather duster....my very fantasies come to life....but what WAS this show? i watched the entire show and by the end was hooked. i bought the first season the very next day. i never looked back.But a few months ago i was forced to sell all seven seasons to pay the rent. (life's tough all over, right?) yesterday, my mother asked what i wanted for christmas (don't go oner $200, please) and guess what i answered.....can't wait to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BOX SET","review":"I love Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I was eagerly looking forward to the receipt of my box set. Having seen (and coveted) the set on friends' bookshelves, I knew what it was supposed to look like. I thought for sure I had the right item here as the pictures matched what I wanted, and the description specified that there were 40 Discs (as opposed to the regular Complete Series, which only has 39, as it is lacking the disc of special features). The item I received in the mail is NOT the box set. It is not packaged all neatly with cool pictures and stuff. It does not have the letter from Joss Whedon. And it does not have the special 40th disc. Instead, it is just the sim DVDs of each of the seven seasons shoved together in a box. Additionally, it has quite a bit of wear & tear despite being, supposedly, new, so even if it had been what I ordered, I would have been displeased."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST EVER","review":"I AM A 30 YEAR SOLDIER SERVING IN THE MILITARY AND I MUST SAY THAT THIS SHOW HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS EVER WRITTEN. AFTER WATCHING THE MOVIE, I WAS NOT VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS SHOW BUT AFTER THE FIRST SEASON MY DOUBTS WERE LAID TO REST. THE REST OF THE SEASONS ONLY GOT BETTER. THE DEPTH AND HUMOR ARE UNSURPASSED FOR A TELEVISION SHOW BUT THE PLETHORA OF ISSUES THAT FORM THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE BRILLIANT JOB OF THE SHOW'S WRITERS. A MUST SEE AND OWN FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO GET A LITTLE MORE OUT OF TELEVISION THAN DRIVEL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality DVD's make this an expensive rental.","review":"The show is excellent of course. I would give 5 stars for the artistic quality of the show. However the DVD's have lasted less than a year. DVD's, or any disc format seems to be incredibly short-lived, whether it is becasue of poor quality manufacture, or just the format itself I am not sure, but my discs are going to hell after only three viewings. That is on brand new equiptment, and I am super careful with handling them. The manufacture here appears to be very low quality, so keep that in mind when purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"I never watched this series when it was on tv.

I am a HUGE fan of Buffy and have watched every episode since the first airing, but I WAITED to buy any of the season sets. I have also done the same thing for Friends, which is now also being released in a Complete Series set at a large discounted price over buying each season separately.I will also wait for Angel, hoping that it will soon follow Buffy with the release of a Complete Boxed Set as well.Waiting is good for any show... even if they are never released in a Complete Set. Regardless of the show, each season set is ALWAYS drastically reduced in price after a few years. You can save a bunch on each season if you wait. Patience is a virtue that saves money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Boxset Has a Plain, Generic, Boring Cover!","review":"Buffy The Vampire Slayer is one of the most awesome TV shows I have ever seen, it is just a magnificent series but I have to agree with the complaints about this boxset not being as good as the hype lead us to believe it would be. I agree that if you haven't bought any seasons of this remarkable show yet that this is probably the best and cheapest way to get all seven seasons (if you can find one in good condition) but if you own all of the seven individual seasons on DVD then I would just say to keep them because this boxset is not only flimsly and the plastic holders can break easily but the boxset is also ugly. The individual DVD sets have nice covers with beautiful photos of Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy usually with some of the supporting actors/characters standing in the back-ground on either side of her but the cover-art on the box for this 40 disc collection is ugly, boring, plain and generic."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the buffy you will ever need","review":"I am glad that I could get all the episodes in one package it's just easier to keep up with.If your a BVS fan and haven't gotten any of the dvds and you want them all this boxset is for you.The bonus disc in the set I thought was a welcomed touch as well.It being out of print now I got lucky and picked this one up.If you find one be sure to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"buffy complete box set","review":"All very wonderful up until season 5 where the last 2 disks will not play and have obvious printing defects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"The videos of the TV shows are very good.

Better quality than most packaged sets ... that's what I've been told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action, comedy, romance, heroine stupidity... what more could you want?","review":"I watched seasons 1, 2 and part of 3 back when they first aired... I have to say that I was not getting some of the comedy, as a barely teen should not. The action is packed it tention releasing jokes and puns, but still offers a level of maturity and drama to entertain any viewer. Even my boyfriend enjoys watching it. Fun for everyone 15+, not to say that younger kids CAN'T watch it, but they won't understand a lot of the jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show but the DVDs...","review":"I have always been a big fan of the show, it has a good combination of humor and \\"drama\\". My boyfriend got me the entire series for my birthday and it is a nice box, every season has features and some commentaries. The only issue that one may have with the DVDs is that Seasons 1-5 (not sure about 6 and 7 because I didn't get that far yet) is that there isn't a \\"Play All\\" option. You have to play the episodes one at the time which can be kind of annoying if you are trying to have a \\"marathon\\", but it's perfect if you are watching the entire series while running on the treadmill (that's why I gave it 5 stars). One of the discs was scratched and therefore one of the episodes skipped, but other than that it was a great gift. I guess if that would bother someone they could send the entire thing back, but I didn't think it was worth the trouble of mailing the heavy box for 1 disc.I saw there is another more expensive box set and perhaps the DVDs there are set up differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy!!!","review":"I love the collection's presentation, and (while the cardboard filler to even out the odd number of disc cases is a little annoying to someone like me that prefers symmetry) this set up is a LOT better for the condition of the discs. No fear of glue or scratches getting on the discs before I even get to watch any of them. :) I'm very happy to now own the entire Buffy series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the WIDESCREEN????????","review":"Great set other than the widescreen seasons are presented full screen. That is a crock. Why should the limeys get widescreen and we Americans who made the show what it was and is get snubbed? Buy it from the ebay scabs for 800.00+ or wait for another release. I'm waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC!","review":"The facts about this show are not in dispute. It was canceled twice. Dont like it go and blame the networks that canceled it. Terrible acting. Dont like it go blame the actors who were terrible. Terrible scripts. Dont like it go blame the Moronic writers. It cracks me up seeing so few defend this show. There comments and reviews are comic genious. YOu just dont get it do you? :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show ever!!!","review":"I love Buffy, so I was thrilled to get this as a Christmas gift. My only complaint is that if you loan these disks to others to share the joys of the Buffyverse, you might just want to give them the disks, because the art in the box set totally gives away some major plot points!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this series!!!","review":"I have been pricing this item for YEARS now, waiting for a good time to purchase this. I LOVE my boxed set! I have Angel too (also from Amazon) and I'm in the process of watching Buffy from start to end. It was in perfect condition and I am so happy to finally own this series! I highly recommend it. Oh, and if you were a fan of the series back when it was on TV you'll LOVE it still."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY Happy!!!","review":"I bought this several months ago and never did get around to writing a review, so here goes......First of all the package arrived before expected and was packed very well to avoid shipping damage. I purchased a used set so I was a little worried about what condition the DVD's would be in. They were rated a \\"good\\". When I opened I was more than pleasantly surprised as I would rate them as almost like new! Everything that was supposed to come with the new set was there. So, I must say that I would most definitely buy from this seller again with no qualms.As for the series itself.....well, I won't go on about content as there are reviews written here that have already done that and probably better than I could do. If you are a Buffy fan this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy RULES!","review":"I watched Buffy from the beginning and stayed tuned through the first three seasons. I hadn't seen the complete series until I purchased this box set. Going back and watching the first three seasons reminded me just how much I loved this show, and why it is one of the best shows ever put on television. It's got it all, love and death, pain and beauty and humor to tie it all together. What I love about Buffy is that it isn't afraid to go to dark places and it isn't afraid to find the funny in the heart of darkness. The cast is amazing, the writing is more thoughtful and complex than you would ever expect, and it always surprises you with it's ability to capture the angst and agony of growing up and finding out that the world is not what you expected it to be. I love this show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffilicious","review":"I bought this for my husband for Christmas but it really has been a gift for the both of us.

A must have for all Buffy Lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffy is flawless, the DVD packaging is not","review":"I am a huge fan of this series so my review has nothing to do with BtVS but has everything to do with the packaging.The first set I received was crushed and mangled. It rattled when I picked up the box. Amazon replaced it. I watched happily, (in spite of the poor video quality on the 1st season DVD) until today when the last disc of Season 4 was so badly scratched it was unplayable. I'm checking the other discs to see if they'll play, but, according to the customer service rep who responded to my email inquiry, the set has widespread problems. Fox will replace it, but only after you send in the damaged disc, they examine it and determine whether or not to charge you $6.99 for it's replacement.This is all a real disappointment. Has anyone else out there had similar problems?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the 40 disc version","review":"I just need to say that the review has absolutely nothing to do with show and everything to do with the packaging. I haven't seen more than the first season of Buffy and I thought that getting the complete series would be easier than buying all the seasons separately. I still plan on buying the complete series, just this time I am going to buy the \\"Chosen collection\\".I hate the packaging for the complete series. Worst box design ever. The size is awkward and bulky. It is to long to put in the case sideways (it sticks out way over the edge), it takes up an astronomical amount of space when placed withe logo facing forward. The case was just horribly designed, it doesn't fit and it makes me angry. I got so angry I couldn't even watch the show and I had to send it back.I would strongly suggest to buy the \\"Chosen Collection\\". It comes with an extra disc and the design is much more compact and user friendly.Also, what I saw of the show was awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthwhile for fans","review":"If you loved the series and you missed a couple I'm sure this will be a top pick.

Decent value, [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRULY GRAND SERIES","review":"Joss Whedon set out to create an icon in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and succeeded admirably. I can't think of a series that managed to incorporate comedy, drama, horror, fantasy, sci-fi ( even a musical episode once )and, of course, teen angst as well. Another great thing about the show was that as empowering as it obviously was for girls, and women, men were not slammed ( the last episode of season 6 comes to mind- when the world is saved by Xander ).The writing, the cast, and production values on BUFFY were nearly flawless. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy saved me.","review":"You think I'm kidding?When nobody was there for me, Buffy was.When I felt I was the only person dealing with bad situations, Buffy showed me that I wasn't alone.And when it ended, I sobbed uncontrollably.With 40 discs, special features, an episode guide booklet, and a pretty little box to boot, it's no wonder that this is the first thing I'd grab if there were ever a fire in my home. Buffy Anne Summers, (and joss whedon, and the scoobies...) you are my hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chosen Collection","review":"This is probably one of the best shows I've ever watched, and I'm happy that I FINALLY got it.

I opted to have next day delivery, and my package arrived on time in excellent condition. In my old single season sets, some discs were damaged. I've been through 5 seasons so far and have yet to have one problem.This single box stores well and is sturdy enough to last years and years.As far as content, I suspect that if you're considering purchasing the entire collection you must be a fan. You either love it or you don't get it. If you are not sure, I'd purchase season 2 to get a good feel for the show. That way you'd get more episodes than season 1. In later seasons there are many jokes that subtally refer to previous episodes.

I was saddened to later discover that, for technical reasons, there will (likely) never be a Blu-Ray remastering of Buffy TVS. I thus took the plunge on this, the \\"Chosen Collection\\" DVD box set.Amazon's stocking of this item was delayed by a couple of weeks, then finally shipped. I discovered that instead of the limited edition \\"Chosen Collection,\\" I received the following:[search \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer-Complete Series\\" at Buy-dot-com]This is nothing more than a repackaging of the \\"slim\\" editions of each of the seasons. There's no bonus disc, no letter from Joss Whedon, no inner box artwork. It is a cheaper set, both in terms of content, and the competition's (versus Amazon's) price - about $60 cheaper.Hopefully Amazon corrects this item on their site.

I agree that Sunnydale should have had investigations from FBI or CIA because the mortality rate was high for a small city. But as we saw in S4, the government was there as The Iniciative, so clearly there were investigations before by the militaries.I don't see the point of questioning the way vampires get dusted and why their clothes go poof too. Imagine if every vamp Buffy killed she had to collect their clothes. That would be dumb, not the way it is done.Why to bash the made-up mythology? Would it be good if Joss Whedon copied the original ideas of vampires? I don't think so. He was the writer and he could make up his own mythology.There's no reason to say Sarah Michelle Gellar is \\"scrawny\\" as Buffy.

My only complaint is with the coloring of the pages of the guide, and the alternation between a picture and the episode listings. It seems absolutely random. Also, it would have been nice if we could play all the episodes on a disc at once, instead of having to click around the menus each time one episode ends to play the next episode.But that's a small price to pay for owning the complete collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all buffy fans","review":"This product is a must have for all buffy fans. not to mention that this product is extremely rare. the Fox offical Buffy website has retired this product and it is no longer available through them or at any store for that matter. Pick this one up as soon as you can if you are the least bit interested. Its worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"This is a brilliant show. One or two viewings isn't really enough; if you're open minded, give the show a chance and you'll have a great time.If you want pop glitz and silly jokes they are there, but if you want more then you just have to look a little deeper.The DVDs look great. Yes they were shot with a widescreen camera, but they were concieved, framed and only meant to be seen full screen. Joss Whedon has made it clear that it was an error beyond his control that anybody ever saw Buffy in widescreen and that what you see on these DVDs is what he meant you to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Buffy, You'll love this!","review":"What could be better than Buffy in a box. All the seasons packed into one bloody box for your enjoyment. The only strange thing is the seasons are not uniform as far as menus go. They are the way they are in the original season box for each one. Besides that its all Buffy goodness. And for those of you skeptical about watching a tv show about vampires being slain, the show is more about the people than the slaying. Its a really great show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just say Hell YES to the Hellmouth!","review":"If you're looking at this product, chances are you're already a member of the Sunnydale Glee Club. If you're looking for a one-stop shop to fulfill all of your Buffy needs, you have come to the right place. All of the eps are here, some with commentary, some good featurettes, and a brand new disc of extras for those who have already purchased the individual seasons on dvd. The new disc includes a great roundtable Buffy discussion led by the all-powerful Joss Whedon. So don't be afraid to get your geek on and squander too much money and time over this lovely boxed set of Buffy goodness. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go watch Buffy and Angel do it for the first time all over again. Can't wait to see what happens..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent Wrong Product!!","review":"I ordered the Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Chosen Collection instead they sent me The Complete Series. Now when I look at the page for the item I ordered it says that it will now be repackaged without the 40th disc but it definitely didn't say that when i ordered it so they screwed me on that one.Additionally it now lists the item as \\"The Complete Series\\" but it still says \\"The Chosen Collection\\" in my item order history and on the packaging slip.NOT COOL AMAZON!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll wait","review":"I already own all seven seasons on DVD and the show very good, with the exeption of the latter two seasons.If you don't already own any of the DVDs this might be for you.I myself will wait for the comming format wars to end before I upgrade my collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Buffy Collector's Edition Box Set (Series 1-7)","review":"This is the title of the slipcased limited edition of the entire Buffy series released on DVD in the UK on Nov. 22. It contains every episode, but with different packaging: compact digipacks all encased in one collector box. It also contains a booklet, a letter from Joss Wheedon, and perhaps new features and extras on the DVDs. Does anyone know if such a box set is planned for the US (or at least a version that is Region 1 compatible)? I haven't been able to find any info at all about this possibility. I'm very eager to own the whole set, but dont want to purchase the current fold out sets if a complete box set is going to be released. EMAIL FOX INTERNATIONAL AND FOX HOME VIDEO, LIKE I DID, AND LET THEM KNOW THAT SUCH A BOX SET WOULD BE A HUGE SELLER AND WOULD PLEASE REGION 1 FANS TO NO END. WE DESERVE A SPECIAL BOX SET, SO SPREAD THE WORD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I was stuck on a desert island...","review":"...with one television show on constant repeat for the rest of my days, this is the show I would choose. I have watched the entire season beginning to end a couple of times and I intend to do so several more times over my lifetime. It amazes me how much the characters grow over the course of seven seasons, how much I came to care about each of them and feel an intimate knowledge of each of their individual viewpoints. But more than anything, I am amazed by how many times I have cried watching this show. It's so moving and funny and adept at dealing with a vast range of human emotions and experiences. Season 3, episode 1 is one of my all time favorite fight sequences. It literally brings me to tears, it is so beautiful. There's not much more to say. Best show ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiffany J","review":"A must have for all Buffy fans. It's great that all 7 seasons come compact and neat in this set. Seasons 2& 3 are by far the best! Season 5 is a great follow up and finally season 7 redeems the show after a horrible season 6. I'm so glad I bought this so I dont have to borrow different seasons from my friend when I need a quick Buffy fix!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection for Buffy fans","review":"Great collection. The list of Joss Whedon's favorite episodes was a fun bonus and the extra's DVD is great. The menus change format slightly from season to season which is slightly confusing but other than that it's a great collection for any Buffy fan. The front-opening box format is great for not having to pull it off the shelf to get the next season out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but....","review":"I am a huge Buffy fan and was really excited when I received this Collectors Set. Many Buffy marathons took place in my home over the past couple of months. I only have one negative remark and it applies to the bonus features: Where's Buffy? Not a single interview, commentary or anything with Sarah, the star of the show! And I am a huge fan of outtakes and was looking forward to some real funny stuff but what they included was not only minimal (for a 7 year show) but they revolved around the same 2 or 3 actors. Overall though, I really glad I have this set in my collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Butt Buffy","review":"Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy was simply one of the best female leads in a television series ever. And her kick butt sidekicks also included Willow (a witch and a lesbian), Cordelia, Anya, younger sister Dawn, and Willow's lover, Tara. Sometimes campy, sometimes sad, sometimes just wonderful, this show kept me pre-occupied on many a weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Birthday to Me!!","review":"AFter watching a few discs I rented from Netflixs, I got hooked on Buffy! So as a birthday present to me, I bought this set for myself. Not only is it great to have all the episodes, but there is sssoo much extras that I haven't even gotten to yet. It is great to be able to get in Joss Whedon and the writer's/actor's heads and see what they were thinking. This set is a must have for a for any Buffy fan or someone who likes anything by Joss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Collection","review":"I've owned each season of Buffy since first release, and at this price I'm tempted to buy it again just to have a library set whilst lending out the other to friends and family. I can't imagine too many people are coming to this series new, but I envy those who are. The entire series is well worth 5 stars, but I've always thought the first season to be weaker than the rest, and there is little to be lost in starting with season two and then backfilling with the dozen season one episodes at a later date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffyness","review":"All the buffy you could ever want. The highs and lows spanning seven seasons of trend-setting, awesome television. The fantastic high points redefine what to expect from quality television, and even the worst of the series entertains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the customer images and reviews. They're inaccurate.","review":"After many people were mislead and complained, Amazon updated the title and initial description to indicate that the bonus 40th disc isn't included. However, they didn't feel so inclined to remove the (mostly positive) reviews that reviewed a very different product, nor did they remove the many customer images of the bonus material that's NOT included. Besides the extra disc with the better special features, it also doesn't include any of the other material (book, letter, etc) that are shown.1 star because Amazon has a lot of work to correct with this listing, in order to be HONEST with its customers about what they're selling."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Buffy but...","review":"I can't except season 4-7 with no widescreen. So I won't buy it. I'll just stick to watching Buffy on Netflix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant Box Set","review":"I feel that this boxset is more for casual Buffy fans who are on the fence about purchasing box sets. As an owner of a region-free DVD player and all 7 seasons (4-7 in widescreen), I wouldn't trade my widescreen versions for full-screen ones, even if they were originally shot that way. I agree with the reviewer who said that widescreen versions would be nice and also a little digital remastering as the first 2 seasons could stand to be cleaned up a little. I do feel that this is a very reasonable price if you don't have any of the seasons or just want a cool-looking box to sit on your shelf, but if you already have the seasons, I can't see investing money just to have a fancy boxset and an extra bonus disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed :(","review":"I ordered this product from Amazon and 3 WEEKS LATER I had to order it from someone else because it never showed up.

I have seen the reviews of this set done by fellow reviewers, and it is was my experience that that the boxes for the previous sets are not much different than this - they are as flimsy as this set is, and just as breakable.The set's discs appear the same as the previous editions, probably a rehash from leftover sets. A bonus disc may be the only redeeming factor, but since I don't own it, I haver never seen it.I spent my money on \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" once, and once is enough for me. Buffy is a endearing series, but why throw away DVD sets just to have them \\"return\\" from the garbage?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, not so great packaging","review":"Buffy is one of my favorite shows of all time, and this collection effectively organizes all the episodes and commentaries, but the cases they are put in are very weak and one of them (season sevens case) broke when i opened it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discs are damaged","review":"I purchased the 8 season boxed set. When I got to Season 5, I found the first two discs, with 8 episodes in all, were damaged and would not play. I have not yet tried the other discs in that season but missing 8 episodes so far destroys the continuity. The return time expired and I have no recourse. The quality control from this company is horrendous and as a result, I will not make any more purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"The horror, the horror!","review":"This CD is a fine example of soulless marketing, bleeding hunks variety.For those of you who like opera, get a real opera. Good performances of \\"La boheme\\" are easy to find. For those of you who like a particular singer or conductor, seek out that person's work. For those of you who want an introduction to opera or to top-flight singing, go elsewhere, there's plenty of good stuff to be found.For those of you who want a genuine freak show, step right up, this is for you.

The chain of events that took place are really hard to follow due to the way the author \\"jumps around\\".Also, I felt the author seemed to glorify the victims' characters (remember, they were picking up a prostitute). I kept feeling as if she was telling this story as her opinion, not as how it really happened. I just wanted a factual account of the events that took place and I didn't think this book did that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumbled prose, impossible to read","review":"Sue Russel may have spent a lot of time researching Aileen Wuornos' life, too bad she didn't spend enough time putting all the facts together to make a readable narrative.

I'm thankful I got the book through the library and didn't waste my money on a book that I've decided to give up after 125 pages.As for Aileen Wuornos, she was a damaged person. Sometimes damaged people go on to inflict damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad book","review":"This book is so badly written that I almost can not read it.

I went out of my way to get a copy of a film whose popularity led to its release after a 13-year lapse between the film and the issue of the DVD. Needless to say, 14 lost minutes add up to a lot on a disk with only 91 minutes. I will continue to watch this version only because it is better than not having one to watch, but will do whatever is necessary to get the full version. Take 15% out of the Godfather and see what happens. Still a good film, but no middle and no end.

Ouch.Three HUGE problems with the DVD: 1) The color/brightness are terrible, some scenes so dark that they're almost impossible to see -- you have to crank up your TV's brightness to get a clue. 2) The sound is totally muddy -- several lines we had to replay to decipher at all. And 3) why is there no widescreen option?All of these problems could have been avoided. In theaters, the movie was widescreen, well-lit, and sounded good.Lions Gate has taken a great post-apocalypse action movie and released a DVD that's best used as a coaster for your drink. I love the movie, but DO NOT BUY THIS DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie - but consider the VHS version ovr DVD ...","review":"It's been stated before, but I'll state it again; This is a great movie. I own both the VHS and DVD versions of the film but was very disappointed in the DVD release. Presumably, they used the best film version they had to create the DVD, but it still suffers from a decided lack of post-production work. In many scenes the color is washed out, and for the life of me I don't understand why they couldn't have done something about the cigarette burns (used in theatres to to signal an upcoming reel change) which are present in the DVD version.The upshot is that for all the advantages DVD has over VHS, I would suggest you consider purchasing the VHS version over the DVD version. Beyond the usual trailers for other movies, the DVD version offers nothing that the VHS version doesn't already have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DVD quality ruins a fun movie","review":"As others have observed, this DVD is extremely poor quality. night and indoor scenes are often so dark as to make the characters almost impossible to recognize, and the sound was so poor that I turned by TV volumne up above 60 and had to shut down a computer in the room because the cooling fan from the computer was louder than the dialogue from the DVD.Sad because this is a fun movie with Rutger Hauer and Joan Chen playing an interesting and brutal sport. The rules are never explained, nor is there any explanation why a person who enters the field of play armed with a pugil stick is called a \\"slash\\", but the movie is good for an afternoon of relaxation.I don't recommend purchasing this to anyone who isn't prepared for the poor quality of the picture and sound. Someone needs to redo the DVD with a high quality master."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product good...service poor","review":"When I did a direct e-mail about the order not arriving, them wanted a group more info and couldn't tell the order date.

My only objection is that the buckle is difficult to use. It snaps easily across his chest, but then has two metal, curved buckles which snap into the piece between his legs. These pieces cause the straps to twist and are very difficult to snap into the bottom piece. I have tried snapping them first and snapping them second and neither seems to be easier.

I decided to buy this 5-point harness seat. Despite my original reservations, I am very pleased with this car seat. The only difficulty I have encountered is that sometimes the latch releases with some difficulty, but this only happens when our son is wearing lots of padding (snowsuit) and has gotten better as I have gotten practice using the seat. The quality of the material is very good. There was lots of padding for an infant (even though we didn't use it, because our 6-month-old was big enough to not need it.) I am especially pleased because we will not have to buy another car seat for our son. This should keep him safe through all his rear-facing, forward-facing, and booster seat years.

I liked that it could go from rear facing to forward to a booster. My biggest mistake was not taking my daughter to the store and trying the seat there, if I had I never would have bought it. I tried several times to adjust the padding for her but could not get it in such a way that it didn't push her forward. Her chin kept getting pushed down onto her chest and she was struggling to be able to pull her head up. I felt that the chest clasp was cheaply made and was worried that it was going to break while I was unbuckling it. The clasp between the legs would not release when I tried to get my daughter back out and I wound up having to undo the chest clasp and pull her out of the leg restraints. It was bulky and unmanagable in our van and we too had the issue of not being able to make it level despite using several towels.

Yeah, it is a great buy for the amount of time you can use it for, but it is NOT worth the TIME.Problems:If you use rear facing sometimes the strap can not be pulled snug enough for safety.Then the recline factor, even with the wedge for car seats, and ajusted tightly (seat itself) recline still goes forward to an almost sitting upright in a rear facing and this is not comfortable on the little necks.Then after 90day return/exchange window, the straps wouldn't work properly. One upper body strap would tighten and the other one would be so loose my husbands fist would fit through.The new carseat will come from Wal-mart or Target, at least they will take it back for you so you won't have to wait on the manufacter to send you a replacement or the parts, which is a major inconvience not to mention a \\"we couldn't really care about your child's safety\\". HUGE PROBLEM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car seat!","review":"I am extremely happy with this purchase. The car seat is very light which makes it easy to carry around in airports. Yes, it is also FAA aproved. The pads fit the frame very well and they are made of quality materials. And since it was very affordable compared to others, we purchased two (one for each car).

It's a great detective story, a good example of plodding, methodical investigative work, and some of the best acting I've seen in a Japanese film. There are some deeply moving scenes and the whole film is an excellent account of life in Japanese small towns and villages in the 1970s. I highly recommend this film and especially Americans who are curious about Japanese culture.

This is not one of those \\"coffee table\\" books. It is packed with information and it is both excellent reading and study data. There are 264 pages in this volume and Mr. Havelaar has established a detailed history from a personal, statistical and photographic perspective which make this not only informative but also a very interesting book to read. This is a must-have book for any serious fan of World War 2 bombing operations, but specifically for the famous 91st Bomb Group in WW2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very detailed info","review":"This book follows the 91st bomb group from its inception to the end of the war. Every mission is mentioned and the planes that were shot down are often noted. Lots of detail with the serial numbers and names of all the planes. Some great nose art too. Exactly like the pictures I have from my dad. Lots of info about the crews with some narrative from them. Mostly I was able to follow my dad's missions and learn more detail than he remembered or wanted to remember. Very accurate according to my dad's log book of missions. I saw where three of the planes he flew were shot down with other crews flying those days. There is even a group picture with my dad it in! Amazing.

It was a cute idea and I looked forward to a light, yet entertaining romantic comedy. But, it lacked the spark that is so likeable in most of Reese Witherspoon's movies. There was no depth to the \\"bad guy\\" scenario, so that part seemed pointless. I disliked the FDR character and he never grew on me even though it was obvious how his character would play out. Tuck was more interesting, but even his character became boring. Katie's character was basically non-existent and her role in the movie seemed carelessly thrown in for a poor wrap up. I also hated the way both guys acted and really didn't want Lauren to choose either one, but of course she did. Ugh. I would have given it 1 star, but I laughed at a few scenes and that's what made it bearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Entertaining, Horrible Evil-Mastermind Development","review":"This movie was almost what you would expect from the previews, except the editing is worse (McG, seriously? I'm surprised you still have a career with the flaming pieces of poo flicks you've dared throw at the silver screen. That, and the ultra-douchey name), and there was this bizarre evil mastermind development that was born early in the flick, to be revisited once in the middle, then 'fixed' as the climax of the film. And by climax, I mean the last five minutes of this face-punching suckfest. I am just now remembering how bad it ended while I write this. *Blech*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed","review":"This is a great movie. I enjoyed the fact that i did not know who she would end up with until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Means War","review":"Was good for a laugh here and there! Of course what lady is not use for more than one guy chasing her. Kind of interesting to put a psin on that perspective and bring it to the surface :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie!","review":"The movie was very funny and had good acting. Good plot and it is totally worth the money. It's the type of movie you can watch over and over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More crass than I expected.....","review":"I was hoping for a lighthearted romantic comedy with some cool action thrown in (Knight and Day-ish for example). However, I found parts of the movie to be rather offensive. The scene with Trish and Bob making out on the floor was disgusting, to be honest. Most of the conversations had between Trish and Lauren were sordid and did not appeal to my sense of humor.That said, there were parts of the movie that were hilarious.Overall, it was decent but not worth buying/rewatching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny","review":"All of the funny parts of this movie are in the commercial. Didn't like it at all. Inappropriate material to watch with your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I love Tom Hardy, especially in Wuthering Heights. This movie, however, was more than disappointing. I hope he picks a better movie project next time.

Waste of four dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I had low expectations for this movie so we rented it through Amazon. Loved it, love the fact that I didn't have to leave my house to rent it even better. We actually liked the movie so much I'll probably end up buying it. Great cast, funny story and an awesome soundtrack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"love tom hardy...not so much the movie.","review":"let me first start by saying tom hardy is probably one of the best imports out of britian in years. his work in 'bronson,' 'warrior,' and of course 'the dark knight rises' is stellar. so now we come to 'this means' war.' well, i'm still a hardy fan, but the movie was difficult to watch. why two stars instead of one? well, the action sequences were fun, and with the amount of money they put into the film, one would be hard pressed to give it one star. the plot sucks, but it's tom hardy. it's difficult to hate him, unless he makes another one like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"this means war","review":"great movie lots of fun keeps you laughing very entertaining One of Reese witherspoon's best an Chris Pine is terrific and TOm Handy is wonderful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie","review":"This is a great movie, and amazon provided it in HD so it looks great too.

One that both men and women would enjoy watching together. An action chick flick!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Movie","review":"Didin't really know what to expect on this movie, but I rented it from Amazon steaming and enjoyed it very much. great cast with a nice mix of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, precisely, were Hardy and Pine thinking?! (2-1/2 stars because of Hardy)","review":"Very weak date comedy about a woman who is oblivious to the fact she is dating two different guys who happen to be best friends ... and co-workers, in the form of CIA intelligence agents; agents who eventually use all their spy skills and surveillance gear to keep tabs on each other (and sabotage each other) to win the girl. Pine's okay, Hardy's great, Witherspoon is meh - the movie overall silly, but okay if you have nothing else to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly fun!","review":"Since I adore Reese Witherspoon, I decided to give This Means War a try. I'm glad I did, this action/romance flick is WAY better than I thought it would be. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play Witherspoon's love interests and they are both easy on the eyes! Witherspoon is fabulous as always and she looks smokin' hot as Lauren. This is just a fun and silly movie, it's not the kind of movie that will win awards but it's darn entertaining to watch. Give it a try, enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty standard","review":"I love Reese Witherspoon, so that tempted me to pay the $1.99 to rent this online. It might have been worth $1.75. :) Reese is wonderful Chelsea Handler's character was hideous and crude - and very much like Ms. Handler I believe. The two guys were adequate. But there is nothing memorable or truly enjoyable about the entire movie. I really don't enjoy watching Reese in heavy love scenes. I'd rather enjoy her sparkling acting instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!","review":"This movie was fun to watch! Cast had good rhythm together, and it was funny, action packed and just a good way to spend a couple of hours. Tom Hardy is definitely an actor to watch in the future. I bought this movie and it was even better the second time! Rent or buy WARRIOR too if you want to see another good Tom Hardy flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run of the Mill Comedy","review":"I watched this film because of the interesting mix up in the cast. The three leads all have different styles. Hardy is a very physical actor, Pine relaxed, and Witherspoon is sassy and take no prisoners. The performances weren't bad but, for me, the movie did not work. It might be that the script wants to be a romantic comedy, buddy movie (gal/guy pairs), and an action/spy flick. It adds nothing new to any of these genres. It is predictable and prosaic. Too many coinkydinks and too much boom boon took away from the plot line. I think we saw this same film in a better form a few years ago in when Edward Norton was contesting for a girl with his friend the priest. I have not seen a really good romantic comedy coming out of Hollywood in a long time. The best romance was in a film called \\"Goon\\"...yep the knock your teeth out hockey movie. The subplot of the romance was original, sweet and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie","review":"I had seen it in theatres and liked it, is a funny movie. My husband had not, so we really enjoyed watching this together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to watch","review":"Was bored tonight so I rented this not expecting much but I am glad to say I actually enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Means Awful","review":"A woman falls in love with two men: playboy and a good guy. Who does she choose? The playboy, of course! I was truly disappointed that an actress like Reese Witherspoon agreed to be in this trash. Besides its awful message the execution of the film is also terrible. It's so predictable at every turn. It was such a waste of time and money. Unless you want to waste 97 minutes of your life, I would say skip this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","review":"I love this movie. I loved it in the theater and I loved watching it again. However, it was almost ruined by a terrible, terrible DVD. I don't know how to explain the problem exactly, but it seemed to be some kind of interlacing problem. Also, the video was unnaturally bright, washing out the color on the faces and the few subtitles it had were awful looking and hard to read. Either way, it was annoying and although I know I didn't pay a fortune for the DVD, it still seems ridiculous that it would be so terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, predictable garbage - don't waste your $$$","review":"This film is one of the top 10 in the categories, \\"Worst Screenplay\\" and \\"Worst Director\\". The premise is interesting, but the screenplay is awful and the directing even worse. Some scenes were lifted straight from other movies, but so poorly written and staged that it's laughable. If you are looking for a second-rate romantic comedy and don't care how improbably or unrealistic the plot is, then this is a good movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This show was dumb","review":"A waste of Tom Hardy's talent. I cannot recall a single thing that made me laugh here. Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always love Reese Witherspoon","review":"Cute film, fun and a bit exciting, not complicated; easy to watch. You can't go wrong with a Reese Witherspoon movie. She has the energy to keep our attention.

It was made to fill a space in the movie business so that the shelf isn't empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"PeeeU!","review":"I couldn't even finish watching this parody on...what? Good actors in badly written movies? Good actors portraying characters with no character? Common, Hollywood...get a clue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful! So very, very bad - Turn away now!","review":"Absolute crap. A rather promising plot line for a comedy that is badly written and poorly acted.Bottom line:For guys - It's okay to screw over a friend and waste your co-workers time and resources to stalk a woman.For girls - It's okay to be a slut and date multiple guys and when pressed to make a choice settle on the sleeziest candidate possible.Ick!I so wish Hollyweird would stop flushing thousands and millions of dollars down the stool to crank this junk out.There is no merit to this and you will really be ticked off by the end. When you find yourself cheering on the bad-guy and then being disappointed that he doesn't kill the three leads then you know you have sat through a serious loser.DO NOT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME ON THIS ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This was boring, unorginal, terrible acting and a big waste of time. Okay cast, but I wouldn't recommend it. I like Reese Witherspoon, but this isn't her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"another dud with Reese","review":"Reese has been having a tough time picking and choosing movies as of late... This is yet another example of her poor choices. Don't bother watching it!! You can imagine the story line.... as boring as the movie jacket suggests..... Reese needs to start taking advice from Kate Hudson, who stars in similar story-lined movies.... but she makes better choices, usually. Again, do not bother wasting your time watching this movie!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I'm a huge Reese Witherspoon fan. But this movie did nothing for me. The way the 2 male characters acted, I didn't want any of them to end up with Reese's character. And why did she have to choose either of them? It was bad so don't watch with high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit lacking","review":"Though this goes by quickly, I found little to recommend it. Reese Witherspoon is past her prime as a love interest and is obviously older than the two young starlets assigned here to try to woo her. The core of the film is dated: internet dating as something weird. Dear Hollywood: it's been going full force for over a decade. Some fun capers as the two CIA agents deal with various bad guys in totally implausible ways. Otherwise, take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"says dvd but doesn't play","review":"Previews played ok, but at government warning the dvd just stuck. I could stop & start again & again but it still would not play when gets to government warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thismeanswar","review":"Was pretty funny, good to watch with the misses.

This was a good movie with great action and a nice mixture of humor as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable, but good.","review":"I won't go to much into the plot, because I don't want to spoil anything for you. The basic plot is that two spies who are friends have fallen for the same girl, and they both compete for her attention. That's all I really want to say about the plot.Yes, this is a predictable movie, and you will know what happens before it does, but that's okay. Usually movies like that kind of annoy me, but for some reason this works. This movie has it all, action, comedy, and a bit of romance. It works on all levels.There are several laugh out loud funny scenes in it. The three main actors do a nice job on their comedic timing, and deliver their lines and make it seem natural. They did a fantastic job.For me, there was one drawback, and that's Chelsea Handler. God, she's horrible. All of her scenes were annoying and hard to watch.&#8232;If you're looking for a perfect date movie, this is it.Overall, I really liked it and will probably pick it up, or put it on my wish list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"The previews show the funniest parts of the movie.

Very untalented work."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIRECTED BADLY!!!","review":"this movie had so much potential and actors that tried to deliver. but, when you watch this film, you find yourself distracted, consciously picking out either better ways to have shot many scenes or just flat out bad decisions by the director in general. oh and i don't know who's idea it was to cast a tired and one noted chelsea handler, but just because your friends with reese witherspoon doesn't mean you deserve to be in the same shots with her. i have nothing against McG or chelsea personally, but neither belong here. both filmed on auto pilot and/or left it to monkeys while taking a vacay to vegas. either way, lite on plot, disappointing all the way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Time and Money","review":"I love romantic comedies, so when I saw this movie I was excited. But I was disappointed during- and after the movie because it was horrible. I tried really hard to laugh, but I didn't succeed. And the movie is not romantic. I didn't enjoy the action. It's not a movie I would buy. I wasted my money and my time. Look elsewhere or you'll be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie, loved every minute","review":"I loved this movie...and Chealsey Lately was great as her best friend.

Bad acting. Bad plot. Reese Witherspoon, who in the past I have considered to be cute and entertaining, really disappointed me for even acting in this movie. The two \\"guys\\" who are the leads, were... stereotypical, boring, predictable and STALE. There are so many other movies out there with some kind of redeeming value, I don't understand what people see in this one. What a waste of time and money.

Bad script, bad acting, FLOP!","review":"This is seriously one of the worst movies of its release year. With an all star cast and a script written by a blind person on meth who would have thought this movie would tank so hard. Man did they over advertise for this movie as well. One scene after another with no real humor, obvious fake & staged fight scenes where the bad guy bends forward and waits to be clobbered like a puppet. Not one single shiny, smily, funny, or endearing moment in this movie. When the credits start rolling you almost jump up from the couch screaming \\"YEAH.......YAH.....THANK GOD ITS OVER\\".

Talk about fake love! GAG! You saw it all coming before the end, even who the other guy ends up with. Painful script. And nowhere near the packed action as implied in the previews (they must've used ALL their action shots there!). And the chick's best friend--what was that?! I won't go into the acting. Weak, weak script. An absolute waste of time. Certainly a waste of rent money (glad i didn't buy it, otherwise i'd have to destroy it)!After reading this, if you get the movie (was that a movie?!), It will surely be better than this review cuz the only way is up!
