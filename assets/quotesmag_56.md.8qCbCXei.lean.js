I'm a big Thievery Corp. fan but am always looking for new stuff. I own Cafe Del Mar vols. 5 and 6.

Hollister's style is colorful and easy to understand and follow-even his more analytical chapters on the church and the sources he used are interesting. If you want to learn something about a underappreciated figure in medieval history, give this biography a try. I am sure you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing impressive here, very drone album.","review":"\\"This album is terrible. It really stinks. I'm not sure about the Who.

Townshend really has his first chance to stretch his wings and fly as a songwriter and as one of the great rock innovators ever.

Let me say right off that the sound quality of this UK import is consistantly top-notch all the way through. And, as advertised, it IS almost entirely in true, authentic stereo (I suppose we can forgive the three minor songs that aren't). I purchased the 1995 US version of this CD a few years ago and was outraged to find that even though the disc said STEREO right on it, it was mostly in mono. And the sound quality, like much of the other re-issued material, was shrill and distortion-ridden in places. But this UK release does not suffer from those problems. This much-overlooked album disserves to be heard like this. \\"Boris the Spider\\", \\"Heat Wave\\", and \\"So Sad About Us\\" in particular have a fresh, clean sound in wonderful, wonderful stereo!

I'm only giving it two stars because I feel like I shouldn't give it one just based on a couple chapters, *some* parts of the book are helpful.

It was flaky and not aligned with my beliefs. My Mother tried to read it as well and thought I should not read it to him as it was like some Angel was in charge of things and not the Lord.

The sound is abysmal in places, and even with a half-hearted attempt at noise reduction, this is truly low fidelity.While the track listing is great, and some of the later tracks appear to have mastered from a reasonable tape, this CD set is really something to be ashamed of. So... I'm going to send mine back to Amazon, and purchase something another title. So, buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, bad sound","review":"I completely agree with the previous review. I like Alan Price's music, but his sixties hits on this collection sound terrible and the best seventies songs are inferior live versions. Don't buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This, Lots of Music, Little $$","review":"a great deal indeed for this 2 cd set. 4 and a half stars. start of price's early years to 1980. wonderful songwriter, great live singer! his voice might sound goofy at first, but not bad at all.some of prices late 70's stuff were not too good, only a few songs are here from that time period.Not at all like his ex-band mate eric burdon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I read this series when I was in the seventh or eight grade. I found this to be a REALLY good series. It has a little bit of everything to make it a truely captivating book. It has historical facts in it, along with some of the Jewish language, romance, and lots of adventure! While I was reading this series, my father and I would sit around and discuss the books at night. I definatly recommend this book if you want something really good to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty awesome","review":"Oh man I am sad that this series is over but I am super excited to start the Zion Chronicles series. And already in the 2nd chapter of the zion chronicles I have met some of the same characters from this series. But this series is So great! And the key to Zion really tops it off. I should always be doing my homework since it is Finals week here in college. but every break and chance I get I read a little more! This book is so exciting. And so crazy because it's truly historical fiction. I even went to the internet and researched the events, and they are REAL! Crazy that this stuff happened. Deir Yessin or however is super sad. Amazing series, amazing Authors. I'm excited that they have like 40 more books that I haven't read yet. One thing with the kindle version, the prime version, is that the text is different sizes. One paragraph it's a size 12 or whatever, and the next paragraph it's a size 10. Kinda odd, but you get used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I believe this book is very good and accurate. I did not like the way the series kept you hanging at the very end, until I found out about the Zion Legacy Series which takes up right where this book leaves off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Quality","review":"Great quality leather.Easy to adjust.Easy open packaging.The fit is very tight and will require massaging the leather to get it so you can holster/draw comfortably. The double clip holder was so tight I could not get a clip in it. But after a few minutes of massaging the leather it fit perfectly.I would recommend to anyone for conceal carry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carry","review":"It takes a couple days to get it adjusted; the leather conforms to your shape. Put an old dress sock over your pistol and put in in the holster for a couple days, and then it fits like a glove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but flawed.","review":"As difficult as a book like this is too science-y, this is the main problem of the book, and it gets progressively worse with each chapter. Not to say that I didn't like the book, I really did, but it was at its strongest when Ehrlich is applying his formidable abilities to more common-place topics than astrophysics.The analysis in last three chapters (involving time-travel, faster than light particles, and the big bang) was difficult to understand, and I went to one of the top engineering schools in the country. Ok, ok, I failed out, but I'm more likely to understand all of that than the layman."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This book is well-executed. I agree whole-heartedly with it's intent- to get people thinking and questioning again. This sort of philosophical erosion in our society has affected us deeply and I believe that it extends well past what we usually consider \\"science\\". But this is a good start.As a side note, if you enjoy this look at these theories, you may find \\"The Deep Hot Biosphere\\" by Thomas Gold to be of interest. Mr. Gold originated the abiogenic theory of \\"fossil fuels\\". Certainly along the same lines, though not so light a read. But I recommend both books very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and sometimes fun.","review":"I read this book here in Brazil.In this book, the author discuss about many subjects.Every subject has a chapter in this book.This book is short, concise and sometimes is fun to read.The problems of this book are basically two:1-Some subjects aren't importants.To example, why to talk about two suns in Solar Sistem, whyle not writing a word about coal, natural gas, oil X nuclear energy?2-Has not enough words about the origins of oil and natural gas.This is the most important chapter of the book.And after all, hasn't enough details about the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehrlich trips over himself.","review":"Joel Kauffman's review is as close an honest reality check you can get for the contents of this book.I was skeptical about many of Ehrlich's own skepticism. When he appraoched and debated John Lott, I knew that Ehrlich's prose was more about convincong himself that his own sacred cows are beyond reproach. Lott dismantled most of Ehrlich's criticism to the degree that left Ehrlich stnading there in his tidy whities.This is not to say that a good share of what Ehrlich writes about here has underpinnings but even John Stossel knows better than to make some of the mistakes Ehrlich makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low level of sophistication","review":"The level of data analysis in this book is somewhat above op-ed writing, but not very much. Crime rates are analyzed without any other factors being accounted for. The analysis on energy is no more sophisticated. The guy should stick to his areas of expertise, but this is really poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong model","review":"I ordered this because of its super saver shipping and because of its model in the description, \\"5a\\". When I received the drumsticks, a sticker is on the sticks saying its a SSGN model. I thought this was an error, but when i compared it to the stick chart at vicfirth.com I find out it really isn't a 5a model. Don't buy unless you plan to get a SSGN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but nothing special","review":"Bic makes good pens but this one isn't.My problems with it:1. The line is too bold for me.

And on top of that, the pens were delivered the next day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pen especially for a writer!","review":"These are perfect in price and as a writing utensil. The line is thick and dark and right after you've written something on a normal piece of paper (does not count for shiny surfaces) you can run your finger across it and it won't smear. I also like the grip but I don't hold my writing utensil in the standard way (I cradle it over my ring finger with my middle finger resting over the pen).I think a con for some people might be how dark it is. Because of the way I hold my writing utensil I tend to press harder on the paper so for me especially the pen bleeds through to the back of a page. You can still read everything just fine on both sides though so I haven't found it to be a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Traditional CD - A Must Have","review":"This CD is wonderful. The songs are traditional versions of all the classic America sounds like This Land is Our Land. The kids that sing on the CD do a great job and the songs are easy to sing along with. My 10 yr old and 5 yr old beg to listen to it in the car and at home. The CD ends with the Pledge of Allegance which has taught my 5 yr old how to say it perfect. I highly recommend this CD for any house. I only wish it was split track.....it's not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty Good Room is an excellent first novel!","review":"I thought Plenty Good Room was magnificent.

I enjoy the book thoroughly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you for this touching book","review":"A few years ago I was a neighbor of Teresa McClain-Watson, and her husband told me about this book. I was caught up right from the beginning - the strong language and emotions - tied to locations that I knew in my hometown made it hard to put down. Thank you for this compelling, readable novel. I really enjoyed it.If you want to be moved...read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When this book was suggested for my book club, I had never heard of it or the author. The description sounded interesting enough, and I picked it up. Unfortunately I have real trouble relating things in the description to what actually took place in this cold, plodding novel full of unappealing characters only partially realized.While Harrison's descriptive language can be quite eloquent, I usually found it mired in a stodgy pace. If I had had a clearer idea about the novel beforehand I might have realized it was not for me. Books without traditional plots are acceptable, but for me they must at least have sympathetic or wholly involving characters. Unfortunately _The Course of the Heart_ fell short for me on both counts. The book is short, but still took me a long time to get through. I can find little to recommend about this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither art nor entertainment","review":"As someone who greatly enjoys both classic literature and speculative fiction, I was very disappointed by \\"The Course of the Heart,\\" which promised to meld the two. The writing is overwrought and frequently incoherent. The reader is given no motivation whatsoever to continue reading the book; the characters are interchangeable madmen, unsympathetic and bereft of will. Their background is withheld throughout in a fashion that would be maddening, if the reader could be brought to care. No foundation is laid, no tension is built, and no conclusion is reached when the characters finally drift offstage at the end.I have not read anything else by M. John Harrison, who seems to be a well-respected author; for all I know, he could have more than earned his acclaim with other works. I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this cd. The first couple of songs are good, but the guitar never changes. I get tired of the same guitar after the third song and can't make it through the entire cd. Every song ends up sounding too alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-receipt","review":"I may review this DVD -- IF I EVER RECEIVE IT.

The \\"Girl Hunt\\" number\\" was funny in it's stupidness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, great price","review":"Great movie, great price, fast shipping. Loved the special edition with its commentary by Liza Minnelli and Michael Feinstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see, but not everyone's favorite","review":"I've never been a huge Vincente Minnelli fan and \\"The Band Wagon\\" is a good example of why. His pacing is sometimes sluggish and this one takes a while to get off the ground. When it does (more than 20 minutes in - when Cyd Charisse's character enters the film) it's occasionally breathtakingly brilliant. Astaire and Charisse's pairings are cinematic gold. It's too bad they aren't teamed enough. And if they'd kept Cyd's \\"Two-faced Woman\\" (seen in \\"That's Entertainment III\\") in the final cut and dropped \\"Triplets\\" or \\"I Love Louisa\\" the film would have been even better. Watch it by all means but remember it's a matter of taste to some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth seeing once or twice for song & dance","review":"There are 3 or 4 great musical number in this film, and that's all. The plot is about entertainers endeavoring to produce a musical comedy based on Faust. Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray provide a little comedy relief, but only the musical numbers stand out. That's Entertainment is the most memorable. Astaire has some fine dance sequences as always, and is good paired with Cyd Charrise in one scene and Jack Buchanan in another. Astaire, Buchanan, and Fabray also do a cute number as baby triplets. For the song & dance, it's worth viewing once or twice, but not over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing","review":"Most of the movie was wonderful, with good singing and dancing. What spoiled it was the director who insisted on making the simple sunny musical written by the Martons' as a miserable, moralistic Faustian tale. Of course, that failed, but that attempt completely ruined the mood of the movie for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!!!","review":"I have a huge collection of Musicals, but this one is quickly becoming one of my favorites!! What's not to like about Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse!!! The supporting cast is wonderful and it's truly a timeless classic!! The scene with \\"The Triplets\\" is not to be missed...it leaves you scratching your head and wondering HOW they did it!! The answer is revealed in the comentary by Liza Minelli whose father directed this fantastic musical. The dancing is superb and there's so many marvelous dance routines and songs that you really get a lot of entertainment for your money with this one!! I also really enjoyed the theatrical trailers that come with the C.D. I hope that parents get these musicals for their families to watch together and teach their children to love them so they won't be lost to future generations! All I can say is \\"That's Entertainment\\"!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect musical!","review":"Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse look great together! The dances and songs are great!

These Chekhov's stories of the early period are full of humour: some of them are just funny but lots of them are psychologically deep. No surprise that most of these stories are widely recognised as masterpieces! Though written in the late XIX these stories are still of great importance for the contemporary reader because they deal with such eternal things as human soul and human character. And in such a funny manner! The translation is remarkable. Those who ever tried to translate literary prose from Russian into English know how difficult this task is. You can really enjoy Sekirin's publication : he succeeded in the translation of the most difficult passages, those in which Chekhov describes the specific atmosphere of Russian reality and even those in which Chekhov play words. Read this book and recommend it to everybody! It is a real treasure of humour and a great exhibition of human characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definatative Bond Collection.","review":"For all Bond lovers this album is a must. It is a collection of all Bond films into one album consisting mainly of themes from the movies. Most songs are great. It includes the origional theme from Dr. No by the John Barry Orchestra. The inside book flap is quite interesting for an inside book flap. This album caught my eye the minute I saw it on the shelf.

It's just that the newest songs that are The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day aren't on this disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one","review":"Comprises all title songs from the Bond films and so its a must for 007 fans. Sadly doesnt feature The world is not enough by Garbage. Nice touch they DIDN'T include that horrible song by K.D. Lang, Surrender, because it's plain awlfull (see my TND review for more on this).

It is described as a \\"Wide Angle - Panoramic - Macro - Fisheye Lens\\" Well, in my opinion it is not wide angle or panoramic and as others have said it is not a true fisheye lens. [As for the macro part I didn't try that but I'm happy with the built in macro features on my camera.] I was looking for something to give me a really wide panoramic effect for landscape photography. This lens did not work for that. I had a lens in the past for a previous camera that did a great job but not this one. In fact it only slightly increased the wide angle view of my S3IS Canon before I began noticing dark corners in the frame. I returned it being more than happy to pay the return postage and the 15% restocking fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically a novelty item","review":"For the price, one should not have great expectations.

He experiences the lifestyle and company of the various hobo jungles, love interest, robbery and murder along the way. Good box car scenery apart, this is a B movie special rather than an A train ride, with no name actors apart from a cameo appearance by Ernest Borgine of the incomparable hobo movie \`Emperor of the North'. There are grounds here for a more engaging road/train movie to break out, beyond its otherwise base banality and disjointed direction. I watched Rail Kings via computor download, so I can't comment on the DVD format. To conclude: watchable but forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Dictionary for Wide Range of Meanings","review":"This is a good dictionary that gives a full range of meanings for English words.

I really like her Maclain series, but not this one. I liked the two main characters, but the plot went off in tangents all over the place. I also didn't like the sister (Jamie). The ending felt like it was rushed, and to make it worse, the author takes the hero's friend and gives (marries) him off to the sister. He deserves better.

This book has all the concepts needed to analyse a given mechansim. Although kinematic analysis is only considered here, the authors another book on 'Dynamic analysis' should complement this. Velocity and acceleration diagrams are given a clear treatment. Cam design is treated with good examples. Another great book is 'Theory of machines' By Thomas Bevan. All the three books together provide a complete introduction to mechanism/machine analysis and should be in the shelf of every mechanical engineer. I believe that synthesizing a mechanism mainly needs a good level of ingenuity although an experience in mechanism analysis will be of some help. For synthesizing, i have come across the seven volume book 'Mechanisms in Modern Engineering Design' Ivan Artobolevsky, Mir Publishers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a perfect vacuum","review":"This vacuum has its pros and cons.

It is very powerful and sucks up an amazing amount of dirt and cat hair from our carpet. However, it is difficult to push on carpeted floors (On the plus side, I get a good workout every time I use it) and cleaning the filter is a pain. You have to tap it against a hard surface and dust goes flying everywhere!

It is a little noisier than other vacuums, but it works so well that I don't care, especially for the price.

I have allergies so emptying this thing is the worst; dust flies everywhere and you might as well buy a new filter everytime you empty the cup which is a beast to take off. On top of that I've had it for about 8 months and the mechanism that makes it stay upright has broken and it smells like something is burning when I run it for awhile.

And the price is great.Cons - Poor design that makes it a pain to empty. The hepa filter IS IN the dust canister! Therefore, every time I empty the canister (see above) I have to take the large hepa filter out and bang it against the outdoor trash can for a whole minute to clear out all the lint that gets imbedded into the filter's ridges. The worst part is trying to hold my breath long enough to do it. I got fed up with it and finely bought a different vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy, this baby sucks!!!","review":"The one and two star reviews are really unfair. This is probably the most effective vacuum machine in its class. It has its faults: it is loud, heavy, the cord is annoying, and I wish it had more hose, but I've owned about 5 VCs and none compare to this one's ability to suck dirt, and especially dog hair, out of carpet. I initially did not like this machine because of the noise (it is still loud), so I had to buy the highly rated Eureka Smart 4870DT which now sits in the corner collecting dust, because it is a true dog compared to this baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowery, predictable drivel","review":"I would normally not read Barbara Taylor Bradford but my boyfriends' Mom gave it to me as part of a present, so I said what the heck, I'll try it.Just as disappointing as I'd expected. Light, uninteresting, and with no real plot or ending. As for the historical pages, read Catherine Cookson instead.I may go back and listen to A Woman of Substance only because other reviewers seemed to have enjoyed it.But this sequel was too into clothes and the finer things, and full of too-successful, too-beautiful men and women. Not believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This was my first Barbara Taylor Bradford book to read. I've heard great things about her books, but this one is very disappointing. I'm over half way through the book, but I don't think I will be able to finish it. There are so many characters that I can't keep up with who's who! Also her writing seems more like \\"filler\\" than actual fiction. I'm afraid I can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"A cliche ridden melodrama. The dialogue is predictable and wooden; the characters are stiff renditions of type casting. How many times does she use the phrase, \\"Bred in the bone?\\" Or how about saying a flatterer has kissed the Blarney stone? Oh puhleeze! The quality of prose is on the same level as any pulpy bodice ripper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had high expectations for this book because I have listened to other Bradford books. This was a total waste of my money. There were too many characters to follow and too many details about them. I was so confused with all of the characters that I never really understood the story. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleverly disappointing","review":"When I first read the 'family tree', I was scared I wouldn't be able to follow all the characters. However, Bradford effortlessly leads you through the meandering storylines of several different characters - and not once did I get lost! Emma's' Secret is definitely a page-turner, yet I feel Bradford went off on a few 'filler' tangents. Instead, I wish she focused on an ending that would have satiated all the readers who devoured this beautiful story as quickly as I did. I know its probably more advantageous to Bradford to leave the story \`open' for her next novel, but the cliffhanger was disappointing to say the least! The ending definitely makes me wonder what will happen to the characters. However, I feel cheated - its almost as if I read the book for nothing! Honestly, the ending was way too blunt and it made me realize that Bradford is just another greedy saga author looking to rope readers into buy her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of an Era","review":"I enjoyed Emma Harte so much that I have been compelled to follow the stories of her offspring. I was incredibly disappointed to read Bradford's description of Evan's mother who struggles with bipolar illness. Her perspective of this condition is extremely negative and shows very little comprehension of the illness. Because of this glaring incongruity, it would be a real strain for me to continue to accept Bradford's credibililty. What else has she presented in a totally skewed manner? My reading of Bradford novels has come to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Woman of Substance it isn't","review":"I read \\"A Woman Of Substance\\" about 20 years ago, and LOVED It. When I read that there was a new book in the series, I was thrilled. But let me say that \\"Emma's Secret\\" is NOT on the same level as the first book!This book starts out with a death of a woman and the request to her granddaughter to find Emma Harte. So off the England the reader goes where they meet the newest generation of the Harte family who frankly lead soap opera lives. About 3/4 in the book the reader finds themshelves in War-Time London with Emma Harte, who has seem to lost her fire since reading the first book. Then after only a few chapters we are back with the young people for the secret to be known to all.This book was not good at all in my opinion. It didn't not need to be written. The only reason that I gave the book two stars were for the war-time chapters. In truth, Ms. Bradford should had let the Harte family go out on the hight note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than what I expected!","review":"I had no idea what type of cover was on this book - I knew it wasn't paperback, but I didn't realize it was a hard cover either!

Let's face it, there was no ending. I agree with one reviewer who said it was like she got a call and stopped writing and just published this book. In addition with the revelation about the \\"secret\\" it's ok that these two are sleeping with eachother????? ::shuddering:: absolutely ridiculous and not thought out at all. It was like BTB had no idea where she was going with the story and we had to trudge along with her until she finally decided to give up...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"If you have read \\"Woman of Substance, you have to read this.

The author definitely leaves you begging for the next installment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was very disappointing. So many things could have been developed to make it exciting but none of them ever were.The book doesnt seem to really have any ending. It felt like the last chapter must have been left out. I have read Bradford before and this has got to be her worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?????????","review":"I've read all her books and loved them. Now I've struggled and struggled to read this one. I give up. I'm about in the middle and I can't take anymore! There's no reason to care for any of the people in the book or about their relationships. I ordered the book before it was published. I sure wish I'd waited to read the reviews and saved myself 25 dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and disappointing","review":"Emma's secret was a terrible disappointment.. I have read all her previous books and inspite of that found it difficult to keep track of the vast cast of characters.. I had to frequently refer to her index. Finally the book just fizzled out. After hinting at some devious plot being laid by the villain he just upped and pushed off to HongKong. As one reviewer said this is probable a precursor to the next book. However it was highly disappointing. I did not expect BTB to do this to her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I read the three books by BTB starting with A Woman of Substance and loved every one of them. Wonderful books with great stories and characters. I was very excited to read Emma's Secret. It was probably one of the worst books I have ever read. Please, don't bother with it! It is very poorly written. Characters tend to speak in a way that no normal person EVER would. I found that nothing really happened in the book until the last few pages. Even then, she leaves you dangling and lets you know at the end that more books are coming. I found that Emma's Secret was just a \\"filler\\" book to get to her others that are coming. It traps you in! Too bad - I wish she had put more thought in to continuing this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emma's Secret","review":"I loved Bradford's Woman of Substance it was a book that kept me awake until the wee hours of the morning, I literally couldn't put it down. In Emma's Secret it appears she didn't have anything else to write about so she rehashed the orginal and it was boring certainly not up to her usual standards, I expect more from a Bradford book. I am sorry I bothered with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty","review":"this was a waste of time and money..seems Ms. Bradford could have told the story in 12 pages...written on a 4'th grade level with entirely too many descriptions and a dialoge that was pitiful...why do so many authors not quit while they are ahead?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I totally agree with Empty of 2/13/04.There were too many people, too much description of clothes, etc. and not enough plot. This book was so contrived! No ending! I think the author just wants to make money. A Woman of Substance was good. She should have stopped there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably bad","review":"I have to admit, with great shame, that I didn't realize how bad this was until the sex passages started. There, the book totally reveals itself as another of those Danielle Steele like easy-reading \\"romantic\\" books for housewives. The book is made of extremely intense micro-chapters, all of them contain an essential part of the story, necessary to the book: the skeleton of the history is the boom itself. It is extremely predictable and the characters act childishly like in some kind of bad soap opera. The main issues of this book are supposed to come from long ago but all of them resolve in 5 minutes scenes in extremely stupid conversations."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"i have read several of this author's works and found them to be good reads. emma's secret, however, is just a big yawn and reminds me very much of danielle steele {the author who writes a short story but makes it last for about 300 pages by adding a chorus that repeats incessantly}. nothing happens except for the fashion retrospective. it has taken me 4 weeks to struggle through this book and i'm still not quite finished even though i've started skimming some parts. i guess you can tell i'm finished with barbara taylor bradford. can't wait to start ken follett's new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"This was the worst book Barbara Taylor Bradford has ever written. Woman of Substance was so outstanding that I thought that surely this might come close to it. WRONG!!! It was boring. It jumped around and who really cares about what she thinks of Winston Churchill, which was the majority of the book. Please Barbara, do better next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Product","review":"The correct product was exactly what I needed and was sent timely. Thanks for being there.

There are some ideas in it that are far-fetched, but still thought-provoking. The part that really stood out to me was the gender selection at the beginning of the book. My friend had had two boys and was thinking of trying for a third child (she wanted a girl). She followed the diet and lo and behold, had a girl. I just had my second son and if I can convince my husband to have a third child, I'll try the diet too. This book is not a pregnancy bible, more of just a study aid. Still, I learned a few things and did enjoy the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate","review":"A week by week guide of a baby's development was anticipated to share the development of the baby with my pre-teen son. This book was not appropriate since it included a description with pictures of intercourse during this period.

The book was very good but not near as good as hearing Mr. Clarke speak in person. If you ever have a chance to hear him speak, don't miss it. If not that, read his book. It's more than about climbing a mountain, it's about striving to do our best, to try our hardest in what ever we do every day. Everyone has a \\"mountain\\".

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"so, so...","review":"This book was informative, but it is limited to \\"on the road\\". You'll hear about the bush taxis and their drivers, but will visit only a small part of the country. This book could have used a good editor -- there's some repetition -- and a better map. The map in the front of the book doesn't list all the towns, villages, etc. that were visited and doesn't name the adjacent countries. I thought it was worth reading, but disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Colonial Nonsense","review":"What most reviewers of \\"Riding the Demon\\" miss is the way in which the author metaphorizes Africa for his own \\"literary\\" ends. As non-Africans have done now for centuries, Chilson translates \\"Africa\\" into a useful tool for his own soul-searching-and pontificating. While in some respects the book may open western eyes to the complex that is \\"Africa,\\" ultimately Chilson bends \\"Africa\\" to his purposes and authorial desires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding a Taxi","review":"This book was very disappointing indeed. Niger is a large country, but the author only rode a few short stretches on the only real highway at the Southern border. Niger is endless sand dunes with tiny water holes that are tough to find. It has ghost towns and the salt oasis of Bilma. It has small oases where the people never saw a doctor and where children will die from infections when they step on an acacia thorn. It is a land of camel caravans where natives get lost and die in the desert. And where, in the mountains, live the blue men of the desert, the Tuaregs. On the desert sands, you can find fish skeletons. And in Agadez you see the world's oldest mosque and can shake hands with the sultan. And where was the author? Nowhere in sight of the real Niger.Forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful !","review":"I bought this album on the recommendation in a review that this was THE BEST version of \\"Grateful\\". I felt that John Bucchino did a better job, more feeling, on his own album entitled Grateful. ALSO ... most important !! DO NOT listen to this CD if you are prone to depression or are in a depressed state."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Candlebox\\" an intriguing band name!!","review":"Candlebox is a band that seems to not become as popular as Alanis Morisette and Madonna (the woman that gave this band to be the first band to sign up for Maverick/Warner records). This album however gave grunge alternative rock to become as intriguing as Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots and Alice In Chains. This band had a bit of success before Alanis Morisette was even heard of. My favourite songs on this album is \\"Change\\", \\"Rain\\" and \\"He Calls Home\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Addition to the Seattle Scene","review":"This is an excellent debut album by yet another Seattle band,and holds out to be better than anything the band releasesafterward. It does not break any new ground overall, but it definitely makes for a great rock album. The anti-drug rocker \\"You\\" caught a lot of attention on national radio wavs, and it set up nicely the smash success of the power ballad-like \\"Far Behind.\\" The album is filled with catchy tunes, and the standouts include the two afforementioned, \\"Change,\\" \\"Arrow,\\" the soothing ballad \\"Cover Me,\\" and the album's best surprise \\"He Calls Home.\\" This closing track harmonizes an excellent acoustic guitar riff with a chorus that you will be humming in your head all day. Candlebox doesn't offer a style of music that hasn't been heard before, but they certainly know how to play some excellent Seattle-brand rock n' roll- and this is the best they have to offer. If you like good '90's rock, then this album is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This self titled album is VERY solid all the way through...","review":"I've bought many rock albums and been disappointed with most of the tracks. This is the second time I've puchased this CD. (I wore the first one out by taking it every where I go!) Lucy was a decent album followed by Happy Pills, but I think that Candlebox still has another great all-around album instore for us. (Or just for us ROCKERS)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This cd is one of the best! My favorite Candlebox sing is \\"You\\" to this day, and \\"Change\\" and \\"Don't You\\" are not far behind. Full of bluesy solos and awesome lyrics. If you like this, check out Lucy, but listen first, before you get \\"Happy Pills\\". It's a bit different. But this one is still the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love them","review":"Candle Box is great!!! I love that one song that go's like this \\"this blood on my hands is for you only you\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid CD","review":"If I added in the sentimental ties I have with this CD, I'd have to bump it up to a 5. So taking that into account, I have to say it's a solid 4 star showing. Nothing earth-shattering about anything, just good blues-based rock.My biggest complaint about the CD is it's production. They didn't capture the feel of the music quite right. This CD could have taken a seat next to Nevermind and Ten, but for a better production and a few tweaks here and there. Ah well, still a good listen after a decade anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated '90s Release.","review":"Another one of my favorite CDs from 1994. I know it was actually released in late '93 but the next year was when this CD really took off. Candlebox got grouped with the grunge bands since they were from Seattle but they were a bit more diverse. While there were elements of grunge in their music (\\"Change\\" comes to mind with it's slow brooding intro) they had more of a mainstream hard rock sound on alot of their songs like \\"Arrow\\", \\"Don't You\\". And even a touch of blues on the great tune \\"Rain\\". \\"Blossom\\" is absolute killer. I love this CD as there is not a throw away track on it. Unfortunately as the years have passed Candlebox,the band and the album, have kind of been forgotten even though it turned out hits \\"You\\", \\"Far Behind\\" and \\"Cover Me\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"You","review":"The song \\"YOU\\" on this cd is powerful and hard hitting.It definitely has the Classic Rock Tag destiny.This song doesn't get nearly enough air time. If you haven't noticed the song yet, give a listen to the song sample. I had loved this song for years, before I was able to find out who it was by. Now, it has taken its place in my ultimate song mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Among the worst of the 90's","review":"A bunch of hair metal rejects who decided to try their luck at \\"alternative\\". Horrible, monotone singing with that cheesy fake 90's twang (that is somehow still selling records for Creed and Matchbox 20, who stink also). Weak, weak guitar solos. TERRIBLE lyrics. \\"Now may-ya-ya-ya-baya, i did-own me-yown to treat you ow so bayad, but I did anyway!\\" Are you kidding me? People bought this?

I knew almost all the songs already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd how time brings perspective, isn't it?","review":"Gee, it's strange that, had this music service from amazon.com existed at the time that \\"Candlebox\\" was released, this page would be overflowing with 5 star reviews claiming \\"THIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER MADE!!!!!\\", like so many of the other cheap, two-bit rip off acts like Matchbox 20. It's good to see that time brings things back into perspective, and encouraging that second rate bands will dissappear as quickly as MTV removes them from their \\"Heavy Rotation\\" set list. In the meantime, the bands that they ripped off are still going strong. I for one am relieved that I will probably never hear \\"Far Behind\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Among the Top Ten Worst Albums of the 90s","review":"Cheesy guitar effects.

Not the case here. The band could play a little, but the song writing, lyrics, and the overall sound is piss poor. It was almost like a combination between Pearl Jam and Poison, without the fun of Poison and the Voice of Pearl Jam. The things that gets me today was how these guys sold any records, but that is not important now. If you are looking for a good early 90'd alt rock record, pick up some Soundgarden. If you are looking for a more talented band from the same era, check out Dream Theater's Awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"They could have been a contender.","review":"After the release of this impressive debut, it looked like \\"Candlebox\\" would be the next big name in grunge/rock. And though they commercially fizzled afterwards, this album still stands as a great one from the era, and their best work of course. The big songs on here are \\"Change\\", \\"You\\", and the huge \\"Far Behind\\", but the rest is all good as well. Even though this album gets tossed into the grunge genre alot, it also has elements of hair-metal at times. I actually think it sounds alot like the debuts from both \\"Pearl Jam\\" and \\"Skid Row\\". Both bands I like. But regardless of who they sound like, they're good. This one is worth picking up, especially used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Perhaps the most fascinating feature of this book is the order in which topics are presented. Students flit all the way through triangles, angles and intersecting lines before they learn that theorems and postulates have some importance. They go through half of the book (and presumably through half of the school year) before they encounter the concept of a mathematical proof. In fact, they already have been required to learn some proofs, but the book hasn't told them that this is what they are doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"The Doors of Perception\\" instead.","review":"The greatest contributions in this book were just the native americans talking about what peyote meant to them, and why it should be legalized. The author, although more than qualified to write on the subject, has no passion or fire behind his writings and the essays seems to be written in a manner which Mr. Smith's extensive vocabulary is showcased over the much more exciting power of the entheogens. If you haven't read Aldous Huxley's masterpieces \\"The Doors of Perception\\" and \\"Heaven & Hell\\" read them instead. If you have read those already, you will not learn anything new here."},{"rating":"2","title":"another awesome metalcore band","review":"metalcore is popping up left and right these days. take these guys for example.

In contrast to the various 1969 Live albums and Carnegie Hall, the sound on this package is clear. You can actually hear the horn and vocal arrangements consistently throughout the record. The band plays with a lot of energy. This album also captures the essence of their Chicago V tour. Some of the tunes from V such as Dialogue and Hit by Varese may even have more energy than their studio counterparts. A misty feeling came over me when the group introduces \\"Saturday in the Park\\" as a \\"new\\" song.

So, when I saw this book, I thought it would be really good - it was only okay. Yes, it has some entertaining areas - but I thought it took a little bit long to get to the fact that someone had been murdered...maybe I need to practice a little more patience, but I wanted to know what they were looking for sooner!I did finish the book, so that bodes well - I am wondering if it I would have enjoyed it more if I started with the first in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder on a Bad Hair Day.","review":"The book was shallow and the plot was unrealistic; therefore, I can't even recommend it for light entertainment.

She writes like I'm sitting in the kitchen hearing her tell the story. The banter between Patricia Anne and Mary Alice is wonderful!

And now I have a new name to add to the list: Anne George. Her books are just precious and her characters are lovable! As I have previously stated, since I live in Alabama, I especially enjoy all the references to the Birmingham landmarks. When I read about highway 280, the Vulcan and the Galleria I feel that I am part of the story. Speaking of the story, I loved it. The writing is crisp, the dialogue forceful, and the plot is scrumptious!

Being a teacher myself, thank you, Mrs. George, for the hours of entertainment and relaxation your books have allowed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book about the bonds of southern relationships!","review":"I've read every Anne George book that she has written. Living in Alabama, I can identify with her favorite stores--Winn Dixie and Piggly Wiggly! As everyone in the south knows, a sister can say things about her sister or her brother, but NO one else can! I find the relationship between Patricia Anne and Mary Alice to be complex, confusing, and just plain fun! My teenage daughter enjoyed this book also. The pleasure in reading this book bridges the generations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Cozy Mystery","review":"In addition to solving mysteries, Patricia Anne drinks hot spiced tea and reads Tony Hillerman while baking cookies. You can't get any cozier than that! A pretty good mystery with several likable characters who work well together. The story bogs down now and then with intricate descriptions of everyday life, but it all leads to a very satisfying ending. A lightweight read, but enjoyable nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder on a Bad Hair Day","review":"When I bought this book it was listed as good condition, but it was missing the whole first chapter.

There is the heroine who is in danger. There is the hero who will rescue her. The hero tells her to stay put so she will stay out of danger. But, she ignores him either because she's not going let him tell her what to do or just because she's a twit. She leaves the house with someone she thinks is a friend. Of course that person turns out to be the villain. Well, if she isn't captured the hero can't rescue her. But I wish Ms. Camp would find a more creative way of getting the heroine into trouble rather than recycling the same plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light-hearted and sensual","review":"I like this book best of all the Candace Camp stories. Is is fun, light-hearted, and sensual. Yes, the young heroine can be pretty silly sometimes, but for the most part, I enjoyed her antics. The story is quite derivative of a Georgette Heyer plot. Think \\"The Convenient Marriage\\", but with sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I Could...","review":"I liked the beginning. I thought I would love the book. The main character Charity seemed like a good character to like...however...Charity was a child. She acted like a child through out what I read of the book. She believed too much and missed too much. I'm sure she was a good character and while I do not mind when an author makes one of the characters a great deal younger then the other I cant finish the book if the heroine is so innocent in everything. It feels wrong to me and so before I barely started the book I stopped reading it.It might have been a good read for some people but I couldn't do it and I wish I had not bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unlikable characters","review":"After reading The Courtship Dance, I was trilled to see that Candance Camp has published a new book. Let me say that although the story begins with so much promise, I got annoyed 1/3 into it. Initially, I liked Charity and how she enticed the duke to choose her instead of her sister, but then the story just turns ridiculous. When you see your fiance have a strong reaction towards another man, shouldn't you go see him and ask him why instead of continuing to frequent the man out of a sense of not letting him control you. On the one side, she promised to be the perfect wife for him and on the other side, she ignores his feelings. I didn't even bother to continue reading the book and choosing instead of skipping to the end. This book was a complete waste of money. I could barely stand Charity due to her immature behavior in the book and the mystery plot drags on until the end with only a couple of pages to tie it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing sudden about it","review":"I found myself struggling to finish this book. The plot was simple, slow moving, and very predictable. I knew exactly how it would end 1/3 of the way though the book. The writing was too simple, the author telling you what was happening instead of showing you."},{"rating":"1","title":"romance or bad mystery - pick one","review":"When I buy a romance novel, that is what I generally look for. A good romance.Camp likes to add in blatantly unchallenging \\"mysteries\\" into her stories, where the reader has figured out who the \\"murderer\\" or \\"mystery\\" is long before the characters do. The characters seem to be intellient people, but she makes the antagonists so obvious, it's frustrating to keep reading. The love story itself is very good and enjoyable in this book, but the added \\"mystery\\" is distracting and takes away from the pleasure of the story. If Camp feels it necessary to clutter the plot with a weak mystery, she should work harder on making the \\"mystery\\" more captivating.Stick to the romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This is one great guitar album.

Well, I'd like to differ there, Thelma's vocal work on that particular song is why I'm going to check if there exist some recording of her solo. The lyrics are reminiscent of Steely Dan's \\"Cousin Dupree\\". What's up with you americans? Can't you keep your hands off of your relatives? :-DOtherwise, I agree with the reviewers, the album is a logical next step in Hendersons blues-oriented catalogue. It is a little bit more to the \\"fusion\\" side of his output and I have no problem with that.(BTW, my 4 stars is probably equal to a lot of other reviewers 5.

All the Small Things- Dunno about this one, really, it's overplayed and in my opinion there are much better Blink-182 songs that could have been their big hit, still, it's okay. 6/10.3.

When I told them it was plugged into a surge protector they said it has to be plugged directly into a wall socket and that the literature is clear about that. I checked the literature and sure enough, in the installation instructions it says to plug the unit into an \\"electrical outlet\\". It doesn't say how to do that or what not to use.

With my horrible luck, I didn't need to wait that long. I was excited because it only took three days for the ac to get here with no additional charge.

It does not, however, cool the bedroom or the living room down much at all, and it's super loud (even when the AC compressor off). I got a sound meter app on my iPhone and checked.

I am very dissatisfied with Nintendo right now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD","review":"I have been a Newsong fan for many years and I think this is their best CD. I especially love Before the day. It could help us all get started on the right foot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pre-natal Yoga Book","review":"I'm a pre-natal yoga teacher, and I have many books on pregnancy yoga. This one is by far my favorite. The pictures are very detailed and well-done. Each pose is broken down step-by-step and has a photo to demonstrate the move. I also like that it is divided by early, mid, and late pregnancy. There is also a section on doing yoga with your baby after the birth.This book will be the one I recommend to my students because it's simple, safe, and well-illustrated without being too Eastern in it's approach. It will suit the average American reader, while still staying true to the heart of yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond my expectations","review":"It is easy to follow, the information is valuable. This book goes beyond not only after birth, but also because its knowledge about the process of being pregnant. A special thanks to the author, every word express her knowledge and dedication to its profession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't ever forget about Duets","review":"It was no secret that by the 90's sinatra was no longer a spring chicken, but it's still sinatra, one of the greatest singers ever. Duet's 1 & 2 are a great collection of music with frank singing with some of the best in the business. The song selection is pretty good in the one's he picked to record on these albums, yet there were a few songs I wished he would have done and didn't. The same for the singers that were chosen, in that would have been nice to see say Michael Jackson sing a duet with him. Overall, the duets collection is a must for every sinatra fan and even the casual fan. It's a great final tribute to sinatra's legacy.Peter J. Miller"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank let me down!","review":"This projet was done for money. Frankie in his elderly state was in no condition to sing. I hated it!

I bought the green one. It's a great watch. You can set mutiple alarm times so it's great for a person who needs constant reminders. It works great when I time myself swimming laps or sprinting. Also a great fit. I definately recommend this product for those looking a sporty but stylish watch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read","review":"I thought the white display on a black background looked cool in the photo but it turns out to be very dim and extremely hard to read.

First time thought it was a fluke. Second time makes me very mad.I did snorkel with the watch but did not exceed the depth rating. Second watch just showered with it to produce leak.This is unacceptable for a sports watch.I have the same model but in blue and its still working, just worn and now grey."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in this watch","review":"I have had two timex ironman watches - I gave one away and lost the other. I replaced it with this one - price was good and it looked nice. Howver, when i'm running, unless the sun is directly on the face, i cannot see it. And - when running and using the intervals, I cannot hear the tones idicating the end of the interval. So - totally useless for these purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty Band","review":"I have had the watch now for several weeks. I really wanted the black face because i thought it was cool. I read the reviews--and was nervous because some people had trouble seeing the face. I haven't had much trouble, but I hate the light colored band. From the picture, i couldn't tell if the black trim on the band turned completely black, as it got toward the back of the band, because that is the area that gets the dirtiest. But no, the band is green throughout and is grimy after three weeks. For a sporst watch, it certainly absorbs dirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"this watch no good","review":"Although the watch probably tells time, I can't see it because the numbers do not show up brightly in the black face. It looks great on line, but it really is useless to me. I can see the numbers if I turn on the light, but who wants to push a switch every time they want to see what time it is??? I am now paying for shipping both ways just to find out that the product can't be used. I will never order another product from Amazon that I have not seen in a store already. It is stupid to pay for shipping just to look at something that isn't any good and that cannot be used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't See Screen","review":"Can't read watch without using light.

The numbers are very dim on the watch face. Fortunately, my daughter's love for lime green has overcome this disadvantage. My suggestion to new buyers is to buy another color with black numbers on a regular digital face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen too dark","review":"The screen of this watch which appears bright white in the advertisement is actually a faded grey-brown.

I am sending mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent attempt","review":"The book is outdated, unclear in its focus, and makes assumptions for the reader. This book provides only a poor intro to Squeak and poorly touches up on OO principles. Liu's Smalltalk book is probably where one would want to start to get both worlds. Worst, this book is used at Ga Tech for a class titled \\"Objects and Design.\\"Also, all the previous book reviews on this page were reviews of Squeak and Alan Kay as opposed the book. So their 5 stars are misplaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Guitarist Ever","review":"A+ for releasing this-Terry Kath is the best guitarist ever.I do echo the sentiments of previous reviewers regarding the glaring omissions.

NO BYBLOS ???","review":"What is it with record companies. What planet are they on? I can't believe that such a worthy tribute album could have been so badly put together. Terry Kath was a truly great guitarist and songwriter. Why then do we have a collection of tracks of which a mere handful are Kath compositions and hardly any really define his intensity, lyrical perspective or guitar playing. Where are \\"Oh, Thank You Great Spirit\\" \\"Song Of The Evergreens\\" or \\"Takin'It On Uptown\\" to name but a few. And \\"Byblos\\" ??? where is \\"Byblos\\" !!! Surely one of the best songs ever written. This is a great album if you want a Chicago collection, but if it's the real Terry Kath you want, best to get a CD-R and make your own !"},{"rating":"1","title":"not too much inside","review":"The book is well written but it is not for learning nuclear physics. There is nothing inside except a nice list of topics with a very superficial view of them. So it is like a good syllabus but does not contain any real pieces of useful stuff for newcomers to the topic.I found quite good for general approaches when no details at all are needed (like tales or just a narrative about nuclear matter). Also, if you want to do the end chapter problems you have to go for the more conventional books, so again, it is just a nice syllabus. Not to mention that there is no insight at all on how experimental work is related with nuclear physics, even the scattering cross section is highly theoretical and far from reality.So, it is not bad but not useful for practical purposes, it is a good guide but not recomended as a study book on the subject, like Krane's, just to mention one."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad at all","review":"Book came in on time and everything went fine. it's cheaper than at school.

This book solved the problem. I bought Silver a few days after my book arrived, and in the first 3 days that I've had it, I've easily won three badges. It's true that there are some errors, but none of them are serious enough to interfere with playing. You'll miss a lot of the nuances if you don't read any Japanese, and if that's important to you, wait till the English version comes out. If, on the other hand, you can't wait to play Silver and Gold (and they're REALLY great games), get this book and go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silver and Gold","review":"This book is VERY good. The cover is awesome and the pictures and info will hold your interests. I do, though, have a caution. If you want to buy this book to help you translate the game, I would suggest you don't. The AT(Kabuto) Puzzle has not been figured out and the some of the info is a bit off and not very specific. It would be better if you just waited for the American release so you can fully understand and read the game and text instead of having too look over at the guide every two minutes. In other words, I'm saying if you don't completely know and understand the Japanese language, don't play the Japanese version of Silver and/or Gold and I say you shouldn't get this book to help translate the game. BUT, but, but, but, but, but,IF you want to buy thid book to learn more about Silver and/or Gold and/or the new Pokémon and/or the items and/or the gameplay, THEN I'd say stop reading this review and GO FOR IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST WAIT.....","review":"This book stinks! Personnally, i have never been satisfied with guides from sanwich islands. the descriptions are pathetic, the stats are not correct (i have the japanese version and can read some japanese), and even if it does help you, it won't compare to the fun being able to read the text and understand it.

It's been great for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a classic and still very popular","review":"I grew up with these songs as a kid (I'm in my 30s) and still remember them. The songs are stories of very imaginative things (cowboy mouse, chocolate king, etc.) with a very nice melody for the kids. The songs are catchy and timeless, in fact my mother in law sings them to my son before I bought the CD. All songs are in spanish and are very well done, highly recommend even if your kids do not speak spanish, maybe they will learn a word or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Deceptive- Not the original Cri Cri","review":"The DVD cover should straight-forwardly state that this video does not include Gabilondo Soler's singing. HE IS CRI CRI, and it is hard to accept anyone else's singing for this music. The back of the cover has credits for the intro only, which is the one and only piece with the original Conjunto de Gabilondo Soler. The lady's singing is in tune and sometimes pretty, but very cold, lacks animation, and never playful. I am very disappointed in Sony's crooked presentation, more so than in the quality of this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real cri-cri","review":"This is not the real voice of cri cri-it is a lady instead.

Iraq was about oil and power, Bush was a phony, his posse a gang. So buy this thing, enjoy it, and know that you are in the company of a truly intelligent, truly brave good guy.

Funnier than anything else I've read this year, you'll probably wince a few times, recognizing yourself or someone you know. Plotline: A Gen-X consumer in the year 2024 spends all day playing video games and buying crap online. When the chance is presented to have an affair with a higher class worker, he goes for it, until both are arrested by one of the large corporations for being selfish and hurting profits. Unlike Orwell's Winston, we never see a change in any of the characters... they're happily stupid and want to stay that way... but there's still an uncomfortable feeling when we see how close society's heading down this path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ideas but could have been presented better","review":"2024 is about mindless consumerism. People are driven only by caring about themselves and collecting \\"points\\" to buy useless stuff (really, isn't that where we are almost at now?). It was okay, it only takes about 45 minutes to read. I wish the art was better. I don't enjoy the ugly comics of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work...","review":"... But even Ted Rall's best work doesn't merit 5 stars. 5 stars should be reserved for the giants of the graphic novel medium, Neil Gaiman, Alan Moore etc. I can understand how someone could like 2024, but five stars?!? I mean, come on!I've liked Rall's comic strips. His drawing style is unique and fun, and he's an intelligent guy. He also has a lot of high quality ammunition to fire at this distopian comsumerist/techno crazy society. Yet, 2024 lacked the #1 thing I've gone to his comics for ... humor!Yes, there were a few funny parts, but not nearly enough to justify this much ink shed.As for the politics, I'm afraid he's just going to be preaching to the converted here.Try his web page for his free stuff, and maybe his collections (the worst thing I've ever done) before buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little gadget","review":"What I found great about this recorder is the speaker on the front. It is a very small speaker, but the quality and volume of sound that comes out is really amazing. Very handy for doing odd jobs where you need portability but can't afford to get tangled up in headphone wires. Recording quality from the built in mic is decent, though background noise is evident. Personally I would recommend an external microphone to go along with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is a sin in itself","review":"Again, I've been duped by other reviewers (thanks johnstory).

She's a beautiful eclectic Iceland singer who can works with a lot instruments, without them (like in Medula), with electronic beats, rythms or just doing what she wants in the moment. Her music is impressive, specially in the Homogenic and the Post albums. The selection of the themes in this compilation has been quite wise. My favorites are: Joga, Pagan poetry and All is full of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fans Have Gotten It Right","review":"Bjork herself called this CD \\"without heart\\" on her website, but strangely the exceptionally premature \\"Greatest Hits\\" works amazingly well. By not taking the traditional route avoiding chronology to provide instead a solid mix of music was brilliant. Even those hardcore Bjork fans might want to at least look at the arrangement of the songs since the most unlikely of songs become good bedfellows when paired back to back. The only carnal sin here is the exclusion of any tracks from the experimental SelmaSongs. One would think \\"I have seen it all\\" would be here amongst the list, Alas, no. \\"It's In Our Hands\\" wraps the compilation up with an original composition. If this album had waited another few studio albums to come out, the result may have been more effective, but for what we're given it is shockingly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excelent choice for bjork new fans","review":"Wow, i have to say i trully love this album. It was excelent for me because a few months ago i started getting into her music. A friend of mine toll me \\"you should heard this girl\\" and thats what i did. By now i have both Vespertine and Homogenic and i bought this album because to hear the Post and Debut singles and of course to have her greatest songs together in one cd. My favorites are All is Full Of love, god i wish the chorus would last forever :), Army of Me, with a lot of anger not especifically in her voice but in the music, and Hidden Place wich is the most beautiful song in the entire world. If you are looking for something new, fresh and that you ears have never heard be4 you should definitely buy this masterpiece ¡¡¡And the artwork is extremely creative and fresh, simple but beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a new Bjork fan","review":"prior to last month, i was only familiar with maybe 2 Bjork songs--tops. But I saw this greatest hits and thought \\"oh well, let's give it a shot\\". OMG, this CD is amazing. Bjork's songs are so beautiful, I'm just sorry it took me this long to discover them and her.

Bjork has herself a new fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eliminate the vocals & it's really not all that bad.","review":"The instrumental music that accompanies Bjork's vocals are creative and atmospheric, however I just cannot stand the sound of her voice.

If Bjork continues to get more and more weird she will problubly end up selling no records at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy This .","review":"If you want good music then stay away from this tripe. She is also not a very nice person.More ego than real talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the music videos","review":"I bought this CD expecting more out of the music. This CD is really about the singing. The music is only there to complement her voice. It is her emotional explorations through music.

If you like classical, I think that you would like this CD, though.However, I highly recommend the music videos:Bjork - Volumen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth in Advertising","review":"\\"Greatest Hits\\" collections are for casual fans. This would seem to be a problem for Björk, as her fans are anything but casual. (She's an object of adoration, not admiration). So I'm not sure who her Greatest Hits set is aimed at, but I'm glad it exists. These 15 tracks - two new ones! - distill her to her essence. Which is what, exactly? A restless bohemian with roots in worldwide club culture and the European avant-garde. Not exactly revelatory information, I know, but what might be is how seamlessly the dissimilar moods cohere across what's been a relatively short solo career (these songs span all of nine whole years). The club tracks are as fresh as when they were released, miraculous in a genre where music has the shelf life of fish. The artsy cuts still elicit awe. They are all held together by that passionately freakish voice. And though I'd listen to her if she sang the proverbial phone book, I'm tickled that she has less pedestrian things in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Bjork collection.","review":"Having always been a fan of Bjork and having never purchased any of her CDs, this particular Greatest Hits album is a must have. It features all of her biggest selling songs including Human Behavior, Sensuality, and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars anyway you look at it...","review":"Bjork is stubborn. She has admitted as much in many instances during her career. Although this was technically a fan-votes there is a very high probability that she left out It's Oh So Quiet and Violently Happy because they are songs which would probably have insulted her ego and her legacy. But the rest of the songs make up for this gaffe of willfullness.Heavily influenced by classical music, 11 of these tracks use orchestral instumentation of some type or another, Bjork's music is driven by her unique voice, a selection of programmed beats, and the genre of which she studied as a child.Here's to another 10 years of creativity. I wonder if there will be another Greatest Hits collection at the end of that epoch?PS: Don't buy Family Tree. While a effort that appears noble in concept, it is simply not worth the price for what is offerred."},{"rating":"2","title":"sublime in bits","review":"I never could get bjork. too much of an oddball for me. sure, she had distinctive voice, but i never paid her too much attention. i dug the video work for her songs, but the songs paled in comparison to the phenomenal imagery the likes of gondry, jonze and cunningham conjured up to support her albums. a recent viewing of jonze's video for 'ts in our hands' had a weird affect on me. the song slyly got into my system and stayed there, in a defiant loop, so much so that i had the urge to own a copy. and since this album cae highly recommended, i decided to give it a shot.i have now found a way to love bjork's music. 'hyperballad', 'all is full of love', 'isobel', 'it's in our hands'...they're so incredibly beautiful. the electronic programming , the atmospheric arrangement...and of course, her distinctive vocal delivery. i'm glad i purchased this album. i see bjork in a new light now!rather late in the day, i'll admit:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I <3 Bjork","review":"I remembered this CD from when it came out and missed some of the songs, so I had to search it out.

Both book and film are set in Brazil and tell a story of revenge in the underworld of that country. However, where Exposure kept the plot moving quickly along (and had some good fight scenes for martial arts fans), the plot of the book plods slowly along, giving out pertinent details only reluctantly, in small doses, while its author tells a narcissistic and pornographic soap opera.

This disc is a lot of fun! It's an excellent follow-up to Soul Insider. My only complaint is that it sounds just a little too much like a studio album (which it is). The sound is almost too polished and too clean; I prefer jazz that sounds more like a live performance. Still, it's aminor complaint. Evans writes most of his own stuff, and he writes with a lot of energy and a healthy dose of funk.

No matter how I set the hand strap on camera, the strap just did not fit right nor wrap on my hand/wrist properly so I could shoot or hold camera comfortably. Additionally, the part that screwed into the camera was off-line setting when I put camera on tripod. It just felt uncomfortable to me when shooting on tripod. It was as if I was shooting from side of tripod and left me feeling that I was shooting off-center. This product to me is a waste of money. I do not recommend its' purchase. Chalk this up as a lesson learned. I just went back to the shoulder strap that came with the camera. I just have the camera held with the strap around my neck or shoulder or on a tripod when I go out to shoot.

The watch is about the width of an average woman's watch. The wrist strap is small; the band is thinner than the width of my smallest finger. I'm 5ft 11inches tall and I have an average man's wrist. This watch is so small, I'm on the last notch.The wriststrap is the smallest of any of the Nike watches I ever owned. I would strongly advise you to get the midsize 100 version if you are looking for a normal man's watch. I was sorely disappointed.The lighting is subpar and not terribly bright. For some reason, nike decided to reverse the lighting, causing the watch face to go dimmer.I had high expectations since this is my second nike watch. I also felt disappointed that Nike abandoned the coin-open battery cover design on their earlier models to go for a decidedly clumsier micro screw panel.It's a huge step backward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haha","review":"This movie was so horribly filmed and made. The videography was totally grainy. I recommend that you should only watch this movie for the sake of laughing at it's flaws. It seems as if the actors are blind, and cannot see anything eye level. Also, it is violent too! Alas, it is embarrassing to have fallen for the cute preview and actually spend money on it because that was $4 that we regret spending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably a fifth grade school project","review":"This movie was insulting to viewers of all ages. It essentially mocked the intelligence of anyone watching it. The \\"writers\\" and producers did not even bother trying to cover up the strikingly glaring holes in logic and sequencing. Our 7 and 9 year old children both concluded quickly that this was \\"the dumbest movie\\" they had ever seen. Not only that, it looked as if it was filmed in a city park and the \\"action\\" was as exciting as watching butter melt on a kitchen counter. Movies for kids often have a formula to follow but this one just settled for making the outline of the formula and assuming the audience was ignorant enough to go along with them. Well, it doesn't work that way. I feel sorry for the adult actors in the movie since their careers would have to be impaired by the greedy \\"felony\\"now on their resumes. I strongly advise staying away from this \\"film\\". Any family could do better by making their own home movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Have Been Perfect","review":"What others have said is accurate. The major drawback is the display -- it's too bright, even on the low setting, and isn't very clear from certain angles. DESPITE THAT, I love it. The fact that there are two additional, separate displays for each alarm (in a different color than the main display) is a huge plus. You can easily see when an alarm in on, and what the settings are. Also the separate up/down buttons for the clock and EACH alarm are a huge plus. Radio sound is pretty good, but this isn't my stereo, it's my alarm clock, so I don't really care. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy this baby again in a second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I first saw this clock radio at the Hotel Palomar in SF. I liked it so much I bought one for home. Like other reviewers, I think it has awesome functionality (alarms, presets, etc.), however, the display is poor. As others said, it is overly bright and difficult to view from an angle.I definitely recommend this, but only wish that Sony would have a release 2.0 that addresses display issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong, New Voice","review":"I echo the statements of Mr. Dennis, who wrote a previous review of this disc. Frankly, it was getting to the point where I was bored by bop-derived playing. It no longer sounded fresh.Dave Glasser works within a traditional jazz setting, but he sounds original. A lot of it has to do with his tone, the sound he gets out of the alto. A little vibrato, a little raspy, quite appealing to this ear. There are 2 unaccompanied alto numbers here: Pannonica and Love Letters - both beautiful and captivating. The group is a good one: the always swinging and intelligent Lewis Nash on drums, Peter Washington - bass and Barry Harris -piano. One tune is a quintet with a trumpet, works very well. I recommend this disc, certainly to anyone playing sax, but any jazz lover will like it. Accessible, rewards careful listening and sounds good at a cocktail party too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfectly timed masterpiece.","review":"This has got to be one of THE best solo albums of all time! Columbia records recognized his talent and knew he was responsible for much of Chicago's success and they were willing to give him a lot of leeway with this album. He did what few would dare to do and made an album with a stripped down sound. Most of the songs are simple constructs of drums, piano, and the occasional orchestration.Each song on this album is a gem. I only wish post-1972 Chicago could have sounded this good. It is replete with the progressive rythyms and tempo changes of early Chicago as well as Robert Lamm's socially conscious lyrics. Any true Chicago fan will love this album. I only wish Mr. Lamm would make another one just like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool record...a little more stripped down than his work w chicago","review":"this album has a great stripped down sound. very soulful and funky w great guitar work from the late great terry kath. the sound isn't very unlike the lamm compositions recorded w chicago (ie Saturday in the park, Does anybody know what time it is).(in fact, a few of these numbers were re recorded w chicago and appeared on chicago albums). also, lamm sounds a little bit like the old billy joel records. definitely check this out if you like old school chicago. the reason i gave three stars instead of five is because there are a few 'filler' number that sort of bored me and had to be skipped over"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST CD of all time!","review":"This is possibly the worst record of the rock era. Bobby Lamm himself is ashamed of it. This originally came out in the late 70's, around the time Billy Joel had a hit with \\"Just the way you are\\". This whole cd is nothing but extremely lame recreations of that piano bar motif. Do yourself a favor....RUN AWAY FROM THIS PAGE AS QUICK AS YOU CAN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is one of the best I've read in life.","review":"The book has it all. The characters, although not fully developed, had depth. If you want to know about the complexities of pulling off a five- pronged military operation, definitely read this book. The plan was awesomely executed and the action was too tense at times. I found myself reading a few sentences at red lights while driving through New York. The dog-fights were awesome, with the Americans fighting like rabid dogs. I felt as if I was in the action at all times. Totally engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for getting rid of small stains and spills","review":"Received this unit a couple days ago. It is extremely handy for small spills and stains, not a whole room since it is a handheld. It has gotten rid of pet stains, crayon/marker spots on rugs, juice spills and any small dirty spots. It is rather loud but for the price it's totally worth it and easy to use. Does come with a small bottle of rug cleaner, so you don't have to buy any right now. I definitely recommend it. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricked","review":"This product claimed to be useful and powerful by the manufacture and the reviews I read. I found the unit to be bulky, (not good for vehicle use), had weak suction, small capacity, and worse of all the liquid must be sprayed manually (like a cheap squirt gun). This is an extremely tedious and slow process (which hurts your fingers after awhile). I would not recommend this to people who would like an easy and fast time at cleaning up puppy accidents, or spills from a 2 year old.

It starts by briefly describing Scandinavia and even telling a little about the Norse Goddesses and Gods. Then we see a history of the notorious Viking raids, which began near the end of the eighth century AD. There's plenty of material about the Viking adventures in England. But we also get to read about Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and other Viking destinations, including North America and Russia. And there's a mention of the famous Icelandic Sagas, the best known Viking literature.I enjoyed this book, and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent summary of Viking history","review":"As an amateur reasearcher and a keen fan of Viking history, I consider this book to be one of the best summaries of the Viking era. The text is well edited, to-the-point, yet manages to contain all important historical details. The illustrations and maps complement the text's material with further graphic information very well, causing the book to be one of the most interesting reads on Vikings I have ever come across. The writing not only deals with major military events of the Viking era, but discloses details on everyday life, rural and urban settlements, trade activites and much more of medieval Scandinavia.To readers who are interested in overall Viking history but simply cannot decide which book to start with, this work is an ideal choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic overview of Viking era - good for teens","review":"I did learn a few things from this book and, as a general introduction to the entire Viking era it does a good job. There are a few problems with it though. First, there are a few editorial mistakes (inlcuding, it appears to me, a missing illustration - the caption is included and a blank space where an image should be). Second, the maps are not always as interesting to look at as one would hope (although the written information is consistently interesting and enjoyable to read). As a reference book it is very useful and I am happy to have it on my bookshelf. I'm sure I will read it again. I feel bound to point out that I think it would be ideal for teenagers - especially if they are doing an assignment on the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"VIKING HISTORY","review":"I have read better accounts of Viking history. However I would still recomend it for most readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"I found this book to be excellent for my requirements - it provided information clearly and was not overwhelming in detail.

You have to watch out for the description on some of the Tell hardware as some are nickel finished steel exterior covering and not stainless steel. All the interior components are steel and in a marine environment will rust if you don't spray them with something like LPS before assembly and periodically afterward. Stainless Steel door hareware can get pretty expensive from other manufacturers but I don't know if they are made any better. I couldn't find any other manufacturer that has all stainless steel construction and I imagine if I did it would be much more than these modestly priced Tell units.

But unlike the other instrumental tribute albums, this takes a different style and sticks to it. One guitar player does two guitar tracks, and the result is a soothing, pleasant listening experience.

In fact, 3 replacements later, I gave up (the thin copper plating was marred, burned, or completely scratched off out of the box)The steel is also thin - not necessarily a problem, but the unit could easily warp, and doesn't hold as much heat for as long as ceramic/iron sets.2 stars, given the price (thin steel sets can be found for far less, this copper plating - and even the simple ceramic insert - doesn't justify the price)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read, eye opener for the small investor","review":"Blind Faith is a behind-the-scenes critique of the information relied upon by most market analysts.

The recipes are put on three or four pages, so although this book has many pages, it doesn't have as many recipes as I anticipated. I felt there was a too large section in the front to discuss each name brand and type of indoor grill available. This section will soon be outdated and rarely used. I would have liked to have seen this shorter and had more recipes.The recipes though are fantastic. This cookbook is well worth the money just to get these excellent recipes.

The fact that a reputable organization such as the Kempe Institute would lend its name to this book and the protocol it suggests is disturbing to say the least.

Sadly, \\"A Reader\\" from LA should stick to cookbooks and biographies of politicians as he has not a clue what the art of fiction is all about. Perhaps he thinks that the words of Hemingway and Fitzgerald are true statements of personal experience? Perhaps he.... ah, shoot, he probably has never heard of those two guys. Read the book and hold a masterpiece in your hands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book You'll Want To Share","review":"I think The Education of Little Tree is exceptional because, at its end, the reader feels a tremendous desire to pass the book on to a friend. Many novels leave you thinking, and you are content with your own journey to the author's world. The Education of Little Tree is different. After you read the final page you are determined that others will also visit Little Tree's mountain home. Why is this? Why do we readers all feel the need to share this novel? I think we want others to be as touched as we were, and continue to be, by this beautiful, beautiful story. What a world! Not only are the relationships loving and supportive, the kind we would all like to experience, they are of a time long gone. This is a wistful book; you yearn for Little Tree to be happy as you yearn for your own world to be as complete and connected to nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pocahontas joke","review":"This book reads like the author saw the film Pocahontas and then decided to send it up by writing a faux-sentimental piece of drivel. If this was the intention, then ten out of ten - you succeeded in creating a really bad joke of a plot and extending it from a single page to an entire book-length work of fiction. It's written by someone who cannot write, and beyond being a really poor prank, is about as interesting as watching paint dry. Can I get my money back, please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a disapointed book","review":"My English teacher and my parents said that The Education of Little Tree is a great book to read. I thought I should read the book because all the other books my English teacher recommended to me were books I really got into. I really didn't understand the point to the book of Little Tree learning his lesson, but maybe I misread the whole point. In the end of the book it had more persistence to it because of the adventure and action--that's why I gave it a two. I think adults like this book better than kids do because they understand the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it really an autobiography?","review":"Please, before you read or recommend this book, read thisarticle published on the NativeWeb...It calls into question theauthenticity of the author. The community has asked the publisher to re-classify the book as a novel, not as an autobiography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks.","review":"My language teacher made our class read this book last semester. It had to be the worst book I've ever read. It provided an unrealistic portrayal of the life of a Cherokee Indian, and I got the feeling that the author didn't do any research at all for this novel. Like most dumba**es, he makes the native americans seem 'magical' and 'mystical' like they practice wicca or something. the whole scene with the wilderness calling him home, and the trees singing to him was rubbish. it's corny and a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I read this wonderful book to my children when they were younger. They loved it as much as I. We laughed and cried together. Now, I have given a copy to my oldest son to read to his son who will be born this month. It is a book to be shared and cherished. What a lovely gift Forrest Carter has given to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read book","review":"This book can be enjoyed by a young audience, as well as adult. The book takes readers back to a time of hardships during the great depression and the discrimination against American Indians at that time. It also takes a harsh look at the part that religion played in fostering the mistreatment of the Indian youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a white fantasy of natives, nothing more","review":"That Forrest Carter, a leader in the Arizona KKK, a man who shot another man in a civil rights march, and George Wallace's speechwriter, would push this obvious fraud is no suprise. That many whites would fall for this pure FANTASY of what they falsely think we are like is really sad and unfortunate.Just so you know, this is NOT an autobiography, it is a long ago discredited hoax. Cherokee ways are NOTHING like what is shown in this book.How sad that so many people are deceived into thinking this is a truthful story about natives.This book is much like the movie \\"Pocahontas\\", a sterotypical and racist story that falsely poses as anti-racist. And whites pat themselves on the back while natives shake their head and wonder of things will ever change."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly inspirational story","review":"I cannot give enough praise to this book. As I read this book, I can imagine myself sitting and listening to an old storyteller, hearing the voices of Little Tree, Granpa, Granma, Blu Boy, union soldiers, etc. Forrest Carter's choice of diction and description of the sounds in nature was instrumental in transforming the reader back into the time and surrounding of Little Tree and making us look at the beauty of nature, the sadness of losing family members and the bitterness of bigotry. As an autobiography, perhaps it lacks the dates, names and all other details needed to draw up a family tree or fill a logbook, but as a story, it is beautiful. It will make you laugh and cry and remember all those images most captivating to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My All-Time Favorites","review":"Regardless of what has come to light concerning the author and the fact that it is apparently a work of fiction, this has always been one of my all time favorite books. After a recent re-reading of this book, my opinion remains unchanged. It'll make you laugh and make you cry...highlights kindness and cruelty in a simple manner through the eyes of a child. With its message of tolerence one can't help but wonder if Mr. Carter underwent a dramatic change in his beliefs at some point and wrote this as some form of redemption...speculation yes, but the contradiction between author's supposed past and this work is mind blowing.This book ranks among my top five probably of the best books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely delightsome! How did I miss this one growing up?","review":"What led me to this book in the first place was a review of the forthcoming video. It offered just enough of a teaser about the book's contents that I had to find out more. Not a long book but one I chose to savor - A few chapters lingering over my favorite coffee on a Sunday morning type of thing. Like Little Tree in the book, when you find something good, tell as many people as you can. My \\"first\\" copy has been given away to a friend on the condition that they will give it away to someone else when they have read it. It gently teaches lessons of the heart and spirit by drawing on a child's experiences and Cherokee wisdom. Though I missed it when I was younger, I'm very happy to have made the acquaintance of \\"Little Tree\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book and the man are not the same","review":"What a pity that critics of this book focus solely on the fact that this book was originally promoted as an autobiography, and that sad past of the author.Today both of those misconceptions have been well documented. The book is a novel. While I loath what Carter apparently stood for in his \\"other life,\\" there is no denying that this book is deeply moving. Separating the author's views from his work is what's need here. I do it with brilliant actress Vanessa Redgrave, and I can do it here.READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Destined To Become A Classic","review":"This is a rare, wonderful, and sensitive book that I urge everyone to read. It was recommended to me by a friend whose father read it to him as a child. It is particularly relevant to those who, like me, live in or near the Appalachian Mountains or are interested in the life style and values of latter day Cherokee. The book is written using the language of the mountains and flows beautifully. The character development is inspired and the descriptions of nature and mountain life is poetry at its finest. I plan to purchase several copies for my close friends and recommend that our local book store carry the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read, didn't know, now I do, put it in it's correct place.","review":"This is not the first time the wool has been pulled over the eyes of many. I read the book last year and was totally unaware of the author and his political views, because the Univ. of New Mexico would not lie about it being a true story. So, it drops down a notch. It is still a moving story. However, it leaves a knot in my stomach, thinking that it was true. Of course, I feel these events are too well described not to have happened in some way, shape or form to Mr. Carter. Look Homeward Angel was fiction, yet had been experienced. The same can be said for all of the books of Hemingway. Mr. Carter either saw these events or was a great listner of stories, and judging from his politics, I doubt he listened to non-whites much. But, for a good fictional short read, give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG STEAMIN' PLATE O' CRAP","review":"The author's racism aside, this book is annoying in the extreme -- the so-called prose is precious and poorly written, and the allegedly authentic colloquialisms are grating. The entire enterprise is gag inducing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribble","review":"The book, \\"The Education of Little Tree\\" is indeed a horrible book in my opinion. Whether or not Asa Earl Carter (AKA \\"Forrest Carter\\") was a \\"reformed\\" rascist is beyond the point. I think that many of the insights in this book can be, and are, taken in the wrong way. Nobody really knows what his views were on Native Americans, but perhaps, just perhaps, he had been reformed, and was wsimply digging deeper into his own black soul to try and justify what he had done."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End Was Incredibly Quick","review":"Throughout the meat of the book, it was an amazing (even if not certainly true) book. Filled with lessons from the Cherokee's ways, it enhanced the damage out government and army did to them. However, the last chapter seemed as if it was hurried, and but a bad impression on the rest of this great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I read this book years ago and brought it up on amazon to see if anyone had made a list with this book in it - I want to read other books this good!It's a wonderful story, beautifully written and compelling. I read some books because they are so well written (Shipping News, My Antonia). I read other books because I can't put them down (Patricia Cornwell, Grisham). This book was both (not the same subject, but along the lines of Cold Sassy Tree, Refiner's Fire, and Bean Trees).I don't know what 'history' the other reviewers refer to, but buy the book. It's wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a documented FAKE, written by a KKK member","review":"Written strictly for the money, this man had no more to do withCherokees than Jesse Helms. The U of NM should know betterthan to insult Native Americans by continuing to promote thisas an Indian text. Shame on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GEM!","review":"Recommended by someone very dear to me as a good read for my son, I learned it's a good read for mankind. We've come so far from living WITH nature, and this is a good reminder why we need to return to harmony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"Putting aside the controversy associated with the book and its author ... it's just so incredibly drab. I'm not sure why anyone would have believed that a five-year-old was capable of all the physical and mental tasks Carter purports to have done with his Granpa.Nothing happens until the very end of the book, when finally we see some action. The first 3/4 of the book is devoted to entire chapters on berry picking, planting, whiskey making and \\"The Way\\" ... and as boring as that is, it's nothing compared to sitting in his secret place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was assigned school reading. I found it rather boring and the language used in the story became annoying after a while. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THOSE BOOKS I WILL ALWAYS RECOMMEND......NOT TO READ!","review":"The Education Of Little Tree is one of those books that I will always recommend...not to read!I hated, wait, hate is such a strong word, but it truly describes the way I felt about this book. I have read many critics' opinions on this book after reading it, I agree strongly with almost everything that a lot of the critics have said about this book. I thought it could have been written a little, I mean a lot better. Every time that I start reading a book for school, I think \`Oh great, another pointless and boring book', and there are only some books that I have read that have contradicted that. The Education of Little Tree was not one of them. I may have used a lot of powerful words in this discussion, but that is the way I feel about books like this one. I really hope that we don't have to read books like this one during this school year."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I read this book several years ago but Amazon's reminder to review another book I recently purchased made me remember this one and I just had to come back to write a review about it.First of all, while this book deals with some pretty heavy subject matter regarding Native Americans and their treatment by the Whites, it is FUNNY. Written from the perspective of a naive young man one cannot help but laugh at the tongue in cheek humor Little Tree espouses when relating to the White Man's attempts to educate him, civilize him, and stop his grandpa from making Moonshine. I still laugh at the image of the two government men sampling some of grandma's cooking only to have to use the restroom in the woods and wipe with poison ivy! This book may have generated some controversy but the writing style, humor and character of Little Tree make it a definite must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acceptable","review":"The book was in the shape that it was described. There was a lot of writing but for the price that I paid for it, I cannot complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education of Little Tree","review":"Lovely and heart wrenching read. I can't think of an age group that wouldn't benefit from reading this book. Light it is not ! I hope we have evolved beyond our ignorance - when it comes to our opinions of the Indians I especially am continually saddened"},{"rating":"2","title":"A major book!","review":"I read this book prior to buying for my grandson. I was so transported by the beautiful writing, descriptive stories, I felt like I could hear and see the forest. I laughed, cried, and learned. Have recommended repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Change You forever","review":"This was a beautiful book, easily readable, believable, childlike, spiritual, kharmic. It will change your view of the world forever and add depth and understanding. I recommend it for young, old and in between. It can be read in a day, it will be remembered for a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"it doesn't matter what you look like, but whats inside.","review":"Little Tree learns that you just have to deal with the hardships that get thrown at you. I learned that just because you are different does not mean that you do not have feelings. The Education of Little tree was a well written book. It explained stories and ideas so that I could understand everything that it was talking about. This book made me relize that it does not matter what you look like but it does matter whats inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most memorable stories I have ever come across.","review":"This is a bittersweet tale told in a simple voice with great poignancy and power. Despite every opportunity, Forrest Carter never portrays himself or any of the many characters he encounters as victims. He weaves a nearly dream-like account of life close to the Earth, of great respect and admiration for all things of nature, and the fine line between the \\"thinking\\" world of white men and the \\"knowing\\" world of the red man. This book will make you giggle and make you cry, but mostly it is a powerful cathartic medicine for those afflicted with the maladies of the modern world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book about the sad treatment of the first people in this country.","review":"This book will open the eyes of a lot of Americans who still don't know how the American Indians were treated at the hands of the whites who ran the boarding schools across America. Their sole purpose was to crush the Indian spirit, beat them when they spoke their native language, and to stuff their own religion down the throats of the poor, vulnerable and very young Indian children. How do I know this as a true fact? My own Grandparents went to the horrendous boarding schools and endured these terrible things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judge a book on its merits","review":"In these days of political correctness, the author and how he or she behaves in private life has become more important than the merits of the book itself. Lamentably, many would have books become mere political objects with the only value assigned to them the value of it furthering the cause of some special interest group. I applaud whoever wrote this book, not because the individual is a 'nice person' but because the book itself is grand. Let's not throw out \\"Moby Dick\\" because Melville may've beat his wife. Long live the book and FREEDOM"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a pleasant diversion","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It was a pleasant diversion. However, I wasn't quite as moved by it as some seem to have been. Perhaps if this had been my first introduction to the Native Amercan view of nature, it might have been more meaningful for me. As it is, it reminded me a little of the kind of anti-establishment novel we would have read in the 60's and early 70's and found to be \\"so true.\\"I did, however, feel that the writing was quite good. The author did a very believable job of telling this from a child's point of view, and I always appreciate someone who describes nature so that you can feel,taste and smell it. Over all, I would recommend this as an excellent book for young adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the saps","review":"Complete Dreck. If you want to read good American Indian fiction, this is not it. Try Sherman Alexi."},{"rating":"1","title":"A manipulative novel","review":"If you're an adult reader, \\"The Education of Little Tree\\" may initially make you angry at the white man's world of cruelty and racism. The story, though, relies on standard elements of sentimentality: an orphaned little boy, half Native American, raised by his grandparents who are honorable without fault, surrounded by cynical whites who take pleasure in ridiculing and hating redskins. Little Tree himself is so innocent and good-hearted that he mistakes ridicule and laughter for affection, and of course he and his grandparents are at the mercy of white power and authority. Even young readers need to know that good and evil aren't so precisely delineated, that love of the land isn't only limited to the dispossessed, and that an awareness and a certain toughness of character are more likely to ultimately triumph than passive innocence. The intent of the story is good and admirable, but its simplistic and sentimental elements do a disservice to its issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart-warming? Ha!","review":"I hated it! As it was a required book for my English class, I had to read through all agonizing 216 pages. The plot was amazingly random and I felt sickened by the 'dialect' used throughout the book. I also feel it completely inappropriate for a five-year-old to be swearing in that great a volume. The ending was the most mismatched series of ridiculous events I have ever read! If those events were ever to happen, they would happen over many years -maybe a lifetime- as opposed to the year or two alotted in the book. I hope never to read another book by Carter again"},{"rating":"1","title":"If interested in Native culture, do not read this book","review":"Forrest Carter was a racist KKK extremist who manipulated the little knowledge he had on Native American life and culture, and sold it as a factual life story. Anyone who wants to learn true Native history should NOT read this book - especially teachers who use this book as a cultural tool for young children. Boycott this book and read something with credit and accuracy. Do not support a man who lied about who and what he was."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy with seller.","review":"Jeewon was the company that did not send my order , charged to my credit card. would not respond to two emails to them.Amazon refunded my payment. amazon was great. not jeewon.I am not rating the book because i never received it from jeewon."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time Favorite book","review":"This is the only book that I have ever read that consistently can make me laugh and cry.

It shows you things about your own life, if you are willing to listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story worth reading and keeping","review":"I first read this book 5 years ago and have purchased copies for several friends and just gave another away.

Unfortunately, it is unbalanced in the upright position and something breaks every time it falls over.

I'm now looking for a better quality machine, but it you don't want to spend a lot of money finding out whether you like a floor cleaning machine--this is the one.

While it does a decent job at cleaning tile floors and is inexpensive, it has too many negatives to keep it.The solution dispenser doesn't seem to work very well, I ended up spraying glass cleaner on my tile floors instead. The dispenser on/off switch is difficult to tell when it is on. The unit is unbalanced and will not stay upright in the locked position. It is very poor at removing the water/solution from the floor, I had to go over the floor with a towel to get it dry. This is the main reason it's going back to the store. But to get it back in the box I had to unscrew the end so I could take it apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"several important problems","review":"Since I retired I have assumed total responsibilty for cleaning the house and as a man I am always looking for the most effective (easy) method. The Floor Keeper is a great concept but unfortunately has several important flaws. These include:1. The machine tips over too easily when the water tank is empty and the cord in wound on its holder...it is just a matter of time before something will break.2. The shut off cleaning dispenser indicater is difficult to read...the only real way you know is when water is pooling on the floor.3. The dirty water tank only holds 12 0z of solution (the amount of a large cup of coffee) before the vacuum shuts off. The time you spend emptying the tank makes mopping seem quick and simple. Back to the basics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept that works poorly","review":"Since my wife works and I'm retired, it's my responsibility to take care of the major maintenace in the house. Saw the Floorkeeper and thought that this was the answer to my floorwashing problems. Lot of promises made on the carton . . . but actual use shows most of the promises go unfulfilled. Some examples:1. The Floorkeeper falls over easily . . . particularly whenit's full of solution.2. You never know when the solution is on or off . . . untilyou see a puddle under the machine.3. After the floor has been washed and you turn on the suction. . . the suction will stop for some unknown reason. If I emptythe dirty water . . . it will start again . . . but it doesn'thold very much dirty water.4. When it does work . . . it works well. But it has so manyproblems that it's too much of a hassle to use it. I've gone back to a mop and pail.Would I recommend it? No way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The floor are clean but...........","review":"I didn't buy the Hoover because I don't have many bare floors. Just the kitchen, 3 bathrooms, and a small entrance area. I bought this on sale yesterday at Target and returned it this morning. It did clean well except along the edges and around the toilets after I vacuumed first with my regular vacuum. (The vacuum on this is a joke) I emptied the tank at least 10 times doing just one bathroom and the (small) kitchen. Totally agree with the other reviews. You can hear a change in the motor when the dirty tank is full, then it pours water all over the floor. It falls over when you let go to empty the tank. Cleaning out the filter is gross. Pet hair clogged it within 5 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea/Poor Product Quality","review":"The Floor Keeper worked well at first. Then, as mentioned in other reviews, the cleaning fluid refused to drain onto the floor to use the wet vac mode. Applying manual pressure to the front of the canister helped. After a year, some of the plastic parts started breaking: the bracket securing the left wheel, the canister securing catch. Also had problems with the unit falling as it failed to lock in upright position. $100/year is too much for floor cleaning tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Wonderful Food","review":"Jacques Pepin uses cooking and food to love people, and it shows in this wonderful and usable book.

By and large, the volume is correctly billed. There are a wide range of recipes -- even desserts -- that for the most part are relatively simple and reasonably quick to prepare. A handful, such as the balsamic chicken, have become instant favorites. Of course, tastes are going to vary -- a classical music fan may be unlikely to give a country album a top rating, and vice versa -- but I think Pepin runs through a wide enough spectrum of choices that there ought to be something here for most people. My only quibble is with the books design: The recipes are sometimes hard to grasp at first glance because of the layout and typefaces, but if you bear with it I think you'll find some rewarding dishes to take away from this.

That may be the biggest problem with it... Steven can't seem to decide what kind of artist he wants to be. Overall, his vocals are good but much like his speaking voice. The better tracks are Route 23, Girl It's Alright, and Better Man, which have a more contemporary blues feel to them. Dance is just that, a dance beat, but it kinda pulls you in.

Written before the final release of IE4.0, it misrepresents some of the methods and code available for Microsoft's latest browser. I can only assume that the support for some of the code was changed after publication of this book. In fact, a lot of what I learned turned out to be fairly useless. As if to verify this, I soon found that there were many updates to chapters on the publisher's website. All in all, it's a book with great potential.

Most songs are from the band's No Parole From Rock and Roll album with a couple instrumentals thrown in and a classic Rainbow cover from Graham Bonnet's days with the band. The recording suffers from some bad producing, but it really captures the rabidness of the band and Yngwie in particular. Bonnet's vocals go flat a few times but it shows that the band didn't get to \\"sweeten\\" their sound in post production. This is a good thing because you get the feel of how potent the band could really be live. Yngwie's guitar literally takes over the concert and hits non-stop with riff after riff. Actually he overplays way too much, but it's still interesting to here such a talented guitarist even if the songs turn into a jerk off contest with Yngwie."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad chemical reaction ...","review":"I like Yngwie and I like Graham Bonnet, but Alcatrazz is just not my cup of tea.

In came Steve Vai and although he sounds more comfortable than Yngwie the band wasn't meant to last.Bonnet went on with the Impelliteri-project, but that would be just another stint with another guitar hero.

It has a rugged heavy duty zipper. The fit is just right, plus this sweatshirt keeps me warm, and it is extremely comfortable. The zippered inside pocket is 5\\" wide and 6\\" deep - large enough to stow my keys, wallet, passport and iPhone together safely, with a bit of room to spare. The hood is quite spacious too. Its draw string is thick, and the end knots don’t untie in the wash, spin and tumble dry cycles of laundering.I had never heard of Carhartt before, but I praise the quality apparent throughout this item of clothing. To me it seems like a great value for the purchase price. I ordered black, and it was truly black.

The price was too good to turn up (somewhere in the ballpark of $35, I think).Was looking for a heavier sweatshirt kind of deal, since I'm not much of a jacket-guy, and this was pretty much what I wanted. The outside is pretty much a sweatshirt, and the inside is a jacket. Its very warm when it needs to be, but isn't too warm to wear when its mild. Mine seems to look a bit thicker than depicted, and is a little heavier than I thought it would be, but I like it.Good for that misty, foggy, cool morning when I'm outside at work during the summer, and overall, its pretty good looking too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical","review":"This is a durable, visually appealing, well-made article.

It is true what other reviews said of the lining being a little rough right out of the box.

It is unoriginal (ripping off true slasher classics like: House on Sorority Row, Madman, Friday the 13th etc.). The novel is great! It revolves around nine friends being graphically terrorized by a mad gravekeeper and killed off in despicable, genuine ways that (surprisingly) weren't ripped off from slasher classics. The book goes on just like a regular slasher movie; the shocking pre-credit sequence, the first graphic kill, the scene of strong love and much more. Crye writes like he knows the rules of the slasher film (recited in the notorious Scream film). He uses a strange format of cleverness and trickery making the person you would think was the final person to survive the first to be brutally butchered. Overall, the novel is great and the film most related to this novel is The Burning and House on Sorority Row.93% out of 100%"},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you expect?","review":"I really enjoyed this book! Yes, its typical and the characters are quite forgettable, But I think the point of this novel was to capitalize on the \\"Slasher\\" crazy of the 80's. I am an avid fan of the Slasher genre, and I font this book to be a great read. I dont read very often, because I don't have the attention span to sit down and read. I was 100% percent into the book from start to finish. I wont say its a masterpiece, I wont say its perfect, but if your a TRUE slasher fan. This book is defiantly worth a read. I was not disappointed. The violence is awesome as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One-dimensional","review":"I picked this up at a used bookstore last year, and am sorry I did.

My understanding is that the battery is not replacable. I have contacted Dirt Devil and am waiting for a reply but I don't have great expectations because battery is not listed on their warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this vacuum in November 2008. After my initial honeymoon phase (being happy about the cordless part), well I might use it every couple months now. I have 3 dogs and 2 cats, and all Pergo flooring. In the winter the brush on the vacuum does nothing but produce tons of static, making it impossible for the vacuum to suck up any pet hair at all. In the spring / summer, the little rollers on either side of it collect all the hair, so it must be turned off, picked up, and cleaned out every few minutes. I had very high hopes after reading all the positive reviews here, but unfortunately it just hasn't worked out for my living situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst vaccume I have ever had.","review":"This is a junk.

This vaccume is going to be in the trash can."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good - very handy","review":"This is so convinient for quickly getting a mess cleaned up. So much nicer than getting out the big vacuum and plugging it in and dragging it around the house. I have mostly harwood and tile in my house and that is why I got this. I have used this on small amounts of carpet and it seems to do the job, but I wouldn't reccommend for just using on carpet. It is very easy to dump the collection chamber, but the filter seemed to be full of lint in mine and I need to figure out how to clean that out so it won't effect suction. Guess I need to get the instructions out. The longest I have used it for is about 15 minutes and it worked fine the whole time. I did leave it off the charger after that and when I went to use it the next time it died after about 5 minutes. So just make sure you put it back on the charger each time used. I love this overall and it is so easy and kind of fun for me to just grab up and clean up the babies crumbs all over the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I think I would rather have one of the manual, push sweepers for small jobs.This vacuum was broken within a few months of use.

Money wasted and who has time to deal with shipping a $50 product back and hope to see your money again? No suction, the brush stopped turning, but worse, it caught bits of cat litter in the wheels and scratched my floors - a lot.

With 2 small children, there is always something spilled on the floor. It has a lot of power for the size and I love the recharging stand. I had purchased a less powerful Dirt Devil stick vac and returned it for this one. It didn't have a stand, which makes a big difference. Although cosmetic, I also like the color of this one.I wish it was a little better at picking up cheerios, though. It takes a little more effort for cereal.I've had it for 2 months now and it has made cleaning a lot easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an everyday vacuum","review":"I bought this vacuum because of the great reviews everyone gave on this site. After getting the vacuum and being disapointed, I went through all of the reviews again. It seems that many who use this vacuum can't really handle the size of bulky regular vacuums. Hence, the most people focus on its portability and decent suction for size.Unfortunately, this is much weaker than a typical $50 upright plugged in vacuum. It has difficulties with corners and hair. Any hair longer than 4 inches is likely to get in the brush.I agree that this is a nice vacuum for those quick spills...but there's no way this is adequate to clean a home. If you can handle a normal vacuum, go with those for now.Dirt Devil is still needs to iterate on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little weak","review":"First, it is great having a cordless product, it makes cleaning small amounts almost instantaneous. The problem is the thing has very little suction. The rotating bristles can be stopped easily with just light pressure from your finger tips so I suspect that as I'm vacuuming carpet the bristles stop spinning.The vacuuming on the hardwood floor is also not very powerful, you have to go over a piece of dog fur directly to get it up and when you're through you see lots that it left behind. I'm looking at the black and decker model next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for first month","review":"This was a great stick vacuum. It saved me so much time as I have a little one but aftera short time, it didn't pick up as well. The crumbs would pick up with the rotating brush but when I turned the power off and lifted it, all the crumbs came right back out! I do NOT recommend this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big, fat waste of money!","review":"I bought this cordless vacuum for quick pick ups. I thought I would buy the more expensive one because I thought it was more powerful. It is a joke. It picks up MAYBE half of the crumbs off our hardwood floors and just pushes the cheerios around the floor. We have young children and I thought it would be nice and fast - trust me, you'd be better off picking every little crumb off the floor with your hands than using this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this for my apartment and have been really disappointed. My floors are almost all hardwood except for one 9 x 11 area rug. It barely picks up the dust and hair from the wood floors and on the rug all it does is roll around the dirt into little piles that I have to later pick up. The suction is so poor that when I cleaned up from removing our Christmas tree, I gave up on it and used a broom instead. I kept it on the charger as per the manual and felt after 5 minutes of using it, it had to be charged again. The dust container was small and had to be emptied quite often. The only redeeming quality of this thing is that it's cordless, but I'd rather have a corded vacuum that actually cleans than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dirt Devil Stick Vacuum is Fantastic!!!","review":"I bought this vacuum to suplement the use of my central vacuum.

It's easy to manouver around and under chairs and tables, holds a long enough charge, my kids can use it too as it's very light in weight. After having 4 different upright cordless vacuums, this is my favorite. Yes, the dirt cannister fills up quickly (sign of a good vac in my opinion!) but unlike the other comment below, I find it no hassle to empty quickly. It's great to get under beds and cupboards too. Definitely not for carpets but great on wood and tile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picks up Great....For 5 minutes","review":"I loved this vacuum initially. You can even see how much dirt it's picking up! However, the shape of the filter severely limits suction almost immediately, to where the vacuum won't pick up a speck of lint.

I do NOT have a terribly messy household, just one with no stairs going to the front & backyard."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dirt Devil is Awesome!","review":"I just recently had all of my bedrooms re-done with laminate wood flooring. I purchased the Dirt Devil Extreme Power Stick Vacuum. It does floors and carpets. I love the fact that it is cordless.

This vacuum is light and maneuverable and quite powerful for its size. The dirt dump is very easy. We originally bought it to go on our boat, but so far we have not been able to get it out of the house because it is so much easier to deploy than our full size vacuum. You can grab it from its convenient charger/holder, sweep up an area of dog hair, for instance, and put it away in less time than you can plug the other vacuum to the wall. We are ordering another one for the boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is powerful...","review":"This vacuum does have the power to clean well on hard floors as well as carpeted areas.

The first few times we used it we were pretty impressed with how much dirt and cat hair it picked up, however the more we used it, the less it picked up. We tried cleaning filters, checked the entire thing to make sure that nothing was clogged, but nothing seemed to help. My husband went over the floor with the broom one day as soon as I was done with our kitchen floor (and we clean our floors every 2 days) and he was able to pick up alot with the broom.

The first one worked well for about 5 months, then I bought new filters and even a new cup (the price ended up being almost as much as I paid for the unit.) It stopped sucking up stuff, so I took it into an \\"approved\\" service center, they took 2 months to tell me the problem with the vacuum is not covered by the warranty. But since it took so long, I bought another one, it's been about 4 months, and this one has stopped sucking, too! So now for about $150 in product and accessories, I could have bought a real good vacuum. If you need a spot cordless vacuum, look into the Eureka 96D... it has wonderful suction, but I can't tell you how long this one will last as I have only used it for about a month, but it has better suction for pet hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"It cannot cope with crumbs and bits","review":"We had to trash this vacuum after a few months because it could not cope with crumbs or any bits (other than dust).

It does a good job with dog hair, the others just pushed it around & it does a great job on the hardwood & tile floors. The battery holds a charge longer than the others -- I can vacuum the entire 1st floor (approx 1500 sq ft/mostly wood & tile) before I hear the motor fading. Dust cup is on the small side but that's insignificant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuum too weak to be useful","review":"The vacuum is too weak to pick up anything heavier than a grain of rice.

I use it about 4 times daily. It picks up all the dog hair, dust, and most of the little crumbs off the floor.

I have found the best results is had if you clean out the debris chamber often and making sure the filters also are cleaned often.For the price this is a very usable vacuum.

We use it for cleaning the tile floors of the kitchens and bath. We tested em out by first cleaning with the new cordless then following up with the old corded bissell. This one missed some visible stuff and the old Bissell picked it right up.We do love the idea of the cordless and the carpet brush. But just cannot live with its suction.

I had read a couple of reviews that when this happened to them, they washed the filters and it worked fine. I tried this, but it made no difference.

It ends up hurting my back and taking more time than it would to pull out and run the regular corded vacuum. If you have grout, forget it - it doesn't have enough power to get anything in the grout. On my floor it is really only good for removing hair and dirt from the tiles, even little dried leaf pieces remain. It also doesn't pick up very well on throw rugs or carpet.

It works marginally on hard surface floors (we have tile) where there is only lint and/or doghair . It will not pick up sand, or other small bits of hard particles, leaves, paper, twigs, etc. The cup is very small, and the vacuum will not pick up lint if even a small amount of material collects in the cup. The cup must be emptied every few minutes. On carpet it picks up lint and doghair primarily by wrapping it around the brush.

This one is fine for things like the middle of the floor and rugs and even does pretty well on carpet. Plus it's neet to have the see-through cannister that you can see all of the stuff you've picked up (and does had much greater capacity than the Shark) -- but I do get aggravated with it's inability to pick up against the baseboards.

The granulation of the Creatine per the description say it's micronized, but it has the weight and mass of sugar, it does not dissolve in a matter of seconds... it'll half dissolve in about 10 minutes. You'll have to constantly stir to distribute, and then it'll settle again. Most micronized Creatines dissolve in minutes into clear water. Not this garbage. Stay away!After receiving this and learning of the non-German Creatine, I took it once to try, got pains for about 8 hours... and then bought Optimum Nutrition's Creatine which IS made with Creapure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this product and the only thing I really gained from it was acne, plus my body actually seemed to get flabby.

In fact, the funny thing is, I was on amazon looking for a new phone to replace the kitchen phone and found the sony here.

Capt. McGonagle of the USS Liberty even admitted the attck was accidental. If Israel really wanted to sink the ship they would have done so with submarines under the cover of night, instead of a partial attack in the middle of the day. More than 10 American and 3 Israeli investigations have come to the same conclusion the attack was an accident.The USA would never have begun funding Israel with military aid had they deliberately attacked the Liberty, all in all this film is for conspiracy nuts and haters of Israel, and lacks any real coherence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute lies and falsified information","review":"This film is not only severely biased, but it fails to explain why Israel would deliberately attack their only ally. At the time of the friendly fire attack there was a huge explosion near El-Arish where Israel was fighting Egyptian troops. Because Israel was attacked by the sea a day earlier, they presumed that an Egyptian warship was firing at them. The US had never even informed Israel that the ship was 22 miles off the coast , and it was not even supposed to be there in the first place, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had repeatedly cabled the Liberty the previous night with instructions to withdraw to a distance of one hundred miles from the Egyptian and Israeli coasts.In short this is a film that only matches the venemous lies of anti-Semitic, anti-Israel websites which preach hatred."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful!","review":"I've ordered a few of these ata133 drives from amazon in the past few months.

Since most games such as FIFA 2001, etc will allow CPU control of both teams, I assumed this would be the case with the former. Had I known this was not true, I would never have purchased the game to begin with. The graphics quality, which is a poor second to FIFA 2001, I could have tolerated but, not the inability to chose the way in which I control the game. I gave it a one star rating, but, in all honesty I feel it deserves a 0. I find the price of the game to be only attractive thing about it.

Five months after purchasing it the self propelled part quit working, the repairman replaced the part, but the self propelled still didn't work, then Dirt Devil decided to replace the entire vacuum. After returning home with the new vacuum, I vacuumed 3 average sized rooms and it was used less then one hour and the self propelled part broke on this one too.

Out of the box it worked fine, but less than a week later, it often gets stuck, which is really irritating when you set it up before going to sleep, only to wake up in a sweat to find that the fan has gotten stuck blowing air against the wall.As a stationery fan, it works fine, but I didn't buy an oscillating fan because I wanted a stationery fan.

That didn't seem so bad, so I screwed the piece back in. I enjoyed the fan for a while - it moves a huge amount of air for such a small fan, but even on the lowest setting, this fan makes more noise than most box fans.After a month of regular use, the base stopped oscillating, and when I turned off the fan and picked it up, I heard something rattling around inside. I figured that another screw had come loose, but when I opened up the base, I found out that the screw connecting the oscillating motor to the base had snapped, leaving the shaft of the screw stuck in the rotating portion of the motor. Anyway, I now have a noisy, non-oscillating fan (that admittedly moves a lot of air)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"The size isn't mentioned and was disappointed to discover it is only a 9\\" fan, on a 12\\" base.

There isn't much difference between the three speeds, Extremely fast, Very fast, and Fast.Speed switch on top, when adjusting speed the fan moves changing angle, must use both hands, one to steady fan position and the other to adjust speed.Switch should be on base.Base should have rubber feet, to prevent movement or sliding during adjustments.Would not purchase again or recommend to others.Needed a fan right-a-way, out-of-season and made a poor choice.When summer stock arrives at local stores I will replace this fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so happy with this quiet fan - at first.

Now let me tell you what I really think....Its way too loud!! I think the slow speed should have actually been the medium or fast speed. I was hoping for more of a whisper hum on the lowest speed, like most fans. But I think this one is trying to compensate for its small size by increasing the rpm's. Even in the hallway or our 2nd story, I can hear it all the way downstairs, through the living room, and into the dining room. Granted, we have hardwood floors, but that should give you an idea of what to expect.They really need to make this fan with a speed at least half as fast as its lowest current setting.

It's a good fan to have on hot days, but when extreme heat hits, you may need an extra fan to help cool a room down...that or just have it in your face blowing the air directly.The design is good looking, however.

After replacing the belt, it still did not vacuum right and was twice as loud. The replaced belt broke and it was replaced. Then the brush attachment melted in several places. This manufactorer says there is a 3 year warrenty on parts, I am waiting to see if they will honor that or not. I will not buy replacement parts that may or may not work for any length of time. I'll sooner throw the entire vacuum in the trash and buy another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Respiratory problems ? BEWARE!","review":"Has great suction (will eat heavy scatter rugs!)and turbo tool is great for upholstery. In spite of \\"self propelled\\" feature, still somewhat clumsy. HEPA filter located inside collection bin is a nightmare!! Regular maintenance says must be cleaned after every use by removing, tapping inside garbage can. Dirt, dust, pet hair...everything so marvelously sucked into collection bin, now goes flying back out of filter into air, on floor, all over inside and outside of garbage bag, and up your nose! And the hepa filter (which cannot be brushed) is STILL full of dirt. I used the hose to suck dirt, dust and hair from filter into collection bin, but this whole process rather defeats the purpose. I have asthma and had very bad reaction. Better to use w/o filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again Dirt Devil","review":"I've had my vacuum for a few years now only b/c I'm too lazy to buy another one. However, I am at the end of my rope. From Day 1 of having this vacuum the belt broke frequently -- and most of the time I was vacuuming on hardwood. If I accidentally ran over a cat toy or piece of string or anything bigger than a crumb, the belt broke. I took to buying lots of extra belts whenever I went to the store. The other day - surprise - the belt broke for no apparent reason. I promptly replaced it and it broke again the minute I turned the vacuum on. I say: NO MORE. I am now determined to buy the best vacuum EVER. I don't care how much it costs!! The only nice thing about this vacuum is the ability to use to the hose/attachments without having to flip a switch; and it is pretty powerful. But that's it. Changing the cannister can be messy and like a few other reviewers, I frequently run over the cord. Something just wasn't designed right there... You've been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away from This Product","review":"Belt broke within 2 uses, couldn't find a replacement for about 2 weeks as nobody carried them or were sold out. Hoses didn't stay attached, kept slipping off their connection points, eventually the \\"locking\\" system broke, had to use tape to keep it connected. upholestry attachment didn't work as well I had hoped and finally the back wheel just fell off one day and the plastic casing around it had cracked so... bought a Bissell! I agree that the filter being in with the debris is counter productive - it did clean well, picked up hair & stuff, but when I used the Bissell Clearview - I saw what 12 amps could really do - it picked up much more dirt. I usually went outside to clean the filter. I also am having problems with the Dirt Devil Dust Buster and will never buy a Dirt Devil Brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I wasted my money on this piece of junk","review":"Please do not waste your money on this vacuum! I replaced an old Hoover upright (1986) with this dirt devil and regret it everytime I have to vacuum. It did work fine the first few months and now it just spits the dirt right back out onto the floor, barely any suction. We have no indoor pets or small children messes to deal with either. We have replaced belts, filters, rollerbrush and it still won't function properly. The cord is too long, the hose and attachments do not stay connected. Thank goodness I have mainly hardwoord floors and can sweep because this vacuum is headed for the dump. The manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves for evening putting this on the market. I will definitely go back to Hoover and soon. My 1986 model actually still worked fine, so old that it had no headlight or on board tools, that's why I bought a new one. Lesson learned. If you insist on buying a Dirt Devil Vision Turbo, email me and I'll GIVE you mine!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Vacuum!","review":"This vacuum is the worst appliance I have ever bought. Every time I use it I keep thinking it must have been a design error and still may contact Dirt Devil to see if there is a recall or something on it. I have been surprised as Dirt Devil usually is known for making good products. It does not pick up anything - not on bare floors, hardwood floors, and especially any type of carpet. I end up picking up crumbs and debris off the carpet by hand after I have used it. The hose disconnects often blowing junk all over what you just vacuumed. The tools are ridiculous! The \\"power\\" hand tool has no power at all and the rotator stops as soon as you put it down on any surface. Even the cord holder is badly designed and doesn't keep the cord attached to the vacuum. $80 wasted! I just bought an Electrolux Ergorapido stick vac and it works better than this \\"power\\" vacuum. Do not buy this vacuum and tell your friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?!","review":"I bought this vaccum a few years ago and can lie to say the first year was great. The second year I had to replace the belt twice, filter 3 times and consistanly had a problem with it getting clogged. I have a fairly clean house, no kids, no pets just me and my spouse. No excuses. This vaccum sucks, and not in a good way!!!! I should have invested in something more reliable, uieter, and a much better sucking power......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!","review":"DO NOT waste you money on this machine. I was also impressed the first few times I used it, but I am now constantly having to change the belts or take it apart to unclog it. Not only that, but the handle comes off at random times, which makes it hard to vaccuum when you are in a rush. Right now, I am expecting dinner guests, but I am so disgusted at having to stop to repair this machine AGAIN, that I am taking the time to warn other consumers not to spend your hard on cash on this thing.Because of this machine, I will never buy a dirt devil- of any kind- again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst vacuum ever","review":"I bought this vacuum a little over a year ago, and at first absolutely loved it. It was loud, but it seemed to do a great job of cleaning the carpets. I was so excited. Within a couple of weeks, something broke on it. I went back to the store and they replaced it. In the last year, I have had to replace this vacuum four times. I finally gave up and am buying a Dyson. I definately do not recommend this vacuum to anyone, unless you enjoy getting a new one every couple of months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will never buy another Dirt Devil","review":"I've learned my lesson, this is my 3rd Dirt Devil and I will never buy another. The only thing I like about this vacuum is the turbo attachment. Otherwise, it is heavy to push, loud, and the hose continuously comes out during vacuuming. I even had to remove the \\"kick stand\\" from underneath because it kept popping up keeping me from pushing the vacuum. And as with all upright Dirt Devils, the cord comes out from the bottom causing it to be run over and eventually chewed up. If they would just have it come out from the top of the vacuum so that you didn't have to worry about holding on to it, it wouldn't be a problem. This will be my last Dirt Devil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great at first, now it's garbage after one year.","review":"We bought this a year ago, and I was happy with it at first. It picked up dirt well, and also worked on a multitude of surfaces (carpet, linoleum, area rugs). There was no way to turn off the brush for bare floors, so it had a tendency to shoot the dirt out of the back when you used it.The next thing we noticed was the HEPA filter needed to be replaced much sooner than expected, and those things are pricey. It was also a messy chore to empty the dirt container, forget doing that in the house! It took a trip outside to bang the filter on the sidewalk to get all the dirt out.Finally, after one year of regular use, our Dirt Devil was done. It started tripping the circuit breaker every time we used it. We had it looked at, but now it's in the trash. I won't be buying another Dirt Devil."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"After about a year the belt locked up the roller brush and melted to the roller brush. I had to replace the entire vacuum. Dirt Devil customer service is not very helpful. Over the years I have owned three Dirt Devils and none of them make it longer than one year. Buy another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud but Still Good","review":"I have owned this vac for about 6 months now. I agree that it is louder than most, but if you can get past that it's truly a good purchase for the price. If you have area rugs, the caster wheels tend to hang up on the edge of the rugs; but it's not a huge deal. It does have excellent suction and is great on dog hair. The turbo brush attachment is fabulous! Why didn't someone think of this sooner?UPDATE!- 9-21-20005-Well it was good while it lasted...only about a year. We noticed it was losing A LOT of suction and gave it a really good cleaning, but it wasn't enough. We finally bit the bullet and bought a new one, but we didn't get another Dirt Devil; we've had two in the last 2 and a half years and wanted something different, that might last a little longer than a year so we bought a Hoover that looks like the Dyson vacuums. No more Dirt Devils for us I'm afaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum","review":"Before I purchased this vacuum, I read the reviews for it - and noticed that everyone said it was too loud... what the heck do you think a vacuum is supposed to sound like?Anyway, I have used the Dirt Devil Brand for years and the reason why I bought a new one is because I gave mine away to a friend who needed it.This is a good vacuum and works excellent on low pile carpets and great on upholstery with its brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome despite noise","review":"HEPA filters don't really matter to me, I just replace every so often when they say. What matters to me with a child, and my apartment also getting tons of traffic as the leasing office for the complex is the suction. WHICH THIS ONE HAS TONS OF!I had thought my carpet was stained which was just perplexing to me, but no my old vacuum just sucked, or rather didn't. I practically filled the can vacuuming my two bedroom apartment. I felt so relieved. It's price is rather good too for just how well it works. I am in LOVE with this vacuum. It sucked up a paperclip (before I notiecd it) without so much as a grumble. I feel like my apartment is 300 times more clean now and am super satisifed.It's a bit louder than my old vacuum but it's a very fair trade off for such power."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't suck; it blows","review":"I bought this vacuum less than a year ago, and use it weekly or bi-weekly on a small two-bedroom apartment with cats. It was very loud, so much that it scares the dickens out of the cats, but it worked well until three months ago.That's when its suction was working less and less. I kept thinking, \\"Wow, I have to vacuum more often, maybe the cats are shedding,\\" or \\"I can't believe how dirty we've been lately.\\" As it turns out, the vacuum wasn't really picking up items so much as it was either redistributing them around the carpet, or collecting them in the nozzle. As soon as I'd turn it off to store it, things came out all over the place.I'm frustrated to have to buy yet another vacuum in less than a year's time. No more Dirt Devils for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"After listening to \\"Upon my wicked son\\" this is disapointing","review":"As an avid Wall of Voodoo (WOV) fan I had high hopes with regards to Andy Prieboy's work.

While the CD player was great, the installation easy, and the controls easy to understand; the radio reception was laughable. They tell you that the power cord serves as the antenna, so:1) Extend the power cord fully, BUT2) Don't plug into an extension cord, AND3) Don't run the cord behind a refrigerator AND4) Don't run the cord near flourescent lights AND5) There is no connection for an external antenna.So, just for the heck of it, I thought I would uninstall the radio and move it around the kitchen until we could get our local traffic and weather station. Too bad, the radio would have to be installed in the middle of the kitchen hanging in mid-air. Back to the drawing board!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Reception Ever","review":"I would have given this radio zero stars except that was not a choice. I, like the other reviewer, thinks this is the worst radio you could possibly buy. Every feature on the radio works great except the radio itself, which by the way is the main feature I bought it for. I even called Sony customer service, but all they said was to return it if dissatified. If there was at least an option to add an external antenna, that might help, but there is not, and no way to even hook one up if you had one. Please don't waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reception Is A Deal Breaker","review":"My contractor who rebuilt my kitchen recommended this under-counter radio for its appearance and \\"space-saving\\" appeal, but without a telescopic antenna or even a pig tail (I assume the power chord is the feeble \\"antenna\\") in the back the radio is essentially worthless. The CD works fine but since this comes with a radio feature it has to be dismissed. For your kitchen, I recommend the sleek, attractive Tivoli Songbook, which comes in several colors.

Spalding's \`Street' basketball ranks pretty high in those key departments. You get a nice firm grip, the durability of the pebbled finish seems to be pretty good, and you get a nice bounce on various types of hardcourts. The grip may not be as good as Spalding's NBA \`Legacy' ball, but it is very close. Like many outdoor type balls, it may feel a little heavy on an indoor court. It's reasonably priced, so if you need an outdoor ball, you really can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Rubber Basketball for Outdoor Play","review":"Ball is well constructed and comes well packaged.

I prefer the leather ball's soft feel.Edited after 3 months of playing with it. It is a great street ball. It forces you to be more precise with your shots with the grip. I hope the grip will still be same after 3 more months.

Of course, Spalding is the official sponsor of the NBA, so the size, material, and performance is exactly what the doctor recommended!

It must be a bad batch of faulty valves but we're going for a more expensive and hopefully better ball this time. They were great in replacing the first ball we have that leaked air every day. However, the 2nd ball leaked air rapidly as well. In less than a week, my son has to have the ball pumped five times. We tried everything, pumped it up a bit more thinking the increased air pressure would close the valve a bit more, storing it in the kitchen where it's warmer reading how cold air affects the pressure e.g. No dice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spalding Street","review":"I purchased this item for my husband's birthday. He is a moderate player in his late 20's and it fit him well. His hands are a bit rougher than most, so the texture didn't bother him. The size of the ball was perfect for his handling. He plays outdoor basketball at least 2-3 times a week and he enjoys it. We did notice that the ball goes flat after a while, so I just bought an air pump to keep it sufficient for use. Overall, the ball is of good quality and I would reccomend this product to anyone who loves to play ball, but I would also reccomend getting an air pump for long term use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Grip!","review":"I bought this basketball for my boys.

There is no excitement. No development or change. It is just the same progressions repeated and repeated- all drearily plodding along in a haze of smoke. and, some of the most rediculous lyrics ever. \\"Lost my self in a starry storm/had to find my way out\\" always gets me to chuckle. This is an prime example of a competent bar-band having too much drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Better","review":"Early UFO really is hard to listen to and for the die-hard collector who must have everything they produced. Thank goodness they changed with the times and with the advent of Schenker and the \\"Phenomenon\\" album in 1974 ventured into heavy rock proper. This release is the same \\"space rock\\" style as UFO1 but not much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Formative Years","review":"Usually early material from most groups is pretty vital and fresh, but please, forget this. There is little in the way of songs, just excuses for long drawn out guitar solos. Leave this one be! It's a jam band type record made by players with little instrumental prowess; like 15 year olds that are figuring out how to play blues. UFO was nothing until Michael Schenker joined the group and they made a series of important albums in the euro-metal genre.Start your collection with Phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indeed It's Hard","review":"This, The Who's final studio album, is I think the weakest of all their albums. Some people blame Kenney Jones for this. I'm going to go out on a limb and say if Keith Moon was still alive, THE ALBUM WOULD NOT BE ANY BETTER! The problem stems from the songwriting aspect rather than the performance.Although \\"Athena\\" was the hit of the album, in my mind the only decent song is \\"Eminence Front\\" maybe because it doesn't try to sound like other Who songs before it.The other songs are not bad but they are mediocre, probably because Peter Townshend's heart wasn't in it.The four bonus cuts are from the final show of their 1982 tour. It sounds like they're glad it's their final show.For completests only."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suprisingly Good Album!","review":"The Who's final album, It's Hard, is a very good album. I don't see why would criticize this album. There are a fair amount of good songs on the album. \\"Athena\\" starts off the album. This song is a catchy little song, with the backing vocals of \\"just a girl.\\" \\"It's Your Turn\\" is a good John Entwistle written song. \\"Cooks County\\" is based on a hospital in Chicago called Cook County Hospital. The title track is very good. \\"Dangerous\\" is probably the best John Entwistle song off the album, with its good bassline and great keyboards. \\"Eminence Front\\" is my favorite track off the album. With the best synthesizer introduction since \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", it is a Who classic. \\"I've Known No War\\" is a great protest song about war. The live tracks are excellent. This ends my review of The Who's last studio album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album simply sucks.","review":"I would have rathered the Who depart gracefully than to release this turd and taint their legacy. The mix, the songs, the lyrics, the groove, the riffs on this album sucks. It was an 80's infused Who attempt that failed bad at least for me, I tossed this out about two minuites after finishing the final song."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Definitive Version?","review":"The limited edition import is part of a 12 CD Who series issued by Polydor in Japan (POCP-9208). As with the rest of the series, this release reproduces the orignal LP artwork in a miniture cardboard cover/inner sleeve. It also includes a lyric booklet and a section from a Who discography. The CD itself is the Polydor/MCA re-master, with extra tracks, originally released in Jun 97.Despite the loss of Keith Moon, and the developing rift among the remaining band members, It's Hard has some excellent songs in Eminence Front, I've Know No War, and Cry If You Want. Critically, it will never get support from old time Who fans, but it deserves a fresh listen now and then.The domestic 97 re-master is fine for casual fans; the limited edition import is a must for those who want the complete set of the Japenese series."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the Best went into Empty Glass and Chinese Eyes","review":"That about sums it up. Those 2 solo albums have 10-12 GREAT songs from over a 3 year period of Townshend inebriation. What were the odds that anything decent would end up on Face Dances and It's Hard? You have to love these 2 WHO albums for what they are. If you saw the tour as I did, these songs all have special meaning. Less than a few good songs here, but generally, I can listen to this album without barfing, mostly for the nostalgia element.The years have been kind to this record I suppose. 26 Years, wow thats a lifetime. Seems not that long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average CD","review":"This album is about what you'd expect from a professional and accomplished rock band...which is why it disappoints, because the Who used to be so much more than that. Its a shame Townshend started his solo career while the Who were still recording since this resulted in sub-Who-standard albums like this one. Nevertheless, Daltrey's voice remains incredible and the album still contains a few nuggets like the Title track and especially Athena which is on a par with 'You Better You Bet' as the Who's best song since Moon died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I pulled this one from the bottom of my CD pile, dusted it off and plugged in. You know what? There isn't a bad song on this album. When I listen, I find myself wishing that The Who had continued on. Sure, it lacks the raging drums of Keith Moon, but the songwriting and arrangements are superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Finale","review":"This CD is very very good... much better than many people probably expect. I believe it was a great finale CD for The Who. After loosing Keith Moon to anti-alcoholism pills in 1979, The Who chose Kenny Jones as a replacement drummer, and they recorded and released \\"Face Dances.\\" This is a decent CD, but it isn't too great... it's mostly synth ballads written by Townshend. Then, Townshend released two solo albums... Empty Glass and All the Best Cowboys have Chinese Eyes. Empty Glass is a phenominal CD... I highly recommend it. Chinese Eyes is decent, but overall not amazing. And then, The Who come back and release this... their last CD. This CD is very good... with alot of rockin' songs, and overall just a good record. I recommend this to any Who fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hard not to like Pete's songs","review":"Another good set of songs from Pete and again semi-autobiographical. It's amazing to think it was their last album until 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic album, their last might have been their best","review":"This is an excellent album, top to bottom. The popular songs, Athena, It's Hard, and Eminence Front got their share of air play 'in the day' but the rest of the album is sound as well. Lyrically and musically I think this was The Who's most complete album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"Most of the songs were pretty good, but the album overall was pretty quiet. I had to torun the volume pretty high to hear it. The title track was a disappointment, because live they do it so well, but on the album it doesn't have any emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable swan song.","review":"This was not a fitting ending to the career of a brilliant band. Two worthwhile cuts here, the decent Athena and the terrific Emminence Front. The rest of 'em are rubbish. Townshend was, for the most part, disinterested in the Who by this time. Clearly his better compositional efforts were steered toward his solo records of the time. Save your money and skip this one and the almost as miserable Face Dances. Go to Who's Next, Quadrophenia, and The Who By Numbers for the Who at their best. Where Who Are You is not quite up to that standard it is also a solid effort...Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Rate","review":"Definitely a sub par effort by the Who on their final all original studio recording. Whereas the synthesizer abuse from Face Dances is somewhat curtailed on It's Hard, the songs themselves are terribly overblown and noisy with a severe shortage of captivating moments. Cooks County, Cry If You Want To, and One At A Time are especially excruciating. The single Athena is quite subpar due to its pedestrian lyrics and annoying drumming. It's Hard is a redundant mess.As for positives there surely isn't much. Eminence Front is an excellent tune with an excellent opening guitar solo and creative synthesizer effects. One Life Is Enough is a nice mood piece and Dangerous is fairly catchy. The rest isn't bad but certainly not overly memorable.For completists and die hard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked","review":"This product leaked the first time I used it. I am sending back.

Shame, shame, shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris By Night","review":"Brassai was probably more responsible than most for generating the noir genre associated with Paris but that, I think, was a function of his equipment. The deserted streets could be a factor of the five minute exposure while the close up shots of the street workers, of all occupations would have been necessary because of the lack of electronic flash. When looking at his pictures, we must be careful to pass them back through the filter of his time. BUT, that same filter has given us some beautifully composed images. There are no accidents.

What I saw was passion, and a love that was always hidden. It reminded me of the older Rosemary Rodgers type of books, I had loved when I was younger. With the man taking forever to see his heart....instead of the independent woman, clinging to her Independence, which I have to say, I am growing sick of.I LOVED LOVED LOVED this book, read it in one weekend, and thought it was profoundly romantic to the very end..and even shed a few tears. *sniff*I salute you Samantha James, very fine read indeed. A keeper for my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"This book is utter trash. The characters are one-dimensional at best. The author attempts to show emotion through adjectives. The characters are neither interesting nor lovable. Gabriel is forever threatening rape and generally doing mean and hurtful things to Cassie. The period is not believable, and neither is the romance. I bought this book based on the other reviews and wish I'd saved my pennies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else!","review":"Normally, I like Samantha James' books. The \\"Perfect\\" series (Perfect Bride, Perfect Groom, Perfect Hero) was fun. This, however, is... well, let's just say that the \\"hero\\" of this book rapes his wife, repeatedly, yet she loooooves him and somehow convinces herself that he's really a good man, way down deep inside (way, way, WAY down), despite the fact that he treats her with contempt consistently and did I mention RAPES her? Ugh. The one thing I did enjoy about this book was confirming that my psyche isn't warped enough to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!","review":"In this book Gabriel is NOT a hero he is always very rude, mean adn cruel to the heroine. He basically raped her in the first love scene (if you could even call it a love scene!) Then when the she gets pregnant he yells at her for it and acts like it's all her fault! So this book was just Gabriel being rude to his wife then apologizing for it. I liked the heroine though. But I cannot see how she ever fell in love with him?! I usually love Samantha James's books but I wanted to throw this book out a window! Then at the end it just kind of cuts off with \\"I love you\\" which I didn't really like. I do not recommend this book. Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable Reading","review":"While the author can write a great story and shows much talent in that area, I was taken back by the many 'love scenes' that were nothing more than rape.

Hoping to push past what is perceived to be the limits of improvement, this future society sends two young men, Geaza and Bisso, back to the 21st century to catalyze a leap in evolution. All they have to do is go about normal lives, as the catalyst exudes from their bodies.In this concluding volume, Oscar returns to make amends for the damage he wrought on Geaza and Bisso's circle of friends, but it will not be easy to repair the uncertainty that now plagues the pair about not only the validity of their mission, but each other's commitment to it.Every bit as good as the first book, this conclusion is heart-wrenching and true.

The cinematography is hazy and the Spanish dialogue is out of synch (obvious to anyone, even those who don't know Spanish), as are the subtitles, which often makes the film confusing.

Although the material was better, it was too small. My son is big but not huge. He is a little above average in size. He isn't overweight but his little legs are too thick to comfortably fit in the carrier, especially when wearing jeans or layered clothing.I'm sure the carrier is a good one.

The performance by Dame Judi Dench is breathtakingly brilliant as the famous novelist and philosopher, Dame Iris Murdoch. The story encompasses her youth as a student at Oxford, her many love affairs and her terrible descent into dementia. As I saw Judi Dench gradually change from a brilliant woman into a screaming, flailing madwoman, her portrayal was enough to reduce me to tears as it was so accurately done and even the flatness of her eyes and lack of expression were perfect. Anyone who has been part of the life of a sufferer from Alzheimer's should be aware that this DVD will stir up bad memories at the physical and mental depiction of the sufferer and will recall all of the horrors.

A lot of the time the pictures came out blurry when the timer was used. But the worse part was the battery life. At first it was okay, but after a few uses it would run out the battery as quickly as I put them in. At first I thought they must've been bad batteries, but it kept happening after putting in brand new batteries three times! I'd put the new batteries in and five minutes later it would say low battery and then it'd shut down. I'm very disappointed with this Sony product. Unfortunately, I purchased it in the store and will get charged a re-stocking fee, but I'd rather have a camera that works, so back it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another brand!","review":"I had purchased the Sony at a local Target and at first was pleased.

I thought this was especially disappointing on Mandy and Could it Be Magic. Could it Be Magic was also hacked by a minute and a half, so if you're looking for the full version you'll be disappointed.

Keep in mind that the Nazi's quasi-scientific thesis was that some human races are genetically inferior to others, and therefore the \\"superior\\" races have to assume responsibility for the advancement of humanity. The thesis of \\"Demonic Males\\" is that males are genetically predisposed to \\"evil\\" and therefore inferior to females, who therefore must be given \\"equal\\" (actually, superior) status so they can lead human civilization down the flower-strewn path to Peace, Love and True Happiness.

Why do female gorillas stay close to their reigning silverback? Because only he can protect their babies from being killed by other silverbacks. Why do adolescent male chimpanzees intimidate every female in their group? So the youngersters will not be refused when it comes time for sex. Why do bonobos, physically similar to chimpanzees, behave in a much less violent manner? Because they evolved in a place where there were no gorillas to preempt an important food source. There are two kinds of male orang-utans, small ones that must rape to reproduce and large one that have no such need. These, and other insights, are carefully reasoned from the most recent field data. Perhaps not all of his explanations of ape behavior will stand the test of time but each of them is interesting and worth further research.

While it is labelled as fiction, the very real feel of the story and the tender age of Madison, the heroine, creates a read that is gripping and suspenseful. The challenges she faces are all the more disturbing for the seemingly innocent surroundings. Not a imaginary landscape of a dark forest or creepy environs, but an average neighborhood from Anywhere, USA. That evil forces could exist just a few doors down is a concept that cannot but give one pause. The heroine cannot rely on adults to help, because they cannot understand or see what is happening. Because innocents can see and experience what adults cannot, it is for them alone to deal with what threatens them. It is this heroic young girl's choice to stand up to evil rather to be victimized and terrorized by it.

I like the concept of team members with a different array of skills and equipment, with the spy and the sniper being personal favorites. (Although the need to limit the sniper's ammunition is understandable from a play-balancing perspective it seems very unrealistic to suggest that a soldier could only carry five bullets.) The team roles however add to the frustration, since the death of any member will cause you to fail a mission. Your team members seem to die distressingly early and often, so one may feel obligated to save accordingly. This merely compounds the difficulty and frustration of the later missions. I soon realized that this game just wasn't fun anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with WINDOWS XP","review":"The Game is good I have played before but the installable in this CD will not work any version of windows other than 95 and 98.

The solos are, ALL OF THEM, ludicrous, noisy, useless. It's a miracle this guy got the gig in Iron Maiden.The Skunkworks show is so badly edited, with MTV-style cuts from second to second, that you cannot watch it properly.The show in Brazil is a bootleg, for Heaven's sake!!

The video is below average at best. While this isn't a hidden feature (it's been described a number of places, including the booklet with the DVD), the major disappointment is the sound quality. First of all, it's only provided in dolby digital stereo - no surround sound. Secondly, the live performances sound remarkably flat.

Although the book did touch on the aforementioned themes to a certain degree, I felt that its central focus was steeped in some of the most prosaic, banal details of Villasenor's childhood. The author's writing has a way of making the most tragic experiences of Villasenor's life seem incidental. The majority of children have stories about growing up but I am not sure that they are all noteworthy enough to be chronicled in a memoir. Likewise, I think that Villasenora could have broadened his work's appeal if he would have omitted several lackluster childhood experiences. I started the book with an open mind and with each page I hoped that it would get better. Regrettably, the book did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"No apparent English version.","review":"I ordered this book thinking that it was written in English as are many of Villasenor's books.

This is opera at its glorious best!If you want to see and hear how exciting opera can be, buy this disc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The center does not hold\\"","review":"Kariti Mattila is indeed stunning as Amelia Grimaldi. La Scola's bumbling, eager, and erratic Gabriel is thoroughly appropriate for the operatic character (and for the historical one as well). Jacopo Fiesco and Paolo Albiani are both well-played. But Paolo, a mere henchman, dwarfs Carlo Guelfi's Simon. Simon Boccanegra, in the opera as in history, was a forceful and decisive leader. Guelfi's failing voice and hesitant acting reduce the central character to a bewildered and tired old man. The costumes are dull and historically inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abbado and Mattila can't save this production","review":"I have to respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer. I agree that Abbado gives the score of Boccanegra a bit of oomph, something it needs for it to 'sell.' But the principals, excepting Karita Mattila, and the production are bush-league. At times I thought I was watching silent moving acting, or members of the football team acting the annual school play. And the singing is merely serviceable. That includes all the male principals. When Mattila as Amelia appears, though, the stage lights up. That, unfortunately, is not enough to save the whole enterprise. Now, if we could just get Mattila on DVD as Salome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not complete","review":"I read this book in the context of developing a CAD-program, using similar 3D-techniques as used in games. I've enjoyed the more mature C++-level then the usual C++ introductory books.I bought it especially for the plug-ins chapter, which is a workable approach (although the example is Win32-specific.The book tackles a few different subjects that are hard to find elsewhere and that have been very usefull for me. This is not an introductory course and I couldn't have read it last year (although I wish I had known some of these approaches earlier on).It handles the topics in short and understandable examples, which makes it not a full-project approach, but more of a \\"good practices\\"-approach.What it lacks is some more detail and some more elaborated examples, but I guess it found a good balance to usable technical approaches and readability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tips for Aspiring Game Developers","review":"I was pleased to find a book that deals specifically with programming games using C++. This is not a book that teaches you how to program an API such as DirectX; it's a book covering data structures and algorithms useful in game development. An intermediate to an advanced programmer may already know a lot of these techniques, but they are presented in the context of game development. Game programming presents many unique challenges of which this book covers fairly well. I like the book because it was written by a person with real experience developing commercial game engines. I do have one complaint though. Don't expect to find all of the source code mentioned in the book on the accompanying CD-ROM. Small code segments seem to be missing. Nonetheless, I did find several chapters that were well worth the read. Also, if you are rusty with polymorphism and inheritance, the book provides a fairly good review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Games aren't just about graphics","review":"I disagree with the other reviewer who stated \\"games programming usually implies a treatment of graphical algorithms\\". Games involve so much more than just graphics, and I wasn't at all suprised at the content of the book. It does go into performance-related issues with templates, exceptions, etc. and is a helpful book for new game programmers. I think too many game programmers focus on graphics... pick up this book and polish up your C++ first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much useless information","review":"If you are using this as a study guide, go elsewhere.

The author even states at one point, \\"you might be asking why you need to know this\\". I agree that knowledge is power but save the extra 400 pages for another book about proxy.

I guess Microsoft feels if you compliment them in a book, they will endorse it. This book is disorganized, redundant and must finish each paragraph with \\"This topic will be covered in greater detail later in this book\\". The answers in the back of the book are often wrong and the book contradicts itself. No wonder people often rely on braindumps to get through. It would be nice to just purchase one book that covered everything and would get you through. On top of this book, I now have to pay for another exam and another book. I am very dissapointed in Sybex for producing such an aweful product and Microsoft for allowing them to say that it's a Microsoft Certified Professional Approved Study guide. I will think twice before before buying something because it has that label on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down for Sybex","review":"I have read 5 other Sybex books and passed 5 microsoft exams, but Sybex's Proxy Server guide is a big let down compared to the others.

There are numerous typographical errors, along with redundant references to the same topic. I would not recommend this book to my enemies.

Not Structured","review":"On the moment of starting this book I was not impressed. Out of all the Sybex books that I have read this is absolutely the worst. There are 2 chapters that are identical to the TCP/IP book.There is one and only one good feature of the book and that it the review questions. There were about ten (10) questions that were identical to the Microsoft Exam.My recommendation is to look for another book as I found it very confusing and disorienting. I ended up skipping pages and chapters as I got bored and fed up with it. I was very lucky to pass the final exam.If you want a good book to read, read the TCP/IP book from Sybex (even though it has nothing to do with proxy server). Very well done. It has humorous lines to keep you interested. Something that Proxy Server 2 lacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Exam preparation","review":"I am an MCT, MCSE, MCP+I and have found this to be one of the most understanding and thorough books for a Microsoft product. It has some errors but not any more than you find in most of the new books hitting the shelves. I am reading two other Proxy books and have yet to be as impressed as I was with this book. I will be recommending this as a reference book in the classroom.With respect to the exam - I am reviewing a beta version of the Transcender Proxy 2.0 exam (they are known to be harder than the real exams) and this book sets a person on the right track. The only complaint I have is the poor section on subnetting - though this is not meant to be a TCP/IP study guide. (Prerequisite knowledge for the Microsoft Proxy course is IIS and TCP/IP.)Certainly worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finaly a proxy book worth reading!","review":"I must have spent half a day in the book store before finally choosing this one.

What a disappointment. I had to re-read several chapters, because things aren't always placed into a logical order. A fitting description for the text in this book would be \\"dry\\". It just isn't interesting to read. By the time I was done with this book, I really couldn't visualize what I would be tested on, because the authors focus overly much on irrelevant material, and fail to point out the important information. I passed the exam, but I think it was due mostly to familiarity with the product and the more focused Exam Cram than to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but wordy","review":"I thought the material was quite good but for someone who was trying to blast throught the MCSE tests, a lot of wordy material gets in the way.

Still would recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Sybex book I've ever encountered","review":"I purchased this book based on the reviews.... The book wasnot easy to follow and the author spent more time telling you that thetopics would be covered in a later chapter - Never mind the fact thatthe topics were never thouroughly explained. I feel that this bookwas very diorganzied and did not present the material in such a wayfor individuals to understand it.

But not because it wasn't good, because it wasn't metal.Spitfire Records re-released this disc in '99 with 3 bonus tracks and I'm glad they did. It's purely an acoustic or \\"slightly amped\\" affair. Rumor has it that Wylde had so much energy, that after a hard-driving show with Ozzy or Pride & Glory, he'd find a nearby pub/bar/club, hop up on a bar-stool and crank out these type of songs on his acoustic guitar.

Every other album they've done will always be held up against that effort. \\"Shetler\\" is a very good cd with some excellent grooves and definitly holds a place in any BNH collection. Vocalist Seidah Garrett is a wonderful talent and can sing well. Her sound is very R&B and you wonder if she had ever heard Acid Jazz like BNH before she was asked to add her voice to the group. As much as I love N'Dea's voice over Seidah's for the BNH sound, I can't take much away from this album. Get it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must in cd collections!","review":"I own six cds of the Brand New Heavies and I think this is the best cd of their's so far. Their acid jazz style is very smooth and mellow. You will not believe how fast time seems to pass when listning to it. I actually got introduced to acid jazz by listning to BNH back in 97. The cd contains wonderful tunes with their usual style of funk, R&B and jazzy bass lines and drumming. As a bassist, I think their percussions and rythms are quite divine. The album includes the hits \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"You Are The Universe\\". If you are planning to buy one cd of the BNH to check them out, I recommend this cd as it will surely capture your musical ear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I forgot how much I loved this CD until I pulled it up earlier today and listened to it.

Since, Internet technology and distributed computing in general is being accepted in the IT industry. The book starts out covering concepts and issues fundamental to distributed computing and gradually takes the reader through the specific details of Enterprise Java Beans, JTS, CORBA OTS and many other very useful design patterns. Finally, the book concludes with an actual application using Enterprise JavaBeans covering Stateless, Statefull and Entity Beans. The authors did a remarkable job of leaving out the extraneous details while maintaining the completeness and continuity of material covered. I am a \\"Picture Person\\", I found the book to be rich in useful illustrations. I would highly recommend the readings and comprehension of the first two parts, followed by trying out the third and final part of building the application.

I hated Sabrina, which really surprised me because I thought she was going to be likable from the other two books, but no. Ms. Drake retreated into her usual style and the character of Sabrina from No Other Man and Woman became a stupid, shrewish, pouty character who held absolutly no interest for me.I wanted to like Sloan, I really did, but he was so mean to her. I mean, yes, Sabrina was an idiot, but their relationship consisted almost entirley of him forcing her into bed and yelling at her, usually calling her a \\"little fool\\" of some rubbish like that.These characters were so utterly awful that I have no memory of what the rest of the book was about. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth and when I think about the book is a vague feeling of disgust. Don't bother with it- this book is not worth the money or the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Other Series - No More Please!","review":"This is the last in a series from Shannon Drake. It is definitely the weakest in the trio for a variety of reasons. First, the heroine is what I classify as 'too dumb to live'. She makes many bad decisions that put the hero at risk and require him to save her. Second, there are several forced seductions that really didn't do it for me. Finally, the heroine is such a shrew to the hero, I could never understand why he was in love to her. The author needs to work on developing her characters and showing why the grow to love each other instead of focusing on action. It would also help if she created more likeable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the No Other series","review":"I enjoyed No Other Man and No Other Woman more than I did No Other Love.

But she leaves a message for Lew asking him to find her recently pregnant and drug addicted daughter who has disappeared. Lew feels that he has to fulfill this request and gets pulled back into the work that he used to do, like a moth to the flame. This is a New Orleans college professor, missing work to go intimidate thugs and break some faces in the process of finding Laverne's daughter. What really made this story so intriguing was Sallis' ability to pack a lot of meaning into just a few words. None of the words felt unnecessary, and Lew emits such an aura of understanding people that he creates a lot of powerful moments without saying much. I loved this book and have since been seeking out all of Sallis' other Lew Griffin novels. How this series could slip so far under the radar is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humpty-Dumpty Dinnerware","review":"The dinnerware arrived in dozens of pieces!

It tastes like a premium dark chocolate product; you'd never know it was sugar-free.

Yet I decided to buy one.My advice to you is: Discard all negative feed-back and get one. This little monster is ergonomically pleasing, extremely powerful, not on the heavy side (as some reviews say). It will suck the life off anywhere you use it, and its filter is washable. Those, and the fact that it will last a life time (you don't need to ever buy batteries that are more expensive than your vacuum, or keep buying vacuums every couple of years), and that it maintains the tremendous sucking power 100% of the time are all excellent factors."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different viewpoint","review":"After reading the reviews, I expected a lot, and I did not get it. This vacuum is heavy and awkward to hold. The dust cup is really tiny and needs to be emptied very often. What I find most annoying about this vacuum is the FILTER, which gets dirty almost instantly, and it is a very nasty job trying to get the dust and dirt off of the filter in order to restore suction. The accompaning extension is too short and looses suction. I had hoped to use this around the house in places that my standard vacuum would be too bulky for, but the Scorpion will not fill that niche for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"It has a lot of suction, but the wide attachment is a poor design. Hardly any use. I cut off the nylon bristles and it works better, but should have been better designed. Other than that, it works well if you don't mind having to do a 1.5 inch strip at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong/Loud Suction","review":"This little vac is very loud, but has incredible suction! It sucked up things that I didn't even mean to suck up, that I thought were too large...but up it went.

The little clip that holds the flip down nozzle broke off and I have only used the stupid thing once. The broken clip is really what irritates me the most. I attribute the power to the fact that the vacuum is electric but, of course, you have to be close to your power source or use a long extension cord. The dirt cup is very small. Considering how much it can pick up, the use of electric and an extension cord, I think it really isn't worth the financial investment or the trouble. The car wash vacuum or a standard vacuum cleaner would suffice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is little devil's vacuum!","review":"I brought it and plug it to power on... Whoa!

I decided on the Dirt Devil product as I have a vacuum that, while loud, works wonderfully.The Scorpion is a very loud little unit and, it seems to have decent suction provided you aren't using the brush attachment (there is no suction with the brush attachment). Unfortunately, the suction only seems to work with the flat attachment which has a tendency to suction-cup itself into place on floors and walls. If you are vacuuming something like small pieces of catfood, the pieces will eventually go into the unit but, only if you lift the hose above it so gravity lends a hand.My biggest complaint is the wind generated. It blows everything you are trying to clean up all around the room! It defeats the purpose of trying to use it. It is easier to lug out the upright, full size vacuum for cleaning small jobs that to even consider using this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lilliputian NYC pad + minikin stotage + negligible budget = Bitsy Vac","review":"It was living in a teensy apartment that made me buy this thing in the first place. It looked great, had good reviews and a reasonable price so I went ahead and clicked 'BUY NOW'.It worked great, not too noisy, sucked up everything in sight. It wasn't something we used on a regular basis (translate: we didn't vacuum/ clean the house much) but after the 6th month though, it just stopped working.Performance was great while it lasted. Judging by it's value for money, this vac cost me +/- $3.00 per use, so I would say it was a bit unreasonable. As for endurance, well it did up in the dumpster after the 6th month.Great start. Bad ending. Wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible vacuum","review":"I bought this to use as a car vacuum. It has terrible power when you add the accessories.

I returned it right after I tried it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE IT !!!","review":"Let's not be so harsh about this little Dirt Devil, i've seen some 2 stars rating about this product and i think i should add my comment as an owner.It is a small vacuum and intented for small cleaning job. So if you're afraid of cleaning the dirt bag so often, you may need a bigger vacuum for your purpose.I use it to clean my room, vacuum my car and furnitures etc. and it does the job wonderfully. The suction is strong and will amaze you with the result plus the dirt filter is easy to clean and washable.final words: it's loud, it sucks hard, it blows hard, it's awkward to hold but it's a powerful little dirt devil and for the price, i would buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little vacuum","review":"Strong suction, lightweight....would highly recommend for ease of use and power...good, economical buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter clogs up","review":"It has lots of power, but all you get done , is emptying the filter. 5 minites then empty.If you don't, it looses it power.I would not buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful suction, great value for $","review":"This is much more powerful than the cordless Shark I threw out.

Also, for smaller things (as crumbs) I use this vacuum so that I don't need to get out the big one.Attachments are providing additional possibilities - but for my needs I haven't use them (yet).This vacuum is very light so it's easy to carry it around while vacuuming. The power cord is quite long, and that is very convenient.I'm impressed with the strength of this vacuum. It's collecting dust, and hair without any problems.Dirt container is quite small - which is expected of such a small vacuum; good side is that it's easy to clean the dirt container (just empty it in the trash) - it's reusable.I really love it and I recommend it to everyone who is thinking of getting a small powerful vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great choice","review":"I use it to get around those tough to get spots.its cost effective.although wish it came with a couple extra filters"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flip","review":"Works very well for the intended purpose.

I thank God every day for allowing me to see Cindy leading a happy, healthy life with a profession today helping others."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book at all.","review":"This author leaves so many unanswered questions. The cover should have had a picture of Fabio on it, and Barbara Cartland co-author it - the heroine got her man! I have suffered from an eating disorder for almost 20 years, and my therapist recommended it to me. Sure it is comforting to know that there are others who feel the way I do, but just because one suffers from an eating disorder does not automatically mean that one should write a book about it. It certainly didn't give me any insight into my illness, nor did it provide me with any hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book!","review":"I have read numberous books on eating disorders, from clinical manuals to personal accounts - this book is up there with the worst of them. I forced myself to finish reading it because I couldn't believe how bad it was. Poor grammar, and an author who continually cried \\"woah is me\\" was bad enough but for anyone who struggles with an eating disorder this book is very triggering. I understand personal accounts of eating disorders can be triggering, but this was a long, drawn out self-pity waste of time. As a recovering anorexic I felt that this book did not portray the personal struggles of eating disorders accurately at all.I give the author credit for telling her story, as it is a very difficult thing to do. I hesitated to write a review because I did not want to offend the author, but truthfully her editors should have played a more integral role in her book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It truelly moved me...I'm now on the road to recovery!","review":"I was truelly moved by this book. I have battling anorexia nad bulimia and this book made me relize i wasn't alone.It talked about the fears and that it takes until you reach the absolute worst part of life until you want to get better. It also talks about how to overcome this. I was inspired while lying in my hospital bed and now I WANT to get better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat accurate but terribly written","review":"I find myself cringing at her style of writing. She makes it seem like an after school special by confusing hindsight with her actual thoughts at the time. Any firsthand accounts are helpful, but the book often seems contrived and made up. I know her pain all too well, but that doesn't mean that she can write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad one","review":"This book was awful. THe author is a bad writer in general. Also, as you can tell from her scary emaciated grin on the back of the book, she is NOT recovered. This means that she cannot distance herself from her disorders and therefore can't really write about them well. There is a tinge of smugness in her account, like, \\"Look how thin I am, I just CAN'T eat.\\" It's boring and it's about a really lame person...she is incapable of living her life at all. She still lived with her parents for the majority of her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother....","review":"...with this one. I have read many books in an attempt to understand eating disorders, and this one is not worth the time or money. The prose is terribly facile and amaturish, and the 'insights' in the book are so immature that you might think it was written by a ten year old. Although I respect her experience, it's important to note that going through a difficult experience doesn't necessarily qualify you to write about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaaaaaawwwwnnnn.","review":"Yet another book glorifying the silly anorexic...recycling the same tired paradigms of control, perfectionism, and family strife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Skott Freedman, in my opinion is one of the music industry's gems.

The book adequetly voices its opinion, however, it is at times hard to follow. The reader may tend to trial away from the work. Yet, Ayn's ideals are worth attempting to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent work","review":"In particular; Nathaniel Branden's essay \\"The Psychology of Pleasure\\" should be carefully read by male readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful not to step in the hyperbole!","review":"I have attempted to read Ayn Rand but could not get past the obvious flaws. Perhaps you could comment. Does it not seem like an incomplete premise to state that the foundation of ethics is the survival and happiness of the individual? Since when have any primates achieved survival and happiness individually, as if the group were of no consequence? Additionally,where does the industrialist/capitalist derive his right to access natural resources and infrastructure as well as civic services if not from an implicit or explicit negotiation with society.This book seems like an over-reach, or as Christoper Hitchens said,\\"Arrogation\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don&#65533;t subscribe to her point of view.","review":"Ayn Rand delivers a boatload of B.S. If you ever wanted a list of reason's to justify selfish acts. Then this book is for you. Put yourself above your family your friends and your god (unless your god is Ayn Rand). Rand gives you plenty of reason's why you should do what's good for you, regardless of the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Philosophy","review":"I knew that coming in, I would not like this book. It did inform me about the Objectivist philosophy, which I wanted, but this philosophy, in application, reduces man to a mercenary character. The fact that Ms. Rand quotes her own novels in support of her ideas (yes, yes, and to explain the reasoning for the novels as well) causes me to think that little research has been done in supporting her theories. Dr. Branden has some pretty outmoded ideas about where homosexuality, psychopathy and autism come from as well, and they seem to be pulled out of the air in order to support his points.All in all, not, to my mind, a life pattern to follow"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic collection of essays about the human condition","review":"This book is awesome - but I don't recommend it as the first of Ayn Rand's work for one to read. I suggest starting with \\"The Fountain Head\\" and then \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". After reading those two, if you want some practical / real life applications and views on the philosophy elucidated in those two novels, pick this book up. It is a great collection of essays and speaches written by Rand and others. A fast read, great for short trips on the subway or bus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rand's case that sacrificial relationships are unnecessary","review":"Ayn Rand put off more than a few readers by using \\"selfishness\\" in a nonstandard way, but in doing so she undoubtedly made her point dramatically and strikingly. The essays in this book defend Rand's view that human relationships can and should be based on the principle of mutual benefit and that \\"sacrifice\\" is never necessary or proper. This point is simple and essential; yet many readers who failed to grasp it have bashed Rand for saying things she never said. Read this book and find out for yourself what this giant of twentieth-century thought actually meant by rational egoism."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS by Ayn Rand","review":"Magnum Opus managed to get the book, THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS by Ayn Rand, to me in a very timely manner and in perfect condition. In spite of some confusion as to who actually sent the book, as I ordered the same book from two different distributors, it was finally ironed out in a basically satisfactory manner.The other company, CarpePM, had difficulty in that the post office either lost or destroyed the same book. CarpePM immediately credited my account with the $6.59 cost of the book and communicated the transaction to me as soon as they knew what had happened. Unfortunately, I did not see it in a timely manner, got confused as to who did what and wrote to Maghum Opus thinking they had not yet sent the book. There was confusion and some words exchanged. In the long run, however, it appears to have been cleared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Received the Book","review":"Feel free to tell when I'll get my book.I've waited patiently till the date I should have received the book and beyond that date."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAND and philosophy","review":"Simply read it!! The \\"Virtue of Selfishness\\" is a beautiful essential, Rand is an American advocate for freedom like none other. From Soviet Russia and the greatest advocate for FREEDOM since Adam Smith!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer demagoguery","review":"No, nobody ever found the dictionary that Rand used to define \\"selfishness\\" - because it never existed. She didn't redefine it at all; she meant by it exactly what everybody else means by it, and it's not a virtue.All she did in this series of \\"philosophical\\" essays was try to rationalize self-absorption by \\"proving\\" that it wasn't really harmful after all. But she couldn't even accomplish *that* task competently; if it's true, as she argues in the essay another reviewer cites, that there aren't any real conflicts of interest among rational people, then why bother to distinguish \\"selfish\\" from \\"unselfish\\"?No, Rand's \\"ethics\\" is just a thinly disguised rationalization of her own utter inability to care about anyone other than herself. She was exactly like her fictional \\"hero,\\" Howard Roark: other people just weren't *real* to her, except as props for her own vastly overinflated and terminally unhealthy EGO. And this book is supposed to explain why that's okay.It isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayn Rand's \\"The Virtue of Selfishness\\"","review":"This book, just another of the great works of the late Ayn Rand, reflects not the negative 'selfish, or me first attitude', that most people would expect this book to put forth to the reader..Rather, it is a guide for all human beings who love life and others, as they do ( and should) love themselves..I recommend this book for all people who love and appreciate their personal Freedoms, and would be inclined to pass her (Miss Rand) words of wisdom on to others that she would wish well .."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure","review":"I have an emotional connection to this book, and by consequence to Rand, because it is Rand's work that motivated me into becoming a full-fledged libertarian. Rand, in it, offers a wonderful collection of essays, and in particular a theory of individual rights rooted in Aristotlean ethics. Were more people to read this chef d'oeuvre by Ms Rand, they would rid themselves of any ignorance on what she actually advocated (too many \\"critics\\" of Objectivism haven't the faintest idea.) Ms Rand was, in my opinion, too averse to reading and understanding her intellectual opponents and did not succeed in fully developing her system of philosophy, but she nonetheless provided the groundworks for future Objectivists (e.g. David Kelley) to build on. For anyone seriously interested in Ayn Rand and Objectivism, this is where to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Serious Reader and Thinker","review":"This is one of Ms Rand's best non fiction works. It applies her objectivist philosophy to a wide range of practical issues in both publc and private life. This is not light reading--this is pure brain food for the reader in search of humane letters and excellent principles of human relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"In True Ayn Rand Fashion","review":"As with all her writing, she's very aggressive in trying to get her point across. Though this was a good read, I would not say that it was profound, as some of the other reviewers have so asserted.It would serve as a good stepping stone into the field of more contemporary ethics, but in order to really assess her claims and axioms, one must be well learned and read in the enormous literature of classical and contemporary ethical theory--something I am not.I didn't give this a 5 star review because quite frankly I disagreed with her on various points, points where it seems that her reasonings had committed some form of fallacy or other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Who is this muttonhead from Jacksonville who says, \\"The negative reviewers below insist that self-sacrifice is necessary\\"? I just read all of those negative reviews and didn't find a single one advocating \\"self-sacrifice.\\" I did find several who thought (correctly) that Rand had given a bad definition of sacrifice.Do ALL Objectivists lapse into Randy jargon at every hint of criticism? Can ANY of them represent an opposing position accurately?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Ayn Rand fan, not so hot on this book","review":"The format of this book is not what I expected. It is basically a set of essays that don't really present one with much information. If you have read the two major novels - The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged (both five stars) - then much of the ideas are repeated in a less effective manner. THere are sections in both of the novels consisting of 50-100 pages that do a much better job presenting the overall Objectivist philosophy.

And they 'show' it by referring to the work of Ludwig von Mises, so Rand was indeed 'precedented'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Argue?","review":"Some find it strange that, while I am a strong believer in free markets, trade and the \\"Chicago School\\" of economics, I despise Ayn Rand. There are two reason - first, Rand is no philosopher, and second, I am a pragmatist (i.e., I don't see the need for an abstract moral philosophy to justify things).In this book, Rand violates one of the most important philosophical laws: David Hume's statement that \\"No 'is' implies an 'ought.'\\" Just because an organism has a tendency to survive does not mean it has a moral right to.Capitalism has transformed the world and raised the standards of living. This is the true (and pragmatic) virtue of capitalism and self-interest. This virtue rests not on some abstract philosophy, but in the lives of billions of people on this planet.All Rand has done is create a straw-man for the socialists and communists who despise capitalism to attack, for her arguments cannot be logically defended, and she is too extreme. Let capitalism speak for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not serious philosophy","review":"Ayn Rand fails to set forth a rational or consistent system of ethics, in spite of what her followers say. For example, she states that a man's life is his highest standard of value. However, why then should someone be concerned with another's rights? Why should someone give his life for his country in time of war? These are just a couple of problems with her ethics. Lastly, for someone who professed to believe in \\"reason,\\" there is a lot name calling, invective, etc. in Rand's writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better yet, read INSTEAD of Atlas Shrugged","review":"- and stop when you reach the point in the introduction at which Rand says she's using the term 'selfishness' to intimidate people. That statement pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the book, indicates the quality of 'philosophy' you can expect, and tells you exactly what you'll find in Atlas Shrugged - so you can skip it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A brilliant book?","review":"Mrs. O'Connor's (nee Rosenbaum) \\"The Virtue of Selfishness\\" is an unoriginal, hopelessly confused, ruthlessly illogical presentation of a morality that has never been thought legitimate by anyone past adolescence: a morality of pure self-interest, which expressly forbids direct concern for the well-being of anyone but oneself and calls the result \\"virtue.\\" Many people are incapable of questioning the stale doctrine of false autonomy they learned in O'Connor's books or in Objectivist study groups. It is precisely to encourage that type of mentality that Mrs. O'Connor wrote her \\"treatise\\" - which is actually no such thing, but merely a collection of short topical essays by two \\"giants\\" who considered themselves not bound by \\"conventional\\" morality: Mrs. O'Connor herself, and her adulterous lover Nathan Blumenthal (\\"Nathaniel Branden\\"), twenty-five years her junior."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE valid idea, drowned in COUNTLESS clutter","review":"There is no arguing with those who already like Ayn Rand and enjoy her linguistic dramatics.But that is precisely what makes everyone else not take her seriously--she is more DRAMATIC than BRILLIANT or INCISIVE.The very idea of not carrying altruism to the extreme, by not meaninglessly sacrificing oneself because of expectations imposed upon us, indeed stands up to scrutiny.But this particular book is more than anything else about taking an idea, or even a word definition, to an extreme which not too many sensible people do anyway, and verbosely ranting against it in --yet again-- dramatic ways. A few valid ideas are no licence to engage, too, in tirades that open us to suspicions of paranoia or hidden \\"issues\\".Ayn Rand needs to acquire greater faith in the persuasive powers of SUBSTANCE, and less on FLOWERY or RADICAL WORDS.A perfect book for fans of hers. For the rest of us, it's a struggle to get through the first ten pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best work of non-fiction","review":"If i were to suggest to someone an introduction of Ayn Rand's writing it would be ANTHEM and THE FOUNTAINHEAD. But if I were to suggest an introduction to her philosophy, it would be THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS.While all of her philosophy doesn't really stand in terms of personal happiness, and some of her views against things like Environmentalism really just are not well-considered, I think her moral basis for capitalism is the most important and pressing matter of her philosophy, and something that people in American society could really benefit from an understanding of.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life changing book","review":"I read this book more than 40 years ago.

Had it been, I would have given it a 2 out of 5. You're best bet for cognitive test preparation is to search for other guides or download similar (or harder) math exams, like I did.That being said, as a tool for those interested in a career with the FBI, I believe this book to be an excellent buy, hence my 4 out of 5 review. Although there were plenty of sections that I found very useful, such as the Selection Process Flowchart and the \\"Standing Out from the Crowd\\" chapter, there is a good deal of information in this book that would be very interesting to read, AFTER I finish my Federal Appliation for employment.

For example, quite recently the Bureau added a 5th program under which applicants for the SA position can enter the Bureau: Computer Science. Traditionally, there were 4 programs: Law, Language, Accounting and Diversified. So don't rely solely on the book. Be sure to check with local recruiters and fbi.gov.

They go on to say that an adult dog only needs to go out 4 times a day--they did NOT, however, tell you what to do when your dog makes a mess while tied to a door knob when they just asked to go out (like we taught them to do when we housetrained them). These people must think dogs are diabolical, and tell you on every page that your dog is constantly trying to usurp your position with every single thing you do or don't do.

After initial installation, the channels were all perfect, but then a few days later the signal quality on the lower channels became very poor (bypassing short run brings quality back to perfect). Contacted the manufacturer and they stated I would need to RMA again (incurring shipping fees and $30/hour penalties if they don't detect the same issue).

I was specifically interested in the section for the particle systems used for a Perfect Storm and sadly found that to be the book's weakest spot. I'm relatively new to 3D animation and fx so maybe I was expecting more explanation then was intended but I would have preferred a specific step-by-step tutorial than the vague trial-and-error explanation that was given in that section. There was a nice simple one-page particle system tutorial in that section that was sort of helpful but other then that I didn't really walk away with the knowledge I was looking for. I did find the rest of the book very helpful. Especially the modelling, texturing and lighting, dynamics, and crowd animation sections.

The film explores some of the dark sides of Grainger, including his proclivity for bondage, so is not for the kiddies. The exquisite soundtrack includes Grainger as well as Grieg, Mozart and others.

It is simple, made of cardboard. It's easy to play for small children, yet involved enough to keep adults interested, too. It has different types of game play as children age or become more proficient at the game. The game is easy, but requires kids to look carefully at the pieces, learn to think strategically, and consider a variety of options as play progresses. It's fun to play for any length of time, which is good for younger kids who don't have a long attention span. My son loves this game, and I have given it to 3 very happy recipients for birthdays since we received it. I definitely intend to purchase more games from this company.

Insurance does not help with many of the products that provide some relief, including Carmol Shampoo. We have used the Carmol lotion with good results, but for some reason the price of the shampoo is markedly higher. The shampoo was initially introduced under $30 per bottle, and the folks at DermaDoctor have now THRICE raised the price now to a whopping near-$50 per bottle. Unfortunate because those who need this product are mostly special-needs cases who are already financially strapped by their ailments.

The brilliance of Larkin is that he weaves true historical persons with his fictional characters. This is what makes the Tribune such an unusual book.

Larkin's main character interacts with Caesar Germanicus to Yeshua (Jesus).

We have had it now for 6 months and I am fed up with it to the point that it is being thrown out today. I comes apart very easily and I find pieces of it scattered all around the house. The rope never stays in place, robots come off easily from their stands, it is not sturdy. Sons complain that they have to bang the buttons with their fists and even then the heads sometimes don't pop up. Nobody wants to play it anymore and even their friends ask to play somethings else. I'm sick of tripping over the pieces. I wish I would have known about Amazon's review system before I purchased this.

My two boys and I love this toy! We mounted the ring onto a carpet covered piece of plywood. This baby sits in our game room and gets plenty of use. I highly recommend the Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots.

I bought it for him and was excited to watch him play it. After his party we put the game together and were quickly disappointed. Not only is the game half as big as it used to be (it's really small now), but the heads of the robots are so tight that no matter how many jabs they take, they won't pop up. We tried everything to loosen them up but nothing seemed to work. My nephew quickly grew frustrated with it and now won't play it because \\"it's not any fun; nothing happens\\".

We took it to our family dinner and my family felt the same. It is nothing like the larger version my aunts uncles and I would play for days and days.

There's nothing in the description to let you know its so small, unless the product dimensions are shown. It's about 1/3 the size of the original, and seems to be of cheaper quality. They used to have metal parts inside - now everything's plastic. Right out of the box, one of the robots has an arm that will barely move. None of the arms move great.

What a dissapointment they would have been, as the orginal still work perfectly and have stood up to the rough and tough play of a six year old and a two and half year old.

I had this as a kid and it did have it's flaws but this type of toy made us use our imaginations. It was fun to play for hours and make up stories. We used to organize entire tournaments because of this toy. Now kids can sit alone for hours playing a video game. I would be happy to pay any price for a better quality version of the original.

But as I said, I bought it because I am a robot collector, and they look as they did when they first came out. It wasn't that difficult to assemble, it went together quickly. When my daughter came home from school, we gave it a go, or two, or at least twenty. I am a big guy, and I put it through it's paces, and it held up with no parts coming off.

It's a page turner. You just have to know what's going to happen next. The portrayal of the bad guy as a demented brother gives the book an all to scary twist to the standard way it would have read. I think this story will be a classic for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"This was the second book by Nora I read. I enjoyed it tremendously. Her descriptive prowess made you feel like you were there. Three women, three men - hot, bothered, fighting feelings of desire - all on one island. Family secrets abounded. Great read. I will continue to read Nora Roberts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Roberts; not a big surprise, but entertaining","review":"While the characters were, as usual, eminently human and very easy to relate to, I found that this book follows what seems to have become a standard plot. There were perhaps to many people covered in too short a novel...a subplot betweenthe heroine's sister and her own lover could have stood on its own had it not been conviently resolved along with the rest of the family's love-lives. I, for one, would have like to have seen them in NY. I would think twice before purchasing the next Roberts' novel in hardback after reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent and Disturbing","review":"Normally I like Nora Roberts - she writes great escapist fiction. This book which includes several detailed brutal rapes and a plot line about a woman whose mother disappeared and who then receives pictures of her corpse is not escpaist and entertaining. It's what nightmares are made of."},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't read it again","review":"I felt like I was watching a poorly made horror movie that included casual sex while the killer was planning his next move. I can deal with there being a rape or murder because all suspense books are based on some type of violence, but did there have to be such graphic detail? I only finished it because I wanted to know who the psycho was. All violence put aside, it was a decent suspense story but didn't include any romance whatsoever. Casual sex does not equal romance in my book. Reader discretion advised: rape, murder, lots of casual sex, adult scenes and overall violence. Not on my bookshelf anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!","review":"I kept trying to like it and picking it up again wanting it to be what I have come to expect from Ms. Roberts, but I hated it. I gave it to the flight attendant because I couldn't throw it out the window! I simply did not like the characters and felt that their portrayal was somewhat demeaning to Southerners. I love Nora Roberts and began to read her when she wrote under another name, but this one was not up to her usual standards. Could it be that she is going the way of Danielle Steele and simply cranking books out for money, without regard to plot? Sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word...WOW!!!!","review":"This was the first book by Nora Roberts I have read. Wow!! The mystery, the romance, it keep me wanting more!! I never liked mystery novel until now. I am now a full fledged Nora Addict!. Definately buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First real disspointment","review":"I almost always am entertained by Ms. Robert's books even when they are less than stellar; usually they are a \\"pick me up\\" kind of read when I'm not feeling like digesting something more viscous. I loved the Sisters trilogy and there are several not far behind those which are genuinely wonderful books. This said, I was ready to put this one down half way through but slogged through to the end which was barely wrapped up in the neat bow and had no interesting after-images of where the characters would go. Some of the characters had promise which just never was developed. The main character is simply unlikeable half of the time and a sorry case the other half.Sorry..........this one just didn't do me well. \\"Sanctuary\\" wasn't................"},{"rating":"2","title":"great reads!","review":"There are not too many novels out there that combine murder-mystery with romance, but this is a good one. I could not figure out 'who dunnit' til the end, and I usually have a pretty good idea!This is a dark and mysterious tale, that should be read with all the lights on! Also recommend 'The Reef' and 'Carolina Moon'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the book greatly.","review":"Sanctuary started off with a very exiting beginning. The use of descriptives such as \\"Angel of Death\\" gave me chills. It was difficult not to want to scan ahead to get more insight into \\"who\\" and \\"what\\" was going to happen next. The characters in the book were developed very well. They seemed like a real family; they loved and hated; they cried and yelled. The book also did a very good job and making me guess (incorrecly I might add) as to the name of the villian in the story. It was not until the name was given that I finally knew the name of the bad guy.All in all Sanctuary is very enjoyable page turner. The descriptions used in the book were very good at evoking joy, fear and sadness from me as I read each chapter"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, well-developed","review":"Enjoyed the character development with a nice dose of excitement. Lovely summer reading when looking for some romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate to Waste Money","review":"I wanted so much to like this book, but after each chapter I wanted to quit. It was so boring and I didn't even like or relate to most characters. I kept drudging along though, hoping it would pick up and appeal to me, the way Northern Lights did and the way Chesapeake Bay Saga trilogy did, but NOOOOOOO, it didn't happen and after page 200, I walked it down to the \\"free table\\" of my apartment complex and laid it there.Wasted time, wasted money. Both...huge disappointments. Going to start reading Tami Hoag. I hear her novels really move along, bringing excitement and intrigue. I still have two of Robert's books to try and get through first though ( made a mistake and ordered 3 at the same time ) and hope one or both of them will restore my faith in the writing style of Nora Roberts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Like You're Right There With The Characters","review":"This book made me feel like I was right there with the characters, espcecially during the storm scene. Nora Roberts, once again, kept me guessing until the very end. Another great book with likable characters who make you feel for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with psychotic turn of the latest novels","review":"I've enjoyed Nora Roberts' novels and went back to read her older ones too. Lately her novels (with the exception of the MacGregor series) have introduced very dark sides - serial rapists/killers, abusive childhoods. I don't like having my stomach turned when I'm reading to \\"escape\\". I have friends who love Nora Roberts' novels too and threw away this one since they didn't want it in the house with teenage kids around. I hope she sticks with jewel thieves, etc. or advertises these new ones under a different series name/style. This was a bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indiana reader rates Sanctuary 5 stars...","review":"Sanctuary is one of NR's most enticing, romantic and mysterious novels yet! I have not yet finished the book (I've had it for two days) but I plan on finishing the last few chapters this afternoon on my way home from work. I have read at least 12 books by Nora Roberts and every single one of them has been fantastic. I suppose you could say I'm a NR addict!In Sanctuary, Nora Roberts develops at least four hot and steamy romances along with a very suspenseful murder mystery. I can't wait to find out who it is! Nora Roberts writes stories that stay with you forever. I have not read a book that I have not thought about since and I will read them all again!Thank you Nora for the most entertaining, suspenseful and romantic times I've had over the last several months! And congratulations on your success!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT! GAVE IT TO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT","review":"SLOW would be a fast word for this book.

Like every other Nora Roberts book I've read, I could not put this down. You will not be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lovely place to go, without the characters - please!","review":"The setting on a barrier island off the Atlantic coast is realistic and well done. This is a place I'd love to go! (Feel the sand between your toes; hear the howl of the wind.) The story and the characters are not so imaginative, but fall into the trite category, particularly the \\"bodice ripper\\" type scenes. And I'm personally not fond of the main character and her cigarettes (smells like an ashtray). Ms. Roberts can write, but her character studies are shallow and not believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Ending","review":"I am a Nora Roberts fan, but this is one of the worst books I have wasted my time on. The first 484 pages were fantastic, I couldn't put the book down. The last two pages did not conclude the story. I kept going back to my book to make sure that I didn't loose any pages or miss something. VERY DISAPPOINTING ENDING. The killer leaves two men (possibly for dead) and goes off to find the woman he has stalked throughout the book.

Her books are incredible. I can't get enough of them. In My Lord Conqueror her hero, Merrick of Normandy is delicious in every way! Her heroine, Alana is fearless and lovely and fun. The ending was chilling and had me enthralled. Her words fairly leaped off the pages. I have read, no devoured, several of Samantha James books: His Wicked Ways, His Wicked Promise, A Perfect Bride, A Perfect Groom, and my personal favorite of the trio, A Perfect Bride. The only way a reader could be disappointed in reading Samantha James's books is if there wasn't any more of her books to read, so keep writing Ms. James and I'll keep reading, BRAVO!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"copycat","review":"The general theme and occurences of this book parallels Brenda Joyce's The Conqueror, but makes a poor job of it. The 'hero' makes empty threats throughout the book and eventually loses the respect of the readers as he began to sound weak with his empty threats. The heroine is made to be a matyr who remains loyal to 'her people' despite their rejection and cruelty to her. She lacks intelligence in that she is unable to judge a person from his actions rather than from the nation of his origin. Throughout the book she makes these petty attempts at 'escaping' but makes no clear plan on how to go about it. The book is most boring and frustrating in that it fails to draw the audience into the emotions of its characters. After a-while you feel that the author has cheated you because of wasted time. The book gives the impression that the author went through the motions of putting in the ingredients and forgetting to mix or add heat. The product lacks chemistry and was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Citric Acid Crystals","review":"I imagine the product is a good product, but I did not end up with the taste I was looking for.

While other books like FISH! tend to look at what they do from a rather superficial and \\"fun\\" vantage point, this book takes a deep probing look at the root of their philosophy and how they choose to live their lives. And most importantly, they themselves are the writers. The reason for their success is that they are not some cheap dog-and-pony show for the entertainment of tourists. These men live their beliefs in and out of the fish market.

The author also paints a picture of \\"the system\\" which demonstrates that it barely \\"worked\\", and dispels the triumphalist version of events presented by the mainstream media. And, for Clinton scandal-mongers (and no, I'm not someone who relies on Rush Limbaugh for information on HRC), Hillary Rodham (not yet Clinton), makes a few cameo appearances as a special sub-committe underling. Her unlawerly actions reveals that if she is not a liar, at least she has no interest in justice. Highly recommended, and should be reissued by the publisher to counter the smug self-congratualtory satisfaction of the post-Watergate era. Current history is rarely what it seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very useful introduction to Historical Theology. . .","review":". . .useful for the scholar, the cleric, and the informed layman.This book is far less comprehensive than, say, the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, but has the advantage of being much less expensive, and much less daunting for the beginning student. The volume covers the major events and figures throughout the history of the Christian Church in an alphabetized dictionary format. The information presented is clear and concise without being minimalistic and the book is not particularly \\"weighted\\" toward a specific Christian tradition (thus minimizing polemic).This book would be a fine addition to a parish library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and beautiful","review":"I am a huge fan of Brasil 66, but with this debut album by Brasil 77, there's just more of the greatness that is Sergio Mendes. My 2 favorite tracks on the CD are Morro Velho a song that is lead by Gracinha Leporace. Gracinha has such a powerful voice and was a great replacement for Lani Hall. The other song I like a lot is Zanzibar. This is a great jazz/fusion number featuring Mendes solo on keyboards.

So far, every one I've looked up on Wikipedia pretty much matches, amazingly. I love what he has to say about Hollywood and the film industry; so true, so true.George certainly was confident that he knew and told the truth. One thing that gets old is his constant assertion that every sandwich and hamburger and dish that he describes is the absolute best food on earth, nay, the universe. No doubt this stuff is good, but hey.He bashes a lot of famous restaurants and places, among them Tijuana, New Orleans, the Old West. He even bashes Disneyland, which I've never seen anybody do, but most of what he says is true. Worse treatment is given to Knotsberry Farm, again true, but jeez.Anyway, if you're interested in original recipes, this is the book.

The father struggling to cope with his wife-abandonned kids, the rich and prissy woman forced to take them into her picture perfect home when her newly built damn bursts and floods their vacation cabin--they were all just great. The way Hansen handles the interpersonal relationships is masterful. She even includes a scruffy dog. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It happened one night","review":"Writer Brianna (Bree) Walker moves to the Arkansas hills to find peace and quiet in order to continue writing her romance novels. Her wish isn't granted due to a massive thunderstorm that floods the area her cabin is in, and completely destroys the cabin of single parent Mitch Fowler and his young sons, Bud and Ryan. They, along with a bedraggled dog, head to Bree's cabin for shelter.Hilarity ensues.Hansen wrote my favorite of the Love Inspired series (\\"The Perfect Couple\\") and her sense of humor is again on display here as clean freak Bree deals with children, a dog, and her growing attraction to Mitch. The kids do come across as bratty at times, but Hansen's characters are all very human and very flawed.The issue of whether or not to have children is an interesting one, since I have many friends who've opted to remain childless. Bree's reasons for doing so relate to her homelife and watching her develop a bond for both Bud and Ryan is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I've read yet...","review":"I want to start by saying I am reading all the Love Inspired books in order.With the exception of Roger Elwood's \\"Promises\\" which I threw across the room because it was so bad, this came close to being one of the worst books I've read from Love Inspired.The female character acts as if she hates his children and does not have a relationship with God, yet the male character still wants a relationship with her. Without saying it, it's as if she has adopted that old adage \\"Children should be seen and not heard\\".I kept waiting until the end for her to get a \\"revelation\\" about what was important, but she never seemed to.Also, issues from the past were brought up and seemed to go nowhere, unlike other books that I've read.Sorry, but I would bypass this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fully orchestrated greatness..","review":"First song I heard was \\"Between the sheets\\" and when the brass came in, I just died.

I would suggest this album for anyone into hard rock as well as alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Cool I Think!","review":"I had never heard of a band with such a weird name known as \\"Monty Are I\\" before. I mainly wanted this CD for the song titled \\"In This Legacy,\\" which as a drummer, has some nifty beats. This whole CD has some interesting sounds. Its a good CD, the only thing I didn't like was a couple tunes sound the same, and theres only one tune...forgetting the name at the moment, sorry, thats just downright boring. Other than that, I heard \\"Monty Are I\\" came out with or is coming out with a new CD and I plan on buying it!

The book flows like crazy. But that's also where the book breaks down for me. It is a long argument, rather than a painstaking work of investigation. I kept thinking that the author went into this with an axe to grind or some other kind of vendetta, and this book was the result. I also felt at times that he was trying to sensationalize his points, i.e. draw a more inflammatory conclusion than was warranted from the evidence he had at his disposal.Some people may consider it worth reading simply because it's so well written; this will be especially true for the growing numbers of Americans who share Mr. Critser's cynical perspectives on the drug industry. No doubt they'll root him along as he moves from chapter to chapter. For me, I can't justify more than the two stars I've given it."},{"rating":"1","title":"an exciting yawn--if that's possible?","review":"This book is all rant all the time--or maybe book as docudrama is a better description. For somebody who supposedly approaches this with the eye of an investigative reporter, Critser seems surprisingly sloppy at connecting the dots. And though he does a nice job of presenting his more credible material, that's the very stuff where you feel like saying \\"I've heard it all before\\". So it's not like he's breaking any news here.It's a good read if you check your brains at the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially for those in a medical field","review":"Everyone should read this book. It opens your eyes to what goes on behind the scenes of the pharmaceutical industry and the aspects of direct to consumer advertising of medications.

I was looking for a book which would give in-depth discussion of the fragrances of various essential oils and perhaps some guidance as to how they can be combined to create new fragrances both for perfumery and aromatherapy purposes. But this book has relatively little on these subjects. If you want brief listings on many essential oils giving: name of plant, family of plant, growth habit, chemical components, aroumatherapy uses, and scent - a lot of information but presented only briefly and not in depth - then you might like the book.

Do NOT leave it armed while you're in the house. Live in an apartment or condo? This is not for you. I placed it on the surface I wished to protect (the stove) and ever so gently turned it on to the low-sensitivity setting. It went off. That was the longest two seconds of my life. My head still hurts. The noise is so shocking that I couldn't even react to reach for the alarm to turn it off. I'd go into cardiac arrest if it went off at night. Returned it immediately. I expect a pet alarm to make a noise which startles the cats, not causes us all to writhe in agony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged my hearing for a day","review":"The previous poster is 100% right about this product. Every time you turn it on the alarm sounds off and it is so ear piercing that I couldn't hear right for the whole day afterwards.

The audio quality was comparable on all 3--not bad for a [money]set of headphones, but the Advent phones each had drawbacks. The Advent phones had to be manually tuned to the right frequency. That was just too big a pain in the xxx for me. These, the AW720, were so tight on my head that they hurt! I couldn't find a way to adjust the tension. Unless you have a really tiny head, don't buy these phones! I recommend the RCA WHP160 phones in this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality product","review":"About a month ago I wrote an extensive review of this Advent product.

I have a full length rail on my Buck Mark and the site needed some modifications to fit. After installation I found that the rear site does not adjust high enough to site in to the front sight. The adjustment needed to be extended past the limits of the screw. I will have to raise the rear site off the rail in order to properly target the gun. I like the look of the sites on the gun but it is not a good fit for a full rail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"They're OK, but wouldn't buy them again. The rear sight is made sloppy, tighten it up and wont adjust low enough on my buckmark. Factory sent me another, but it was no better.

Fire Sights Set Browning Buckmark.On a cloudy day or shooting at a range that has a roof over the shooting bench, these sights are useless. Another negative: The front Fiber Optic is RED.The bulls eye on my targets are RED. So, I can't see the sight when I'm lined up for the bull. Don't waste your money.

I generally do not like pointless shoot-'em-up games, so I truly enjoyed this one. The game offered good mixture of attention to detail, some movement challenges, and relevant predatory targets. The video inserts are fairly well done, but tedious for younger players. Having enjoyed the early levels, I was a bit disappointed in the Atlantis segment, in which a realistic treasure hunt was replaced with a science fiction adventure. In addition, the ending was a bit anti-climactic. The extra Gold levels, however, gave us something to look forward to when we in fact completed the game.

I was very happywhen I plugged it into my computer. I started the game... andimmediatly ran into a wall. THE PLAY CONTROL IS HORRID. Lara runs into walls like a stumbling idiot. She won't jump for a full second after you hit the JUMP button, meaning you have to be in the middle of a platform to make sure you jump in time, which is a pain during the timed puzzles. It's impossible to jump diagonally. On top of that, the story is stupid and makes no sense. I lost it when I had to fight the dinosaurs.

If you're looking for repair info on the 510, 240Z, or 1968-1972 Pickup, I'd look elsewhere. Each car is covered in brief, with step-by-step instructions for such things as removing the engine, replacing the clutch, etc., but since it covers so much, a book dedicated to the more popular later cars would be a better source.I hope this book is still available, as it got me through many repairs to the 1967 RL411 (Bluebird) that I bought in 1986."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouch!","review":"Brother has become one of the most exciting performers that I have ever seen.

I guess it is just my taste (or lack of it) but I found the book rather tedious, with all its details on the clothes everyone was wearing and the angst all the main characters exhibited.

Maybe $3.00. The graphics are less than horrible, the sharks don't even look like sharks. U can't change the controls to your own liking. Terribly limited game play 4 levels 4 sharks.About the playing the game...it may drive to the impulsive urge to explode your computer. It is extremely difficult to adjust to the controls. Some are overly sensitive others are not sensitive enough. It is easier to die in this game than to make EasyMac. Sometimes you could just be sit there with no sharks close to you and you will die. If you get aim on the shark they have to be an arms lenth away to actually hit them, also your speargun jerks around on it own which worsens the problem. Did I mention the graphics suck to no end. A three year old could program better graphics. Every thing in this game is made of horribly oversized polygons.

Instead they substituted the newer 1061 Hot Tools 2 setting model with Pink lettering that everyplace else on the internet has for much cheaper than Lil Gift LLC. My mother set it up and turned it on, well, the hot is way too hot and the low is too low, and there is no in between. It is also very cheap construction and difficult for an older person's arthritic hands to adjust.DO NOT ORDER this product from Lil Gift, LLC. They are substituting a cheaper version than what is in the picture. I purchase a lot of stuff on Amazon.com, but this seller has just lost a potential customer.

Five minutes later, I cut the lights back on because I had to find out what happened next. I couldn't go to sleep without knowing what happened.

This book was thorough, and handled commercial paper in a simply and easy to understand way. I didn't take commercial paper in law school, and was completely unfamiliar with the lay of the land. This book was an excellent starting point and covered all the basics necessary to do well on the bar exam. If you are like the last reviewer, and already have a solid enough grasp on the subject matter to be able to nitpick discrepancies between different versions of the UCC, then this might not be a good book for you. But if you are simply looking for a solid introduction to the subject, I highly recommend this book.

This book is an epic journey.Not having read other books in the western genre, I can't compare this other such authors, but this novel stands very well on its own. It's very gritty: characters, and not just the 'bad' guys, are killed, tortured, and kidnapped. Parts of this sickened me. But there are interspersed moments of real joy, and Wheeler's descriptions of the vast open wilderness is amazing.My only criticism is some of the characters come close to being 2D cardboard cutouts, but there is a lot of character development here to balance it out. Also, this is a book about the journey, not the destination, so don't expect all loose ends to be tied up. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"can get this and more / another lee book","review":"I was really pissed off at this book, I got both together of this one and carnal surgery, GUESS WHAT?

The first 46 pages discuss the naval arms race up to the end of the First World War. This was followed by a new naval arms race that few nations (especially in Europe) could afford. The book then goes into a detailed naritive (mostly American view) of the negosiations that resulted in the naval treaty. Topics include old and new battleships, carriers and the Pacific islands. It then breifly examines the early reaction of the three nations. This book was printed in 1940, but there are very few coments past 1922.

I wouldn't let little kids play this because of all the un-dead and noises around the place.

No, wait, its just the game....","review":"This game is more fun than having a bag of hammers dropped on your head, but not by much. A game where you rely on stealth and not your trigger finger is a good idea but I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. I knew that I was in trouble on the very first mission. It went like this: Me: \\"Where am I? Is this a wall or a door? I'll just open it-\\" Guard: \\"Hey!\\" Me: \\"Oops!\\" Guard kills me. The End.Wow. That was fun. Hoo-boy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read all the great reviews but...","review":"I finally got around to playing Thief and, given all its wonderful press, I ended up disappointed. Yes, I know the graphics engine is outdated now but even when it came out it must not have been that great. I found the constant stealth factor to actually not be that fun and found it very aggravating at times. Sometimes it takes ALOT of playing time to negotiate and area correctly without alerting the guards. I also found the player controls a little more stiff or crude or less responsive or something than most games of this nature. I played through alot of the first level and then gave up. Maybe it was a blast when it came out but now there are alot of other games that will give me much more fun and excitement. I will give Thief II a try (I already own it) but I feel it will be more of the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why kill people randomly when you can just take their stuff?","review":"Thief: In a word, this game is incredible. Despite the FPS-like controls, this game is far removed from brainless shooters involving portagonists that can take more than a few bullets before they die. Thief is the intelligent FPS that gamers have been waiting for since the birth of the genre.Gameplay is astounding in both its immersiveness and its originality. The universe Thief is set in is so brimming with personalities, places, and warring factions that an RPG could easily be made from it, and the plot is interesting enough to keep you hooked despite the relatively tacky cut-scenes.Though graphics leave something to be desired, I would far rather spend my time with Thief than with some brainless eye-candy game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thief","review":"Theif is a great game. It is definetely worth the money. If you you have ever played this you will love Thief 2. Thief takes some getting used to. You cant just run around and kill anyone you want.

It isn't BAD, but they ain't great either.The gameplay is basically sneaking around, knocking out soldiers, finding stuff, etc. Most of the missions are VERY hard... and sometime a little TOO hard. You get weopons like a sword, a bow & arrow ...water arrows, etc. You'll usually have to steal something in the missions.The sound is great. You can hear peoples conversations, etc.The control takes time getting used to.Overall, I liked this game... but in the end it didn't turn out to be very replayable.

What was once a dynamic and creative outfit sounds dulled and uninspired. The drumming, for the first time in their recording history, is devoid of those interesting fills and complex rythms that marked prior recordings. The use of the synthesizer sounds dated. Only Brooker is in fine form as vocalist. The production is also substandard as it comes across quite coldly and sparse, lacking the muscle and density of the three prior recordings(Grand Hotel, Exotic Birds and Fruit, Procol's Ninth). The final cut is a dreadful reciting of a childish poem that is woefully long. Save yourself some money and skip this one. Purchase Grand Hotel and Exotic Birds...and you'll be much happier. Not recommended at all...Simon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underestimated album indeed","review":"I think this album is good. A lot of people seems to think that it's the end of PH, but I beg to differ.

Chris Copping switched back to bass, and Gary Brooker brought Pete Solley in for the coveted organ role. And Pete even played some synthesizers (BLGH) to attempt to keep Procol in tune with the times, but....no. And having schlockmeisters, Ron & Howie Albert to \\"produce\\" (heh-heh-heh) \\"Something Magic\\" ensured its - and the group's - imminent demise. STILL, though: the fourth song, Guitarist Extraordinare Mick Grabham's \\"The Mark Of The Claw\\" made purching the album worth it. It's a grinding rock and roller, but the astounding solo that Pete Solley plays on the song almost justifies synthesizers' very existence.

I was left with a lot of questions about how the RADIUS software actually implements the standard. How user files are parsed, how attribute matching is done, what is actually checked and returned. Things like that were not covered at all. This is a good introduction to RADIUS, but if you have a real project to do you are still going to have to spend a lot of time digging for more info on the web or in poorly written documentation that is available out there.

However, after I first opened the 3-disc set, I have to admit I was letdown that the \\"Treasure of the Golden Suns\\" pilot episodes weren't included! (WHY?????)

Then I did some research on Amazon and found Free and Clear. Well, it didn't help my skin condition, but I was pretty impressed with the products (styling gel and hair spray). The styling gel isn't sticky and gives my hair volume and shine. The hairspray holds nicely, but isn't stiff.

The prose and images bring the story to life, and the final image is enough to make you believe in magic all over again.This is a Christmas story that should have a place of honor beside on your bookshelf beside \\"The night before Christmas\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Ranger Came Calling","review":"I use this story in my classroom to teach excellence in writing--voice and word choice. Students puzzle over the ending with amazement. Parents listening to the story rush for a copy. I wish to own a hardback copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our favorite holiday tradition.","review":"My husband and I discovered The Red Ranger Came Calling when we were dating, and sat on the library floor laughing our heads off. Two kids later, we are still loving this book. It's the only Christmas book that stays on our shelves year round, and the only Christmas book that we are constantly buying for other people. Buy it, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Classic for all ages","review":"When I discovered this book I went right back to the store & bought copies for all my friends & family. It has become a holiday tradition in our house.It's a magical blend of humor & emotions without getting overly sentimental. The rich, colorful illustrations nicely compliment the humorous story culminating in an off-the-wall ending that will have you reading this one over & over each year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tired of \\"Night Before Christmas\\"?","review":"Looking for something that has that message of Christmas? This is the book. Excellent for children and hillarious for adults, this is the perfect book for all those not believing in Santa Clause. Try it, its now my family's tradition over \\"Night Before Christmas\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Funny, Totally captivated my boys.","review":"This was an excellent read for our boys, aged 8,5, and 2. It held their interest, They laughed and we read it again and again. As a mother it is also one of my very favorite books.This is a \\"Must Have\\" if you favor Mr. Breathed's work. My boys are convinced this is a true story and they pray at Christmas that Santa Claus \\"hears\\" what they want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Magic","review":"There are so many great reviews of this very special book, that I almost skipped commenting. This book is the perfect gift for all the adults in your life. It is logical to think of children first, but adults may need the magical story and reminder of what is important more than children during the holidays when everything seems to be about money.I am including a copy in each holiday package shipped to my adult relatives. The book is secular -- this isn't a religious story, but it still drives home the message that it isn't about the gifts. And, given the stress of the economy, this year in particular, Christmas may feel like an added burden. This unique story is spirit lifting and magical for young and old. I will read this book every Christmas season and so will you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Ranger","review":"Disappointed in book. Read a great review, but was not what I expected. I had planned to use it in my classroom, but will probably give it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical and bizarre","review":"First I'll admit up front, I was always a fan of Mr. Breathed's work from the \\"Bloom County\\" days, but this book applies his unique take on the world, and in particular Christmas, to another level. The artrwork is great, and the story just twisted and wacky enough for the 7 year old in all of us to be delighted. Crawl up with a little one you love, or just settle down with a hot cocoa by the fire and enjoy. Wow, what a great world he takes you to, reminding us all what it's like to view the world's \\"magic\\" through the eys of a child. This book slays me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite story","review":"This is my favorite Christmas story. The story is great, the pictures are amazing and it makes even my older child think twice. I gave this book as a gift to several neighbors this year and they are all believers now! We read this every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Christmas Tradition - Red Ranger Came Calling","review":"How could you not believe after reading this one of a kind \\"there is a Santa Claus\\" book? This is Berkeley Breathed at his best - luring you into the story until you are rooting for the happy ending. And along the way, you'll find the magic that one little boy brought back from Santa in the most unexpected way. I won't give away the ending - but don't peek at the last page. Not only is a picture worth a thousand words, it is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud and warm your heart. One for a gift and one to keep - I'm glad I bought two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe mine's broken?","review":"When we squeeze the handle, the birds mouth closes instead of opens, and when we let go of the button the mouth just half hangs open. so in order for the pelican to fit any of the little guys in his mouth, we basically have to trap them against the edge of the tub with his mouth and shove them in. They also fall out the bottom the very second they are eaten. My kids don't play with this at all, once they discovered the pelicans mouth doesnt open enough to easily eat the toys. I love the colors and think it looks very cute, but it's useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother.","review":"Unfortunately Sony missed the boat with this one. Yes its compact and lightweight, but its performance dosent outweigh its features. First of all, the reception is horrible! If you like listening to static, this is your model. It might be able to perform better outside, but inside, its sucks. Next, the volume dial sits conviently high enough that its gets knocked easily. Switching machines at the gym, and WHAM! your ears are now taking in maxumum volume. I would highly recommend another brand or Sony model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Previous model had a stopwatch","review":"Such as it is, the walkman works fine, however the previous model had a stopwatch that was extremely handy to measure my running progress. It was a big disappointment when I opened the package and found that this model does not have the stopwatch feature. For almost $50, you should get more than just a radio. Sony has laid an egg with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSULTING PRICE","review":"this is not the best choice for music,i get only 1 local station and the sound it muddy it also has a loose volume dial, dont be fooled by that INSULTING PRICE of $199.99 third party sellers are selling it for, this radio sold for $ 49.99 at target a few years back, get the new model for $39.99 or better yet spend the $199.99 on a great mp3"},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt Clip would be better than Arm Wrap","review":"I have seen this product and planned to purchase it. However I found out that only a velcro wrap is avalaible, no belt clip. Too bad it is perfectly designed to fit the waist and a belt clip would have been preferred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going down hill fast","review":"I have owned four SRF-M78s in the past 6 months - no exageration; three have failed. The battery contacts fell out of the first unit after three weeks. Moderate perspiration will cause rust in the battery compartment as it did in my second unit which failed after two months. After the third unit failed I went to the Sony service center. They replaced it but within a week rust began to form on the battery contacts. Failure is inevitable The first Sports Walkman had a rubber gasket which this unit lacks. It also sadly lacks scan capability. Ten presets but only five FM; does anybody need five AM presets. This unit has serious flaws. One of the few Sony Bummers I've ever owned. I'd pay twice the price for the previous the unit. I can not recommend this piece and eagerly await an anticipated \\"next model\\" when Sony gets enough complaints"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good investment","review":"This is a great tool for any gym rat. The buttons are convenient to use and the band stays in place comfortably. You do have to tweak the headphone cord on occasion to improve reception, but overall this unit works well. The hold feature is great to keep your station in place and to save battery power when you're not using the radio. The unit holds up to general where and tear well. I've had mine a year and it still works great!It's a good investment for anyone needing a lightweight portable radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lifespan with bad sound","review":"I bought Sony's sports radio to use when I worked out. I thought it worked great at first but then the unit began to break down. Now, I can barely hear the radion stations or they fade in and out. I've gotten very irritated with how it performs, and I wouldn't recommend this radio unless you want one that has a short lifespan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why pay more!?!","review":"This little mount works great. Four screws in the TV, 2 in the wall, you're done. There's also a locking allen wrench if you want more security. The low profile looks right on a small TV. Why spend premium prices at the big box store when this one does the job right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Set screws don't set","review":"I wish I could like this shift knob more because it goes great with the interior of my car, but I had to take it off and go back to stock because the thing just would not stay put! No matter how tight I made the set screws (almost to the point of bending the teeny hex wrench that came with this), they would be loose within days and the shift knob would be loose and spinning around."},{"rating":"2","title":"JY rocks out","review":"This a great solo album from one of Styx's founding members.

I found this book to be incredibly helpful when creating a report. It had me wish I knew this thoughtful and insightful queen. I felt I was in the time period because it had information and facts where other biographers made speculations and mere guesses. In other books, I felt as if the author had not even researched it at all. I would recommend this book to anyone, not just as a resource but also as a free read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, Now I Understand","review":"I saw the recent movies about Elizabeth and a couple of the older ones and I had sooo many questions. What was real? What was just cinematic license? This book is enjoyable to read, the facts are presented clearly and well-documented, and there's no glossing over the uncomfortable parts as happens in so many books written for children. Ms. Thomas obviously respects the intelligence of her readers. I think a lot of adults will find this book the best place to start when finding out more about Good Queen Bess . . . or trying to figure out the conflicting views of her from the movies. On top of which, the book is just plain gorgeous--great drawings and color paintings. Thanks, Ms. Thomas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slightly dissappointed","review":"I was excited to get this book, but don't remember in the description when I purchased it, that the pages were coming out of the binding.

This one went promptly back to gamestop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than a shiny ripoff of Zelda","review":"The graphics are really shiny and clear!The game stinks of too long development cycle and a derivative mindset. I was playing this game on my N64 years ago! Sure it looks pretty, but most of that is the backgrounds. Half the time you spend fighting the camera WHILE you are fighting the bad guys. Major disappointment!Get Call of Duty 2 or Perfect Dark Zero for your 360 instead, you'll thank me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun game but two times it breaks on me.","review":"This game is fun, but I don't know what the heck, this game faults and goes multi-colored screen on me 1/4 a way through it.

This is the only game that does this on my 360."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont know who gave the good reveiws","review":"This game is terrible. True it is sort of new and inventive. But gameplay is terrible, graphics are equiv. to regular Xbox. I have purchased this game in package just to get the Xbox 360. Also stay away from ridge racer (terrible driving game, the worst i have ever played) driving physics are non existent and gameplay is designed for five year olds. Perfect Dark Zero is also terrible. All of these games have received great reviews. I dont know how? All have graphics dated back to the original Xbox!!!! Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"soooooooooo boring","review":"this game was the most boring game of all time. The graphics suck. The 360 is not all that great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"I'm an addict. Kameo is a great game and keeps you trying again because of so many locked bonus features. I'm a fan of the more arcade style games and this has the feel of that while being a whole next gen feature. Gameplay is great, the game can be challenging, cute, funny and did I say addicting. Rather than have side sets of mini-games, the mini-game like components are part of the game - something I prefer. It all fits together into a very dense, visually stunning, and extremely fun game. I'm 33, male, and probably not the target for the game but I really enjoy it and have been playing it almost exclusively for a couple weeks. Keep an open mind and you'll be pleased. I finished the game in about 13 hours but have kept playing to improve the score, grade, and find all of the hidden pieces. Lot's of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW A Great game at Launch.","review":"Can you believe Microsoft has managed to provide two count em two incredible titles at launch? Perfect Dark is the first and this is the second. This game is sooo much fun. And better still, this game is sooo creative. For me personally, there is nothing better than a creative, fun, action packed platformer with Character. This game has those in spades. Finally microsoft has a mario rival. Only this character takes the shape of several different monsters all of which are insanely fun to play. Oh, and by the way. The game is beautiful.Bottom Line: Buy this and perfect dark and you will have avery merry Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kameo Elements of Power","review":"The graphics are very nice. The game overall is fun and adventurous but doesn't have enough difficulty or challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kameo is F.U.N.","review":"Despite the graphic, the game is additively fun! The game rated is T for Teen but adults can play it too. I have tons of fun playing this game and solving the puzzle together with my 9 year old daughter.You play a girl named Kameo that can morph into several different kinds of forms or what they call them \\"elementals.\\" After you pass the first section, you'll lose all these elementals and you have to work really hard through different realms to get them again one by one. That's the gist of it.If you want to take a break killing monsters, get this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Next gen graphics with last gen gameplay...","review":"Tedious boss battles, wonky camera controls, button mashing combat and an annoying \\"guide book\\" make this game a must miss. Kameo was slated for the original Xbox and it shows, the gameplay is stale and doesn't hold up. By time you hit the under water levels you'll find yourself fighting the controls and the camera more than anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a game for girls","review":"For anyone out there who is sick of *all* games being geared towards guys, Kameo is the game for you. It's fun, not too violent, not so challenging that you have to spend another $15 on a player's guide, and the best part is that the main character is a girl - and not a gun-toting impossibly-proportioned femme fatale a la Lara Croft (or worse, a fashion and makeup obsessed bimbette like Barbie), but a fairy. It may sound cheesy, but that is what excited me the most about this game. The graphics are superb, the gameplay is great; an altogether good game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game for the family","review":"This is a nice game to add that is more inclusive than other launch titles for younger family members. The graphics are fantastic (especially on a higher quality flat screen) and the controls are easy to learn. The story is engaging and not overly taxing - again allowing for younger members to play and have fun (while not worrying about too much violence though there is plenty of \\"fantasy\\" violence but it is not overly gruesome)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"I think kameo is a wonderful game, it has good graphics, at least to my opinion. Its fun to get awards when having highscores. There are so many ways to kill trolls wich makes it alot of fun. I think kameo should add more exploration, so we could explore more lands during her quest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kameo initial review","review":"Great fun, though going from level to level can be quite challenging. We like the autosave feature, excellent graphics, and good story line. Great for the entire family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied with my first attempt","review":"An excellent description of the process of applying clown makeup. I've never applied makeup before reading this book. I followed the instruction presented and I feel like I understand the basics of the process and I was very satisfied with my first attempt.There is an artistry to expression through clown makeup. This book touches on artistry, but I think that it would be far more fulfilling to the reader to expand on a variety of styles of expression for the artist who is trying to develop a unique external expression of self. I hope that a future version of this book will expand on this idea. Despite my wishes, I highly recommend this book for anyone who has no formal training in makeup application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous for toddlers, Ages 5 & up only","review":"This toy is designed for a toddler due to its small size, but interestly is advertized for ages 5 & up. I now know why. It's a hazard. Pros: toddlers love pushing it & it's realistic looking. Incidents with this toy include: tot's head got stuck between handle bar and main cart, tot's foot got stuck in bottom tray slats, wheels continually got stuck on deck furniture with the gap they have in middle, causing toddler distress. Also, the cart is light weight enough that my boy is compelled to race it along the walls and on top of tables. Finally couldn't take it anymore and threw this toy out today. Get the Little Tikes plastic cart instead (our kids love those at nearby rec center), which I'm going to buy to replace this one. The Little Tikes shopping cart does not have all the openings for kids to get stuck as this one does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is so cheep it falls apart all the time.

I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what happened next. And what did I get for all this anticipation? A BIG FAT ZERO. No resoultion to any of the previous plotlines. No actual plot, unless you consider seeing how many men Merry can have sex with in public a plot. Give me a break. All I got for my troubles was a book of soft porn. Thanks for nothing. I'm so disgusted I don't know if I will even bother with the next book in the series. Someone just let me know when it is finally over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent porn, boring story","review":"What happened to LHK? It's like she got so up-close-and-personal with micro-manage writing, that she forgot to actually MOVE the characters. Unlike the early Anita Blake books who have addictive characters, I found it difficult to bond with any of these bunch. I'm tired of seeing big strong guys getting in touch with their emotional wounds, then having massive magical sex to regain powers. Blah blah blah.However, if you like good porn, the scenes are steamy. Call me old-fashioned, though, hot scenes are infinitley better with well-developed characters and an engaging story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given it less...","review":"...but Amazon.com won't let you. This book ticked me off. I loved the Anita Blake books in the beginning, but then Anita decided to drop her pants on a regular basis and it got really boring. So then I started reading the Merry Gentry books and when I realized that Merry was decended from a bunch of fertility deities I knew what was going to happen next. There was a lot of sex but the premise was interesting enough that I hung on to see what would happen. I should have known...I feel really ripped off. My boyfriend who has a dirty mind even thought all the sex was boring. That, is quite a feat. Congratulations LKH, you made group sex routine..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I feel so cheated. I am a huge Laurell Hamilton fan. I bought this book the day it came out. The story seemed so good. I love her characters, and her descriptions are so detailed. What happened with the story and plot? I read the last page, and was so dissapointed. It is as if they forgot to print the last few chapters. It just stops and leaves you dangling. What happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The story gets richer","review":"I just don't understand the negative reviews to this book. It can only be that people are offended by the sex in the book on principle. Because the main character is channeling a fertility goddess, it makes sense that sex would play a big role in the story line. And Ms Hamilton's books all have an eroticsm to them which is why many of us love her work. So don't be misled by those who would have you believe there is no plot in this book. Apparently they just didn't like the plot and arc of the story but that is their issue, not the book's flaw. I can not wait to hear what happens in the next installment. I only wish I didn't have to wait another year for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really subpar Hamilton","review":"Listen to the other reviewers. Those of us used to the 600+ pages of the later Anita Blake books are going to feel cheated by the mere 380 pages over about a day in this one.If you took out the sex scenes, I'd bet on less than 150 pages of plot. Too little, too little! Very frustrating. If you took the previous book and this one and released them as one, that would have been alright.The book also ends by just stopping. None of the usual tying up of ends or such -- it just stops. Plus 3 major plot points -- the visit to the goblin court, the visit to the Seelie court, and the liason with Sholto -- are still out there, waiting to happen. It's ok to keep the reader guessing, but this feels like a broken promise.The next book better be 500+ pages and full of actual *plot*, not just \\"bloody fertility goddesses\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Paper","review":"Buying books where the plots advances at a snails pace is a waste of money. Reading them is a waste of time. I had hoped to see the inside of the goblin court or the Seelie court. BUT no. All this book does is generate income for the publisher and the author. If this continues I advise the public to skip the next 2 or 3 books and maybe some progress will be made. This series is turning into a literary soap opera and moving slower than one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"I have to say I've become horribly disappointed in the last several LKH books. I've been pushing myself to read them though, because I've been a die-hard LKH fan for years now, and I've been hoping that eventually these books will get back on track with the twisted and intelligent plot-lines. The Merry Gentry books were definitely gentler than the AB books from the get-go, but the potential with the sidhe was so fantastic. I know Merry's magic is based in sex, but geez.... I love erotica and sex hardly makes me wince when I come across it in a book. But I wince every few pages now in this book because that's all it is. Sex. And its not well-written sex either. Its actually quite boring. LKH gives you just enough hints into the awsomeness this book COULD be in between the sex scenes to keep you reading, but not enough for me to even consider getting the next book. I'm afraid that unless she gets this crappy sex out of her system, her books won't be adorning my bookshelves anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurell's best book yet in the Gentry series!","review":"I have always believed that Laurell has a cult following with her Merry and Anita series but this book proves me wrong. A stoke of Midnight appeals to all readers, not just the devoted series readers. It is fast moving and the action just doesn't stop! Fantastic read and I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting ready for the big final . . .","review":"I feel that this book is the begining of LKH getting ready to finish the series. She gives some hints of how things use to be in the Courts plus how things needs to change before the race no longer exists.I really enjoyed this books and felt that it was filling in some gaps of what has happened in the previous books.I do recommend reading this books if you are a LKH fan and are continuing the Merry series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Heck?!?!?!","review":"I never got this book, I did get a e-mail saying that the book was unavailable, even though I got an e-mail before that one confirming my order, the Amazon website had said the book was for sale on the site!!!!

So I can't review the actual book because I never got it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Let Down","review":"I am such a Hamilton fan and so excited when the fourth book came out in this series. HOWEVER, the story line has only moved about 2 days in the last two books. Can we please move on? I realize that writers need to milk this if the books are successful however if the story goes no where then readers will lose interest(i.e. myself and many others who have made comments).In short, this series could have been completed in three big books and after the fourth book we are no where. I'm willing to give this one more chance but if the next book progresses one day then I'm giving up for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye LKH, Hello some great new writers","review":"This is as bad as everyone says. LKH has done an Anne Rice.Let it go now, and read some good new writers: Kim Harrison (Dead Witch Walking), Kim Wilkins (Autumn Castle), Kelley Armstrong (Dime Store Magic). Fresh new voices. Not overpaid cash cows who can produce nothing but hundreds of pages of filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Characters","review":"I've read the other reviews posted in regard to missing the plot. The characters are the plot, the interactions between the characters are the plot, and the way they are starting to look upon Merry as a leader, not just an object to get beyond their years of celibacy is an important plot point. Plot doesn't always have to be A + B = C. If it was we'd be bored, as people and as readers.If you don't like racy sex scenes don't read this book. If you love the way LKH writes characters then read this book. It is by no means a piece of literary perfection, it is however perfection for those readers who truly enjoy the characters she's created.LKH is not a standard author so I think it's important to hold her up to her own standards because she delivered when she wrote this book, the characters are growing, and the relationships are improving, and life at the Sithen is getting more and more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queen of Porn, belongs in a sex shop","review":"Gosh what an awful book. No story just pornography. Not interested in reading any more of her books. What the heck happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just out to sell books","review":"This the 4th book in the Gentry stories is by far the worst of the lot. The entire book covers less than 24 hours in time and barely edges the plot forward. Laurell writes like she's trying to extend the series out over as many books as possible just to sell more books. The multi chapter sex scenes while steamy filled probably close to 1/2 of the entire book. Yes, I know she makes her money selling books. But I for one will glance through her next addition to this series before I buy it in hardback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"While some reviewers are trashing this book, I liked it. It was fast moving and while there have been complaints that there is no plot, I disagree. When reading a Laurell K Hamilton book you have to let go of reality and live in her fantasy world. Way to go Ms. Hamilton, keep em coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed feelings about Stroke of Midnight","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton has been a favorite since I first started reading her Anita Blake series. I was eager to dive into this new series with Meredith Gentry and I haven't been disappointed.My only complaint is that as the series continues the sex scenes seem to become more and more frequent. I'm not one to complain about THAT, except in this, the third book, the sex scenes seem to pretty much overwhelm the plot.It's got to be difficult to balance sex with plot in a series where everything hinges on the main character having sex with as many men as possible. It just seemed like 3/4 of the book was Meredith having sex...it didn't leave room for things to progress in the series.I am still looking forward to the rest of the series, and I can't deny that Laurell can write one heck of a hot sex scene. I just wish Meredith would spend a little more time on her feet and not on her back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and let down...","review":"I had high hopes for this book, and they pretty much fell flat. There were the beginning threads of a lot of good ideas that just went dangling. This novel felt more like a very drawn-out introduction to the real story, none of the loose ends were tied off, and there were a lot of questions that went unanswered. And, while I've got no objection to the occasional sex scene, it'd be nice to get a few pages of plot in there in between them."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO MORE SEX PLEASE!!","review":"I have loved Laurel K Hamilton books since I picked up Guilty Pleasures, because all my favorite authors had nothing new out as a whim and sheer desperation for something to read. I was overjoyed that she had started a new series within the same \\"world\\" as Anita Blake but from a totally different perspective...that of the supernatural view.The Stroke of Midnight was such a disappointment and, I am sad to say, a waste of the $25 I spent on the hardback.The novel takes place in the Sithen and it is over 300 pages of sex...Meridith takes that long to make it to the throneroom in one night!I miss the plots and the story line and the potential I saw in the first book or two...now like the Anita Blake its just sex and not that well written.Please bring back the potential seen in the first couple books!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"I thought A Stroke of Midnight would be a continuation of the previous Merry Gentry novel, Seduced by Moonlight; however, the two days Merry had to heal, ally herself with the sluagh and goblins, and then appear at a banquet at the Seelie court (see the penultimate chapter in Midnight) vanish. Plot continuation from A Stroke of Midnight seems to be discarded; a continual orgy ensues. I enjoy well-developed romance and a soupcon (or more) of sex. I appreciate that Laurell avoids euphemisms for sex and makes it real, but this book just degenetres into (disgusting) sex scene after sex scene. The characters could almost be interchanged with those from the last Anita Blake novel, Incubus Dreams (although that may have been a bit worse), without altering the story.I've been a devoted Laurell K. Hamilton fan for years and am sorry to see her novels devolve so drastically. Her first novel, Nightseer, (a stand-alone) was a gem. Now, sadly, I don't think I'll buy another book by LKH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Move On","review":"Like many other reviewers, I have been a huge Laurell K. Hamilton fan via the Anita Blake series and the first couple of Merry Gentry novels. However, it appears that Ms. Hamilton is now simply a revenue-generator for her publisher, and her editor has lost interest in making her books interesting and grammatically correct. Both series have devolved into soft core with no plot. Hamilton doesn't even bother to extend the story line past a day or part of a day.Save your money on the newer books. Read the first four or five Anita Blake novels, then move on to fresher, more interesting writers like Charlene Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two and a half stars for half a book","review":"this was too short, too shallow, and had too much sex (never thought I'd complain about that, but it just got ridiculous). i'm super disapointed because i love lkh so much. better books to read are: Armstron'gs Dimestore Magic, Harris' Dead witch walking, Wilkins' The Autumn Castle. they do lkh better than lkh does now."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much is a bad thing","review":"I agree with most of the reviews, this book in particular was too filled with sex. I like the mystery, I love the politics with a sprinkling of sex. I also grow weary of her repeatedly explaining the same thing over and over again. I know she was raised by her father and I know she visited the Goblin kingdom many times, I know the rules she keeps explaining over and over again. Get to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring!","review":"I looked forwards to this book coming out, and when the big day finally came, I was the first to purchase it at my local bookstore. However, as I started to read it, I realised that it was nothing but sex over and over again! The plotline sounded promising, but it was done too quickly, and frankly would probably have only been a short story if the sex was omitted. Hamilton seems to have become too obsessed with sex lately, and it's starting to ruin her books. I understand that it's part of the storyline, but if I wanted to read a brainless bodice-ripper I'd go out and buy one. I'm still going to buy her next book, in hopes of her style improving, but I fear that she's sold herself out to the dark side of writing: writing to sell, not to create.For those who have a desire to read books similar to her early works, I recommend Kim Harrison and Kelley Armstrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"I eagerly awaited this book, I can't believe how cheated I feel. LKH needs to get on with the story instead of letting her greed for sales get the better of her.So much of this book was pointless blah, blah, blahing that I literally skipped whole paragraphs trying to find the story. I HATE how wimpy she made Doyle and Frost.I enjoy a good sex scene anytime, but I don't enjoy LKH turning the heroine into a (...). Enough with the screaming orgasms already.I will be very cautious before buying the next book in hard cover.One more thing, LKH needs to get rid of the ardeur in her Anita Blake series. Maybe she should have a big vampire war kill off most of Anita's men. I have lost my respect for her completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boriiiiiiiing","review":"I started the book when it first came out but have yet to finish it..I loved the first book in the Merry series but am having a seriously hard time wading through this one.It also looks like she maybe adding tons of men to the Anita books but at least they keep my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who knew?","review":"This is what I have learned from Stroke of Midnight -- double penetration can be boring. Who knew?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful,but confusing.................","review":"I have been eagerly waiting for a long time and after a few days reading I will have to another two years to find out what happens in Merry's fascinating world. I will not go into a big synopsis of this book but I will say that the way is clearing up for Merry getting pregnant and for being the new Queen. Andais is finally finding out who may be a better ruler for her people the Fae and the Ravens are slowly thinning out. They're are a lot of confusing situations that have to be cleared up,and I can't wait to see how they are solved. I do not have a favorite Raven, I love all of her guys. I highly recommend only reading this book after you've read all the earlier books in this series because if you don't you will be greatly confused. HURRY UP LAURELL AND WRITE MERRY\\"S BOOK PLEASE, AND MAKE THEM LONGER,THEY AREN'T LONG ENOUGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent addition to the series","review":"This book is a wonderful addition to the Merry Gentry series. It moves very fast, and combines plot elements from a number of court intrigue lines, as well as a significant increase in the magic backstory. The end seems more like a middle than an end, so that is a bit frustrating, but otherwise very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stroking Midnight","review":"As a reader familiar with Laurell's books one can't help but notice the increasing number of pages devoted to sex, which isn't all bad but does mean less actual story and character progression/development per book. The other detracting element of the book for me was the timeframe in which it occurs. All the action appears to occur over the course of a single day (or part thereof) - which makes Meredith one very busy (and sore?) lady.This aside I still enjoyed this book and would recommend it to other devoted Hamilton fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"I kept my promise to myself and did NOT buy this book. I read it in the bookstore in about 30mins. No plot, nothing but sex. I was amused to see other LKH books in the romance section ... where they belong. Thanks to Amazon's \\"you might also like\\" I have found many other authors who exceed LKH. I am so dissapointed with both the Gentry and the Blake series. The original concepts for both were so good, what a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish. no, really","review":"Everybody else here has said it before, I don't need to say it again. A great big LETDOWN. The only reason I'm posting is to tell you all that there is hope: Kim Harrison's \\"EVery Which Way But Dead\\" and Kim Wilkins' \\"The Autumn Castle\\" are everything this book isn't: cool, sexy, witty, dark and totally page-turning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know if I'm still a fan","review":"I had loved the Anita Blake series but have grown frustrated with the current level of sexual obsession. What I liked about the early books is Hamilton's ability to weave several storylines together to a satisfying climax. I've never been a great Merry Gentry fan, and this is probably the last book of that series I will buy. I liked the idea of a detective who was also a fairie princess and had anticipated a paranormal mystery. I even liked the court intrigue and the social comments regarding prejudice and alienation. I also liked the great fight against the amoeba of ancient magic. What I didn't like was wading through all the intensely detailed sexual encounters complete with tentacles, and as the books progress the frequency of such is increasing so that it feels like the story line (and advancement thereof) is secondary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not the only one!!","review":"Finished A Stroke of Midnight recently.... I must say it was better than the previous book, but not by much. I read alot of the other reviews and I'm happy to discover that, no, I'm NOT going crazy! Hamilton's books have been declining. I think she's trying to whip them out so fast she's not really concentrating on the plot. She's losing so much focus. I can see where she wants to go with both series, but at the rate she's going, she won't get there for another 7 books. The unsidhe court is going thru a time warp, but I wish Hamilton didn't feel she had to drag the reader with it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's deja vu all over again","review":"If you don't feel like actually buying the book but you want to keep up with the story line, here's my suggestion: just read Book 3 again. Because the plot is literally at a stand-still and doesn't advance even one step in this installment. Example:- situation with Cel = nothing happens- situation with Sholto = nothing happens- situation with the goblin twins = nothing happens- situation with the Seelie Court = nothing happens- situation with Merry getting a king = nothing happensetc. etc. etc.Am I pissed off about waiting a year with baited breath for what amounts to an issue of Penthouse Forum? Yes. I'm all for sex scenes, but how about we break some of those scenes up with some actual plot once in awhile. Is that too much to ask? Apparently, it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continues to cater to the lowest common denominator...","review":"I give up -- I'll be saving my money from now on. Hamilton just can't get past her current trend of using her female characters as vehicles for her lame sex fantasies, and I'm BORED, BORED, BORED. You can't even like these people, in this series or the Anita Blake novels, both of which illustrate Hamilton's lack of scholarly versatility. Different clothes, different color hair, same slutty character. Sad to see a good writer deteriorate to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment!","review":"As the other reviewers have stated, I also have been a long time Laurell K. Hamilton fan and this book was a HUGE disappointment. There is no plot, many questions are raised and none are answered. It read like a printed political discussion and was, in my opinion, a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and Gratifying Read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the latest Merry Gentry novel. Politics and Intrigue among the Unseelie Sidhe provide the back drop for Princess Merideth's further adventures as she dodges assassination attempts and the workings of enemies from both her bloodline, the Seelie Sidhe and unknown malefactors who may be targeting both Sidhe Courts. There is a wealth of sensual detailing and luscious erotic encounters as Merry plays conduit for the Goddess and is awakening ancient powers long lost among those who look to her. As well, Merry is in a race to prove her fertility against that of her cousin by getting with child, because to lose means not only her own demise but that of her people. Beautiful interweaving of relationships between Merry and the other characters in the book. I was a very satisfied reader. The only thing I could have wanted was MORE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unsatisfied","review":"Just finished the book 10 minutes ago and I have to add on to the other reviews that were also disappointed with this installment of the MG series.I can't find fault with the sex scenes but what makes this a great series is the political negotiation, the subplots and the rich character development. All these were missing from \\"A Stroke of Midnight\\".I would seriously read all reviews of Book 5 - \\"Mistral's Kiss\\" before even considering reading the next book myself. If it doesn't rate a minimum of 4 stars, I will probably give it a miss and drop LKH from my preferred authors list."},{"rating":"1","title":"the reader is annoying","review":"I slammed the last book for changing the pronunciation of names because it was jarring to the listener. I removed 2 stars. This time I am removing 4 stars. The name pronunciation stayed the same but an accent was added to Doyle/Dole/whatever his name is, since it changes...In the previous book there is a section where the author literally (and I mean literally) states that Doyle has no accent and Meredith had never heard it before, until he was stressed out or excited or something... I don't recall what it was, I think it was when he changed into an animal for the first time in centuries. Then the accent goes away as he gets back his control - again, specifically stated by the author. This novel, has him using the accent constantly and it drives me nuts. The reader is the same as the last novel so there shouldn't even be the excuse that she didn't know. Take some pride in your work. yeesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"I continue to be disappointed with her latest books","review":"I really enjoyed LKH's books up until a year or two ago, when both series degenerated into a lot of sex scenes and much less plot. This book is sadly more of the same. I found myself getting bored an hour into it. LKH can write great books but I don't think this was one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stroke of midnight","review":"great story. The auhur is an excellent story teller. She forgets nothing. Everyone has their own personality. You cannot put down this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually deleted this from my Kindle mid-book.","review":"Everyone else pretty much summed this book up. Sex. So no longer is the book about anything actually interesting. I thought it would be an interesting book but it wasn't. LKH is no longer an author I will be paying to read. Her books are all the same a woman feels the need to be a complete tramp the entire time and blames it all on something she can not control. PATHETIC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly frustrating. Laurell, you are testing my patience.","review":"I was incredibly disappointed with this novel. The story moved absolutely nowhere. I keep going back to Ms. Hamilton for my faerie-fix, and I enjoyed her third book in the series, even though there was so much sex even I found it harder to swallow (no pun intended). When I bought the fourth installment of her series, I expected her to take a break from the gratuitous sex and maybe let the plotline develop....for example, LET HER GO TO THE SEELIE COURT! But instead, not only does she do more of the same, she decides to make all 300-plus pages about one 24 hour period! I literally screamed in frustration. Sure, some cool goddess manifestations happen, but sheez. To me, it almost seemed like she didn't know where to go with the story, so she just threw more sex in. Ms Hamilton: You tried a new method. We are not amused. PLEASE get back to the plot. And give Doyle's character more pages. He's the best guard *smirk*."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I still bother?","review":"Once upon a time I liked Hamilton's books. I've been displeased lately and I truly regret buying this one. The editing was better than her last books, but when that's something to be grateful for you know something is wrong. The book is softcore porn, it's as simple as that. Buy the book if you want that, save your money otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a waste","review":"I don't want to be harsh. really I don't. But this is too much.....What are LKH's editor(s) doing? Shouldn't somebody tell her to stop babbling and go on? Yes, this book surely has enough smart and exotic sex scenes. But I didn't buy it to see a porno with almost NO plot and too much sex!It does starts with a murder case, but they don't solve it. The murderer's out in the end but not because anybody tried.All in all, this is a waste. A waste of time, money, and LKH herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot?","review":"The first Merry Gentry novel was a great Who-dunnit. The following novels began to slow to a stand still. Where is the Story in this story? As erotic prose Ann Rice does it better and still delivers a plot. It would be a welcome change if the characters ate a meal or had a non-foreplay conversation. I am not sure I will bother with the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with the story already","review":"I loved this series first couple of books...but Anita and Meredith are going in the same direction Sex, Sex, and more sex, the story is dead last.I love the sex in her books but this one was so over whelming with sex that it got boring. I was listening to it on CD for a 4 hour trip and it was putting me to sleep, which her books have never done in the past.It was easy to tell what was going to happen most of the time and there was no mystery...Not to mention that she changed some of the facts. I double checked and in the last book she had healed Reese's eye, but in this on he was back to being blinded and disfigured.LKH should get back to writing the really great books like Circus of the Dammed, Obsidian Butter Fly, A Kiss of Shadows, and A Caress of Twilight."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Review For A Stroke Of Midnight","review":"I think that this book carried on longer than it should. A good chuknk could've been cut out of this, and one sex scene was a little over the top and completely unrealistic. A lot of the scenes in this book seem to drag pointlessly on and on and on, like the descriptions for example. It would go from someone's hair, to their eyes, how the color of their eyes or hair contrasted with other colors. The it would go to another person's eyes and hair and how those contrasted with other colors. This book started off really well with the press conference, and finding out about the murders...but then the murders kinda get dropped for the rest of the book until the last chapter they get brought up again. I seriously think this book could've been written better. I almost considered not finishing it because the chapters carried on way too long. I did like, however how the different little things ths sithen did for Meredith helped with the story later as the book drug on and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition to Merry-verse","review":"I absolutely loved this book. The reader is given more insight into the Sidhe world, and the newer characters are intriguing. I only had a couple of problems with this book.1. The infamous 3 chapters long sex scene. A little on the boring side.2. The book just wasn't long enough.Ater the disaster that was ID, I must admit I was a little scared to read this book. I love Merry and her Merry Men so much, I didn't want to start hating them like I did in the world of Anita. Well, LKH has gotten back on track (here's hoping she stays there) with this book. If you love Merry, Doyle, Frost, and all the other hunks of Fairie, you'll enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one","review":"Lately, Hamilton's books have been a little hard to read. Not enough action, except in the bedroom. I was a little disgusted with this entire series and was determined to not read her books anymore. Then I started over at the beginning, and realized that this woman can really write. Her story pulls you in and you're rooting for Merry, Doyle, Rhys, Galen, Kitto, and Frost. I actually can't decide which one I want to be King. Sure, some readers have trouble with the overt sexuality, but come on, much of the sex is behind closed doors. She really only has three sex scenes in a 300-400 page book. I really, like the books and would you suggest you buy all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book.","review":"I browse through the Hamilton books of late. I can't bring myself to pay for such drivel. If I can't find anything but sex and stupidity, I put it back on the shelf.I haven't bought any of her last four books. Laurell Hamilton: the John Norman for the Seelie Court."},{"rating":"2","title":"soothing sounds to create a calming atmosphere","review":"This CD is all original music. I was expecting something similar to classical music or jazz, but it's more like easy listening combined with nature sounds. As a baby, my daughter used to have trouble falling to sleep so I thought some soothing music might help. When she was crying uncontrollably she couldnt hear it so it didn't change her mood, but when she listened to it she did relax more. It didn't always put her to sleep, but it made the atmosphere more calm. Now that she's 2 she will identify all the sounds she hears; birds, water, etc. I would recommend it for anyone who's looking for a cd of soothing background music. My favorite song is track number 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought we have evolved past this in Society.","review":"This book is a disgrace, it is everything that is wrong with America. Mayhem, imoral behavior and chaos are not entertaining. The author is a cave man with a a good vocabulary. He seems to think that being a brute, beating people up, and being sexually reckless are entertaining. The other thing that sucks about this book other then all the angry white man attitude and violence, is that the reader is subjected to Mr. Tenaglia's warped views on art and politics (He is and out of work actor, he hates the Democrats and the Republicans, and he can't stand organized religion). If half of what goes on in this book is true, (and from the amount of fine detail given,it must be) then the writer needs to be put in jail for a number of crimes and civil rights violations, or at the very least given therapy.

The protagonist of the story is a guy named Billy D., who's an actor/brawler/construction worker/passionate guy. We follow him through the guts of the city in his search for life, liberty and happiness ON HIS TERMS! You'll either love the guy or hate him. This book is for anyone who has a dream and wants to make it happen. Anti-Hero will inspire you, make you laugh, make you angry and maybe even change your view of the world.

The warning on the cover was not true I was not offened by the sex or th violence.The bigest thing I came away with was a desire/fantasy to meet the writer for a late night drink. I mean one minute you're in the middle of a fistfight on a Manhattan street, the next minute your hearing a political rant that would make Dennis Miller jealous, and the next minute he says something so poetic you're stopped in your tracks.

In this, you are playing a prequel so you find out somethings that happened before the first game that gives a backstory to the original game. It's hard to find anything that is wrong with the game, it's fun, the music sounds great and the graphics are amazing. For one of the first games to be released on 360, it's amazing. I read that the graphics will be even better on games by this time next year so if that's true, it will be amazing. Back on topic, I really do recommend this game if you are a FPS fan.

If you can find it in a bargain bin then it may be worth the investment. I like First Person Shooters, and was looking forward to this one. However, I found it to be rather lame. The graphics are only so-so. Voice acting is terrible. You can only hold at most three weapons at one time.Some of the levels are actually much better than others, so it isn't all bad. Also, it is fun to play deathmatch. However, I have only been able to get four levels on deathmatch.You can play with 15 bots which is fun. Also there are some hovercraft thingees that are neat and don't run out of ammo.All in all, I am glad that the games on the 360 have improved. If this was my first game I would probably trade in my 360 for something else. I would suggest playing other games first and wait for this title to go down further in price.What I'd pay: $5.00 or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Dark N64 was way better","review":"First off, its almost 2008, and I just bought this game.

The AI is a joke, and the controls are, well, its hard to describe but basically they suck. It just doesn't feel right.The biggest disappoint I have is that this game taints my wonderful memories of PD for N64. Now that was an awesome game. Playing PD N64 with my siblings was the best.

But after seeing it under the \\"recommended for you\\" category on Amazon, I felt compelled to warn others to NOT buy this game.As a person who LOVED Perfect Dark 64, I was thoroughly underwhelmed by this game. I cannot describe what a totally different game it is. I'm not sure if Rare lost their talent, but man- it is different, and NOT in a good way. This game has frustratingly poor level design- it's laughable. It's so bad that if you don't move for five seconds, arrows light up on the ground to send you in the right direction. That should NOT be necessary. The plot is pretty cliched- it's not helped that it's a prequel, but it IS thoroughly predictable, particularly towards the end. Of course, Carringtonn makes an appearance- with a thick Scottish accent not present in Perfect Dark 64 in any form whatsover.Online play is extremely mediocre too.Avoid this game.

The characters are truly annoying. I could see the theme they were going for here: a mix of 1960's spy movie camp with futuristic overtones and settings. It failed on all fronts. The main character looks like some annoying, arrogant super model ***** who you wouldn't pay to be around.The dialogue is equally as bad, campy and lame. It really becomes annoying to hear anyone talk after like the 5th or 6th level. I don't even care to remember the name of them just that I was annoyed.What is really strange is that this game's lameness sticks with you after you've gotten rid of it.

I didn't get past the 2nd mission before I felt the need to put it down and never put myself through that again.

The controls are rubbish and the reticle has to be so spot on, that it's just plain tedious. Maybe I am a HALO NERD, that's fine, but I will wait for the return of the MASTER CHIEF. Ms. Dark is pretty, but she lacks heart, agility, and controllability. I think we are reaching the point in game development where companies are surrendering gameplay for graphics. PDZ makes me sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"good bang","review":"I was a little concerned about buying this because I thought a girl character and the low price would make this a likely whimpy game, but in fact this game was great bang for the buck. A really good shooter that was good fun and very reasonably priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash.","review":"That word explains this game to a T. The Graphics are Gamecube, the Story is retarded, & the multiplayer is Embarrassing. Why in God's name would Microsoft put out a game that clearly was not anywhere next to finished? This is a poor excuse for a FPS. There are way better games out there; Halo 3, COD 2,3,4, Orange Box, Fear, Bioshock,.... Avoid this game at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is for Five year olds...cheezy graphics....","review":"This game is terrible. True it is sort of new and inventive. But gameplay is terrible, graphics are equiv. to regular Xbox. I have purchased this game in package just to get the Xbox 360. Also stay away from ridge racer (terrible driving game, the worst i have ever played) driving physics are non existent and gameplay is designed for five year olds. Perfect Dark Zero is also terrible. All of these games have received great reviews. I dont know how? All have graphics dated back to the original Xbox!!!! Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Set Reckoning !","review":"Dead Reckonong is an ideal introduction to the talents of Kieran Kane. Recorded in 1994 with Dead Reckoning label partners including Mike Henderson (guitars), Tammy Rogers (fiddle) and Harry Stinson (drums) providing support, the tracks on \\"ead Reckoning are well structured, sung, arranged and played and effortlessly cross the alternative country, roots, folk and rock boundraries with precision and ease. Overall, Dead Reckoning is extremely user friendly and will satisfy fans of contemporary singer song writers and those (like myself) who need to add some more twang and rockin' pedal steel to their CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Americana Album","review":"Kieran Kane has been a great Americana writer and performer for some time, and this is one of his best; strong songs played by a talented group of musicians. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one good song, Ramblin' Man","review":"I ordered this album because of the Ramblin' Man cut by Kieran Kane on the Steel Rails anthology of railroad songs. This was a great song, but the rest of Dead Rekoning was in a completely different style--more of a pedestrian country genre. It is just like the musical Cats. There is one great song at the end, but the rest of the music seemed to be created by a completely different person. If you like Kane's Ramblin' Man, and I really do, get Steel Rails and get a lot of other good songs in the bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaver that doesn't shave...","review":"I purchased the shaver for some of those big'n'bobbly sweaters/cardigans and this shaver could not even trim them. The motor on the razor slows down everytime it had to cut something, causing it to barely work. The casing for the shaver is badly put together and feels like it is going to fall apart any second. The end of the handle where you insert the batteries is weak and could easily break, causing your batteries to be stylishly taped in. I would never purchase this product again. A plug-in shaver may be a better purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I was furious upon receiving this item to see how feeble, cheap looking and feeling it was. For ten more bucks I should have purchased a shaver from Sharper Image instead of this pretend brand. The plastic container feels like it can be cracked in my palm, the battery topper gets jammed, the blades work when they feel like rotating, not when you want them to, and you are never sure that hitting \\"on\\" switch will provide any results; in another words a nightmare.I thought I was saving money, and they don't refund shipping charges, so even upon return of this horrible product you end up losing a few bucks. Never again am I buying anything form this brand.It seriously cut one ball of my sweater, and my clothes aren't even that worn, I was simply looking for something that would defuzz it gently but this did not work.Do not waste time and money on this, as you can read the reviewer below me had the same issue so it is clearly a bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"I have purchased this and to my grave dissapointemnt this product does not work.

There is one corner of the cage they sometimes use as a bathroom when they should not.. this has stopped completely since I hung this toy in that corner. I had been putting a plush ferret sleeping bag there for the same effect, but the ferret with the stealing tendencies would always drag it away.

I bought just about every jingly ball toy at PetCo but unless I was shaking it right in front of them they never really seemed to care about it. I bought 2 of these, 1 for their cage and 1 for their play pen and they love them. From the 4 hours they have been in the cage I noticed they seem to ignore them until they get brushed or bumped and the toy makes noise. After the investigate it and it makes more noise they get hooked. Eventually it turns into a tug of war and both my ferrets go crazy when it snaps back. No other toy has captured their attention so quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"I love history and science and I thought this book was a good mix of the two. The first couple chapters are a little technical but informative and understandable. I loved reading how diseases altered the histories of empires, info that you might not necessarily read in just a straight up history book.I also really enjoyed the look at work that is presently underway to prevent future pandemics such as the avian flu and the work being put in to curb the continued spread of HIV and find an eventual cure. The stories contained in these pages makes you appreciate the period we live in and all the contributions and sacrifices made by the researchers that came before us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good review of viruses","review":"this is more of a historical book than a scientific book. It tells how viruses have changed history and talks about how history might have been if a plague did not happen. It is for a reader with a nonscientific background, as it has two chapters on basic immunology and viral characteristics. Overall, it has been an informative and well written book, although at some times dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I was not impressed by this book. I admit I have, so far, only glanced at it. What I found was:- one factual error: Sherlock Holemns was based on Prof Joeseph Bell not Dr Charles Bell- a very cursory description of the history and recent outbreak of the Ebola virus. I would expect Time magazine to have a better article;- an exetremely cursory description of Hantaviruses. The Field Guide to Germs by Wayne Biddle does it better;- avarege descriptions of the histories of \\"classic\\" infectious diseases such as yellow fever. I recommend Plague, Pox & Pestilence by Kenneth F. Kipple (Ed.) for an excellent lay introduction to the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!","review":"My Children love the Rescue Rangers.....I ordered both seasons and they arrived together on time and in perfect condition....Who knew that Chip and Dale would offer hours of family enjoyment and entertainment?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Disney Series","review":"I was looking forward to this series on DVD a slight bit more than Ducktales. The video quality is alright but there's occasional speakles onscreen and a bit of artifacting in the digital image. Either way it's pretty good, I'm glad to own at least part of the series! The covers are really nice and also include the old art images from the original VHS tapes. To those worried about the lack of the original pilot movies, I'm fairly confident it will apear on a later volume, but probably only in the multi-episode format. I hope Talespin and Darkwing Duck are next on Disney's list for DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not \\"Complete\\"","review":"This is a fine set for any kid. But not for fans. No, this set is lacking the first four episodes that establish the characters. For baffling reasons, the folks at Disney decided not to include these episodes.

We onely have 5 episodes on a disc because of the different languages that have to be on the disc.

The character of Gadget became so popular that Disney created a ride for her at Disneyland & Tokyo Disneyland - the only TV themed attraction!!

The teaching given might be fine if you are the only photographer within a thousand mile radius of Podunk.

If you can wear this, congratulations. The apple and melon are REALLY nice, reminding me of the best quality of Coty's Exclamation & Coty's Forbidden Fruit. I like smelling this on others, even if I can't stand the egomaniacal celeb.There is something freaky about the juice that doesn't sit well. For me, there's a chemical note in Paris Hilton that when I sniff it, it's almost like it jabs my sensitive back molars. There's a metallic taste to it too. I frequently have problems with white florals, but it's not the jasmine & tuberose causing it. It's something else. If it wasn't for that freaky note, I would wear this regularly, in spite of the white florals.I so wish that this worked for me, even if the flacon is 1970s Avon tacky.

It would seem the shelf life has expired, or it came from a bad batch. It smells like most perfumes eventually do after sitting for some time- cheap and like rubbing alcohol. I would have sent it back, but Amazon does not allow for perfume returns. I am a frequent Amazon customer, yet this is my first time writing an Amazon review, so obviously I feel motivated to do so. For the first time, I am disappointed with Amazon.

This is a pleasant, soothing game that is a little challenging, mostly fun to play at the same excitement level as reading a book to a child or coloring a picture. Not as frenetic as Freddi Fish.

However, the author acts as an authority, yet trips on her own mistakes. For instance, her heavy suggestion that a VR owner hire a professional writer or editor is overshadowed by the fact that shehas numerour grammatical and punctual errors in that very section of the book! Overall, the meat of the book is a bit lean. She touches on many good points lightly. The author is now employed by a VRBO website: i.e., she's making her living not just as a vacation rental owner, but now working for a website which advertises the VRBOs. That to me underscores that she is willign to go where the money is, and may not necessarily be the expert she portrays herself to be. Some great ideas here, but not to be taken as the \\"bible\\" of the VRBO world by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read for Vacation Property Owners","review":"I am closing on my vacation property in a few weeks.

In fact, it has been proposed in 1940s by Abraham Maslow in his hierarchy of needs. Maslow's argued that human behaviors are motivated by a series of needs, and are hierarchical in nature. If I understand correctly what Maslow had proposed and applied the same theory to this book, in fact what we are seeing is the execution of satisfying the needs on love/belonging and esteem. This is why an employee will prefer public recognition anytime compare to bonuses, since money, to a large degree, is use to satify the human needs for food and shelter only, which is at the lowest hierarchy of all human needs. The book carries no new theory of human behavior, but a new way in reminding managers that employees are human, and do satisfy human needs in the hierarchical form."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"didnot like this one as much as emotions....

It doesn't matter whether you call it \\"country\\" or \\"blues\\", this music has an edge to it as jagged as a broken beer bottle. That no one has reviewed this album before confirms one of my worst fears: the fear that there are a lot of great records out there that I'm not hearing.

The first two Tortoise albums stood out for their extremely sparse and dry sound but on TNT, the production is much lusher and the group fills up a lot more of the sonic space. New elements like IDM and lounge music mix with the traditional Tortoise trademarks (twangy guitars, cinematic grandeur, chugging rhythms, chiming tuned percussion). The album is all over the map stylistically but manages to weave a coherent tapestry of sound. Definitely a fun album to listen to whether you are studying, driving, or simply watching the old lava lamp.[This review is based on the 1998 CD; I have not heard the latest reissue.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid all around","review":"A very solid record, not a bad track found here. This is not music you would listen to with friends, but it is perfect for mornings or evenings alone as well as for driving at night. I think the song \\"the Equator\\" is the finest electronic song I have ever heard. I imagine this would be the music that would play in the background of a movie as someone ran through the rain forest at night. Very vibrant and imaginative textures. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Varieting album","review":"Tortoise has done it again. They have created an album you can listen to way forward into the new millenium. At first they start out nearly Can like with guitar minimalism, later in the album Steve Reich like with the xylofones. They are bit more jazzy on this album than they use to be, but that clearly comes in their advance as the album progresses. Clearly a step forward for Tortoise and for music in generel."},{"rating":"2","title":"F'ing A","review":"This cd is really good. I like it a lot.

The sounds build upon each other to create a shimmering, yet somehow rock solid, edifice. The first time I played this disc, I felt that the songs were already in my head, that the disc was somehow drawing them OUT OF rather than forcing them INTO my consciousness. I thought I would chafe at the drum and bass and other \\"dance\\" elements, but they are seamlessly integrated, a completely natural progression and extension of the band's sound. I've never seen them live, but I will make it a personal mission to do so after hearing this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chef's Choice Ice Cream Cone Holder","review":"This ice cream cone holder is very helpful.

Unlike Hong Kong B movies, this title has not only poor acting, poor lines, and crappy camera work, but also surprisingly bad picture quality. I kept thinking that I could have done a better job with an analog video camera from 1988.The \\"action\\" in the movie is bordering on the ridiculous. For example in the opening scene the main character easily overwhelms a half a dozen guards with a suppressed pistol, even though all of the guards were within ten or so yards of each other. This is followed by an execution scene that borders on the comical. And it doesn't get any better.Short version: save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage!!","review":"Apart from the weak plot, I find the fighting scenes to be poorly Choreographed, not to mention the acting which leaves a lot to be desired!!Most importantly, I find it incredible that this piece of junk was actually on 1080p format as the picture and audio qualities were far below that of standard DVD's!!I actually threw my copy in the GARBAGE after patiently watching the first 15 minutes of this trash.

Boring, short, and completely useless. You could make something up on your own and it would be better.

And now, with the release of \\"Waking Up,\\" I can't help but keep singing along. Bethany's music is REAL, striking me with a heart-wretching reality--- reminding me to hang on to my Joy. The album titled song \\"Waking Up\\" reflects a dynamic relationship with God that is present in her debut album with \\"Beautiful\\". In Bethany's new cd you hear awe-struck, God affirming messages develop in her lyrics, voice, and talent as a strong Christian artist that began early on in her career. Its no wonder to see her three albums work to reveal the most miniscule wonders of God. I am ever-so greatful to hear living and inspired words embodied in Bethany Dillon's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bethany is an inspiration","review":"Bethany Dillon filled the void that was left in me after Jennifer Knapp kinda fell out of the music scene.

For one thing the playibility is horrible and performing a single regular move like a suplex is immpossible. Hell every move is immpossible because if you are facing the computer, the other charcter will constantly grab you while you are trying to perform your moves. Also what really sucks, is the hidden wrestlers. I like the roster but the wrestlers dont sport their own signature moves just someone elses. For example Roddy Piper is a hidden character and his finisher is called \\"the Piper Clutch.\\" What this moves is what I remember is Chris Benoit's Crippler Crossface. To put in hardcore terms DONT EVEN RENT THIS GAME. If you must then I say let the buyer and the renter BEWARE."},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS ON THIS ONE","review":"There are many better wrestling games than Nitro. The control is flat out poor.

The character's are realistic looking, and there are some cool finishing moves on this game, but the hidden character's are hard enough to get. I suggest, getting the code, or the player's guide, so you can actually do there moves as well. Another flaw on this game, is that it was rushed out! Right after Revenge came out, Nitro was released. Not a good comparasin."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game was the reason I stopped watching WCW","review":"Seriously, grab your shovels and let's bury this one because it totally bites! WCW/NWO Nitro is easily the worst game ever and I'm seriously talking about EVER!! No other game that I've ever played was this bad!Graphics = poor, sloppy, ugly and generally funny looking. Gameplay = a big fat 0 because the game is not fun. All you can really do (unless you're God) is kick, punch and taunt because the computer pulls off any moves with ease while you are stuck struggling trying to figure out this game's terrible move configuration. Replay = another big fat 0. Nothing great here at all because of it's complicated and frustrating gameplay.If you want any of the WCW games, I would suggest WCW/NWO or WCW/NWO REVENGE because those are just better games, easier to play and they look a lot better. Don't waste your time and don't be fooled by the name. Just because this is a WCW game, doesn't mean you get the same WCW quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"Got it as a birthday present for my wife but was not happy with what I got.

Any fans of anime or 70s cop movies will get a lot of enjoyment out of this one, I know I did!Episode 2 is also worth checking out, although not as good as this one.

In fact, I have no hesitation in saying that these two films are their worst. Africa Screams was their first film. Hence, they're not the stars of the film.

Gotthard is one of those bands that you really can rely on to deliver the goods time after time. I can easily recommend anything by these guys but this album is my personal favourite at the moment. The songwriting is great and the production is superb. As always I must mention the intense vocals of Steve Lee - he has got to be one of the greatest singers of all time. He delivers his vocals with so much passion that it makes the hairs stand up on the back of your neck all the time! He is equally at home singing ballads or rockers and will impress even the harshest critics. Highly recommended to melodic rock fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"There's almost nothing in this book that I could find useful.

This is mixtape material, not the classic sound we are accustomed to hearing. I think Canibus really needs to sit down and choose what direction he wants to going in.

In my opinion Margaret's Story comes from an era years ago when Ms Price was at her best writing. Although the Civil War is becoming an increasingly common subject for fiction, M.S. is set in North Florida, a state that many forget was part of the Confederacy. Ms. Price chronicles generations of this state's history, from Indian wars into Reconstruction, through the eyes of the factual woman Margaret Fleming. Here Ms Price is at her best with characterizations-they're more full-blooded here than in any other of her novels. The story is often tragic but never boring. The character is one with whom the reader cannot help but follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of pastel sticks broken in pieces, not happy!","review":"I found this set at the local art store with the price $94.00 something, so when I found this on Amazon with 54.99 I was really happy to buy it.

My favorite story is \\"the Stolen Scent\\" and I realise how much reading the stories when I was a child gave me an idea on how to base my ideas.This is a must read!!

Mad Catz does deliver quite well with that in mind. Their Pro Advanced Controller works like a charm. It is simple and easy to operate for anybody who needs a spare controller. It also is a little cheaper than the actual cost of a standard Playstation 2 controller. While so many people would rather consider a Sony PS2 controller, most third-party companies don't give out adequate controllers as well. This controller Mad Catz created for the PS2 is a really good purchase.Convience: B+Price: A-Overall: B 1/2+"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Bad controller","review":"I warn all the people interested in buying this controller, DONT BUY IT!! This controller is absoluteley awful. Buy this controller and I can garuntee you will be dissappointed. First off, it doesnt feel good in your hands, its too big and bulky and it is too heavy. I had the controller for 2 weeks and the START button doesnt even work. And the buttons dont respond quick enough. Worst freaking controller ever. Dont buy it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great controller, only a few problems.","review":"I rated it 4/5 for very small reasons, the R2 button is a bit messed up, and the picture for the item is misleading as the actual controller was black, but still was a bit see-through on the handles.Other then that, it just takes a few minutes to dismantle it and fix it.It's in great condition, and I plan to buy more products from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk. Buy any other controller for your PS2.","review":"Worthless controllers made by a company that doesn't stand behind its products. In fact, I would give this product 0 stars if I could.I bought 2 of these contollers. Within 2 days of purchase, I started noticing problems on one controller's left analog stick. (It wouldn't respond when moved left.) Four days after that, the other one's left stick started move the character by itself. It was quite amusing to watch characters moving in circles by themselves.Since then, the start button went on one. The other's 4-way controller's up stopped working. Sometimes buttons are slow to respond.I sent an email to the Company, Madcatz, for information and/or an address to get these obvious defective controllers replaced and got no response.Will never waste money on anything this company has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT!

BE CAREFUL to read the suggested product, in my case the filters that I ordered do not come close to being the correct ones for my vacuum. Make sure you don't take for granted that the selected products are correct, I made this mistake. I'm sure this product will work fine, but I will not be able to use it to know for sure.

Text dropping happens regardless of text size selected, so the only way to see what was dropped is to constantly toggle between different text sizes and different pages.

I'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong, but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient Sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol.

A fun title, a delightful cover, a goldmine of raw material, but then the actual text is so very tedious. This book could have been thoughtful, but it's not. It is just a few hundred index cards assembled into a book. Incompently hundreds of obvious connections are not drawn. This book could have been amusing, but again and again stories that could have kept the reader in stitches are rendered in text that that has lost the ironic delight I bet their original sources had. The authors of numerious encyclopedias are weeping in their graves. Only the most dedicated reader will find some slight pleasure in this now doubled irony. The book could have been scholarly, but the absense of careful footnotes and careless about the materials leaves the scholar afraid that this is just tainted with urban myths that have rattled down the the ages over beers at the pub after Latin class.

All other cdrs that i leave in my car get ruined by the heat. The black cdrs are not exactly the \\"nicest-looking\\" cdrs on the market, but they are SUPERB in terms of performance.

However, there is something you should look out for. Whenn buying, look for ones that have a somewhat rough surface and a foam ring insert on the very top.

Memorex used to be a really good brand for media, but their CD-Rs just keep getting flimsier and flimsier. I got these because the old black labels were really thick and lasted a long time. They also held up great to scratching. The new ones are cheap and the top often peals off which is even worse then a scratch on the bottom. These seem to be as flimsy and cheap as the regular ones except black. I would now choose a different media such as TDK, but unfortunately my old car stereo only prefers Memorex for some reason.The last 100pk spindle of Memorex CD-Rs I got werent black but seem the same. Almost everyone has the top peeling or flaking off somewhere eventhough they were kept in a case most of the time. And again, when the top peels off it seems to be much worse than a scratch (Data is completely lost). Too bad a great brand turned to crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality - hard to label","review":"I haven't had a bad CD in the bunch yet, and the black color is very classy looking. However, since the entire CD is black, there's no place to write a label!

Their first album was cutting edge, and their sound defiantly unique, but to be able to go back in the studio and pull off not the same feat, but a greater one, is simply phenomenal. The new album sees the band sounding more dynamic and soulful than ever before. The opening track, \\"Welcome To The North\\", has that exhilarating underworld sound we couldn't get enough of on their first album. Other tracks, like the solidly infectious \\"Guide\\" and the radio favorite \\"Breakin'\\" introduce a more straightforward, catchy sound that so easily gets stuck in your head. A few songs see the tempo drop, and the grand finale \\"Open Your Mind\\" is beautiful epic of honesty and empowerment.

I tried to exchange it, but it was too late, past the stores policy or whatever so I took it to my local repair guy.

I've found the bass boost burns batteries, so if you are on a budget, better keep that and the anti-skip stuff off. And like others, I've noticed that the anti-shock flakes a little, but ONLY when the batteries are getting low. Fresh batteries = good as new.

Well there's plenty of opportunities in this book!I now have to learn inline CSS which I believe might have been covered to some extent in this book. I can't remember. That's how badly I want to forget this book!

The books are about 3\\"X3\\" and the box it was shipped in was about 8\\"X10\\"X4\\" and stuffed with paper. This cost around $7!

Had a vague recollection of a book by Robin Cook and borrowed it from my local library. Then decided to check out Amazon.com for a movie and voila! Just bought the video & watched it this weekend. IT IS BETTER THAN THE BOOK!! Probably because the movie is a visual feast. Also, the heroine is less pathetic than in the book and there's no jerk of a boyfriend to cloud things up! I found it interesting to see how dated the male actors looked (hair, clothes) but Lesley Ann Warren was stunning and up-to-date elegant. The movie is a complete treat for those fascinated by ancient Egyptian history and artifacts. And the scenes in the Cairo Museum are marvelous. And the feluccas sailing in the Nile so beautiful and romantic. AND..on and on! Enjoy one and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great views of Egypt!

Finally, this year it was produced and I ordered it from Amazon the last week of November. However, when I received my copy, the DVD stopped and was totally blank after 11 seconds. All it contained was the video pirating message. I returned it easily and Amazon promptly send a replacement which also proved to be blank after exactly 11 seconds. I have sent it back for a refund. I do not fault Amazon, however, since both were brand new and still in the plastic wrapper. I assume this was an error in production and wonder how many blank DVDs there are out there. I'm also wondering when I will be able to order another DVD which actually contains the movie. Beware if you are ordering this DVD now. . . looks like there are still 37 left in this batch as of 12/7/11."},{"rating":"2","title":"Langella the Egyptologist!","review":"I was so glad to find this on DVD as my tape had begun to deteriorate.Wonderful adaptation of the Cook novel - I like the movie ending better than the book, unusual for a bibliophile like me.Wonderful cast, great story, mouthwatering locations, and - ooh- to be let loose in the props room after the movie.Langella is totally believable as the Egyptologist with a dark secret. Lesly Anne Down as the glam visiting historian is refreshing ans foreshadows some of the real lovelies working in Egypt today. Who wouldn't find her predicament interesting?Package arrived quickly; disc in excellent condition. Glad to have it in my collection and glad to recommend the vendor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I saw this movie when it was in theaters about 3 decades ago, it is a great pleasure to have access to it again. It combines mystery, charm and a lot of wonderful real views from 'today' Egypt (apart from the Valley of the Kings and king Tut tomb, which are fake)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good at all...","review":"Just read \\"Godfather\\" or \\"The Last Don\\". Or, for facts, Sammy Gravano's memoirs. \\"Gangster\\" just doesn't cut it. Carcaterra cannot mix action and quiet mob dignity skillfully enough to warrant his book a place next to Mario Puzo's ones. It's ironic, though, that when he wrote fiction which he tried to present as a \\"true story\\" (\\"Sleepers\\"), he wrote well, but now that he wrote fiction and labelled it as such, he couldn't make it as enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm... Can anyone say Godfather rip off???","review":"This book was awful. It's like the author chose a variety of other mafia books and combined them all into one. The part when the young protégé is sent to Sicily is priceless. Ironically, it reminded me of when Michael goes to Sicily under similar circumstances in Godfather I. The young man also falls in love with a girl named.... You guessed it, Appolonia.Save your money and wait for the T.V. mini-series (If any network will touch it).Come on Lorenzo, be more creative. You could have at least changed the names.Highly disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maudlin and unrealistic.","review":"Credibility? The author acknowledges the assistance of more than a dozen people in the writing of the book...and not a single one of them explained to him that the end of the barrel of a gun is called the \\"muzzle,\\" NOT the \\"nozzle.\\" Whenever someone looked down the \\"nozzle\\" of a handgun, I expected them to get extinguished with water.Sorry, folks, but something like this ruins the whole book. It's not a typo and it's not a minor error. It's evidence that the author doesn't really know what he's talking about and doesn't really care. All of the pontificating about the life of a \\"gangster\\" is basically crap.Of course, there are numerous other errors and problems with the book, but this is typical of the whole. The style is good...too bad about the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat sophomoric and shallow...","review":"As another reviewer mentioned, I also got off to at bad start when the author describes a raging World War I in the latter part of 1913. Naturally, that made me suspect to other facts in the story to follow. Certain events in the book were obviously \\"made for TV\\" events...the childbirth in the raging inferno, the \\"here Dad, shoot yourself\\" suicide of the Papa and the gunfight in the prostitute's bedroom were enough to make me roll my eyes and feel somewhat insulted. As a Puzo fan, and one who was looking forward to this read, I think when it comes out as USA Network's Mini-series of the Week, I'll flip the channel over to Emeril...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard Godfather","review":"This book explains why there are so many poorly written books on the market: when you read it, you realize that even you can do better. How 'bout howlers like, \\"...boiling under the surface, coiled like a...\\" --ever hear of mixed metaphors? Or \\"...muscle-thin, with jet dark eyes...\\" Huh? \\"muscle-thin\\"?? And what exactly are \\"jet dark eyes\\" other than a cliche, wrapped in a synonym. The characters are completely one-dimensional, the dialog is wooden and the story is preposterous. (Like gangsters who remain true to their wives. Didn't this guy ever watch the Sopranos? Goodfellas?) This guy doesn't have any idea about the world he's writing so badly about. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke or what?","review":"Reviewer: Ben Storey tells it like it is. Please read his review before buying.The characters are preposterous.

At 12 and 15 they are n charge of running//hiring/firing/collecting$s from a certain dock and all it's workers. I couldn't take any more than 100 pages. What a piece of junk. L. Carcaterra obviously knows neither children, NY 1906, nor gangsters.I do recommend his book Sleepers tho. I thought that was pretty good.Gangsters should of never been published. It's a disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many holes","review":"This book was filled will all the typical gangster cliches. And they were poorly written, as well as poorly tied together.

Well worth the time for any person who ejoys history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gangster...Incredible!!!","review":"I have never read any of Lorenzo Caracaterra's books. I also have never been really into very many novels. This story was in incredible journey. It was very well written and very easy to follow along. In fact, it was hard not to get sucked into his \\"Gangster\\" world and feel as though you are really a part of what is going on. It gave you a different view to see gangsters and not just killers. You see them as business men. You see them as corporate leaders. Must of the story what you would think it is. Then you start to see the story change. Before you know it, BAM! You get thrown for a loop and my jaw dropped to the ground. Even tho I saw it coming from the beginning, I never really did put it all together until the first words out of Mary's mouth towards the end. Then it all just made sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside the Life of a Gangster","review":"Carcaterra narrates the story of Angelo's (Bones') life in a way that draws the reader in, its almost like you're sitting in a dark bar when a stranger leans over and starts telling a story and everything else, the atmosphere, your drink, the conversation becomes a backdrop for a wonderful story. I could feel the ups and downs of the story as I observed the lives of Angleo and Pudge. I've read many books based on the mafia and gangsetrs including all of Puzo's novels but this is the best! As a matter of fact this is one of the best novels I've ever read. Thumbs up Carcaterra!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book!!!","review":"Wow! I just finished this book today and it was the best fiction mafia book ive ever read. Ive read all the Mario Puzo books and many non-fiction OC books and this was in my top 10!

I recommend this to anyone no matter what your interests are-its amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"To me this is a more personal story than the Godfather book.

I really wish I could send this one back and get a new complete book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just chick lit ---","review":"--- but New Age chick lit. Possibly the worst book I've ever read. Leaving out the clunky punctuation and bad grammar (several instances of \\"laying\\" instead of \\"lying\\"), and other manifestations of bad editing, the whole plot is preposterous. Unbelievable characters do incredible things. All the minority characters, black and Cherokee, are dazzlingly wonderful. Two or three older women/witches perform miracles of benign magic. There are lapses in the interior logic and anachronisms. The only interesting things in the book had to do with the the cult of snake handling and the resurgence of the Klan. So as literature this was wretched, but as sociology it was, if accurate, perhaps worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Superb","review":"I came across this novel quite by accident. I found the work in a small library and was immediately entranced by it. Pug's character came completely alive for me and I grew to love her more with each passing page. What an insight Mrs. Cline has given us into the life of the rural south. As a student of political science, the novel gave me a deep insight to the racist psychology of the turn of the century south."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent adventure story with a powerful message","review":"Sandra Cline is a talented new author who has produced a gem of a book. The narrative crackles with excitement and is embellished by magical realist techniques. Not only a great story, it also engages the social realities of the South, offering a liberating feminist and anti-racist viewpoint. This one will touch your heart and your mind. And it's very well edited.I look forward to any future work that Sandra Cline publishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly engaging read!","review":"Our book club chose this book as our September 2008 read, especially because Sandy Cline is a local author, and agreed to attend our discussion after we finished the book. What an amazing experience! We were able to really get a feel for Sandy's frame of mind and intentions while writing the book.I really enjoyed this book...it reminds me on several levels of To Kill a Mockingbird, one of my very favorite novels. The young southern protagonist, the racial themes, and the strong family influences are all reminiscent of Harper Lee's classic. Pug is a very memorable character, and her \\"sisters\\" all add a vital piece to the story. The plot has a lot of action, several surprising twists, and really pulls you along. I found myself breeezing through this book.Overall, I thought it was a great choice for our book club; it allowed for a very satisfying discussion of the central themes. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great review","review":"This book has helped my daughter understand and retain the math presented to her in 5th grade.

Unfortunately, the locking mechanism always grabs onto the rope, no matter what angle I try it at. This means that the load will not come back down. I've even tried the rope horizontally and it still catchese. The only way I can get the load back down from the ceiling is to climb on a ladder and hold the locking mechanism open manually.

This album, like the others features plenty of rockin' good times, but there's a sense of foreboding in nearly every track. The album's overall tone seems to carry a message that even if you're self-indulgent, you might still make it alright, but don't bet on it. It's this cautionary feel that inspires me to look at pictures of TV and movie hotties as a deterrent to self-indulgent behavior. The band members' belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since last spring on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"REPN IE IN THE H-TOWN","review":"I ADMIT....WHEN I FIRST MET THE DUDE I WAS HESITANT ABOUT BUYING A LOCAL ARTIST....HOWEVER...MY BOY CAME SO CORRECT AND I LOVE THIS CD..HOWEVER...I BROKE IT AND IM ON HERE TRYING TO GET ANOTHER COPY!! \\"HOWEVER DO U WANT IT!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"BASIC WESTCOAST RAP","review":"Finally, I cannot even begin to tell you have glad I am to see a fresh new record out the westcoast which isnt all about picking the \\"right\\" beats and get the hottest names to star on the record in order for itto sell!!Dirty Birdy is here, and he represents the hardcore, basic style of rapping that real rap fans will love and respect, plus love to listen to in a real respectful way.Dr. Stank is on this record!

Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt are great on guitars and vocals, singing rather than screaming, and while Rossi can't match Paul Rodgers, Derek St. Holmes, early Sammy Hagar, or Dave Peverett for soul, at least he's more pleasant to listen to than a guy like say, Kevin Dubrow, and has a wonderful sense of how to properly phrase a lyric. The band continues on the strong path begun with PILEDRIVER, proving that it's doubly unfair that the Quo never made it big over here.

It offers readers an insight into the philosophy behind the Awakening of our Divine Selves through the Sufi beliefs (a branch from Muslim tradition). The book wonderfully explains theories of our Universal existance, which offers readers the chance to obtain a larger perspective on Life itself; the insignificant day-to-day worries seem less intimidating and overall a greater appreciation for our higher purpose in life presents itself to those following along. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in expanding their spiritual scope and learn to view the world from an entirely new perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely read","review":"This book is definitely a good read. i was very pleased with my purchasing it.

The plot was built around a silly premise, and several idiotic notions. Cornell, as a character, seemed like a two-dimensional cardboard cut-out, and gave me absolutely no sense of feeling for him. At the end, I felt like I had been stuffed full of too much Sweet 'n' Low - the book had a few good ideas and themes stuffed in behind the rest, but not nearly enough to constitute anything of any real worth. However, out of everything bad I've said about the book, it earns an extra star because of the author's writing style. While I didn't enjoy the book, I did like the style of writing the author used to elaborate on those ideas. Unfortunately, this is one of Reed's better novels. Which isn't saying much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amen!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book...when you read it you feel as though you are there in the rice patties with Sarah running for your life. You can \\"hear\\" the sounds of war...the cries of death and the anquish that she must feel. As a Christian myself I can also see her go from non-believer to believer and the change it makes in her.

A few will stand out from all the others. Something about them makes you want to spend time with them, to get to know them more intimately, to learn from them. Sarah Lavine is like that. She is the main character of this book and, as I read the book, I found myself wishing I could sit down and talk to her, even if it mean sharing her very dangerous circumstances. Like the few people you've met who were worth knowing, Sarah has something at her core (in her soul) that is important, alive and true. She knows something that maybe you don't. So you need to spend time with her and learn from her. It's only 216 pages. It won't take you long. In fact, it's too short. It left me wanting to learn more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Debbie Allen","review":"I was lucky to see Debbie Allen in Sweet Charity when I was a teenager.

Unfortunately, it has been badly served by this edition; it's overpriced and lacking in quality. It doesn't have the 26 illustrations of the original; it doesn't even have the absolutely necessary map. Reading it is like watching a great movie without sound or captions. Fleming (Ian Fleming's brother, as it happens)would have had a well-turned phrase of damnation had he seen how this edition emasculates the original. I urge you to read the book, but not this way. Go online and buy a used copy of the hardback for not much more (over 50 copies were listed when I checked abebooks.com)and enjoy Fleming's travel saga as it deserves to be enjoyed. I feel cheated; readers should be informed when a reprint edition is, like this one, incomplete. My one star rating is not for the writing--its for this shoddy presentation of a great travel book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Anyone who's tired of 'following in the footsteps of...' and 'I skiied backwards down Everest' type of travel books, will find that this is a classic read. It's the tale of a rugged trip across the wilds of Qinghai and Tibet at a time when those places were among the most secluded in the world. Peter Fleming (whose brother is responsible for James Bond) and his Swiss partner Kini find both hardship and adventure - and manage to convey it all in down-to-earth but inspiring prose. I'd also highly recommend Peter Fleming's 'Brazilian Adventure', which further illustrates his intrepid nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than worthless","review":"First of all, this video was less than 10 minutes long.

Seregil and Mardus are among the coolest characters I know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"A magical adventurous fantasy which captures the imagination from the beginning till the end. Delightful, often humourous and rich in characters this is fantasy at its best. I dread fantasy series which goes on forever like the Wheels of Time. Hence I scanned through the reviews of the 3rd book before I decided to buy the series. Glad that I did. It was pure joy reading Luck in the Shadows. The story is so well written that your imagination just runs wild with each scene, each paragraph. Thank you Ms Flewelling for such a joyful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"When I started reading this book I thought it was going to be another epic story but it turned out to be pretty good. I like the way that Flewelling draws her world and the history behind it. Some of the characters such as Nysander and Alec are a bit predictable but I have hopes that the characters will develop through the trilogy.Flewelling keeps dropping hits about Seregil's past and we just want to learn more about it, doesn't always work for me, but it did this time.All in all a good and fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Newcomb is better","review":"What can I say? I seem to never be of the same mind with the majority of Amazon reviewers. I like Robert Newcomb yet a lot of people criticize him as being sexist yet take a female author who makes women the sole rulers the good guys and the bad guys as a male dominated society. For some reason I find my self baffled by the readers hypocrisy. At least Robert Newcomb made his characters more interesting then this hack of a writer.I find it laughable to be honest that the vast majority seem to turn a blind eye at the authors apparent sexism, men can't rule, women are better rulers, etc. Also the language usage in this book was so juvinile and just plain bad that it made me wonder how she even developed a fan base.Call me biased but I think Amazon reviewers are quick to criticize a decent writer over a bad writer who happens to make her characters so unlikable and dull that it makes me scratch my head and ask, why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, great characters","review":"Let me say this from the start, if you love Robin Hobbs, you will love this book and author. This book is drawn well from a character standpoint and not so much plot driven. Alec is the central character followed closely by Seregil who is my favorite character to come along in a long time. The plot is nothing too outlandish, but the plot is secondary and the relationship and growth of the characters is what draws you in. Yes, if you have read the reviews there is a hint of a gay relationship, but if that is something that concerns you I would say throw those concerns aside. It is a very minor part of the story and it is handled well."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"Read this book way back from the library, since then have the rest of the series so took advantage of ordering this copy to complete my set.

I recommend it to anyone that is looking for a passionate adventure. Rock out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rooting for the Rogue","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and am enjoying the series. It mixes fantasy, intrigue, politics, romance ... all the right ingredients in the right doses.The characters are excellent -- you may very well find yourself empathizing with characters you didn't think you could ever empathize with. I dislike the cliche' of the rogue epitomizing honor in such stories, and luckily this book doesn't quite stick to the formula. The rogue isn't quite honorable, but he does do the right thing when it counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional fantasy!","review":"This series is one of the best out there. Flewelling createsrich and complicated characters and settings, staying clear of stockplot points and instead weaving a wonderful world inhabited by real people. Alec and Seregil, our heroes, are entirely sympathetic even as they are not always admirable, and their friendship (and in later books relationship) is warm, wonderful, and all that one should be, regardless of sexual orientation.I HIGHLY recommend this series! Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fantasy series","review":"I chanced upon the Nightrunners series while I was ordering for the high school library for which I work. I read all three books and was pleased with the detailed and complex world in which these well thought-out characters live. The books were all entertaining and detailed with a thread of humor that I found very engaging. It was like meeting a new person and feeling as if you'd known them all your life. The issue of the relationship between Seregil and Alec is handled with the same good humor. It becomes simply another facet of these very fascinating characters. I am looking forward to reading more about this world and these people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average fantasy . . .","review":"Lynn Flewelling's Luck in the Shadows was the first fantasy novel I have read in a while, and I have to say I was suitably impressed. Her plot is engrossing with lots of unexpected twists and turns, and her characters are engaging and believable. She makes you care about what happens to her characters, namely Seregil and Alec, the heroes of the story. She also has several strong minor female characters in atypical roles such as soldiers and generals. The world in the story is carefully crafted with lots of detail, but not so much that the reader is bogged down with too much to remember. Overall, the details make it a very real, three-dimensional world that the reader is reluctant to come back from."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing debut novel.","review":"The book starts off with a bang and doesn't lose any steam until the end.

I especially liked Trent Latta (Norman) and Michael Lutz (Morris). The monster looked as good as any you'd see in the big-budget films. And unlike those East European films, there aren't any phony special effects.

I understand Canibus might be a great talent, but just accept the fact that Canibus doesn't have it in this particular album. AS an emcee he's only reached the level of mediocrity. I think this album pushed his level way down. None of his albums has ever surpassed even the slightest breakthrough status. Can-I-Bus lacked the production AND the album was monotonous throughout every single damn song. The second album was a little above descent. The lyrics were damn near incredible but lacked the variety of topics a good album needs.

I can't possible see someone tell me, that any one of these tracks off his new album is anywhere near as lyricaly equal to even some of his worst work from any other album he's put out. The beats and production is so weak it's just childish! What Can-I-bus needs to do is hook up with some real production, like DJ Premier or whoever produces MOP.

I have been a big Canibus fan since I heard him with the Lost Boyz. I, a huge fan, saw a change in his style and his lyrics. Even his voice sounds different in this album. Canibus, who I used to consider being one of the greatest lyricist, has become commercial like all these other MC's who did rather well until they started to talk about garbage. I notice that \\"C\\" True Hollywood Stories has no point to it at all. He obviously didn't get motivated to make it better. I think if he motivates himself, his albums would be great, maybe better than 2000 B.C. Canibus is the greatest alive, but he will have to erase \\"C\\" True Hollywood Stories with another album that'll hopefully be great. Who knows, he'll probally name it 2002 BC.T.H.S.

He should stick with what he does best, battle rapping. He is trying to hard to make his lyrics commical with stupid phrases in hopes to somehow mimic the style of Eminem. Its not working! This album was a GREAT disapointment being that his first two had some of the best lyrical quotes I have ever heard. Even on \\"Beasts from the East\\", one of Lost Boyz best song on there second album \\"Love,Peace and Nappiness\\", Canibus tears up the spot for over half the song, its just amazing. Although I still consider myself a Canibus fan, I dont consider myself a fan of this album. Dont waist your money, but if you do decide to spend money on canibus, buy some herb, maybe it will help make you forget how terrible this album is."},{"rating":"1","title":"canibus has disapointed again","review":"this cd is trash, the stan skits make no sense and on certain tracks his voice sounds high pitched. fans who are expecting the hard core canibus are gonna be disapointed cause canibus comes really soft in this album. the only joint im feeling off of this album is box cutter but the rest is just garbage he even has a joint here thats called ya teeth is yellow lol . im telling ya dont waste ya (money) on this once ill mc's new piece of crap album. wanna listen to a really ill mc wit a great new album listen to chino xl's new album and put ya (money) into that if you can find it, now that album was bangin. ya been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Canibus is amazing, this album was made by trash. In 2000 BC canibus came strong and blew everything up. In C true hollywood story. Canibus sounds like a kid with his friends recording an album in their basement.People say that this album is purposefully weak so that his spring release will be even more powerful. Well Canibus will be lucky if anyone picks up his spring album. And that is a tired excuse for a weak album, weak weak weak trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment for hardcore Canibus fans","review":"Canibus has lost his appetite for eating emcees. It becomes clear in this third release that he will probably never drop another hardcore album. He talks more about women in this album and sex, and about his humble beginnings. Only in the song Draft Me! where he addresses the September 11th attacks does he come off hardcore, and even then he shares the mic with C-4 a new white rap band he is helping to promote. His signature styles are virtually non-existent in this release. The transition would be tolerable if not for the terrible beats and choruses. Not to mention most of the tracks are skits, making it sound more like a musical than a rap album. Only hardcore Canibus fans should even consider buying this and to those that are: prepared to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"i picked this cd up as soon as i got off of school with high expectations and anticipation. but all i got was canibus' gifted lyrics over some wack beats. I dont know what c was thinking when hooking up with this production team. the beats sound like they were originally produced for brittney spears and nsync. Of course canibus gives us crazy metaphors and that ill flow again but over beats produced for pop stars. and another huge problem i got with canibus this time is how he used his voice. Everyone remembers that hardcore battling voice heard on his 2nd LP, but it's no where to be found here. all i can say is that this cd was a big dissapointment for me and i want my (money)back. i should of purchased the new brittney spears cd for singing canibus is displaying. at least she's hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can-You-Not-Bus?","review":"This album is terrible. The only reason I gave it one star is because of \\"A Different Vibe In LA\\" and perhaps \\"The Rip Off\\" - All other songs seem like mixtape rejects. His beats are terrible, for example the Super Nintendo esque \\"Hate U 2\\" which is followed by \\"Luv U 2\\" which uses the exact SAME beat for two songs. Some say Canibus is a deadly lyricist, I say he's a has been who thinks there's someone out there who still cares. Give up Canibus - Eminem beat you, LL beat you, Wyclef ditched you...Retire C."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"I had been waiting for this album since Bis's last one...well...I am prepared to wait longer cuz i was mad disappointed. The rhymes he spits are still tight, but definitely not his best. But again, the beats and production on this album are garbage. Bis has waaaay too much talent to waste on garbage production. I'd like to see him team up with Rockwilder, Pete ROck, RZA, Dre, and hell, even the Neptunes. Canibus is one of my fave MCs ever, and definitely one of the nicest, but this album is probably his worst. Almost evey song on the album he is dissing someone which is aiight, but if ur going to dis someone, spit that fire over a hot beat and not some garbage that sounds like amusement park music. I'm out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"Dont get me wrong, Canibus is one of the illest emcees to ever rock the mic and thats a fact. But this album really disappointed me because he doesnt come with the rawness he came with in the first two. The first one was raw and hype and the second was with energy and fiercefulness. This one was the one to redeem him of the bricklaying albums and I think it just made his situation worse. But I hope this is just to throw us off cause to be honest the album really (is bad). It lacks creativity, rawness, beats, and featured artists. Advice: To all canibus listeners, listen to it and youll know what im talking about.Peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have all the battle wizards gone?","review":"I was pretty excited for this album. Somewhere along the line I heard that Canibus was enlisting someone to lay solid beats; however, this was certainly not the case. Usually I would say that Canibus's rhyme style & pattern would compensate for lackluster beats; not on this album though. I thought Chino XL's new album was a disappointment. All in all I would have liked Canibus to maintain his rhyme format, but instead you get a watered-down version of an ill emcee."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Disappointment of the YEAR!","review":"If you like Canibus don't buy this album. \\"C Hollywood Stories,\\" is about a lyrically captivating as a 504 boyz track.

Don't make the mistake I did... trust me you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow... i mean a bad wow","review":"I'm a pretty big Canibus fan, and despite how great an MC he is, I've learned to lower my expectations of his music in order to enjoy even the worst of his work. that way, even if its bad, i wont expect much, and if its good, I'll be pleasantly surprised. I thought 2000 BC was the worst thing he ever put out... until i heard this that is. To be honest, I've never listened to the album in its entirety, but after previewing it on Amazon just now, I gotta say i don't know if i want to. Never before have i ever wanted to NOT buy a Canibus album. I think there were maybe 4 songs out of 21 tracks that I actually liked, much less were good. 4 out of 21... thats a hell of a difference right there. Even dedicated Canibus fans may want to think twice before getting this one, unless you just want it to say you have it. God forbid i ever do buy this thing, get it as a gift, or just find it laying in a alley somewhere, i highly doubt it will get too many spins on my CD player"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge flop","review":"Bis is in my top 5 rappers ever so maybe thats why this is four stars but one thing to add is that this cd has wack tracks and brilliant tracks this cd is worth buying for thoose ones there are huge lines and serious rhyming as usual from bisFavorite Track: U didnt careGuests:C4 and Pakman7.5 of 10 lyrics 4.75 of 10 beats"},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant belive it","review":"Theres not much too say about this album.I love canibus but this is his wrost album ever!

And i tought only Jay-Z makes 1 star albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst 'Bis CD by FAR","review":"This is not a Canibus cd if you ask me. He doesn't sound like himself and is obsessed with this attack on Eminem (never says his name). His production on this is horrible and his rhymes ain't that good.

Canibus first cd was medicore with good lyrics, but lousy production. The second cd was what his 1st was supposed to be raging lyrics, with the beats to match. But it was slept-on by the people, leaving Universal with no choice but to dump him. The new album is another sorry way to sell albums: dissing. Why is he dissing Eminem? Jay Z? Beanie Siegal? Jadakiss? The production sounds like they made it with a child's keyboard. The lyrics with made Canibus the illest, are now watered down and he still has trouble making SONGS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful classics","review":"If you are a Richard Smallwood fan, then you will appreciate his classical style as a pianist and vocalist. This CD is a compilation of most of his well known songs that are formed into medleys that flow right into each other.

As I live in a college dorm, this isn't a good thing. I purchased a pair of Boston Acoustic CR-9's instead... which are slightly inferior in overall imaging, but sound great at low volumes, as well as when you crank them.

As for using religion to justify violence, slave-owers used that tactic.Does anyone now feel that slavery is biblically sanctioned?

The quality of the song craftsmanship has diminished while the over-glossy production quality goes up a notch. A few songs flirt with 70s disco and are fairly nauseating, and a few uninspired 'rock' songs feature a ridiculously bad vocalist (and equally sappy lyrics). One or two tracks are very good but most are simply adequate, but there's really nothing here that makes you stand back and take notice. The first album was great because of all of the unexpected twists and turns it took, this one fails because it lacks dynamics, takes few chances and settles on being safe and overly repetitious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mick Callahan - A believable hero, a rare treat","review":"Harry Shannon continues to chronicle the struggles of one of the most believable heroes in modern noir fiction: Mick Callahan. We believe him because he's flawed like the rest of us; we admire him because he works hard to make things better for the less-fortunate in society, unlike most of us. Set against the backdrop of the famous Burning Man Festival, this 100 mile-an-hour thriller treats us to an exciting look into Mick's complicated life and his honorable quest to be a knight in a graceless age. I can't wait for the next installment! By the way, those reviewers who thought that Shannon showed disrespect for the festival obviously did not read the disclaimer on the author's Acknowledgements page: \\"No one should construe Mick's feelings about the festival as reflecting my disapproval.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Shannon does it one more time....","review":"..If you read the 'Night Of' series you know how Shannon can draw you in..if you read Memorial Day then you know how he can create the characters and bring them to life...in this the second of the Mick Callahan series Shannon brings Callahan back again for some raucous, at times dangerous and sometimes simply entertaining experiences. Take a ride with this one...you really will find it quite fun I think. If you have not read any of Shannon's books...try this one, you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shannon in Top Form","review":"Harry Shannon has created a compelling, original anti-hero in the character of Mick Callahan. Callahan picks up right where he left off in the debut novel \\"Memorial Day,\\" that is to say full of ideas and ready to rock and roll with the bad guys. He's cleaned up his act now, with a girl, some money, and a re-discovered sense of honor---but his anger is still far too close to the surface. This is a faster read than the first book (Memorial Day), which may be a mixed blessing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Travis McGee territory","review":"The Mick Callahan we met in \\"Memorial Day\\" was self-absorbed and arrogant at times, and just learning to care about other people. Still, he was already a fascinating character. Well, Mick has grown tremendously here, as the series steps boldly into Travis McGee territory. Young Callahan has become an introspective knight in rusty aromor, a wry philosopher of a man with opinions and what seems like a genetic taste for violence. The two books are best read in order, although 'Eye of the Burning Man' also stands on its own well enough. Snappy dialogue, lots of action, really fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Scene is a band you shouldn't miss out on","review":"A blast from the past. Good 90s music.

I wouldn't give a nickle for any of them They all had problems all different. This is the first laptop that has worked flawlessly. I actually picked the Toshiba up through my BB warranty. The Compaq had motherboard problems repeatedly, they warrantied and with the funds I got I was able to buy this beauty. It has run all games and programs. wireless is friendly. The built in camera leaves a bit to be desired. But I really don't use it. You want a good laptop buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like buying batteries","review":"I've bought two Satellite laptops, and both have had their batteries fail within two years. One of them won't keep a charge for more than a few minutes, and sometimes powers off when you disconnect the AC power; the other sometimes just shuts down at the slightest movement. When we called the tech support, they didn't mention that the batteries were subject to recall; now I just found out, and Toshiba won't process the recall. I don't know if the problems are battery related, since it'll cost $500 to have Toshiba diagnose the problem. That's right, FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS once it's out of warranty.The screen on the newer laptop - just two years old - has gone funky, with some horizontal lines.They both run somewhat warm, with the fan going nonstop.As you can tell, these are my last Toshiba laptop purchases. It's great value for the first year, so enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOSHIBA X205 laptops","review":"I strongly don't recommend this laptop for those who wish to buy this kind.I am very disappointed with it's performance particularly with it's HD-DVD drive. I have not been using frequently the drive but after a year and a month it just totally non-functional. And Toshiba service center refused to offer warranty and they are charging me 500 US dollars for the drive including service fee. I think this product line did not meet my expectation when it comes to reliability,quality and performance wise. Beware of this notebook PC quality you will just be upset in buying this product.

(We're now hunting for a different one.)Holes in the bottom of the outer bowl mean that you have to use it in the sink or some other place that can collect water, rather than sitting it on the countertop while spinning.Often when you put on the lid the gears don't mesh so that the handle either won't turn at all or it turns slowly and off-kilter.Assigned this 2 stars rather than 1 because my husband doesn't mind carefully lining up the gears and therefore was only bothered by the holes in the bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solved my issue of old stereo, new Ipod","review":"After lamenting how I wished to be able to use my Ipod with my older stereo system, I came across this solution and it works like a charm! A simple cord instead of a new system, what could be better. Plug one end into your earphone jack on the Ipod and the other into the back of your stereo jacks and you hear your music, I used an auxiliary imput and just set the front to auxiliary. No fuss, sound is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended for history buffs, Orwell fans.","review":"I had (somehow) never heard of this novel before a few weeks ago when I figured I'd go on reader recommendations and buy this. I am glad I did.The novel examines the experience of one N.S. Rubashov, who although fictional, is based on the real life events of some of the heroes of the Soviet political machine who got caught up in the Moscow show trials.That being said, the entire novel is drenched in the psychology of socialist politics. You are at times both endeared to the protagonist, at other times repulsed. His interactions with others as both a political commissar and prisoner are well crafted, and help lend an ever present air of suspense.The reader is offered a detailed look into the illogical nature of the great purges, and the manipulation of political prisoners, as well as the differing attitudes of the old guard versus the new.I would recommend this book if you enjoyed 1984, Animal Farm, Fahrenheit 451, or A Brave New World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Off-road Instructional Book","review":"While I'm a bit too old to ride motocross this book was absolutely fabulous in showing me the riding techniques that really took me from zero to becoming a decent rider in the woods.

Every song is a gem, none more so than the last song. Stephin Merritt writes better songs than anyone else even within the strict formal constraints of this disc(each song is built on a repeating chordal/rhythmic loop). Buy this and Holiday which is better than 69 Love Songs, as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first non-electronic Mag Fields EP is a must-buy","review":"House of tomorrow is a must buy if only for one song: Love Goes Home to Paris in the Spring. The first time I heard it, on a 45, I cried, as did everyone else in the room. Sure it's another patented Stephin Merritt heart break/love song, but the tone is more final and certain compared to later songs: \\"I've had enough/you never give me anything/Don't you know love/goes home to paris in the spring?\\"When this EP first came out (as a 7\\" - it WAS definitely a good value when it was originally released, don't blame Merritt & co for changes in technology) it was described by the band as their 'loop song' ep -- each song is comprised of a single loop, repeated over and over and over, on analog instruments. At the time this was downright revolutionary for them, as they had not previously recorded with live instruments. They occasionally return to this loop format, but not nearly as effectively as on this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Angelika Kirchschlager's mezzo voice is very fine, but one can hardly tell from listening to these duets---she's drowned out by Barbara Bonney's big soprano voice, too-big vibrato, and too-frequent pitch difficulties (usually on the sharp side). It's a shame. Many of these songs are heard infrequently. But this is not the way to hear them. Perhaps Bonney plus a stronger mezzo voice would have been better. Personally I would have preferred Kirchschlager paired with a soprano who's on pitch and less closely miked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tinkers and Stinkers","review":"Any worthwhile book should enable the reader to suspend disbelief; The Killing of the Tinkers did let me suspend disbelief, but I could not suspend distaste. The plotting in this book was weak and the protagonist did more drugs than detecting.The author, with self-conscious references to George Pelecanos, tried to use use song titles to establish mood; it did not work. It read more like playlists from the author's iPod than prose.I gave up after 138 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"An even greater waste of my precious time.","review":"Picks up where The Guards left off but adds cocaine to the list of addictive personality disorders of the hero. Same problem as the first book though, Jack stays loaded the entire time, never solves the primary case he's working on, gets an innocent man killed, and leaves the reader begging for a shot in the head to put us out of our misery for reading such a load of peat that is full of fleas and better when it is burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Cover","review":"This Album is icked.

To make a long story short, I doubt anyone involved in the making tried to give it a final editing. It is littered with spelling errors, and the captions misidentify the vehicles represented in the pictures. There are several, but just to name the two most glaring: a YF-23 prototype is incorrectly identified as an SR-71, and the rather large nose-mounted reaction control system boom on a Yak-36 prototype is described as a refueling boom!The text itself doesn't add much to what you could learn reading the wikipedia page on aerial refueling.Thank God the book was relatively cheap.

Live theater has an energy that movies can't seem to capture but this production was disappointing. It was miscast, the actors did not fit the parts and either they were tired or the director was depressed because there was no fun nor energy to match the dialogue.

However, after two TV's with both having the dreaded halo prism problem all that potential doesn't mean a thing. The purplish prism is quite noticeable once you see it and from then on it serves to only annoy you as it pops up repeatedly during various scenes. When it is not noticeable the picture quality is outstanding and comparable to even LCD's. It speaks of very shoddy quality control on Samsung's part. If you order this TV all I will say is good luck and I hope you get one that is problem free!

The picture was sharp and beautiful from July, 2007 up until January, 2010 at which point the red LED burned out. Researching this online while staring at a blue-green picture I found that this make and model of Samsung has this problem ALL THE TIME.In fact, I got pretty lucky that it lasted 2.5 years. Some folks have this happen after just 12, 15 or 18 months.The red LED can be obtained for around $100 but there's a 4 week backorder on it. Something tells me that's another indication how common the problem is. I could buy a light engine for $1000 but that would be throwing another grand at a set that still has a weak red LED."},{"rating":"1","title":"15 months only","review":"This TV was fine for 15 months, and then the red led or something to that effect failed today so we now have a blue-green tv.

I have a 37\\" Panasonic plasma, and the picture on this is every bit as good. I've hooked it up through my home entertainment system, so sound is not an issue.

However, it arrived with problems with the screen (dark smugged areas). We alerted Samsung to this issue and they gave use a warrenty repair company to come out to fix it. They came out to see if it could be repaired in place and found the screens needed to be replaced. They ordered the new screens 3 months ago. The repair company was blaming Samsung and Samsung had no idea why the screens were not delivered, until today. Come to find out the repair company had lost there licenses to repair Samsung awhile back. We were never contacted by Samsung to tell us that the dropping of the service company had happened and to get us a new repair service company to come back out. If you have issues with Samsung you will want to immediately talk to the Executive Customer Relations (ECR) branch.

Watching Planet Earth in 1080p on this set will knock your socks off.My favorite feature of this set is the fact that all of the inputs are on the side and very easy to reach and there are a ton of them. 3 HDMI, 2 Component, 2 Composite, VGA, and an optical audio out. The only downside of having the inputs on the side is that they are difficult to hide and the way our living room is set up makes them clearly visible.This is my second Samsung HDTV and I'm sure that my third (which I don't plan on getting any time soon) will be too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV, Fast Shipping!","review":"First off I received the TV 5 days before the estimated delivery date!

I'm finally writing that review! :) I think this is a great book full of things that BSB fans want to know! Some magazines made this book out to be a \\"tell-all\\" but it isn't. It's just questions that are probably on all of your minds being answered truthfully. If you still haven't read it, I highly suggest that you do! and Samantha, if you're reading this YOU GO GIRL! I'll e-mail ya soon! KTBSPA! Kristen"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Inside Look on the BSB!","review":"When I first heard about Samantha's book I figured it was going to be a tell all book about her and Brian's relationship. Then when I saw it in the store I flipped through it and decided to check it out, I was very happy I did in the end! Samantha's book gives BSB fans a great inside look on how being a BSB girlfriend would really be like and she also shows what the guys are really like. Instead of being angry at Samantha, she's made me like the BSB even more after reading this! I congratulate her on an excellent book and to all the fans that think she was hurting Brian by writing this..check out the book and you'll see just how wrong you were!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New, True Facts","review":"What You Wanna Know...is the best book that any true BSB fan could read. These are the real facts told by someone that was actually there. These aren't stories that someone researched or made up. This true life and a great interesting book. The topics are covered in a mature fashion and acceptable for all ages. I wasn't sure how I felt about this book before it was released. Now I am so happy that I bought it. Samantha did a great job of telling fans what we want to know while still keeping certain things private. A great book that all true fans should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real ,Warm a must read","review":"I think this book is woderful. After reading it I love the boyseven more.

It didn't give out all of Brian's personal secrets, and no embarassing or private pictures were published. The thing that gets to me is the contest she is having with it. If my boyfriend would have given me his gold record, the one he shed tears over, I wouldn't give it to anyone, let alone a stranger who wins a contest! I feel like I know Brian now, but I still wish I wouldn't have bought the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly not a problem!","review":"I read the book one night, and couldn't put it down, sure I didn't think it was right that she put stupid stuff like his mom cutting his steak.

Yeah, simply because it is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great","review":"i loved the book it help you realize that these guys are actually human beings.

He's a respectable and devout husband and father, and is by far not the kind of ex- that should be trashed like this.

Samantha Stonebraker is a coniving, money-hungry insult to the beauty that is Brian Littrell. I can't believe that this woman would sink so low as to try to make a few dollars off of an ex's success. This personally to Samantha: You are sick and twisted and I seriously hope you get what you deserve for exploiting Brian and the rest of the guys. Get a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wrong!!","review":"Actually, I give this zero stars, but it won't actually let me do that.The first thing that I have to mention is that I have never read this book, and I never plan to. But I think that the concept is absolutley disgusting. The excerpt from the back of the book made me want to throw up. Which of them are still virgins? That's really personal, and she has no right to be writing a book about that. If she ever really cared about Brian, and the other BSB, she wouldn't be writing a book about their secrets. If you really are a true fan, you wouldn't buy this book so you could read about all of their secrets. You would not buy it, because it is a total invasion of their privacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"at three years old, it still works... but not as well","review":"I have enjoyed this camera since my MIL got it for us in 2001. But now it's starting to show it's age, and after countless uses and trip and kids we are finally needing a new one. But I like this one for \\"beat up\\" purposes. It still works ok.

The box comes with every thing that one needs to snap away and load JPG files into the PC.Using the camera is pretty easy and intuitive - although I'm a first time user, it just took me about 5 mins to learn the basic functions. FinePix 2300 is also relatively smaller and more esthetically pleasing to the eye in comparison with other models of its class. It's slim and smooth lines fits nicely into the palm of your hands. One does not need to hesitate when wondering \\"to bring or not to bring\\" a camera to events/places.

I did like the book alot. It answered alot of questions I have about the Church now. At first I just wanted doctrinal information, but now I'm interested in Church oragnization. Leadership, missions, and temples.... This book covers all that and more. The only thing is that I'm glad I didn't run into it sooner because it would have been WAY too much for me. It seems that this may be the type of info most often sought by those not on the spectrum, so I don't forsee many other people feeling that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Convert's Guide to Morman Life","review":"A good book to learn the basics and why things are done.

It's not a horrible book, but it doesn't have much in it. More motivation than advice, the entire book could be summed up by saying \\"get off your ass and get to work\\", only then the author wouldn't have made millions off a few weeks (being very generous here) worth of work.It's not the worst thing I've ever read, but if you're looking for help or a gift, I would continue your search."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and Practical","review":"Wish It, Dream It, Do It is more than just inspirational.

Cidylo goes to great pains to make the reader feel that they are in the moment with her. I found her accounts of what it was like as a foreigner AND a woman to be particularly interesting.

I am a frequent viewer of soft porn/playboy, and I can't tell you how bad this thing was. It is not only mistitled (SERIOUSLY lacking in any bare people) but there was no action! There was no attempt to match up with the cinematic style or feel of the original and only resembled the Blair Witch Project in the name and use of a map at some point in the movie. I would STRONGLY reccomend that you go somewhere else for your action and resist the urge of listening to the other reviewers that probably produced or acted in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stunk","review":"I thought the Blair Witch Project was a bad movie until I saw this movie.

If you like the kind of movie that has nothing but T&A all the way through it then get this movie, don't get it thinking it is a masterpiece cause it is not and the only part that I hated was the one girl in it that all she does is talk and whine about going skinny dipping, not that there is anything wrong with that but it does get a little annoying. So if you are looking for a fun movie with good looking women and lots of T&A then pick this one up, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scantilly Clad Babes in the Woods","review":"This is a straight-forward but silly and lame parody of the Blair Witch Project. It gets the camcorder look of the original right, but is terribly written and acted, and full of unfunny jokes. This is as \\"B\\" as a B movie can get.So, why do I give it 4 stars? It gets one each for the four fabulous babes that spend most of the film hiking in the great outdoors while nearly or completely naked.

The iPod would play for about 3-4 minutes and then pause itself. I tried using the different adapters thinking that would make a difference, but no luck. This occurred with both of the units we've had. Second, if you want to use the digital radio tuner (AM or FM)... it will let you get close to the exact station, but it is a challenge (a game almost) to get exactly on the number. Additionally, the sound quality on radio has much to be desired... of course that could be because the actual station is not tuned in because the digital tuner moves up / down the dial on its own.Overall, big disappointment... would not recommend this to ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Choise","review":"Was my brother\`s present and bad choise...Bad sound , poor options , unless low price i too much when you have the product , you feels have been cheated!

For my use, I probably should have looked around a little more because it sits on my desk and I haven't once taken it anywhere. But I think the sound is great, I listen to the radio as much as the ipod. A couple things I would change: once you start listening to your iPod, the only way to go to your menu or go to a different song or something, is by using one finger. Maybe this is just my personnal preference, but I think it's a bother. Another thing with my iPod Nano is a screen pops up every 5-10 seconds saying that you can't charge it. Then you click on that and it takes you back to the main menu so with your one finger you have to keep clicking and scrolling to find where you were.But all in all, I think it's a nice size, it plays well, and it does what I want it to do.

You can't really listen to the radio! The cd player DOES NOT have anti-skip technology; therefore, it jumps every 10 seconds of music (specially if the volume is all the way up - I guess the sound vibrations makes it skip). To makes matter worse the IPOD connectivity doesn't work either: The music plays for a few seconds and then goes silent for minutes and then comes back again over and over...

My question to everyone is this: What model of iPod are you using? Mine is a Classic (6th Gen, 2nd Rev). I'm wondering if this issue is related to a specific iPod model or if this is just really a POS device.One reviewer (Venkat) mentioned that the pausing issue occurred while in the doc *and* while plugged into the Aux port.

It would only play for 10-15 minutes at a time and then cut out completely. I even tested my iPod with my computer and a small set of portable speakers to see if my iPod was the problem - it wasn't!

Well, standard can openers harbor the most harmful bacteria in the kitchen (how often do you clean yours?)The SafeCut can opener is the most obvious design for a can opener, at least in retrospect: it reverses the assembly process by un-crimping the lid.Let me repeat that: it un-crimps the lid of the can. Without a blade. As it does not touch the food, it cannot contaminate it. As it does not cut the metal lid, it leaves no sharp edges. In fact, one can push the opened lib back onto the can's body as loosly re-sealed container.It is elegent in its operation. It is safe for children and those with unstead hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well for a while, doesn't last","review":"I bought one of these at the grocery store, to replace a different brand that we've been happy with for a few years but finally wore out.

I'm here on Amazon looking for a more reliable design that won't need to be replaced monthly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spyro can opener lasted two months","review":"We picked the Spyro can opener to replace another brand. At first, the unusual opening method and lack of a positive puncture were unnerving, but I quickly got past that. While it works, it is a positive joy. What it does not do well are large cans (institutional size), cans with dents on the seam, and cans with rebated edges (crimp for lid is back a little bit from side of can). Put the roller over the edge, start turning the handle, and when the resistance drops off, the lid is cut.About two months into using the Spyro, it started to skip on the can seam while turning the handle. The lid would only be freed intermittently around the periphery. Regretfully, I'm giving up on the Spyro.I have bought an American made can opener off Amazon and look forward to a positive grip on the can, ability to tolerate dented can seams, large cans, and rebated rims."},{"rating":"1","title":"worn out after 2 months","review":"I bought this at my local big box store. It looked neat and appeared easy and simple to use. Worked great initially, but after about 2 months of usage, it will no longer open a can. It pinches the metal edge of the can, and yes the resistance does drop off after one complete revolution...but, still can't get the top off the can. I've had to work over the can with a pair of pliers to get the lids off. Usually I tear the top to create a small opening to pour out the contents. I highly recommend spending your money on a different opener. I did purchase a traditional opener that makes the nasty sharp edges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one.","review":"I have this can opener and it worked great for less than a month.

One is it often left small metal shavings & splinters on the can which could easily get into the food. The other issue is that the handle was pretty stiff to turn. I can't imagine someone with arthritic hands trying to use it.HOWEVER, I've been using it for two or three months and have started having the same problem others described. (I'm opening three or four cans a day at most to feed the critters.) It no longer opens cleanly on the first pass, sometimes not even by the third time around and I'm frequently having to pry the top up and back to get at the cans' contents.Now I'm scouring the options on Amazon for a better can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"great but doesn't last","review":"I purchased this can opener in May, 2011.

I would recommend to go with a cheaper unit that does not break so much. Works really well till it breaks, so if you buy it just plan on replacing it every 1-2 years.Note to the manufacturer, this is not exactly the cheapest opener out there so I really feel that for the money this is inexcusable. I am sure they could do it better and even if it cost a little more, it would be worth it. The design is great and if you could just provide a handle that is as durable as the rest of the unit, you would have a vastly superior product that will last well enough to become a kitchen standard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs as Claimed","review":"This has become my \\"go to\\" can opener. It indeed opens the can without cutting, so that a non-hazardous edge remains. It is easier to operate than a conventional opener. I had hoped it would open Coke cans (which have an indented top); however, my disappointment is tempered by the fact that no other opener that I know of will do that.

I kept cleaning the nozzles, realigning, and contacting support... I finally gave up and replaced the cartridges, and only then did I see the quality I had been expecting. I realize now the cartridges that came with the printer were dried up when I bought it. I don't need to print often, but who would expect that printing less would cost more?!

Unfortunately, with no alternative available, those of us with Lexmark's printers (that use this ink) are stuck with smearing ink, and no help from Lexmark (repeated emails have yielded no interest in resolving the problem. They say \\"some minor smearing is normal,\\" and don't address the major smearing).The NON-waterproof COLOR ink does not have this smearing problem.

I think Lexmark has designed the ink to be bad, or the printheads to be unreliable, so that customers are forced to buy new cartridges regularly, even if they don't print a lot of pages.Never again will I buy a Lexmark printer.

Sadly, managers usually sound the alarm and demand new customer service initiatives only after the customers have fled. Author Jeanne Bliss, a veteran chief customer service officer, tries to explain the problem and to suggest ways to correct it. She offers so many detailed trees - in the form of questionnaires, bullet points, details and checklists - that you risk losing sight of the practical forest: the motives and methods for implementing better customer service. There is valuable information here, even if it is a bit shaded. For this reason, we particularly liked her clear, helpful and revealing chapter of first-hand stories from the field of customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading!","review":"A must read for anyone in business.

But worst of all, my spyware free computer got infected by every spyware you can imagine while I was downloading updates from Norton. And to top it off Norton could not fix the problem. It took me three other anti-spyware programs to fully undo what Norton did to my computer. Avoid Norton at all costs, if you don't heed my advice you will regret it.

The speed of virus scan become much slower.2. System is very unstable now.3. This software will keep your mahcine running like crazy for many hours but the processing will never be completed. The final result is: harddrive died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I am running Norton Anti virus 2005 and I have had no problems at all. I have 3 friends running the same with absolutely no problems. Everyone I know who has had problems are on dial up connections. That seems to be the problem. My computer is free from viruses and spyware. I have checked it with several free programs and they found nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustation with NAV 2005","review":"I have never had any problems with Norton AntiVirus before. Now I had to renew my subscription and went to buy NAV 2005. I ran the CD but I have still not been able to install the antivirus. I am told that I have Symantec Integrator problems or Norton AntiVirus has encountered an internal program error. I never expected this from Symantec and I am wondering what they are doing about it.The quality of their product and their credibility is at stake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Activation Problem - Don't Buy","review":"After many years of use of various Norton products I became baffled about NAV2005. My subscription of NAV2003 ran out and it was manditory to purchase a newer version. I installed NAV2005 with no problem... then when I activated by internet it returned that \\"Invalid Key A8\\". When I called the technical support line (over 20 times), I was directed to go way beyond --- reformat hard drive, scan for viruses, scan for adware, un-install, re-install, phone activate, edit registry, rename directories, delete files in safe mode, purchase another copy of NAV2005, remove firewall, remove Spyware Blocker, remove CD burner software, run Symantec un-install software, re-install...Nothing worked !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Fine","review":"I have used Norton products since the early 80's. I have rarely had a problem with them. AntiVirus 2005 installed easily and I have had no issues. I would highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone. I found that McAfee slowed down my computer wherease Norton did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FRESH, OUTDOORS SCENT FOR MEN","review":"Liz Claiborne's latest fragrance for men, Realities, is an outdoors fresh, clean scent. The blend of citrus and wood notes is ultra masculine, while a certain richness is added by Italian Grapefruit, and Mandarin. Then with a touch of Nutmeg, Ginger and Teas there is also a hint of spiciness.It's attractive and memorable without being at all overpowering.The heavy glass bottle is broad shouldered with a gun metal silver cap with a double band of olive - good looking.Realities is available in the 3.4 oz. and 1.7 oz. Cologne spray as well as in After Shave, After Shave Soother, Hair & Body Wash, and Deodorant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmm My lungs will breath good tonight, I see white!","review":"Its nice to see a white filter again, when I pulled the old out it was so grey I knew it was past due, it has been almost two years and I had washed it the past few times due to low funds, yes THAT low. No problems with shipping or the Rabbit. I've been using it for about 3 years now and this is my second filter replcement. I ordered for the wrong model about 2 years before and the company was great, I did have to pay shipping to send the wrong parts back but they quickly sent the correct parts back, never had anything but great customer service from Rabbit Air and excellent breathing from the machine! My ashtma has definitly improved and almost like I don't live with smokers at all anymore! My little breathing machine cleans my air for me and my dad keeps trying to talk it out of my room and into the living room, I'm sure it could clean the air out there but he can buy his own, this ones mine!"}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],B={key:0},W={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(N,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-33c9dd65"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/56.md","filePath":"quotesmag/56.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/56.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
