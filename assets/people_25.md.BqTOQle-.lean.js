Both men are totally lying and faking to win her over and after she finds out, she is only mad for a moment and then picks one! There are a few laughs, one when Chelsea's car lands in a lake (where were the airbags?), and one when Bad Boy appears to have fallen asleep. Of course this sleeping scene has him asleep at one angle with his head back, and then with his head flat in the next angle, and then back to flat again.

Their debut, \\"Welcome to the Pleasuredome,\\" is truly a landmark album of 1980s British pop: this isn't about content, but rather concept. In addition, the boys do an interesting rendition of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born to Run\\" and they deliver a decent ballad \\"The Power of Love.\\" Casual listeners should probably get their greatest hits set instead, but for music collectors and 80s completists, this CD should be high on your list to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"\\"Welcome of the Pleasuredome\\" is certainly one of those decade-defining classics.

The bizarre, intriguing mix of sound-poems like \\"the world is my oyster\\" or \\"welcome to the pleasure dome\\" and very unusual cover versions of songs like \\"the way to san Jose\\" and even \\"born to run\\" is all wrapped into one enormous, engulfing sound experience. The mixing and orchestration of the album is absolutely amazing and Frankie's lead voice Holly Johnson was at the peak of his power, forget his later efforts, this is the real thing. Since its transfer from album to CD format the music is a seamless flow, and the quality of the digital mastering is outstanding.

Then little things like \\"car phone\\" instead of cell phone and the crazy \\"San Fran gay scene\\" made me go huh??? Then a character says something like seven years ago in 1984 and I finally got it - I paid a new release price for some old re-issue and not even a good one.

I read this book in about 4 days of my commute back and forth to work, the book is about 470 pages, and I am not a fast reader!I'm a big Myron Bolitar fan, and this book is not as good as some of his Bolitar books, but it's definitely worth the price of admission and a good read on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Coben, Cook, Palmer, or anything of the genre, it's great.","review":"I admit that I have a weak spot for medical thrillers and mysteries/thrillers broadly. Add to that my enjoyment of techno-thrillers, and the result is a virtual guarantee that I'll be happy reading anything by Robin Cook or Michael Palmer. (Indeed, they're among my go-to authors during spells of boredom or used-book hunts before vacations.) Harlan Coben is hit-or-miss for me, as some of his novels have themes or subjects that just don't grab me -- or are too wrapped up in [insert tortured male protagonist with fatal flaw here]. This is definitely one of the books I'd classify as a \\"hit\\"; it's all the suspense and quirky inter-personal character detail that he always delivers but situated in a great plot with interesting research integrated in the book throughout. It was a refreshing break from some of his favorite, frequent themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story","review":"I like Harlan Coben's work.

I am having a hard time even finishing it. All of his more recent books I finish in 1 or 2 days. He is one of my favorite authors.

Although I did figure out whodunit before it was revealed, I enjoyed this sophomore effort and found it hard to put down (wish I could say the same for his first novel, Play Dead, which was awful). I first discovered Coben with Tell No One, which is still far and away my favorite of his novels, and I am a dedicated fan of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie!","review":"My whole family loved this movie.

Not an entertaining book at all. More of a history lesson if that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I've often thought that the power organized Christian religion has in this world can be terrifying. THE PALACE explores this with a most fearsome antagonist, a monk named Savonarola. Set in 15th Century Italy, this second of the Saint-Germain novels focuses on the horrors one man can cause in the name of religion. Featuring historical figures such as the de Medici's and the artist Botticelli, THE PALACE is ripe with Yarbro's beautiful, poetic prose, her incredible imagery and fabulous characterization. It's sensual, riveting. A novel that both horror and historical fiction fans can appreciate and since it's available in hardback from Stealth Press, Yarbro fans can fall in love with it all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I spent several days reviewing different metal detectors before I choose the Bounty Hunter Silver model.

After assembling the detector (which was very easy to do) and turning the item on, it made a contast hissing noise and, no matter which setting I put it on, the detector's noise was the same.Two others tried to work with the detector with the same results.

The identifying indicator fluctuates way too much and is undependable even with new batteries. Our other off brand is far more dependable at identifying the targets. This is the last cheapie and the last Bounty Hunter. I recommend spending the extra money for a better machine like Garrett. They hold value also.

Then I actually started on a \\"real\\" mission and before I knew it I had finished the game...in like 45 minutes!! What the...? There are only a few short missions and they are very easy.The graphics are great, but I was expecting this game to be like the original Rainbow Six game with a bunch of challenging missions. I can't believe I wasted bucks on this game. I even went back and played it a second time to make sure I had really finished it. Yep, sure enough the credits began to roll and the game was over just like that.I would skip this game since just about anyone can finish it in under an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"This game is horrible. when i got this game i thought it would be great, like the other R6 games, boy was i wrong.

If you're cawling, in the dark, under heavy cover, some how a guy 50 yards away sees and shouts to his buddies (in terrible voice acting-its the same voice for every guy in the game)something like \\"HEy U.\\" And then u die in about 1-2 hits, so if more than 1 see u, your pretty much dead. And to to ther pinpoint accuracy and the ridiculous recoil your guy has, even if one guy sees u your dead.

Many of my students have been drilled to death with grammar workbooks and five-paragraph essays, coming to me with little taste for more writing. And (oops--there I go starting a sentence with \\"and\\") I do my best to make writing interesting, forcing them to write about things they know, feel passion for. Then we line-edit. And the best reference out there is this one. So nix to all those negatives, folks who undoubtedly think English is a fixed language. Let me tell you this: it is not.

It had a plausible and different take than \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" about the proper use of apostrophes (not apostrophe's), but as it points out, \\"who cares?\\"It might be blasphemy for me to quarrel with Garrison Keillor's opinion that this book is \\"cool,\\" and maybe my perceptions are attributable to differences between his taste and mine, but having given due consideration to that possibility, I deduce that GK wrote that to provide an excuse for his giving this book as gifts to people he hates."},{"rating":"2","title":"English As An A+","review":"Great book for those who have trouble keeping up with the English words.Excellent resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prescriptivist Nonsense","review":"In linguistics, grammatical \\"experts\\" are referred to as prescriptivists--those who say that there is a right way and a wrong way to use a language. Query, however, what is the point of a language--to communicate an idea between people. So long as you can meet this objective, a linguist would say you have met your goal. Saying, as Ms. O'Conner does, that you shouldn't talk to certain people due to their grammatical choices only reinforces an elitist attitude which is almost religious in nature where grammatical prophets are deemed heretics and outcast from the elite just as quickly. Instead, we should appreciate the differences among people, see the beauty in the differences in language, try not to offend others with our language, and appreciate the beautiful miracle that is language. To do otherwise is to miss out on the wonder of spontaneous order that is language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty Grammar Book","review":"I thought the author was quite funny in her writing, it is actually a lot more useful than I thought.

I know why: It is much easier to use, has a great index, is fun to read (no one will ever say that about the Chicago Manual of Style), and covers all the essentials.I highly recommend \\"Woe Is I\\" to everyone that cares about grammar. For those people, like me, that just want a quick reference to help them write well enough, this is perfect. If you are a professional, buy \\"Woe Is I\\" to complement your Chicago Manual of Style.

I lived too long without consistently using \\"it's\\" and \\"its\\" in their rightful place and I shamefully admit, \\"who's and whose\\" routinely gave me pause. For a small book, it sure packs a mighty punch. \\"Woe Is I\\" utilizes very small lessons, some just a short paragraph. The reader is never bogged down with lengthy instruction or boring details, just the facts and some examples are all you really need.

I would recommend trying Bill Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome words. Its the same kind of stuff, but I much prefer his writing style as well as his sense of humor.

Naturally, everyone suspects that a vampire is at work. Of course superstitious villagers start running around with torches.Dwight Frye has a significant role in this flick as the red herring. This may very well be Frye's best performance of all time.

Its real danger is that uninformed readers may actually believe what's put forth in this book, and make life style or behavior decisions based on what they read -- potentially placing those people at greater risk of both contracting HIV, and attempting to remain healthy and live longer if infected.This book does a huge disservice to anyone who reads it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat useful","review":"Basically what this book does is list a topic and several questions under that topic that you may be asking yourself. Then it gives scripture passages from the New Living Translation. After some of the scripture, whoever wrote the book then paraphrases scripture into whatever he/she thinks it means. I found this paraphrasing unneccessary. People who are new in Christ or new at reading the bible may be swayed by someone else's opinion and then may not seek the wisdom from God to understand what they have just read. I also found some of the scripture was taken out of context. Overall, I would say that this book is helpful in finding scripture related to certain topics, but it is best read with your bible open so you can read the scripture right out of God's word in it's original context.

What you get is a product with a workable storyline that is virtually unplayable. First off, you can't change your camera angle -- the game decides it for you. This makes it difficult to tell where the next hoard of zombies is coming from. Aiming is almost impossible, so you'll empty most of your ammo clips into the air before that hoard of zombies closes in on you. Finally, the characters respond sluggishly to the controls. I could have lived with the camera angle and poor aiming system if my aspiring Hunter wasn't lumbering around like a pregnant water-buffalo.

If you mixed equal parts of Resident Evil, Gauntlet, and frustratingly bad game play, you'd have 'Hunter: The Reckoning.\\" The angles from which you view the action are awkward. Game play doesn't flow very well. You'll probably spend plenty of time running around trying to figure out where to go next, which wouldn't be bad if the environment was entertaining enough to want to explore. As it is, it resembles a 3-D version of a 2-D cartoon scroller with the same background cell recycled over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunter: The BORING~~zzzz....","review":"I watched the long intro. which was interesting, but started playing and it is the same old hack/shoot run-around game. Not much excitement here. After defeating hundreds of zombies and tagging some blue icons, the tasks became repetitive. Rent the game before you purchase to see if this is what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had alot going for it, but that's not saying much.","review":"I bought this game. It had a good start with the cutscene at the beginning. It really had an interesting plot: A prison is torturing inmates by experimenting on them or something so they come back from the dead and try to kill off the town, along with other creatures working with them. The game also had a dark atmosphere and that's a high point. Unfortunately, most of the levels require you to kill zombies and rescue people. Because of this, the game gets old. I actually enjoyed the cutscenes more than playing! What could have been a great game is destroyed by pointless objectives and the storyline is ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game for lovers of monster-killing and quests","review":"I'm new to Xbox games,but I got this one because I like dungeon-crawls/shooters,ala \\"Diablo 1,and 2.\\" I found this game to be even more addictive than Diablo,something I thought I could never say.The graphics are pretty cool.The sounds,music and voices are suitably creepy.I have only been able to play single mode,but have had a lot of fun killing all the available enemies.If I could only find another 56 year old who would like to play!!The quests are well thought out.The placement of \\"items to find\\" isn't too difficult to master.The quests are not very easy by yourself,which is fine with me.I just love the game,and will replay it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best X-Box game since Halo","review":"This game is incredible and so much fun. Get some of your buddies and play a game that puts Gauntlet to complete shame. The moves are sweet and there's actually strategy despite the fact it's a beat-em up kind of game. In any case this game is AMAZING and incredibly addicting. Seriously, the best game for X-box since Halo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"This game is hours of mindless frustration, and boredom. If you don't love slasher films, this game is gonna [stick]! The camera angle is terrible and you have no control over it, which makes aiming nearly impossible. The bad guys(zombies with guns)pop out of nowhere continuously like Night Caster, and i have OFTEN gotten so many enemies on the screen that the game bogs down. While the glorious xbox does its best to make the game pretty the animation is terrible, and cut scenes look like the PS one. All in all this game isn't worth [the price]. Hang onto your money and wait for the price to come down-way down-like used. Or buy a good game, HALO,JSRF,Gotham Racing,GunValk,BloodWake. Im taking mine back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is not worth buying, possibly renting...","review":"At first when I played this game I thought it would be fun, but NOPE! I was wrong. The controls and gameplay are possibly the worst. And the graphics could have been a little bit better. The main problem with the game is the gameplay. All you do is run around shoot and slice up zombies/ghosts/vampires that seem to never stop coming. So basicly you got to just run away while shooting otherwise you are dead. Sounds like fun, but its only frustrating and then just boring after a while. I took this game to a game trade-in store and got at least some money from it. I reccomend RENTING this game, and I'm not sure if its even worth that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting!","review":"For those of you familiar with the pen & paper Hunters, and are looking for an electronic version - this is NOT it. If you played \\"Vampire the Masquerade Redemption\\" on the PC, again this is NOTHING like it. If you want a hack & slash game with tuns on glitches and next to no story line, this is the game for you. Unlike what one may expect of a game based on a role-player game, you cannot distribute experience point to customize your character, nor can you upgrade weapons & armor. You can only aquire the weapons you find (which are severly limited), the only time you can save is at the end of each level, and the controls are overly complicated. This is a linear game with non stop hack & slash. The only good point to the game is the graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like borring, pointless, shooting games this is great","review":"I got borred of this game before I got done with the first level. All you do is shoot continuesly attacking monsters that get harder and harder to drop as you go on. The bosses are rediculously hard and the story line could have been thought up by a two year old ape. The graphics are alright and the gore is cool but thats about the extent of this games qualities. Rent the game don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, not worth the money","review":"First of all, I really wanted to buy this game from the reviews it had been getting, but in the long run I am glad I didn't. I had read all the reviews and previews and thought this would be like \\"resident evil.\\" However, after renting it, I was truly dissapointed and would not recommend this game other than a rental. This game is ultra hard, even for really experienced gamers. If you don't have at least three players, it is almost impossible. Forget about just doing single player, you just won't last. Second, it's very boring. The whole game is just cutting up zombies and weird creatures over and over again. It really gets old. The story itself seems to have good thought behind it, but please don't spend your money on this game. Give it rental, because that's all it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take your money and flush....","review":"Listen people take your money that could buy this game, and flush it down the toilet, cause it would be better spent. This is one of the WORST 10 XBOX games that has ever been created so far. I mean it seems alright at first. Then you get to playing it and there are more and more enemies, until you're extremely out-numbered. Than you die and its hard to earn more lives. Then the story line just seems to disapear for a while. This game is POSSIBLY worth thinking about renting, MAYBE! But I would'nt even rent this game if I would have know how bad it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short","review":"Its too bad. I was actually pretty excited about this game initially. Why not? It has a pretty intriguing story, admirable spooky, misty graphics, and a variety of cool playable characters. So why is this game such a dissapointment?There is no stategy or gamemanship required, whatsoever! To make it through the entire game (which I did) requires nothing more than constant movement of your character and a quick (and strong) trigger finger. This is more of an arcade-style game of the \\"Space Invaders\\" genre. Hordes of bad dudes constantly chase your character and you shoot them until your finger falls off. Its fun for the first hour or two and thats it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Multiplayer Game","review":"I thought this game was quite entertaining singleplayer, but the multiplayer feature was even better. You could start wherever you left off and fight story mode with 3 other friends. although the game is very repetitive, the swarms of zombies and monsters never gets me tired of the game. Hunter is great for a get together with the friends or even by yourself. the design and art of the game is very well detailed and the monsters are very well done. the game has pretty good graphics. this game is one of my games in my collection and it is going to be played for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible multi-player experience","review":"I thought that this game would be a great coorperation play game with a twist like Resident Evil. However, I found that this game was horrible in the multiplay arena. The game was easier (and slightly more fun) to play one player. There were way too many times when one player would get killed because another player was accidently trapping them.When will companies come to the conclusion that sharing the same screen just doesn't work on multi-player? Split it up and allow each user to move freely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but why \\"M\\"?","review":"This is a very fun game. The graphics and gameplay are tremendous and this is one of the best action games on X box (next to Halo). I don't understand how it's rated \\"M\\". A little bit of unrealistic red powder spills when you kill an enemy. It doesn't even stay on the ground in a pool of blood. This is defenetly a great action game for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game for mindless fun!","review":"This game is extremely fun! you get your four characters, which is cool and each has different skills, and as you play more with your character, they attain up to 3 skills, in which 2 of the characters have rejuvenate, which heals themselves and those around them.game is easy to play, but character building is game specific, i mean that each level and boss you beat is saved as a scene, with your increased character stats. however, if you were to go back to a previous scene or start a new game, you would have to rebuild your character.another thing is, camera angles can become terrible! that was the most frustrating part of the game. bosses are not terrible to beat, you have to use the \\"right\\" type of weapon against them.all in all, a very fun button mashing game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Fun Fun, for more than one...","review":"Hunter: The Reckoning is a very good game. If you've played any of the Gauntlet games, it's pretty much the same deal (one to four players, working for the common good), but this one is better. There are four characters (ironically all fitting each of my friends): The Martyr (a raver, like me!), the Defender, The Judge, and the Truck Driver (no, that not a mistake). Each character gets one long-range weapon (a gun or guns) an one close range weapon (a sword of knives). Infinite ammo is easy to earn right from the start (a BIG plus). The only downfall it that it would become tiresome with only one player, having to keep running back for health. A great party game, not a great single player game.Overall: Buy only if using more than one player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!!!!!!","review":"This game is the best game I've ever played! You think it whould like Resident Evil but its not its even better! It is so sweet with 4 players because the monsters get even harder and they start to multiply. Their are 4 diffrent people you can be so once you beat the game once with one person you can go back and beat it again with another person and each person carries diffrent weapons and they all have diffrent skills. Their many diffrent things to unlock and many diffrent skills to acheive. I deffenitly think this is the best Xbox game yet and I'm sure they\\"ll make many more of this series of games. So you should deffinitly deffinitly buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good graphics","review":"But the game is so hard.

Otherwise, very pleased with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"only somewhat helpful","review":"The general problem with Arabic texts is that there are not many good options out there. Supplemental books, such as the '201 Verbs', is ok, but it quickly loses the average student who is unfamiliar with what the meaning of the 'jussive' verb form is in English.I wish there would be a listing of the verbs in English as well. They are in alphabetical order in Arabic, something that is only of limited help. The need for better Arabic texts is very high. An overhaul of this book would be much appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very limited","review":"I agree with most of the other reviewers - this book is of limited use and a disappointment. It gives detailed conjugation of representative verbs but no list of other verbs which follow the representative patterns. It assumes you have the Wehr Dictionary handy in order to figure it all out. It was obviously intended for specialist use - if so why promote it so widely. Oh yeah - caveat emptor: it also has errors. A much more useful and cheaper book is Arabic Verbs and Essential Grammar by John Mace who packs a wealth of information into a small volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julia Brown's review of 201 Arabic Verbs","review":"I was dissapointed with this book because I was expecting the verbs to be written in Arabic (which they are) but also that the verbs be written as they are pronounced in English. This book is not usefull to people who do not know how to read in Arabic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, but could have been better.","review":"In this book, Jenkins describes his choice of the thousand best churches in England. Churches range from tiny, rural chapels notable for their remote, dramatic settings, to grand and majestic churches. (Cathedrals, however, are not covered, only parish churches.) He also rates the churches from one star through 5 stars.The descriptions are generally full and compelling. However, I took off one star from my rating, because, for the armchair traveller, more pictures would have been welcome. (How frustrating to read about glorious stained glass windows, and have no idea what they actually look like!) Only about one in 10 churches is illustrated with either an interior or exterior photo."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor job","review":"I'm a delirious fan and have all of their previous CDs, however I have to say that this CD is a bit of a disappointment and I don't listen to it often.Many of the songs are weak in the melody department - a strength of previous Delirious offerings. Martin Smith sounds like he is trying to channel Radiohead at times and ultimately fails in my opinion. The focus of the songs on this CD seems to have shifted away from outright Christian themes to more general life themes of love and loss. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to keep them stuck in the Christian ghetto with everyone else, I just think that tackling more general themes leaves them with a less distinctive voice than they had previously.If you are a die-hard fan like me then you'll buy this CD anyway. If not, steer clear of this particular offering........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I was disappointed with this record. I guess at some point the standard's got to fall, but the last two have been so good, they have stayed fresh and gone new places when I wasn't sure there were new places to go... But this one falls apart. It bows to radio like King of Fools did, but King of Fools had Deeper and Sanctify and King or Cripple and What a Friend I've Found... enough quality to forgive its overall blase sound. This record has two or three decent songs, no sparklers, and the rest is just boring.

I wouldn't take too many points off for pedestrian writing.But this terrible story at least deserved careful research, didn't it? Jones really falls down on that job, offering no substantive background on either the Aryan Brotherhood or (my particular field) dog behavior. San Francisco is home to some of the world's best dog behaviorists, and Jones even cites one of them (Jean Donaldson) in her acknowledgments, yet she winds up unable to offer any informed insight into what went wrong in these animals' breeding, training and handling. Given the notoriety of this case and the horror of Diane Whipple's death, Jones has really squandered an opportunity. If the quality of her dog-related information reflects the quality of the rest of her information, you won't find too many facts in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Zone","review":"This book is an exciting book by a well written and published author. Keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you realize that it did happen for real......read it and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleazy","review":"A big disapointment. I should have known after hearing Jones being interviewed on NPR. She came off as self-promoting and sensationalistic. I had hoped that the book would be better. It isn't. Her prose is sterile and overly focuses on direct quotations where a summary would do fine. Beyond that it reads like a literary version of the Jerry Springer show. It's no wonder that none of Diane Whipple's friends or family members would cooperate with Jones. They probably smelled her coming a mile away. Reading Red Zone is something akin to passing by a an accident on the highway and gazing at the carnage as you pass by, it makes you feel sleazy for having done so. Clearly Jones is a woman with no shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"On and on and on and on and on","review":"I was so excited to finally get a chance to read this book as I was looking forward to learning more about Diane Whipple and her LIFE. Boy, was I disappointed. There is very VERY little information about Diane Whipple and most of the book centers of Paul Schneider, who started the business with the dogs. And, comparing him to Hanibal Lecter? What?? It doesn't even make sense. This book rambles on and on and on about nothing, really, and I was very disappointed to see that it was written by Aphrodite Jones, whom I normally like to read. Had I known that those from Diane's side of the story didn't cooperate, I would have never picked up the book. Save your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable book, Questionable author","review":"Save your money. This book was not well researched and gives the wrong impression about the Presa. Often, Ms Jones gives the impression it is the breed itself that is the risk. Humans create bad dogs - regardless of the breed.To capitalize on a tragedy such as this with the poor resources used makes the Whipple case all the sadder. Allow those close to her to get on with their lives.I would not recommend this book at all - especially because the proceeds are going straight to lining an author's pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two clues","review":"1. Never read a true crime book with illustrations that include autopsy photos of the victim. If you were Diane Whipple's family or her lover, would you want the world to see those?2.

You can do better than this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for dog lovers","review":"Once you start reading Aphrodite Jones's book Red Zone you will not be able to put it down. Everything in your life will be put on hold until you finish this fascinating book. Most people heard about the dog mauling incident in San Francisco. Many San Franciscans followed the story- wondering how Noel and Knoller, the owners of the dogs, could be so smug- smiling at the tv camera's and throwing blame on Diane Whipple, the victim of the attack. Everyone should read the book to find out the sordid details.Aphrodite reveals the elaborate layers to the twisted story of how fine bred dogs could become weapons of destruction. It is an amazingly honest, shocking and sad story. In the end the book reminds the reader that Diane Whipple's death could have been prevented and that it is up to the public to keep their eyes and ears open and not let bully's like Noel and Knoller control our lives or the lives of pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe, dreck, swill, slop","review":"While it's true that this book gives more information than was provided by the media, it is so slathered with Ms. Jones' personal opinions and musings that it is hard to take seriously. A true journalist would have been a better choice for a story as intriguing and important as this. Instead, Ms. Jones seems to be more concerned with dropping the names of all the important San Francisco people she met: ex-Mayor Willie Brown, current Mayor Gavin Newsom and his lingerie model wife, Kimberley. Real journalists at least attempt to leave their own feelings out of their work, and report events in an objective way. Ms. Jones is clearly incapable. This book should have been called \\"All About Aphrodite: The San Francisco Years.\\" The book cover photograph of her alone is worth a thousand words (most of them unflattering.)

She still shows her skill for meticulous research."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner","review":"As a follower of Ms. Jones' work, I have read all of her books. I think Red Zone is her best to date, even better than Cruel Sacrifice, one of the best true crime books I've read to date. I think the fact that she dedicated the book to Diane Whipple is interesting, and I think the message in this book is important for animal lovers and pet owners everywhere. Even though the story is really about two Pacific Heights lawyers who were responsible for Whipple's death, the book makes a great point about people's responsibility to their animals. I highly reccomend it and look forward to her next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Background of Case","review":"I found the background information to be quite interesting, and realized there is much more to the story than the death of an innocent woman. The title was appropriate and relevant to the material describing behind-the-scenes events which I don't recall reading in any newspaper article. I learned much from this book, and it is apparent that the author had access to quite a bit of information the rest of us did not know existed. She did her homework. I also read Death of An Angel (a different angle about the same story) and it appears the author of that book did not have access to the same type of information, or chose not to write about it. I believe Red Zone to be a more thorough account of the story as a whole, and would recommend it to any true crime novel buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must read this book!!!!","review":"Having followed Jones' career, I highly recommend Red Zone and consider it to be the best book she has written yet. This is an author who is truly passionate about her subject and it shows in her work. I followed this case on Court TV, but I had no idea of the evil lurking behind these two San Francisco attorneys and their eerily frightening \\"adopted son\\". Ms. Jones really gave me an insiders peek into their world of twisted sex and fantasies.I can't wait to see what she has in store for us in her next book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Understanding Panic | Less for Overcoming","review":"In the midst of raging anxiety, I find 400 page a little overwhelming.

That is defininately not what I needed to hear, especially with my fears. I couldn't even finish reading the book because it made me so nervous. Why on earth would this author go into such detail for more than half the book on conditions that you might have that might not be caused by anxiety but rather some disease. Instead of calming you about the bodily symtoms you have, as they are normal in axiety, he goes into detail about hear disease, strokes, etc. No thank you. Horrible Book!

Now why in the world would you do that to a group of people that are well known for having a health anxiety?If you are agoraphobic and do not have health anxiety issues then maybe this book might be okay but then again,I suspect that if you didn't have health anxiety before you read it, that you may have health anxiety by the time you reach the end of chapter one.I wish I had never bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the research","review":"The recommendation to reduce anxiety and worry by thought stopping have been found untherapeutic in recent studies.

My book arrived so fast I felt like I had just ordered it and suddenly it was delivered to my door.This book was recommended to me and I am so happy that I got it. This book is actually a pleasure to read because it is quite informative without any of the boring factor. I had read about 100 pages before realizing just how many pages I had read - reader friendly.It is full of useful information and pertinent data to anyone suffering with Panic Disorder or knows someone who is.The contents of this book are divided into 4 parts:1.- Identifying the Problem2.- The Nature of Anxiety Attacks3.- Don't Panic Live: Your Moment-by-Moment Strategies4.- Support When You Need ItI would definitely recommend this book because I feel it is a very helpful asset in one's tool box when dealing/coping with Panic.

She wasn't able to go beyond a certain point in the book and I told her not to bother.My mother will be 80 in January, and these attacks scare her quite a bit (plus, she lives alone). I wouldn't argue the benefit the book may have had for other people, but I certainly think it's not going to be a \\"one size fits all\\" and much will have to do with the reader's personal situation and state of mind. Caution should probably be followed re: puchasing this book in situations involving the elderly and an already \\"fragile\\" mindset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this book at all","review":"I started to get a panic attack reading this book. The begining of the book just keeps going into detail about panic, panic, panic, panic, symptoms, panic, more symtpons, more details of panic, every other sentence has the word panic, dizzy, nervousenes, more nervousnes, fear, terrified, hurt, more hurt, more panic. When you read this book these words just get pounded into your head and pretty soon you feel like your going to get another episode just reading this detailed negativity. I retuned the book immediatly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me Nervous!","review":"I have been suffering from panic and anxiety since I was 4 years old. This book was recommended by my therapist, and I found it tremendously panic-inducing! It's a little dense, and there's a very thick section in the beginning which just describes panic over and over and over again... !!!!!Sometimes, I've found that reviewing the symptoms of panic can actually get me to calm down. I realize that these are just symptoms, and they'll go away when I can calm down. Not so with this book. It makes me too nervous, and I have to put it down. I've never been able to read more than a few pages without feeling sick.It's utterly useless, in my opinion, to those it's trying to help. May be a good read for the spouse or partner of a suffering person. Have someone read it and give you the information!"},{"rating":"1","title":"all filler.","review":"this book is about 75% filler. there are many parts where it will say something like \\"before we learn the technique of controlled breathing, lets reflect on something\\". then you gotta read 3 pages of non-sense before actually learning what the chapter was meant to teach. also, the book is very boring, uses huge medical words normal people don't know, and is just not helpful. lets face it, if your reading it it's cause you got some loose screws in your head. your either anxious which comes with depression most of the time and your stressed out. most people in that situation don't want to sit and read a boring book that's written like a technical manual on routine maintenance. also, there are a lot of religious references. science and religion should not be mixed. Psychology is the scientific study of human (or animal) mental functions and behaviors. if your religious... great... pray for less anxiety. if your not, find a more interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and wordy","review":"This book is about as easy to swallow as two valiums without any water.

This album first turned me on to Rovo in a big way, which led to my seeing them live in San Francisco in 2001. Much as I dug the record, it was only after seeing them live that I realized that this band pulls off their amazing sound in real-time, and that the awesome effects achieved on Imago were not the result of studio wizardry or cut-and-paste beats, but because Rovo are one of the most incredibly tight and virtuosic bands I've ever seen. Watching the two drummers play complex poly-rhythms off each other was worth the price alone. Definitely check out their show next time they come anywhere near you. Meanwhile, pick this one up. It's a knock-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, pleasing, and fun","review":"Rovo is not like anything you'd normally find categorised as techno, trance, or electronic -- incidental music doesn't quite grasp the complexity of the music, either. But the music is fun -- it's interesting to listen to; there's always something new to hear in the tracks. It's different, and unique, incorporating more traditional elements of electronica with things you can't quite figure out what you hear. The best way to decide if you like this is download \\"Horses\\" or \\"N'Dam\\" (at epitonic.com) and give it a try. This is music that engages your brain, as well as your body, without leaving you behind thinking you missed something along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracklisting","review":"1.

The other stories in the series were much better. I also was not a fan of Alyx. Whine, whine, shout shout... The \\"couple\\" fighting overpowered this novel.

However, what I enjoy the most in a author is when they allow their heroines to be feminine, but not weak. Just as a strong woman needs and wants a strong man. I like to believe a strong man wants and needs a strong woman. Once I figure out exactly how many books there are to this set I plan to read everyone of them.Could you please tell me the exact order the Montgomery Trilogy goes in?

There are 4 'Velvet' books and then the actual first of the series, but actually book number 5, is a book called \\"The Black Lyon\\". I had read that one a long time ago and never related it to the 'Velvet' books until I read this one, \\"Velvet Song\\", where Alyx has the lion belt that is described in 'The Black Lyon'.

I love most of Jude's books but this one was a huge disappointment. First, the romantic lead. He's a big, sulking bully. He spanks his wife.

Not even there for the birth!! I think if Jude had written an epilogue I would have been a little bit more placated. I thought this was going to be the best one. Alyx was heart breakingly sweet and loving and absolutely loyal, I'm glad Raine finally came around to be the same. One more to go in the series ^_^ I have to say redo the middle.

Ms. Argerich has been said to be reclusive, impulsive, often haunted by stage fright, and generally shy of the limelight. Coupled with her impassioned, outside-the-envelope playing, Martha engenders enduring admiration and curiosity among her fans. In this approximately 70 minute video, Martha indulges us with a glimpse of her artistic traits, passions, and motivations.The video includes a number of performance excerpts from throughout her career; and particularly, Ms. Argerich describes her special reverence for a favorite teacher from her teenage years, the late Friedrich Gulda. She also describes how she learned the Prokofiev 3rd piano concerto, subliminally.For anyone who would enjoy seeing and hearing this artist's personal insight into her life as an esteemed pianist and as a hair-raising musical genius, buy this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"too crude","review":"I bought this for a cowboy unit in first grade.

I know it's all in good fun, but I can pretty much guarantee that I would have plenty of parents who would be offended and/or upset that their child checked this out of his/her school library (and folks, I'm not at all a prude here, but I have to say I agree!).

George Elsey has told the story of his experiences with clarity and continuity that makes history reading fun. The word serendipity came to mind numerous times while George relates the fortuitous events in his life. He does not belabor the reader with oft-told events that are common knowledge. His narrative style paints a vivid picture of how important and significant world affairs melded together through the 40s, 50s and 60s.

You get a front seat to the mid-60s Sunset Strip teenage scene, replete with a wild club performance by the Beau Brummels (and as they play, you get Toni Basil doing the monkey and the frug from inside a cage). This movie is about teenagers versus adults, teenagers from an upscale neighborhood versus teenagers from working class families, teenager versus the law . . . And you get a young Ron Howard playing a geeky whiz kid who accidentally creates \\"goo,\\" a concoction which, when ingested, turns you into a giant. Whacky 60s movie fans will love this one. Attack of the Puppet People is a worthwhile film in its own right - a tale of a creepy and desperate dollmaker who turns anyone who crosses him into one of his dolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential cut short","review":"This movie had all the potential to being one of the great tiny people movies but came up short, pun intended. The doll maker was not evil and even a bit likeable; his main reason for creating live dolls was because he was lonely. No thrills, no near deaths, no real reason for this movie even though it had lots of potential it didn't take advantage of anything that would have made me want to see it again. The cop was told several times what the old man was doing and never once came close to believing. The ending left you feeling like they just gave up on this idea and called it a day.

It is that important, Brodsky is that important. It is the best single reading of a Frost poem that I have ever seen, but good-better-bests is not the issue.

Suffice to say they are all gloriously on show in this tenth anniversary edition. This edition is an absolute necessity for anyone who enjoys Calvin and Hobbes' antics.The normally reclusive Bill Watterson gives his thoughts on his strips, the world in which Calvin and Hobbes live and cartooning in general. He talks about the joy that cartooning as a career has given him and the reasons why he has refused to sell out and cash in on merchandising the Calvin and Hobbes brand.Needless to say there is also a long parade of many of the most popular and memorable of the strips which means that it is fantastic and hilarious even for newcomers.

Calvin and Hobbes sometimes share their deep insights on the values of life. Sometimes their personal outlooks on life are reflected off Watterson's views, which is a great skill to have. Along with the comics, the book is filled with accounts the author wrote, explaining his feelings about the comics and what they mean to him. The book is funny and adventurous, and when you're through reading it, you might have learned a lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite of the Calvin and Hobbes books because:","review":"The comics are really funny and I like how he tells you about what he was thinking when he was writing the comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anniversary Book was great","review":"It was bought for a gift to my brother as he is a Calvin fan ( like me ) from way back and he was thrilled at receiving the Anniversary Book.

Reading this book, I begin to understand Calvin and Hobbes better than before."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great works of American Literature","review":"Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes is a true joy in every sense of the word. No other American artist in any medium has depicted childhood with such intelligence and sympathy, never descending into sentimental schmaltz. Calvin's sheer joy in simply being alive is never less than infectious. Thank God for Bill Watterson, and thank Bill Watterson for Calvin and Hobbes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be 10 stars **********","review":"This book is the early Bill Watterson Calvin & Hobbs.

I particularly like the first one, DE 7th. From the imaginative cover with the tab notation for the two chords, this is a slick release. Dave rips it up on the Bruce Springsteen tune \\"From Small Things Mama\\" with ripping horns on the end of the tune. The cover of the NRBQ song \\"Me and the Boys\\" offers an interesting use of delay on the lead vocals to provide a doubling effect. \\"Generation Rumble\\" is a nice tune that received airplay as well. The second release, Information, was produced by ELO's Jeff Lynn, and showcases the lush vocal layering that made their sound so popular. Dave's guitar playing and singing are great on the compiled version. I still like Tracks on Wax more, but think this is a nice repacking, allowing the listener two albums for the price of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't buy this product","review":"My review here is worth nothing because I do not remember buying this.

Si!","review":"He's the Peter Allen of Brazil -- way over-the-top, kinda queeny, and a bit of a blue balladeer. His previous records always struck my ear as the kinda bouncy pop that Xuxa purveys across Latin America. But with \\"Olhos de Farol\\" Matogrosso stakes out fresh territory. Miséria No Japo, the lede off cut on this pretty satifsying, is a powerful rocker that suits his reedy bray. The title track could emerge to become one of late-MPB's great supper club ballads. Stand out track is the beautiful \\"Poema,\\" penned by Cazuza. Play spot the \\"Free Bird\\" lick on the other tracks. Live DVD available.

We didn't know if we were having a boy or a girl, and this pattern suited both (we had a boy).Pros:1. Neutral pattern -- goes with neutral decor2. Vibration system great when we first brought our son home3. Elevated changing table so you don't have to bend as much4. With wheels, easy to moveCons:1. Bassinet & changing table don't fit in travel bag2. Canopy can't be used with playard alone (it is attached to the bassinet)3. Place for wipes only holds about 15 (but this looks like the norm with most Pack n Plays)Unlike other reviewers, we had no problems figuring out how to put this together. As a matter of fact, we liked this so much and raved about it that my cousin in Greece wants one -- my aunt just bought one to mail to her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"This pack n play has every feature available. I love the heigth of the changing table, but wish it folded up better for travel since that is what this is for. My daughter loves the vibrating feature and the nature sounds.

When my husband and cousin assembled it, it resembled a true princess' bed. The website picture didn't do it justice. Layla loved her bassinet and we were sad when she outgrew it...she's now 7 months. But, she thoroughly enjoys her playpen. It gives her plenty of room to play and me the opportunity to do somethings around the house. She just recently started sleeping in her crib, but I still prefer the playpen.The only con is that there is no handle to the travel bag! Not sure what Graco was thinking about when they made it. But, other than that it's a definite winner, in me and Layla's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMFY","review":"This play yard is very expensive and has a lot of options, many I feel most people won't use, but maybe that's just me? I liked the pattern and the changing pad that could be moved out of the way instead of those that completely remove and you have to find a place to put them while using it as a bassinet.HOWEVER . . .this is the only place my now 5 week old CANNOT sleep. The pad is too big for the area it's meant to fit in. The sleeping pad is bent downwards in the middle, I try to lie her in it the short way, like the picture someone posted above, but she won't fit there long. I can see how a mattress could be uncomfy even for an infant. She sleeps fine in her crib and all other places we place her. I also think putting a sheet on it is SO hard, because they made the bassinet part rounded on the corners, for no significant reason.I would NOT recommend this play yard."},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"I just bought this for my 5month old daughter and i love it it is so convenient and easy to use i was able to put it together without the use of the instructions its just an over all great product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad value for what you get...","review":"I purchased this DVD game for $24.99 and was very excited to play it. The game was pretty fun, however, after you play it 3 times you can just throw it in the trash! There are only 3 games on the whole entire disk, so once you've played them you know all the answers. Each game takes about 30 min., so you could easily play them all in one night. I was terribly dissappointed that the questions didn't change each time you play, it really makes the game useless for future playing. This game should cost about $5 or less for what you get!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't even bother wasting your money on this so called game. Do yourself a favour and spend a couple dollars more and get Scene It. Not only are most of the questions on this game moronically simple but once you've gone through them during the three games, they NEVER change. If this thing cost under $5 then I might suggest it, especially if you were just renting it and then didn't have to make room for it on the yard sale table to get rid of it once you've played it. But if you were stupid enough, like us, to pay $30 cdn on it then you will be thoroughly mad at yourself for doing so. So, please, take my advice and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game. but not worth the money","review":"The game really is clever, convenient and a lot of fun. However, there are only three identical games on the DVD. So, once you play them, it's over. you know the answers and can't play them again. when you pay close to $20 (and in some cases, plus shipping) it most definately is NOT worth the buy. it's good for an hour and a half of great fun. and it's over. I consider it a waste of money. We bought two editions, but decided not to open the second one and wilil just return it. I can't believe a company would even make a game that has that short of a life span. And, charge that much money. The concept is great. There is no game board, scoreing is within and it's extremely convenient. The games were great fun. just not enough on one dvd, for that money. We were highly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooooooo much fun.","review":"This game was given to me as a gift. It is likely the best new game that I have played in years. I play a lot of board games, and there is no other game that compares. It is all on DVD, but it doesn't need a video game system, just a regular DVD player. I am a big fan of Trivial Pursuit, and am also a not so humble movie buff, and this game really tickled me pink. It has classics like Hitchcock and ET, and favorites like Teen Wolf. It has a lot of elements of a game show, with a live host and a final jeopardy type bet at the end of the game. But, it also looks and feels like a video game and the graphics are top, top notch. I recommend this to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Whole Family","review":"My family and I LOVE this game! I broke out this game one night to play with my sisters who are huge movie buffs. We had a BLAST! By the next day we were up to game 3 and included 4 more family members including my 8 year old son and my mom. This is truly a family game. There is no learning curve - just put the DVD in the player and start. The game keeps track of the score (you enter it after each round) so you can just play.Others have mentioned the downside - you can only play the games once. I am not sure how you can get around this with this medium. I suggest selling (or buying) this game at eBay to get the most of your money.

That being said, even if it is just a placebo, at least it's doing something for you. I've heard that Picamilon can cross the BBB, though I haven't done the research to find out yet. Picamilon is GABA bound to a niacin and is used to relieve various ailments. I'm going to give it a try as I've tried GABA because of all the good reviews, thinking maybe if I took enough some would cross the BBB.

I own a vinyl copy that I found last year in a used record shop, and being familiar with \\"The Flock\\" and never having never heard this before I was quite excited to get it, but ultimately disappointed. I have to admit I should give it another listen or two to give it a fair shot, but my impression is that this was one of those bands that just had one good album in them, and this wasn't it.So I recommend \\"The Flock\\", but you can't go wrong plunking down a few extra bucks and getting this combined collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a unique band in any time.","review":"I remember hearing this album long ago at the house of the first chair tenor sax player. Dinosaur Birds was the album we listened to, an I thought it was different from what I was hearing at the time, and in the time of Chicago, Tower of Power, Blood, Sweat, and Tears, The Ides of March, Kool and the Gang, many horn bands playing many styles of music. What made them stand out I believe was Jerry Goodman and his electrically amplified violin, along with excellent writing by the horn section and lead guitar player. So now I have both album's to remember and listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"If you are a fan of The Flock stay away from this release.

Seems as though the band's first choice, one Jean-Luc Ponty, couldn't get a work visa from those same wonderful folks (INS) who kept playing with John Lennon's freedom, for the first half of the 70s.To suggest that Clive's move crippled The Flock is something of a mild understatement. He was more-or-less the George Harrison of the group, after Freddie Gliskstein and Tom \\"T.S. Henry\\" Webb (as Paul and John, respectively).

Second, this was the ONLY time outside of the early to mid-1930's that Artie Shaw and the equally great jazz vocalist Connee Boswell recorded together.

It's very good, though some of the relationships in it makes it unsuitable for younger readers. Very surprising if you've only read the authors 'Young Wizards' or the spinnoff of that series 'Cat Wizards' series.The central character is a young nobleman, who is trying to unleash his dormant magical abilities. Abilities that only women have been able to use for untold generations. Along the way, he aides his boyfriend the renegade prince of a neighboring kingdom, as well as a fire elemental, and a distant cousin. Not to mention a dragon. Oh, did I mention that the demonic Shadow wants the guy as dead as possible, and out of its way?If you read fantasy, and don't have a problem with unconventional lifestyles, you should pick up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"sometimes kinky-sometimes just odd","review":"Like most albums from the sixties sexy movie scene this is a lot of fun.

Lo novedoso es la velocidad de la acción de este librito. Si te gustan las novelas rápidas, plagadas de acción con un toquecito (o un toquesote) de historia bien documentada, tipo el Codigo Da Vinci, te va a encantar éste. No es un nobel, pero nos acerca con una construcción suficientemente nueva a los secretos templarios en España y nos pone a pensar. Que pasaría despues con el tal Arca de la Alianza???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky and unillustrated","review":"I had high hopes for this guide given Frommer's reputation for quality guidebooks that are slightly more upmarket than Lonely Planet. But, the paper quality is like cheap paperbacks in checkout aisles, there are no illustations/photographs, and the writers insert too much of their personality and preferences in the writing (at times the guide reads like a feminist critique of Japan). And there are few maps, which were difficult to read (colors would have been nice)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Kindle","review":"The content is decent for Tokyo and Kyoto but the book is not designed for the kindle. The book has few internal links which makes it quite awkward to navigate. Very hard to search for specific cities that are not part of the table of contents. Stick to Lonely Planet or Rough Guide when using a kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, with much information, but could use more maps","review":"Very useful guidebook--I used it on a trip to Japan in 2001 and I will use it again this year. Much information, about relatively small cities, even, if they would be of interest to Westerners.A few faults. First, more maps are needed. Yes, I know Japanese don't always name their streets, but they could be based on landmarks. If you choose to visit one of the smaller cities covered, say, Takayama, you will do so without a Fodor's map (get one at the Tourist office, usually by the train station). But even some large cities, which are extensively covered, like Kobe, do not have maps in the book.Second, more hotels should be reviewed, and they might want to concentrate on the sort of hotel you'd book online.Third, there's a certain incompleteness about the text. For example, they list the three top gardens in Japan. You will find that only two of the cities are listed in the index. For the third, look in vain.Still, I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst guide book I've ever used","review":"Terrible directions (5 min walk from station...

What I will say is that we are having a horrible time finding copies that play without scattering immages, or freezing up the player. So far we've had to return episode one 2 times (one time it came with 2 identical discs (i.e one disc one, two discs two, and one disc 4), we've had to return season 2 and 3 for reasons that they're not playable. It will play fine on one disc, then the next disc it crashes, pixilates, or won't load at all. We don't have this problem with ANY other movies. SO, beware, watch ALL the episodes before you put it on your shelf, and be prepared (and if you are a true fan, you will do this) to keep on trying until all the discs WORK. All that I can figure is that they weren't sure they'd sell (big mistake) and made them CHEAP. What a shame.GOOD LUCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Fun","review":"The series was always delightful because it was fun, done with panache and done with a little tongue in cheek.

The first episode, Steele Away With Me, is a disappointment only because whenever the show went on location to exotic locales (as they do in this episode), the focus is always more on the locale rather than the characters. Technically, the two-sided discs and the lack of commentaries by Stephanie Zimbalist, Pierce Brosnan, or Doris Roberts are major disappointments, and wouldn't it have been nice to see one of Pierce Brosnan's auditions? But otherwise, this is an collection- buy and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remington Steele - Season Two","review":"OK, Remington Steele isn't great drama or fantastic special effects, but I love the quirky humor and the sparring (and sparks) between the characters played by Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist. I felt that \\"Mildred\\" added a lot to the office repartee. The casting of the visiting stars, bad guys and clients, made for entertaining variety. I loved watching the show when it ran on TV, but missed a lot of episodes. I am delighted to have the opportunity to see the series \\"in order\\" at my convenience, when I can take the time to watch the behind the scenes featurette and character profile.

But next time I will be returning any issues.I cannot actually rate this DVD, BECAUSE I DIDN'T receive the right item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, Bad dvd","review":"This is my worst experience ever with dvd. Remington Steele season 1 was fine. Then I guess the dvd company decided to go cheap because season 2 (and 3, I understand) are very bad. I had to receive and return 6 or 7 sets of season 2 before I got one that worked. Every set had 1 or 2, or more discs that were flawed in production and would not play (stalled, pixellated, etc.). I watch a lot of dvds and I have several players, so this is definitely a case of a bad production run. Since Amazon absorbs the shipping for all the returns and replacements, they should put some pressure on the dvd companies to have just a minimum of quality control. If you want to collect this show, count on having to go back and forth A LOT before you get ones that work.

He proves here that, when he wants to, he can go purely for laughs and score big. There are countless verbal and physical gags in this film and they're all brilliant. Beneath all the glorious bits, however, is a sweet love story--not so sweet that it obscures the comedy, however. This movie has ideas so fresh and funny, they'll stay with you forever.

There are many great sight gags as well as the usual number of quality one-liners. The film is done in a documentary style, telling the story of Virgil Starkwell, an incompentent petty criminal, played by Woody of course.To pick a favourite moment out is difficult. However, if forced to pick one I'd go for the scene where Virgil tries to rob a bank, and fails because he hands over a note where the word gun can easily be mistaken for gub. Consequently the entire bank staff and customers are all arguing whether the word is gun or gub. Woody insists its gun; everybody else thinks its gub...This is definitely one of Woody's early funny ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I am only 12 and I think this is one of my favorite movies.

You don't have to use crude humor or put downs to be funny... but this is not funny!

The stories are so orginal and flat out hilarious, all three taking place in Memphis, Tennesee and involving Elvis Presley in some way. The best story is the first, Far From Yokohama, involving the young Japanese couple (Masatoshi Nagasai & Yuki Kudoh) visiting Memphis for the first time.

They all spend the night at a fleabag hotel (The Arcade, run by Screamin' Jay Hawkins!). Jarmusch's use of flashback, a la RASHOMON, is clever and inspired.

I got a real kick out of seeing him walking along Bell Blvd with an old schoolmate past some joints familiar to myself,growing up in Flushing.

Social issues that are presented in episodes of the show such as alcholism, racism, teen pregnancy, and many more are delivered in an entertaining yet educational manner. Sit down with your sports loving children and these episodes just might provoke much needed discussion in today's world between parent and child.

I would not recommmend this play yard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Playyard","review":"While we have the previous version of this playyard, it sounds like the problems that we have encountered are still present. I agree that the changing table part is too small and not very sturdy for an infant. We used it but I constantly worried about safety. Our little girl is now big enough to sit in the playyard itself to play. I agree that you can feel the poles through the bottom of it, even with the pad. I have lined ours with blankets to make it more comfortable. This morning though, my daughter toppled over from a sitting position and banged her head on one of the four support poles. These are not padded at all and are quite dangerous in my opinion. We spent a good bit of money thinking that the Eddie Bauer name would lead to a high quality product.

So in order to bring all those other things with you, you'd need an additional large box! We thought this was ridiculous! The only part you can carry in the bag is the crib portion itself! To take apart these additional items (the changing table, mobile) we needed a screwdriver because the snap and lock system was so tight that we couldn't press the buttons in order to pull it apart. We're young and strong, too, so that wasn't the problem. If you want something truly portable, go for something much simpler. All these \\"cool\\" extras just make it very heavy, and hard to take with you. We're returning ours and getting something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this thing!!!","review":"I had registered for this item for my baby shower and glad that I did. My son is almost 5 months old and has loved this pack and play since day one. He loves the bears that spin around on the mobile! It is very sturdy and easy to assemble. I also like it because it is neutral and matches just about any decor.The reason I am giving it only 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is so annoying that I have to keep going in the room to wind up the mobile, it only goes for about a minute or two and then you have to crank it up again. Also the music and vibration only lasts about 5 minutes or so and I have to keep hitting the button to repeat it. For the money they really could of made those two features a little better for the consumer. Overall, I would recommend this item though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"warning","review":"This product is DANGEROUS! Not only was it difficult to fold and unfold, but the seam on the sides spontaniously split in half after three months of purchase.

My sons leg had gotten caught underneath the padding. And the only thing I could fit into the travel bag was the playpen itself. I am shocked that this product is on the market and deemed safe. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good while it lasts","review":"i got this play yard for my son because of the portability, i returned 2 before my son was even born because they would not fold up, then when i got one that folded properly for traveling, the changing table and bassinet parts do not fit in the travel bag so you can't take them, but after 1 1/2 years, this one would no longer fold up either, called cosco the manufacturer and they said it was past warranty and nothing they could do. i wont buy anymore cosco products for my babies. my old play yard from when i was a baby 30+years ago still folds, i expect better products in this day and age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dimes do not exist, apparently.","review":"This bank does not recognize the existence of the dime.

I saw this product on sale in an ad and rushed out with the purpose of buying one for every grandkid because it looked fun. Only one was left which I'm extremely thankful for now!You really have to force coins into the slot due to a really strong spring inside. This causes coins to pop back out yet they've been counted. It also has a hard time telling pennies and dimes. Five dimes can go in and only be counted as $0.05.We were unable to find an on/off button. We theorized that maybe it turns off automatically like some calculators do. The end result, it stays on 24/7. I have no idea how long the batteries would last.It's cute to look at but I imagine kids might find it frustrating when the counter doesn't add up right.

If you push carefully from your right hand side then it can count properly. However, this requires mature hand coordination which is beyond a six year old child. My six year old just push it from the top or from the left sometimes and it just simply count the total wrongly.The purpose of buy this jar is not for you the adult.

My son took some out this morning - I don't know of a way to subtract.The jar is hard plastic; the LED stays lit - not sure how long the batteries will last.

There are several faults with the function of this bank. We bought two and they both do the same things. It is clearly a design deficiency. They often count pennies as dimes and vice versa. They also will count incorrectly if the coin is not pushed straight into the slot. You can start to push it and if it pops back up, it will count something. It does not recognize any coin greater than a quarter. Overall it is a novelty item at best. If your child tells you he put 5 dollars in the bank and the bank says there is 4.50, I would trust your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"I was thrilled to get this bank for use of the \\"coffee fund\\" at my work. But I was rather disappointed to find that there is NO way to adjust the amount of money listed in the jar if you remove the money. You have to reset it and drop all the remaining change back into the jug to re-total it. Not very convenient when you're regularly taking out money to purchase things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool money jar!!","review":"My 6 year old son had a coffee can full of coins and was constantly asking me to count it.

We went back the next week and bought another for my 4 year old.The kids are always asking what they can do to earn my pocket change so they can put it in their jars. I often slip my change in as well just to see how much they have. I have not noticed any miscalculation of money (except for when my 4 year old unscrewed the top and put the change back in...easily rectified by pulling the batteries out and putting them back in and starting over).When the jars are full, we're going to Disney. A good incentive for the kids to save."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"The electronic counter stopped working after two days and I'm left with a junk plastic jar.

He dumped that out and decided to start over. The next four coins he dropped in, were calculated right, but then he dropped a dime in and it added $0.11 to his total.

I was a little concerned by previous reviews about the adding innacuracies but ordered anyway... then ended up returning them almost immediately. The bank misread the very first coin, then after I reset it, it kept misreading within the first few coins we put in. It seemed like if there was ANY sort of hesitation or movement once you put the coin over the slot, it would misread it - and of course three and a half year olds aren't known for having steady hands so I don't think this bank is well suited for kids.

Within 4 coins it misread the value of a dime, adding on 15 cents and then continued to do this ever after. To top it all, when the total got to $6.01 the readout stopped there and refused to budge and is no doubt still showing that as it languishes at the bottom of the dumpster.Save yourself some money and the crestfallen face of your child and avoid this piece of crap like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for rebreather practice","review":"This is the text we used for my rebreather course and I still look at it today even though I have not done much rebreater work recently.

You can not control motion on pitches, which means the fancy pitch selector has no function except asthetics. If you hit a home run, you don't watch the ball flight....just an immediate splash screen saying \\"Home Run.\\" The backgrounds and animations look nice atleast, with many different fields and stylish 3D batters. Unfortunately, the batter clicks and skips from missing frames. Some boys have girl names and visa versa. The worst thing about it is that some elementary baseball rules are ignored.

How ridiculous!Scott also attempts to prove his thesis by stating that alcohol sometimes plays a role in hidden transcripts becoming public. I suppose he hasn't had much experience with alcohol or those who have partaken of alcohol, else he would realize this is painfully obvious and not a groundbreaking revelation.I give the book 2 stars because of its readability and the obvious effort put into the research.

Granted does what the author says occur... sure anything can happen, but the author makes it seem like it will happen. If you really want to know about the military and military life then ask someone who is in the military.

It has a compelling storyline: by recovering the particular conditions that led to Lincoln's assassination in 1865, the reader is led deep into the heart of a universal condition. Brothers Booth take readers onto a higher plane--it's at this level that we feel inspired, provoked, and alive. This book reinterprets ordinary history in a way that enables the reader to see into the mind and motives of John Wilkes Booth, in much the same way as Shakespeare saw into Julius Caesar.Having said this, be warned that Brothers Booth will not reward a casual reading; it requires careful attention to unlock its treasure--a fact that makes the book even more amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"didn't last","review":"The light bulb only lasted two games then blew out.

It has the brightest light and the best coverage I've seen. It is also fully adjustable to completely eliminate glare. It does have a few drawback however. its bigger and heavier than many other lights, which has never bothered me since its easily removable, but some people has issues with this. It also takes 3 AA batteries and eats them like candy. I'd seriously recommend a good set of NiMH rechargables to go along with this light.

Hands down the BEST light. I think it is still a better product than the other lights out there even though it has some serious design flaws.1. It uses power cells way too fast.2. The lower bracket that attaches the unit to the GBA is somewhat thin and the possiblity of the \\"tab\\" that secures it to the bottom of the GBA is likely to snap off with little abuse.3. When the unit is attached to the GBA it gives it a top-heavy center of gravity. You'll find yourself clutching your GBA with a kung-foo death grip if you don't watch yourself.Otherwise the Flood Light is great. It really brings out the colors and details of the games.

Overall, the Flood Light provides the best light in the worst conditions with the least glare.

And there I found her: Lucienne Delyle. This two-disk set contains digitally remastered recordings from all parts of her short career, and it is most enjoyable. I have read that people believe her voice became smokier and richer with time, and I can hear that, but I confess I am most charmed by the songs from the late 1930s and early 1940s, including \\"Sur les quais de vieux Paris.\\"When you are in the mood for mid-20th century popular Parisian music, this set fills the bill nicely!

We did get a few laughs out of the movie, but I assure you, the director didn't mean them.I'm not quite sure why anyone would think of this 'story' and even put it down on paper, let alone make a movie out of it. I'm pretty easy to please, but when the most exciting moment in a whole movie is a toss-up between someone's aunt winning a hand of cards, or someone else swiping a vase off a shelf, I have to say pass on this one, and spend your money on something a little more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting film about boring people","review":"If you have ever felt a complete stranger in a foreign country or just felt lonely (and sure you did), you'll love the film. Stranger Than Paradise is one of my Jarmusch favorites (at par with Down by Law).Two melancholic characters, played or better said - lived - by John Lurie and Richard Edson, seem to be happy to just go with the flow without any particular purpose. But arrival of the Hungarian cousin creates purpose in their lives and makes the film very exciting. There are plenty of hilarious moments in this, in my view, very sad movie about being an outsider and feeling lonely.5 out of 5 stars for Jim Jarmusch, John Lurie and cameraman Tom DiCillo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful mid-80s Independent Film","review":"Before Sundance and Soderbergh, STRANGER THAN PARADISE pretty much defined what was an independent film. Shot in beautiful Black and White, with long unedited takes, this movie seems like slow going at the outset, but if you stay with it, you'll get into it. You sort of have to adjust yourself OUT OF the rhythms of Hollywood movie-making. Not a masterpiece, but I love this movie anyways. At the time of its release, it was just so, so, so... different. And it still is almost 20 years later! And Screamin' Jay Hawkins is THE MAN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too minimal","review":"Next to your average, American Joe, I consider myself to be pretty preferential to minimalism, but this is a little past where I draw the line. I really wanted to like this movie, but nothing happens. Maybe somehow that's the point, and I just didn't get it or something, but it's boring as hell. The performances are good, but most of the time the actors aren't acting; they're just sitting there as the camera films them. It's a lot like watching a friend's home movies, except only the stuff where nothing's really happening. I didn't count the lines in the film, but I'm pretty sure I could. The camera work is good and so is the editing, but those things alone couldn't hold my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Indeed, an Indie Classic","review":"The black and white is a nice touch. I was surprised to find this movie listed under Comedy, I thought it was more of a drama. Anyway, if you're looking for something quiet, see 'Paradise.' It has barely any action, so if you're loking for something exciting, I wouldn't watch it. It seems to take place in the 1960s; it's a bit dark and urban. The characters aren't too developed throughout the movie, but screamin' Jay Hawkins shows a different side of the character Eva, form Budapest, Hungary. Yet another classic film for Jarmusch.

It has lingered with me all this time, and I finally broke down and bought the DVD. I had to see it again. This is first rate stuff. Jarmusch has done what most directors can only dream of doing, creating a witty, off-beat film on the most thread bare of budgets, driven by gritty compelling characters. The humor is so dry as to leave your throat parched at film's end, but don't be disappointed. It is truly a memorable film."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISCONCEPTION","review":"Totally disappointed.

If as much work was put into the story and acting as was in the filming of the animals, scenery, explosion, avalanche, plane crash, etc., it would have been a MUCH better movie.

Will never forget the scene of Woody trying to recreate the shared intimacy of boiling lobsters with Annie with a new, clueless girlfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie Hall","review":"One of the great modern love stories, the charming \\"Annie Hall\\" has Allen essentially playing himself, with Keaton's sweet, spacy Annie providing an inspired foil. Aside from its examination of contemporary relationships, the movie hilariously contrasts the flavor and essence of New York with sunny, hip Los Angeles, that sprawl on the West Coast which, to Allen's mind, is definitely alien territory. Touching, true, and extremely funny, this is Woody's peak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Member of the Classics Hall of Fame","review":"Until I rented \\"Annie Hall,\\" I'd seen it just once, when it was first released in movie theaters. It's still hilarious. Still poignant. Still a memorable exploration of female/male relationships and the culture clash of Midwestern/Manhattan sensibilities. It's Diane Keaton at her absolute best. It's Woody Allen when his neurotic revelations were fresh and still entertaining. In my mind, it's a member of the \\"Classics Hall of Fame.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pushing thirty but still fresh and lovely","review":"I know some reviewers have thought Annie Hall at almost thirty is impossibly dated. Boy, do I disagree. The film is about relationships and human relationships never really change. A few of the references may be lost on the post baby boomer generations ( I think a few of the references were lost on some folks when it came out in the 70's) but the general themes of lost loves and longing still remain relevant. And Allen tells his story with such intelligence and supreme humor. An added joy in watching this film is seeing several now very famous personalities in small roles and who knew Paul Simon could act? Highly recommended to anyone but diehard Woody Allen haters."},{"rating":"1","title":"i usually like woody allen flicks","review":"but this one blows. it's really really bad. you end up hating annie hall (who is a totally annoying woman) and woody.avoid"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie: B+ DVD: C","review":"Annie Hall B+/C 1.27.00 1.85:1/2.0 monoFirst Viewing Non-anamorphic Best PictureQuintessential Woody Allen.

I recommend this movie to anyone who like witty, smart comedies that go against the grain of your normal feel-good comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave well enough alone","review":"I've seen Annie Hall quite a number of times on VHS. However when I bought and viewed the DVD, I was very disappointed about one particular scene. In VHS versions, with regards to the balcony scene I do not ever recall the subtitles taking the audience by the hand and include the word '(thinking)'as a preface to the characters thoughts!! Did I miss something here or did some marketing genius decide that for the DVD version MOST audiences would never understand that the characters are 'thinking' and those white subtitles are actually their thoughts so we'd better play it safe and include the word 'thinking' a couple of times before each thought just to make sure.To me it's akin to altering any artistic masterpiece.If Woody Allen were dumb enough to include the word (thinking) before his characters thought,he would have done so in the original film......he didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, witty, charming.

When \\"Annie Hall\\" was broadcasted on Television, I recorded it immediately, because I was curious about the film.Since that day I am a real Woody-Allen-Fan and I have seen nearly every film of him. His pictures are among the most witty, funny and sophisticated out there and \\"Annie Hall\\" shows him in peak form. Individual scenes, like the one involving Marshal McLuhan, are real gems.\\"Annie Hall\\" is the kind of movie that is almost impossible to dislike. If you watch it once, you will watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woody's worst ?","review":"I think this 70s neurosis junk that got an Oscar is just for hard-die Allen's fans nowadays.

Everyone has their own favourites - the \\"where are they now?\\" classroom opener, a couple of guys named Cheech, Woody's Coney Island family, lobster hotpot, the LA scenes, \\"you know nothing of my work\\", etc. etc. But the quotable titbits all slot into a neatly observed story, and Allen and co. walk a fine line between straight acting and \\"funning up\\" the sketches. Still pure joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic missing a classic part","review":"Annie Hall is a classic movie and I love it and have loved it for many years. Last night as I watched my newly purchased DVD edition (my taped version was falling apart) I noticed a shocking error. In the scene where Alvy (Allen) and Annie (Keaton) first meet they go up on her terrace to have a glass of wine and begin to discuss some esoteric b.s. In the original film there are clever subtitles stating what the two characters are actually thinking and feeling while spouting their nonsense. In the DVD version that I purchased here at this site the subtitles were missing. It's a brilliant scene that was sadly botched by whomever made these DVD's.

Woody Allen will always crack me up with his odd sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"La de da, la de da,...","review":"This was the film that made me want to work in the movie business. Great, yet offbeat non-Hollywood like script, and charming Diane Keaton, help make this one of the best motion pictures of all time. Woody, as always, playing the 40ish, Jewish, neurotic... but he does it so well!Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Shelley Duval, Christopher Walken and even Paul Simon, are all terrific in this story about two people growing apart.Flawless editing by Ralph Rosenblum. This genius really helped create the structure of the film to make it the polished gem that it is. (The hilarious \\"cocaine\\" scene was constructed simply because the audience needed to know that Allen/Keaton were going to the California.)I was so happy when it won all the Oscars that it did, despite what a lot of other folks thought. Witty as hell and as American as apple pie... well, maybe with a Matzoh crust!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Time Classic","review":"'Favourite' is a term not to be thrown about lightly, but in my case, after much thought, I have to apply it to this wonderful film. It's the one I know I can return to time after time and always enjoy.Allen's bittersweet romance has too many perfect scenes to relate here, and the fact that I see so much of my own life in the film is, I'm sure, not a unique experience among viewers. Other reviewers' comments about the supposedly disjointed format ignores the fact that the non-linear narrative is one of the great charms of a movie which features asides to camera, flashes back and forward, and even a short cartoon interlude.To this reviewer, an all-time classic which addresses universal truths about love and life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, Hilarious Diary of a Love Affair","review":"Annie Hall is Allen's best film in my opinion. Keaton is the perfect counterpart to the Woodman's neurotic whining.The film is full of poignant beautiful dialouge like \\"Love Fades\\"...It rings true to life.The montage at the end is one of the best I have ever seen done, and is listed in a film book I had to read for film criticism class. There is everything to love about this film. Watch for Jeff Goldblum, Paul Simon, and one of the funniest sequences has Christopher Walken. A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Trivials of Life","review":"Woody Allen's Best Picture Winner is one of the funniest films I have seen in some time. I cant say this is his best, for I have not seen them all (or nearly enough) to compare. However I do sense a certain sense of zenith achieved here with Allen's pictures. Woody Allen finds a charming insecure girl (Diane Keaton) whom they hit it off really well in the beginning, then begin to question their relationship. Played off really well with superb dialogue, shot in a somewhat discontinuous style. Truly and deservedly a classic by every standard. This DVD edition does not grant you with all the niceties of others, unless you are settled with just a trailer, cause thats all there is. Nonetheless, a great film for the whole family (excluding young children)."},{"rating":"2","title":"annie hall","review":"This is a great movie and i love that the rental is for a month, makes it well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, Clever Romance","review":"Jewish comedy writer Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and WASP singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) have their ups and downs in the slapstick romance that eventually ends up with the two going their separate ways. However, while quite entertaining at first, it eventually wears thin near the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allen at his finest","review":"A wonderfully funny, insightful movie filled with classic Allenisms. Deservedly won the best picture oscar. As for being letterboxed, many films are cropped from the top and bottom \\"intentionally\\" when shown in theatres. The letterboxed edition is exactly the way Woody or his cinematographer planned the composition to be. When films like this are shown on tv or released on homevideo, many movie studios will remove or reveal the image area that was originally masked to fill the tv screen. This is why sometimes one will see boom mikes hanging above the actors or other objects that were originally masked out. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like an extended T.V. show","review":"Maybe I'm too used to seening episodes of 'Seinfeld', 'Friends', and other modern sitcoms, but 'Annie Hall' felt like one of those T.V. shows, just extended. Although some scenes are very funny, most of the movie is not. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton look uneven as a couple and I didn't see what the point of the film was. At the same time, I didn't believe in their relationship. I wasn't convinced of their attraction toward each other so it was even harder to feel sympathy for Allen's character. Many times throughout, I felt like I was watching a pointless film. Allen has a free spirit tone, but his nervous and shaky character became old and annoying fast. Maybe I'm not easily amused, but then again, maybe 'Annie Hall' isn't all that funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pardon?","review":"This is a special interest movie, and there can only be lovers or haters of the same. So, let me acknowledge Woody's intelligence, and appreciate the many that worship this product. I cannot bear it, I always felt like slapping the guy. But then, if I react, even in this way, what more could the artist want from me? God, I give up, and I need some chips."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"bad movie dont buy it, you'll never finish it it's really boring and has bad sound and picture with a devastatingly terrible plot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why couldn't they just have been lunch buddies like on Seinfeld?","review":"Diane Keaton kind of throws herself at Woody Allen who plays it cool (maybe smug.) I hate his khaki pants and I didn't really notice how impressive Diane Keaton looked in old suits. I totally missed the era when this movie was always mentioned in the media and I'm glad I did. Most of the time, I thought I would have clobbered Woody Allen if he had talked to me that way but I don't think this is true love or even love. I think this was an exercise in misdirection."},{"rating":"1","title":"talk, talk, talk","review":"Like all Woody Allen movies, this one is endless, pointless talking about irrelevant boring stuff. I know Allen has his fans, but they must all be people with an ability to listen to actors talk...and talk...and talk. That's all that happens in a Woody Allen movie. Continuous non-stop banter, seasoned with a lot of complaining and angst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no,","review":"This movie started off with potential, but the end was just pathetic. However, as a Christian it would have been better to see Pastor Greg work out his insecurities with God and not be so weak, if he had to be so weak, fine, but let him use the scripture to pull himself out of it. He started off with a confidence level of 10 and ended up with 0. His weakness was pathetic rather than funny. I won't recommend this movie. If you can watch it for free, do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all fans","review":"This soundtrack is absolutely on my top-10 list. It has a great combination of rock and jazz tracks with a couple of weird instrumental tracks (although those are great too).

Get it and hear for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family fun","review":"My 4-year-old, who is already the world's biggest Scooby-Doo fan, gives this a hearty thumbs-up. It's a fun game for both father and son. The action's pretty good, a standard platformer, nothing innovative, but not a bad one either. The greatest part is the faithfulness to the source material. It's a real Saturday morning nostalgia blast for '70s kids with the real voices of the actors, very expressive animation and the villains from the show's original run. There's even a cameo appearance from Don Knotts as the groundskeeper! And the best part? No Scrappy Doo. Not even Scooby Dum -- unless there's a Gameshark cheat I don't know about. :) Anyway, lots of fun for little ones, probably a little hard without some grown-up help, but not that tough.

The material's there, but the presentation is lacking. You can read and reread and remained confused on even the most trivial topic. There are other electromagnetism text, some are much clearer to understand.If you don't believe me, try the test. Read a section in Jackson and try to solve a problem at the end of the chapter which relates to that section. Read a section about the same topic and solve another Jackson problem pertaining to the same material. Do this several times alternating between reading Jackson first and then reading a text of your choice first. Keep a tally of how many problems you solve correctly and the time it takes. The result shouldn't surprise you, you'll probably learn better from the source of your choice. (Actually, this test is unfair. Everybody learns in different fashions. Of course, you'll learn better from the author of your choice! And if Jackson is the author of your choice, god help you.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackson knows his math. Not so sure about the physics.","review":"I believe the main reason that this book remains the standard graduate-level E&M text is \\"inertia\\". Your prof used it, and so you will, too. As a physics text, it supplies more mathematical details than physical insight. Confusing mathematical expressions with physical understanding may be the reason that many people get the warm and fuzzy feeling about this book. The truth is, most people who proclaim to enjoy this book probably haven't throughly mastered the -physical- contents of Griffith's undergraduate text. If you truely have, you can go a long way without touching Jackson. Sure, long math equations can be orgasmic, but it's not physics.The explanations in this book for the most part can best be described as turbid. For a particulary hideous example, try the section on the vectorial diffraction theory, and come back and ask yourself if you really know what the heck he's talking about. And then ask if HE knew what he was talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"As if we needed more disincentives for physics grad school.","review":"Reading Jackson ranks in enjoyment somewhere between having your teeth pulled and getting a spinal tap. It's a shame that this book has become the de facto standard for graduate electromagnetism. It is dry, uninspriring and full of problems designed to test your aptitude for looking up definite integrals in Russian mathematical handbooks. We won't take this any more -- students of the world unite -- if at all possible, refuse to buy this book. Jackson should not be allowed to reap the profits obtained by terrorizing thousands of graduate students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader","review":"I fail to see how this textbook became a standard in Graduate level Electrodynamics. I found myself often feeling confused and frustrated with this textbook. There are so many better written books on this subject out there - so please look!

Heed my warnings on this book or be prepared to repeat the suffering of previous graduate students!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brightest Physics Students will Avoid this One","review":"I disagree. Jackson simply presents several topics in an incoherant and slapdash fashion. There's a great deal of material in this book but Jackson doesn't do it justice. The brightest students will save their money and never buy this one. It's overrated and the problems are not difficult, just vaguely worded or occasionally algebraically messy."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS A DISGRACE TO PHYSICS.","review":"We used Jackson's \\"classic\\" in the graduate E&M class. But Jackson doesn't teach. I wound up learning the material from the instructor's handouts and help in office hours.Jackson's book falls below the threshold of being a true textbook. The book does not educate. There are zero worked examples, only bombastic dreck. The sooner this book is replaced by something user-friendly, the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO STARTED THIS TREND ANYWAY?","review":"Look, I took the usual two graduate semesters of Jackson and received a B,A respectively without hardly ever opening my Jackson text. I found it completely useless. There are so many other wonderfully explicit and dynamic texts to use other than Jackson. His text is boring and unfiling. He skips important (in my opinion crucial) steps in derivations. The problem sets are impossible and if you are one of the few to actually solve some, it is probably done via the assistance of previous graduate student's contributions... not your own. I DON'T KNOW WHO STARTED THIS TREND for making Jackson the mandatory Physics graduate text, but it is not serving its purpose. I suggest you look elsewhere for a supplemental text if you truly wish to *learn* electrodynamics and not just get through it. My suggestion.... Albert Shadowitz (Dover publications) ISBN:048665660-8. If I could, I would sell you my Jackson cheap, since I will never use it again... even to reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"challenging","review":"this book is outstanding for many reasons, the leading of wich is its treatment of topics that you can't find in any other book. The level of the exposition corresponds to works published in specialiced publications, then is not recommended to inexperienced students. The collection of problems is perhaps the outstanding fature of the book 'cause they are rather outrageous in many cases but refreshing for a courageous reader. I've worked many problems of five chapters 9,13,14,15,16, and the volume of calculus is enormous, perhaps one should not learn very much physics, but you become an expert in vectorial analysis for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackson is without empathy and mercy.","review":"I met Jackson once personally. Let's just say he's not the paragon of sanity one has in mind. He's very much of a sadist and this comes out very well in his book.

Some reviewers suggest that you can only appreciate this book if you already have a solid foundation in math and Electromagnetics. Baloney! Truth is, Jackson should never have been allowed to even think of writing such a textbook. From what I have seen so far, painful is not a strong enough word to describe the act of sifting through this mess. I feel for the students who had this assigned as their classroom text. As one reviewer put it, the students had to take other books out of the library to get through the course or to determine what the hell Jackson is talking about. There is a difference between a well presented, intelligent style of writing and a pretentious \\"Look how smart I appear to be, try try try to figure out what I am saying; I'm not going to tell you, that's for sure\\" style of writing, where Jackson adopts the latter, exclusively. There are far better books out there. Go look for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for effort and its history","review":"If you would like to learn some of the mathematics in E&M; this book is nearly perfect. For those wanting to learn physics, Feynman is the appropriate book.For example, consider the following: what is more important to you: learning how to spend time with tensors or learning why the spring model of the dipole is important?Though Jackson is regarded as a classic, if you read Feynman for the physics, and perhaps Griffiths for the problems, you will probably know what you are talking about.In short, Jackson does indeed have interesting discussions on certain topics, but overall this book focuses on terse mathematics rather than physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly written learning tool","review":"As a graduate student who is currently taking a course using Jackson, I can honestly say that it is very poorly written. The primary reason Jackson's text has survived this long is that it has challanging problems, which are an important part of learning e&m. Unfortunately, the actual text is difficult to follow and largely devoid of examples. While I can't comment on many of the contemporary graduate level alternatives to Jackson, I have personally found Griffiths text to be an excellent undergraduate level text which has proven useful in understanding some of the more cryptic parts of Jackson where topics overlap. The only good graduate text I've examined that I think is both at the same advanced level of complexity as Jackson and lucid enough to learn from is Sir James Jeans text, which is unfortunalely out of print and a bit obsolete in its notation. I have found Jeans to be quite helpful when learning some of the more advanced level material covered in Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is completely USELESS","review":"Researcher in Applied Physics here.Let's be honest and frank. This book is TOTALLY USELESS, a DISGRACE TO THE PHYSICS, a huge DISINCENTIVE FOR STUDYING physics and IT'S NOT A PHYSICS BOOK.It's impossible to learn something reading Jackson's book. The only thing it will happen is that you'll start questioning about your smartness. \\"Perhaps I'm not smart enough to understand this book\\" No, it's not you, everyone of us had this feeling the first time we read it (or tried to read it).

Certainly, one needs to be firm in the mathematics involved here, but this is a requirement for understanding electrodynamics anyway. The only other textbook from the U.S. on a similar level is Panofsky/Phillips and that is to my knowledge as of this moment out of print.The collection of problems alone is so rich, that an instructor won't have problems creating exams from it. Student can check their knowledge by going through them. Sure, some of them are very hard and I guess there are enough students that cry because of this. However, nothing is more rewarding but to go through the book and the problems combined. Mastering this books means mastering electrodynamics."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's got to be a better way","review":"But I'm told this is the best out there. Very depressing.Before I took the class, I heard horror stories of this book. They did not do the book justince for the horror to come. The problem may be partly mine. I did come in never having solved Laplaces equation for anything and never having seen image charges and just about everything else you should have at least a cursory understanding before getting into the thick of things.Yes, the problems are hard and I won't harp on that any more than others have. But the text is so unappealing and dry. I can't read more than a sentance or two without taking a break. There are also way too many 'applications' sections thrown in that further muddle things. It's hard to know where the important material is, and where the asides are.If I ever do understand EM to the Jackson level, I vow to write a better EM textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a shame that this text is considered a classic.","review":"The author fails to communicate the fundementals clearly. He presents a myriad of topics quickly and without consideration for individuals who would like to learn. Possibly, the sheer number of topics covered in this book redeems it a bit, but only in the sense that the book may be used as a reference in a library. Or better yet, it may be used as a footstool so that I can reach higher on the book shelf to obtain a copy of Griffiths to help elucidate this text.One thing is certain, the problems at the end of each chapter are challenging, and that's why I gave the book two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the purpose?","review":"I fail to understand the purpose of writing such a book as Jacksons'. The physics is many times neglected in favor of mathematics, and yet the mathematics itself is poorly explained. It feels like studying E&M while being drunk: \\"you take the div of the curl, then the curl of the curl and the div of the div of the . . . \\" Also, Jackson takes the rather uninspiring view of teaching E&M from the unrelativistic point of view, a real shame, considering the conceptual simplification such an approach offers. Classical Electrodynamics by Julian Schwinger outrivals Jackson's book from the mathematical point of view, and is more comprehensive. Schwartz's \\"Principles of Electrodynamics\\" and Ohanian's text (forgot the name) explain the physics much better (Ohanian's book is also at a nice mathematical level). So what's the purpose of using this text?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor is naked","review":"This is terrible textbook.

I learned a lot, but I also became very interested in the man. He is fasinating and very brave. I'm very gald I read this book.The main idea is to study how Churchill made his leadership decicions, and what the reason for that decision was. It's an informative study of the man, and even funny at times. It's always entertaining, but somewhat short of a great story (so 4 stars).By all means read this book. It's a great way to begin to learn about Churchill, aside from the 3 or 6 volume works available at the bookstore. It's also a good study on decision making based on principles and honest living, strength, and forward thinking. There are good lessons here as well a good reading. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"I'm going to say something that might sound odd: this is not a leadership book. It deals pretty well with the everyday tasks and details of Churchill's style, but strangely not his \\"executive success in the face of adversity.\\" And Hayward's assertion that Churchill's style is like that of an executive seems a little red-faced: Hayward spends a lot of time defending against Churchill's critics that Churchill was disorganized and a bad judge of character. In all likelihood, he is forcing Churchill into a category that he does not belong: indeed, Churchill may have been disorganized, but he was a darn good prime minister. My opinion is that Churchill deserves more than this. In place of this book, I would recommend Lincoln On Leadership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool for understanding Churchill in a leadership focus","review":"This book is very well crafted. I especially like the section on \\"Churchill The Inventor And Innovator.\\" Hayward's well researched book synthesizes so much of what was the essence of Churchill's leadership foundation (not just his style.)My sense is this book is best for the business (or govt) leader (or soon to be leader) eager to understand some of the less obvious leadership fundamentals of WSC's leadership evolution. By pulling from diverse references over time, Hayward displays a leadership trajectory, and perspective absent in so many leadership books. Also, great insights as to how WSC was able to get opposing constituencies to work together on a variety of issues. A great investment if your career has a leadership component to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leadership Succinctly Put!","review":"Although Sir Winston's leadership skills manifested themselves in the military realm, his skills can easily be transferred to the business/ private sectors.

Of course with the subject being Sir Winston, how can one go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but not that useful for aspiring leaders","review":"I am a Churchill buff, and REALLY wanted to like this book. I did enjoy many of the anecdotes and situations discussed. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that the book offered much useful advice to those who want to lead. The author offers brief bullet points at the end of each chapter that summarize key lessons, but most of them are fairly self-evident, and they are not well-developed.This type of book seems to be popular lately. People looking for historical lessons based on real figures would do better to read \\"Lincoln on Leadership\\" or the old Attila the Hun books by Wess Roberts"},{"rating":"2","title":"Churchill On Leadership","review":"\\"Churchill On Leadership\\" by Steven Hayward is a good read on one of the 20th century's best leaders and especially during WW2. The book is around 180 pages and contains 10 chapters on some aspect of Churchill's leadership, such as:1. Managing people2. Decision making and thought processes3. Communication4. Inventions and innovation5. Moral purpose and destinyThe book also includes a brief survey of his political career. The book also covers his risks and failures, relationships with others, and his willingness to take risks when necessary.\\"Churchill On Leadership\\" is a very readable title and may be completed in a few sittings. While there are more comprehensive titles on Churchill, Hayward's book is an excellent introduction.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another biography, but a different style.","review":"As a longtime fan of Churchill, and in a position of leadership in a commercial environment, the book appeared to be excellant vacation reading. Well it was but only from the 'fan' position. The author sets out with good intentions and early in the book he relates Churchill ways back into the context of today's executive's environment. But, by the middle, and then thereafter, he's lost his way and it becomes a bit idol worshipping with no real relevance to application to today's leadership 'student'. At times Mr Hayward really is squeezing the pips to show Winston as a model to follow - I've suggested dictation from my bathtub but so far my secretary hasn't picked up on the idea. If you want to understand Churchill it's a good read. If it's leadership you want you'll have to browse further."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth your time and money","review":"The book is well written, entertaining, and to the point. I felt like I've learned something after reading the book and that's all the importance. The book doesn't get into too much details as some readers would like, but it serves its purpose as an easy-to-read book. As Churchill himself observed that leadership is pretty much inborn and can hardly be learned, the book doesn't offer you the definate way to leadership, or even as of how Churchill could be a great leader as he was. The book, however, offers you the general descriptions of the man and the elements of making a leader. It tells you \\"what\\", not \\"how\\".

Watch this show for the deliciously insane gags. I won't even mention a single one of them, because they have to be seen to be believed.Sure, the humor is unsophisticated. Even dumb.

This, plus the odd overuse of pedal that smears harmonies and individual lines, and you have a self-indulgent recital that certainly will not appeal to those of who consider this music some of Schumann's best. There are some elegant and poetic moments, but they cannot rescue this mostly awful set of performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS WEST COAST TOAST","review":"Bud Shank was on of my earlier heores.

I bought him this book over a year ago, and he still pulls it out and works on the techniques. The instructions are easy to follow, and they give some good ideas for projects. It is written in such a way that he can either follow step by step, or he can just read through and then apply the techniques to his own projects. He has enjoyed doing both.

Bach's perhaps most important composer son, who had a large influence on Mozart, viewed the art of figured bass and counterpoint. Apparently the Bachs were aware of Rameau's theory of harmony and root progressions, but preferred the contrapuntal approach to harmonization. This book bears serious study by those interested in music theory and composition."},{"rating":"2","title":"historically significant","review":"This an historically significant work worthwhile for a number of reasons--of course--, but I am particularly interested in its treatment of figured bass. Why? Although it was composed after Rameau published his revolutionary theory of root progression, C.P.E. Bach repudiated Rameau's theory, and this work remains untouched by it. Consequently, reading this is the easist way to get a feel for how things stood before Rameau and (ironically for C.P.E. Bach) to appreciate truly Rameau's achievement.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff...","review":"Needed one to slow down a 1.5V toy train that was running off the tracks... works great and could not find one this small at the shack..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disillusioned","review":"Perhaps I expected too much from this book.

Colorful, outrageous illustrations by the imaginative John Gabriel joyfully partner with the rhyming text.There is a fellow, a music lover who suffers from severe shyness. He has gone to hear a duet by a cello and a viola when suddenly he feels an irresistible urge to swallow the cello - and he does. Preposterous? Not in the mind of Barbara S. Garriel.Think what swallowing a cello would do to a person's figure let alone his or her digestive tract. You'll have to see these wacky illustrations to get an idea. Now, as if swallowing a cello weren't enough this timid soul follows that feat by ingesting a harp, a sax, a fiddle, a cymbal, a kazoo, and a bell. The fellow has become a veritable one man band.Obviously, no one can spend the rest of his life with these instruments inside.

However, once I got the book and read through it the illustrations were disturbing. So I read it to my own 4 year old wondering if they'd appeal to his tastes. He asked me to stop halfway through because the pictures were yucky and it made him not want to hear how it turned out.

The last mix is the worst. Unfortunately, it's also the longest. I don't know why anyone would willingly sit through six and a half minutes of this stuff.

Bernstein does a typical Bernstein job to conduct it, and it is life. However, I personally didn't like the recording, and find the sound quality too bad. There is another recording out there conducted by Tullio Serafin, with much better sound quality and at least the same drama. Do not make the mistake and mistake one for the other. In particular, you can try to buy the Serafin version on Amazon, and you might just get the Bernstein version (this is how I ended up with my version)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performance - terrible mastering","review":"This great recording is totally sabotaged by the mastering EMI used.

The middle line was the most plausible scenario, according to Hansen.Ten years later, Patrick Michaels testified to the US Congress. In this testimony, he produced Hansen's graph, but with the bottom two scenarios totally deleted, thus leaving only the most extreme top scenario. Patrick Michaels then argued that his doctored graph, with the \\"most plausible scenario\\" deleted by Michaels, showed that \\"the forecast made in 1988 was an astounding failure\\".Patrick Michaels has a cheek trying to lecture anyone on the distortion of science, after his deliberate distortion of Hansen's views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected for an unacademic reader","review":"I was overexcited when I first started reading this book but became very disappointed when I got about a third of the way through.

To admit that global warming is at least partly caused by human activities, then to argue that it is no big deal and we can all adjust? How do you adjust when your house washes away? It is fortunate indeed that he will no longer be around in another 100 years, when the results of atmospheric CO2 increases will be abundantly clear to all, because those suffering as a result will not look kindly on contrarian apologists for business as usual such as Michaels.He is of course entitled to his fossil fuel industry financed opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Independent Thinkers Beware!","review":"Mr. Michaels is a member of no less that 20 institutes, think tanks, and other national groups that receive significant funding from Exxon--places like the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the George C.

Some say global warming is more politics than science. THIS is the source of the politics; almost all scientists (and more each day) recognize that global warming is a serious problem that should be dealt with. This book is not science but public relations for the oil industry. And with record profits, they have the money to protect their investments. This type of person will give conservative politicians (Republicans) enough ammuntition to say, \\"See? Even the scientists don't agree\\" and will convince the gullible action need not be taken; better to \\"save American jobs.\\"Michaels says it is a conspiracy of scientists out to hurt the oil industry (and America).

None of his studies cited in this book are peer-reviewed outside of the energy coalitions that pay him.Sorry folks, but he really is a schill. If you don't believe it, just do a little research.

For many years, there has been almost universal agreement among climate scientists that global warming is happening, and that human pollution is largely responsible.So why is this still controversial? Largely because a handful of skeptics, like Michaels, have thrown up a dust cloud of confusion around the issue through popular books, newspaper opinion pieces, television and radio appearances, and other tactics. They have skillfully exploited the media's desire for \\"balance\\" in their reporting, when in fact, they are in an extreme, scientifically isolated minority. Many politicians have been swept up in their deceptions.Michaels gets huge amounts of money from the coal and oil industries, which stand to lose if we start getting serious about addressing climate change.

So, to impugn one's motive based on the source of one's paycheck is not worthy of a fair-minded person.People in a democracy sometimes have a misplaced faith in numbers - number of people believing in something. The answer to a mathematical or scientific question is not determined by a vote-count. A \\"near-unanimity\\" of the scientific community has been known to be wrong time and again, especially in recent times when they are often in cahoots with politicians and the media. The scientific method tells us this: hypothesize a theory and let it's predictions be checked by measurements and facts.Checking measurement and facts - that is what this book does.

Great Buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would give it more stars if I could","review":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stroller frame! We bought a Graco SnugRide carseat, and this is the perfect stroller for it. We didn't want a bulky travel system, and we didn't want to spend a ton of money on a stroller before knowing for certain what we would need. The basket is large enough to hold everything we've needed it for (we've put a lot of weight in it, and it hasn't torn), the stroller hasn't tipped yet, and it folds down relatively easily. I do wish it was a one-handed task, but I'm willing to sacrifice that. Generally, my son is in the car in his seat when I'm putting the stroller away, anyhow. Now that my son is moving on to a convertible seat, I will miss this! We've been using it for 6 months, and it still looks brand new. The handle is adjustable, so my father in law, who is 6 feet tall, can easily push this comfortably. It fits well into the trunk of my Honda Civic coupe, and is relatively light weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for My Needs","review":"Someone had given me a really nice, very expensive Graco travel system, but that contraption was so complicated I hated using it. I'm soooo glad I got this frame. My daughter always falls asleep in the car and this allows me to remove her from the car and snap her into the frame without waking her up. It's super lightweight and easy to fold & unfold maing travel a cinch. I've been using it several times a week for four months and I've had no difficulties with it or with the quality and construction. It fits nicely into my small trunk. I would have given it 5 stars, but the storage basket, although roomy, is not easily accessible when the carseat is snapped in. Overall, I'm very happy with this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"I lugged my infant around for weeks in his carrier when I didn't have to! I love this stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel stroller","review":"I bought this stroller as a way to transport my infant car carrier when shopping and travelling. I love it! It's lightweight and easy to fold up and assemble. It's a simple solution and was a great asset as we took our first airplane rides. Highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, light weight, rolls like a dream","review":"This is an excellently designed stroller. It took a few moments, without consulting the instructions, to figure out how to collapse and open the stroller, but once I figured that out, I could do it with one hand.Assembly was a snap, and I am amazed at out easily it folds up for storage or transport in a car. It is also a dream to push about, glides smoothly and turns nicely.We're very happy with this stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy","review":"For the price and the relatively short lifespan required from this pram, it is wonderful. Utilitarian and practical.We adore not having to remove our son from the infant car seat.Only neg about this system is that in the car seat our son is strapped in fairly tight, as required. I would be happy with him slightly less constricted in the pram but changing the harness length would never be an option as it would be such a nuisance. Thus, the babe is very very safely attached to his pram but perhaps not as comfortable as I would like him to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mobile solution","review":"I have the Graco carseat and stroller, purchased as a set. This was a recommendation from a friend, and I love it. I keep it in the back of my jeep, and her little carseat snaps out of the base in our car and into this easy frame. I like the features (brakes, locking front wheels, basket underneath) and I like that it is light and simple. I still plan on using the stroller that matches the seat, but this is just an easier and lighter option for on the go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.","review":"This thing is awesome . . . I made the HUGE mistake at registery for the Graco set . . . I hated the stroller, and oddly so did my daughter. But this thing was great! So lightweight and easy to open and close.Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller","review":"This is a really nice light weight stroller. I love that I can snap the car seat right into it to run into stores instead of dealing with the dirty carts. Nice big storage area too. I also love that you can adjust the handle.

I originally decided on the snap-n-go, however, when put together our graco snugride car seat didn't seem to fit. I took the snap-n-go back to babies -r-us to see if someone could check to make sure it was right. Thank god I did because I found out that baby trend had manufactured some wrong and it would not accomodate a graco car seat. Long story short they had just recieved this graco one in and exchanged it for me. Not only was this one easier to put together it seems sturdier and more compact. So far we love it! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a little tough to fold and unfold right now. I don't know if it is because it is so new, hopefully it will loosen up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you thank you thank you Graco!","review":"We just had a baby, and have a Graco car seat, we got a Snap N Go, and it just plain did not work, there was a manufacture defect that did not allow me to set the snap bar in the first position, returned it for a second, same problem, before I took it back was doing some research on Babys R Us website and saw this. I got in my car, and took the snap n junk back to BRU and they had one more of these left. VERY easy to put together, snap on the wheels, the cup holders, and that's it. Love the adjustable handle, so my wife and I can both use it at different heights. Also love the fact that is has a mechanism that locks the stroller in the closed position. This is a must for all Graco infant seat owners who want something such as this. Don't waste your time or money on the snap n junk. If you have a car seat made by someone other than Graco it may be great, but it's a joke for Graco owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"lightweight, fits perfectly with graco car seat","review":"i originally got a full stroller, but soon realised i needed something simple and lightweight for those times when my husband wasn't with me to carry the stroller up and down the new york subway stairs. one of my girlfriends recommended this to me because it was easy to attach the car seat on, easy to remove, and i'm able to carry it with the carseat attached while going down the stairs. the bottom storage has a good amount of space. my only issue was the cupholder becauase my coffee kept spilling over during strolls with my baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy for new moms!","review":"What a great idea! I had NO idea what a baby would need. While asking around, several folks mentioned this as a MUST. They were right! I got this using frequent flyer points and wow- it's one item I use almost every day. I use it for our near daily walks around the neighborhood, run errands on urban terrain, hit the malls, etc. Folds up flat and so light. I figure it will last me at least 6 mnths (when baby outgrows his Snugride) during which time I can really get a sense of what I need before I plunk down big bucks on a 'real' stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job well.","review":"Perfect for the car, does well in stores and even on short neighborhood strolls (half hour to an hour). Lightweight, compact and easy to use. The car seat frame is a workhorse, nothing fancy. Well-made and highly recommended, by this mother of a 3month old, as a first stroller. We will move on to a jogger at six months of age when a child can safely be put in a jogger.M..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy with SnugRide car seat.","review":"My husband and I both like this stroller. We've heard mixed reviews of Graco's full-size strollers, so we didn't want to buy a travel system. But with SnugRide known as the safest infant seat, I looked for other options. Admittedly, without practice, unfolding and folding is a bit difficult, but when the foot pad on the back of the basket is used, it's really not too bad. Also, if you put anything too big into the basket, it won't come back out witout tilting the car seat up. That said, the car seat fits in perfectly. The handle is very comfortable and adjusts easily even for shorter people. For us, it is worth some of the hassle to have this light-weight, compact solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO easy and handy","review":"I don't know why I didn't get this sooner.

I wish we knew about it with our first kid :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel through airports","review":"We purchased this for a trip we were taking because we did not want to lug around our bigger stroller through the airport and at our destination. This was a GREAT purchase. I can't be more happy. It folds up quickly and fits through the security scanner at the airport. We have the graco safe seat and it pops in and out with ease. We have started using this stroller more than the $300 stroller we got because it is so convenient, especially for me because it is not heavy, and I have tendinitis in my wrist and it is so easy for me to handle this lighter stroller than a heavy one. Plus, it is great for shopping because the basket in the bottom is HUGE!! A lot bigger than the more expensive stroller we have.I am very happy with this stroller and I would recommend it to everyone wanting something easy to travel with through an airport and for everyday use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, good quality","review":"We loved this item! Baby's car seat easily snaps into this stroller frame. You can take a sleeping baby out of the car and pop him in here and not disturb him. The frame is lightweight -- easy to maneuver in and out of the car trunk and folds with ease. I don't have to fumble with giant, heavy stroller systems.Also has a big basket underneath. Fits my huge diaper bag and several small items.The handlebar adjusts to two heights. Good for parents of all sizes.I will recommend this to every new parent I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, compact, yet durable. I love it!","review":"We put this together in a matter of minutes in the parking lot right after buying it, hardly glancing at the instructions. It fits easily into the trunk of either of our compact cars, and it opens and closes with hardly any effort. It has a smooth ride and maneuvers easily. The basket on the bottom is just the right size for our diaper bag and my purse. We love this and I'm so glad we went with it instead of a whole bulky travel system."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product for the price!","review":"I am glad we purchased the Graco Snugrider. We keep it in the car and use for quick trips shopping or running errands. The basket is a generous size. It doesn't ride as smoothly as we would like, but for the price you can't beat it. I do not reccomend it as your only stroller, as I do not think it would do well on bumpy sidewalks, or any less than smooth surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the money","review":"We were given a very nice Graco car seat and base for our new baby, so we didn't want to register for an entire new travel system, but we liked the idea of the convenience for those occasions when we do need a stroller.The stroller frame was very easy to assemble. I'm petite, and getting it in and out of the car is very easy for me, though it does take two hands to fold and unfold. The car seat attaches securely and it feels sturdy. My only major complaint is that the ride is very rough on asphalt, so it isn't good for walking with my baby in the neighborhood for exercise.This product meets our needs and was a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tires often got stuck when folded","review":"I inherited this stroller from my sister.

Then have no idea how to unfold it easily. Feel terrible and angry now :((((After struggling for a long time, finally figured out the reason hard to unfold is due to the two big stupid front wheels. They are very easy to stuck when you fold it. Move them outwards before unfold."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU NEED TO BUY THIS","review":"This is AWESOME... If you're like me, you went and bought a travel system.. and regretted it! The Graco system I bought is so bulky and heavy!! It drove me crazy.. Until I got this!! I love it. I used it for about 9 months, just click the carseat in, and you're good to go! We took it with us on vacation to Florida too, it was perfect. Only negative is that you can't use it without the carseat. I wish there were a way to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Must Have","review":"I decided on the Snap and Go stroller frame over a larger travel system because of the size of my car and lack of storage at my house. This was a great buy for a fraction of the price of the large travel systems. I loved how easy it was to move the baby from the car right into the stroller frame and vice versa. The bag at the bottom is huge and holds tons of stuff! I used to go to the farmers market and was able to fit everything I purchased in ther with some extra room! It is the perfect space for diaper bags or anything else you can think of. The frame folds up easily and would fit in any size car. The cup holders come in handy too when out and about. Highly recommended if you are getting a Graco infant car seat! It is now stashed in the closed waiting for the next baby to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I purchased this item for my daughter for a trip. It worked out perfectally! It is small and light weight, the car seat sits securally in place with room for a few things on the bottom. Much better than hauling along a big stoller."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Moms shouldn't be without it...","review":"This is an excellent stroller. I received this stroller as a gift for my baby shower almost 3years ago. After my daughter outgrew her carseat, I passed it on to my friend who was pregnant. She used it for a good 7-8 months with her baby, and then passed it back to me when I was expecting my second child. I have now been using it with my second child for 6 months and it is still in excellent shape! I can't live with out it! It is lightweight, easy to open, fold, and store. The carseat snaps in very easinly and won't come off until the release is pressed. It is an excellent first stroller. I never bouhgt a travel system and don't regret it at all. This stroller filled every need for the first 6-7 mos. of both my kids lives...Thanks Graco!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!!!","review":"This is great stroller for the car seat! Easy to use. The car seat easily snaps into place and they are additional safety holders on the sides of the stroller frame. Once in use, it is easy to push and manuver. It collapses very easily and can fit easily into the trunk of the car. The bag at bottom is great and holds a fair share of items when shopping. The cup holders are fine, - they could be deeper. Overall this a great buy and makes like easier with the heavy snug ride car seat. One additional caveat - this is not good on stairs up or down."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: MY SON FLIPPED OVER!!!!","review":"Let me start by saying I loved this stroller. We have used it for 8 months now, it is great for traveling. But today, I went down a slope, and the carseat with my son, who THANK GOD was strapped in, flipped a full 180 degrees, feet over head. He landed upside-down in his carseat on the concrete! I had been responsible and made sure it clicked into place when I put him in, but the carseat is only latched on the top side. So the other side is just placed on the two flimsy red hooks. Any slope, or going down a curb, and there is a possibility that the child may flip over. SO PLEASE BE CAREFUL! Luckily, my son was OK, more scared than hurt, but I am still going to contact Graco about this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"best money I've ever spent","review":"This is the best money I have ever spent - it's so quick and easy and lightweight. The basket underneath offers ample storage, it is perfect for a day of shopping, running a quick errand or walking your dogs. The carseat gets very heavy for me to lug, so it's nice to be able to pop it in here and go. The cup holder is my only complaint - it's not very deep, so if you are going over some rough terrain, your drink will likely topple over. Overall though, a fantastic purchase for the price. Only wish I had gotten it sooner. (It is compatible with the Snugride 32)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Complement","review":"Bought this as a substitute for the Graco full size stroller. This is so much lighter and easier to get in and out of the car. Well worth having until our little one can sit in the normal stroller's seat. Large basket at the bottom is nice as well. Baby carrier feels secure and stable even with the lighter weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller","review":"So glad I purchased this stroller.All I had was a jogging stroller which isn't the easiest thing to maneuver around while out shopping nor does it fit in the trunk of my car. I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money so this worked out perfect for me. It's compact enough to fit in the back seat of my truck, maneuvers easily around cramped corners, and folds in and out very easily. The basket at the bottom is very spacious and I have no problem getting my huge diaper bag in and out of it. If you need something simple and basic this is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is the perfect companion to the graco carseat we already had.

So glad we finally bought this SnugRider. It makes travelling within the city much easier.We use it anytime we are walking with the baby and will need to get into a car or taxi. It work perfectly with our Graco car seat and is very quick to attach or detach. Taxis can be impatient and we try to get in quickly once they stop for us. We can quickly detach the car seat and fold up the SnugRider to get in and go.Folding the SnugRider is not intuitive. We definitely had to read the instructions to figure out which part to twist and where to pull. Even knowing how to do it, the movement is a bit awkward, but we are able to do it quickly now after a little practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use!

The problem is that this stroller is not good for using to take your baby on walks. The wheels don't have enough shock absorption and this makes for a bumpy, jolting ride that had my baby being shook awake every few seconds. I suppose the stroller would be sufficient for walking in a mall or some place that had smooth flooring, but if you are intending to use the stroller for walking around sidewalks and crossing streets, I'd get something else with better rubber tires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graco Car Seat owner prefers Snap 'n' Go frame","review":"We travel _a lot_ with the baby and have a Graco car seat.

In concept, a frame/stroller like this is awesome, but Graco needs to redesign this and make it better and sturdier. All in all, a major dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't purchase the GIFT WRAPPING!","review":"I ordered this stroller frame as a baby shower gift and, because of the size, also ordered the Amazon gift wrapping. It is the quality of the gift wrapping that I am reviewing - not the stroller frame - so that others can avoid making the same mistake.The point of gift wrapping is to make a nice presentation, and this is especially the case with wedding and baby shower gifts. Amazon's \\"gift wrapping\\" consisted of a large, heavily-wrinkled, solid navy blue sack with a pull tie closure. The pull ties could not be used because the gift was too large to allow the sack to be closed. Luckily, the gift was delivered to my address instead of the recipient's address, and I opened it far enough in advance that I had still had time to rectify the problem by purchasing supplies and wrapping the gift myself.To their credit, Amazon refunded my account the cost of the gift wrapping and forwarded the customer feedback to their \\"wrapping\\" department."},{"rating":"1","title":"chemical smell from handle","review":"I pushed the Graco SnugRider around for one hour and my hands afterward had a strong smell of chemicals and old rubber.

Being a first-time mom, I listened and purchased the Snap and Go, along with a Graco travel system. My plan was to use the infant car seat with the Snap and Go as my stroller until my son was big enough to fit into the full-size stroller. I now sincerely wish I wouldn't have wasted my money. One day, my husband and I were taking a walk with our baby... when we went over a particularly bumpy part of the sidewalk, the car seat became disconnected from the Snap and Go and flipped over the top of it, landing on the sidewalk. If my husband hadn't been holding my son in his arms, I would most likely be in a lawsuit with Graco right now. As it is, we discontinued use of the Snap and Go from that day forward and purchased an UPPAbaby Vista, which we LOVE. It was expensive, but more than worth the price of my son's safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product until YOUR CHILD FLIPS OUT","review":"I absolutely loved this product for three months. It's light weight, has lots of basket space, and is easy to travel with. I was so excited about my purchase, but after three months things went down hill. First the latch that you press to unfold the stroller kept jamming. Then the front wheels started to lock on their own. This was all stuff I found annoying, but could live with. Then the parts that hook in to keep the side of the car seat on the side that the parent pushes started popping loose. The worst part is that I didn't even notice until I went over a pothole while crossing the street and the car seat flipped out and over. Thankfully he was harnessed in tightly and it stayed attached to the strolled on the back side. We got so lucky! I really don't recommended this product. My son got lucky, but as I read in other reviews, not everyone is so lucky.

However, it just is not the same as the first Men In Black. The jokes were fewer, and there were less surprises.

It was almost as if in the second one you were expecting what was going to happen. But yes, go see it. MIB II is worth your time.

She disguises herself as a supermodel and takes over MiB Headquarters. Once again, Agent J and K (who at the time did not have his MiB memory back) are together and must save MiB Headquarters (with the help of the hilarious worm guys).People say sequels are not as good as the original, but I think this is an exception. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return as Agents K and J, along with Zed (Rip Torn), Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub), along with new cast members Johnny Knoxville as Scrad/Charlie, and supermodel Lara Flynn Boyle as Serleena.

The film was very short and the script took what, a week? They just slapped together this one, realizing that people would see it anyway, and by the time the word of mouth spread about this being bad, well, most everyone will have seen it already. The funny moments are few and far between. Frank was funny, and Tommy Lee Jones' post office clothes were funny. That's about it. It had enough for me to give two stars, but I wouldn't recommend it.

First of all, what were Smith, Jones and Sonnenfeld thinking when they approved this tired script? Don't these pics spend years in development? This is the best that anyone could come up with? And the effects! There might as well be strings attached to the spaceships. This is the kind of film that gives sequels a really bad name -- and in this case, deservedly so.

Surely someone could have written a decent sequel to the first one (which was wonderful). I am sorry I spent any money seeing this movie. Not real original with the jokes.

I was expecting so much more than what I got, the first Men in Black movie is still the best, and that's a DAMN shame. Even Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones's chemistry is bad, they used it wrong. As a matter of fact they didn't use it at all. There was so many ways Men in Black II could have topped the first one, with the right story and good comedy. MIIB is one of the worst sequels of all time.

One was more of a smile than a laugh. I kept looking at my watch waiting for the movie to let out, its really shory but seemed longer than almost every movie. Too many stupid movies add to the horrible script and the result is this \\"movie\\". It is a rehash of a way better prequel.

That is the question that I kept asking myself as I watched this mess. Sure, there were parts of this movie that were interesting and funny but the overall effect was very unpleasant. Will Smith's overblown performance got tiresome real quick and the Worms make Jar-Jar Binks look like Sir Laurence Olivier! This movie could have been alot better, why do Hollywood movie makers have so much trouble with good movie concepts like Men In Black?"},{"rating":"1","title":"MIIB doesnt have the right touch","review":"first of all, for all you people who saw MIB and want to see the sequel, don't waste your money, its cheaper just to watch the previews on tv. the cast and crew of MIB 2 has made the same mistake as so many other filmakers have by putting every single funny part in tyhe movie in previews.this movie also has several other faults. 1: the length of the movie. the movie is 88 minutes long. that isnt as long as most disney movies. the film has the feel of a disney movie to, except with more sex appeal through the quite beuatiful villain. 2: the movie is to serious to have a place in the MIB franchise. will smith is not as comic as he was in the beginning, and tommy lee jones talks to fast to be funny. such as when he sees will smith again, and quickly mutters,\\" ive never worked in a retirement home, what can i do for you slick?\\"if you appreciate the third austinn powers film, this is a good film to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"The men should have stayed gone","review":"I remember having such high hopes for this movie, but it turned out that the movie trailer had served up all the laughs and the rest of the flick was shockingly dull and un-orginal. But I get it. Sequels are hard and Hollywood are usually a greedy lot. The plot re: returning the Light couldn't have been more campy or paper thin if you tried. But, and it's a big but, it may have worked a little better for children. I'm not sure. I don't have children. Anyhoot, if you have absolutely nothing to do or you're searching for what NOT to do with a sequel, check this film out. Otherwise, watch the first movie and then pretend that this one never happened. Where's a good nuturalizer when you need one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Men, In Black, Are Back, On Track...","review":"While it is totally indefensible on any artistic, technical, adept, or emotional level, this sequel is often so hilarious and non-stop that you just don't care. Critics should find it so funny that they forget to laugh it off; the amazing thing about MIB is that most people who don't appreciate sci-fi end up enjoying them. That's no mean feat, and Lara Flynn Boyle (as the villanous alien of coarse) in the lingerie ad is a different type of visual feast. Rated PG-13 for some mild language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first","review":"Ignore the people on here who say the jokes were fewer, or weaker; they must have been either braindead or not paying very much attention. Although the movie is very short (88 minutes), that's because not a single moment was wasted; it's literally jam-packed with jokes from the first moment to the last that are funnier and more biting than those in the first movie. Nothing is overextended, even the fight scenes are perfectly timed. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have even more amusing interactions.

This happens to be an excellent movie, loaded with laughs, great acting and, most of all, fantastic special effects. C'mon... You think the effects in this film are bad?!? If nothing else, Rick Baker and ILM, the leaders in their respective industries, do a stupendous job of realizing Sonnenfeld's vision. Yes, the plot is simple and flimsy... This is a si-fi comedy blockbuster, remember? Yes, the film is derivative of the first film, to at least some extent. But this is a sequel, right? Same characters, same design elements... I can think of MANY other sequels that are MUCH more derivative or their originals. I think people have grown far too accustomed to expecting their own, specific opinion of what a movie should be override their ability to enjoy an artistic experience.

Frankly, I think this is just as good as the first. The FX are better, along with one or two more action sequences then the first. I like this movie, but it seems everyone else hates it.

MIB-II offers exactly two chuckles, plus a few pleasantries here and there. Not sure why Tommy Jones was roped in again, he looks about as emotive as his suit.

The actors walk through their roles and there is no joy in the film, which is sad considering how entertaining and original the first film was. There are no memorable lines, scenes, or jokes. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are just in it for the paycheck. Barry Sonnenfeld proves once again that his theory that shorter movies are better is pathetically flawed. This film is witless, hopeless, pointless. Plot? What plot? Visual effects? We recycled the first ones? And what happened to MIB headquarters? It used to be brimming with life. Now, it's a corporate mess. The movie rivals the Austin Powers and Bond films for shameless plugs. I would write a more coherent review, but there's nothing TO review.

Don't be fooled! All the funny parts are in the previews! This movie was a carbon copy of the first Men in Black, except that Tommy Lee Jones' role was reversed with Will Smith's this time. The only thing that could have saved this movie, or at least made it half decent, is if Zed (MIB leader) had died and all the characters are like \\"Where's Zed?\\" and Frank the pug comes out and says \\"Zed's dead baby, Zed's dead\\" kinda like Pulp Fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it, don't buy it.","review":"Only a shadow of the original.

It's a basic story that reunites Agent K with J to kill more aliens.The film is not completely without merit. There are some good jokes and humorous scenes involved. There is also a better array of special effects. But at the same time, the goofiness and in-your-face style of the film takes on a more unbelievable edge.The characters are still well-developed and well enacted.

This is hands down the worst movie of 2002. This movie has no story as usual and the supposed evil person in the story Lara Flynn Boyle, they don't even give a reason why she is evil. We're just supposed to presume that she is evil. The deneurilizer effect joke only works for so long and at the end it being in the Statue Of Liberty's torch was ridiculous. This movie was release for money and Will Smith's poor box office numbers of his last two movies Ali and the Legend Of Bagger Vance. This movie deserves to be in the top 100 worst movies of all time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $$.

Some nice special effects, but all that takes is money and it can't carry a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just feels off!!!","review":"This from the very beggining feels off. Something is missing from this one that was in the first. And it's not lack of being original, because the story works, and it's not flawed preformances because everyone brings it to the table. Just the heart of the movie is gone. It feels witout a skelliton.Each trick seems to be like that guy at the party thats always funny but just having an off night. I'ts fun in places, but when it's not, you feel it ten fold. Rent, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aimed toward younger audience","review":"I remember watching Men in Black a long time ago and I remember it being pretty good. So naturally, when I heard Men In Black 2 was coming I was ready to go see it. It turned out to be nothing I expected. I think the directors aimed this movie toward a younger audience. Because the jokes were very childish and my niece thought it was hilarious. Anyway, for a children's movie, it was decent, but I'm not watching it again, even though I like Disney movies...."},{"rating":"1","title":"the first is way better","review":"sorry but this movie just made me mad. I was eagerly anticipating watchin this movie as I had seen the first and really enjoyed it.Ok ive seen it now and I just have to say it is not up to the standards of the first. Its good and at times its a bit funny but for how long can a talking dog be funny? Its funny the first time, mildly amusing the second time it speaks and makes jokes but from then on you just wish it was out down.It isnt really funny and didnt make me laughing out loud like the reviews said it would. It was just a film. An average film and not even the soundtrack that will smith done for this film was played during the film, it was only played in the end credits which is useless.This whole fim was sloppy and tacky and it aint good enough. I wasted money renting it and I just hope they dont make another men in black after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than everyone said it would be","review":"Okay, I agree, this movie was NOT all it was cracked up to be. Still, after hearing so many people say how bad it was, it proved to be a good investment of an hour and twenty minutes. Even if you don't like it, there is that one redeeming quality--it's less than 1 1/2 hours long.I thought this movie was very funny--funnier than the first. Will Smith, as Jay, completely outdoes himself here, and Tommy Lee Jones contributes to the humor as the cranky, by-the-book Kay. Of course, there is not a whole lot to the plot--what did you expect?--but the movie nonetheless remains very entertaining.MIIB is definitely worth the viewing, though I'd recommend you watch it before you buy it. You may not want to watch this one over and over, but it would be well worth your time to see it at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second verse, same as the first!","review":"Here's a waste of an overinflated movie admission for you.There's nothing startling in the fact that 90% of the scenes in this movie were a rehash of the most popular scenes from the original I guess, that's why critics commonly lament sequels. Never before has this been so apparent, though. You'll find yourself asking who could have possibly been responsible for the screenplay, a writer or a test audience from the first film. As David Spade would have put it in a Hollywood Minute, I liked this film the first time I saw it...when it was Men in Black I.To sum up- thin plot, thinner characters, one or two scenes that will make you smirk just like they did the first time around. Skip it in theaters, rent it at Blockbuster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible movie!","review":"Having just returned from a nurse's mission to Israel, I was on Masada and seeing the ruins and knowing the story, I felt compelled to see the movie, which was actually on sale at the gift shop at Masada. I purchased it as soon as I arrived home, and I wasn't disappointed. Knowing the historical aspect of this movie, I wanted to see it as soon as possible. It did not disappoint! With a stellar cast, it makes for excellent entertainment and, knowing it is based on a part of Jewish history, makes it even better viewing. People of all ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds visit Masada every year! Everyone can enjoy this film; a must have combining a history lesson with entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, though propagandistic at points.","review":"I'm happy that Masada has been released on DVD, and I bought it as soon as I found out. It's one of the better mini-series from that TV form's heyday. I've been fascinated by what happened at Masada for many years and this is what piqued my interest. The pro-Israeli bent of the modern day commentary isn't surprising, but seemed a bit over the top for my taste.All-in-all, this is quite good and I reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masada-the complete mini-series","review":"I bought this Mini-series because of the great reviews it got. I was sorry I did. I found Peter O'toole, completely overacting. The storyline had his nemis, very pompous and so full of could have, should have, thoeries it left the viewer annoyed and frustrated. Maybe that's how the real story came to a conclusion. If so, too bad. Even I could have resolved a better outcome. Oh well. To the back of my vidio shelf. Did'nt like the show-movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertainment or Propaganda?","review":"Being a student of Roman history, the butchery of the facts in this DVD is quite appalling, but I suppose it's no worse than Disney's version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. In any event, the melodramatic script is preposterous Hollywood fluff. Anyone who knows anything about the Romans would cringe at O'Toole's scripted part as a Roman governor.Aside from the fact that the story is ridiculous, and that this is blatant Israeli propaganda, I have to give at least two stars because the Roman uniforms were fairly accurate and the scenes with the siege engine were first rate; also, a smattering of the dialogue was actually passably good.Acting wasn't bad either. The poor actors made do with what they were given. All that was missing was Charlton Heston."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masada","review":"Though it's an older epic, we found it totally enjoyable. Wish we had watched the movie before we took our trip to Israel and actually went to Masada."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Despicable","review":"The film almost totally ignores the sole surviving ancient historical account of Masada (contained in Josephus' \\"Jewish War\\") as well as the evidence found during modern excavations of the site in favor of presenting an almost wholly made up and, at times, tawdry melodrama. The only events in the film which come from the sole ancient source (Josephus) are the building of an inner wall of wood and earth for the fortress and its subsequent destruction by fire. All other events in the film are devices employed in the service of a fraudulent patriotic fantasy--as any legitimate scholar of the ancient world will attest. As pure drama, this film would not be so bad. Unfortunately, the film does not settle for that--it also claims to be actual history, and, on that scale, it fails miserably. Worse than only not informing, it actually misinforms its tabloid browsing, television \\"Movie of the Week\\" watching audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buena miniserie, pero...","review":"La grabación tiene algjunas manchas blancas.No tiene traducción al castellano.No tiene extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disk skipping","review":"Well, I guess I learned about returning items promptly to Amazon.

He watched it two weeks later and found that the second disk or this two disk set skips and freezes in ANY DVD player it is played in. And of course, I have missed the return date.

I cut it off boooooooo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Masada shall not all again","review":"Masada is sometimes described as the Jewish Alamo.There were 185 Texians defenders of the Alamo and 4000 Mexican agressors. The Texians fought to the death.The number of Jewiish fighters at Masada was approcimately 1000, the Romans had around 5000.Masada was an easily defended mountain fortress rising 1000 feet above the desert.The Alamo was a simple wooden stockade with no elevation.The Jews chose to commit suicide rather than fight to the death.I suppose the reason \\"Masada will not fall again\\" is that it is supposed the Americans will fight to the death to defend the Israelis and pay trillionsin Israeli inspired wars.That's the way it has been.If somebody would run for President on a platform which said Israel was on its own, I would vote for him. That's what Ron Paul says. Maybe I will vote for him (again).Shalom you-all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for an older TV series","review":"I have been to Masada a few times and wanted to see this movie to compare it to the actual location. Overall it is pretty accurate in terms of the feeling of the desert location.It is not a terribly exciting movie, with much of the show being discussions about if each side is doing the right thing and why they don't trust the other side. But the major aspects of the siege were pretty accurate.The show is made to be watched in 4 one hour sessions and it is slow enough that this is probably for the best. I would not make this a must see for anyone going to Israel though. Just a nice to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPLETE","review":"This is NOT the entire mini-series. It does not tell the whole story. It is clear there are episodes missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent,but slightly historically inaccurate","review":"Beautifully acted all round;stunning scenery and props; the only problem I have is the portrayal of Flavius Silva as a conciliatory general, when in actual fact he was a bellicose,bloodthirsty soldier, as were most of the Roman generals and Procurators at that time. The only written record by a Jew was by Josephus, which most certainly could not be considered as entirely historically accurate, because he was living among the Romans, having defected after the siege of Jerusalem in 78 C.E. He most certainly would not have wanted to displease his Roman masters by portraying them as brutal savages(which is exactly what they were) Here endeth the lesson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"After teaching a Bible study class where this topic came up I decided I would like to see how it was interpreted in the movie. I enjoyed the movie very much. It was mostly like the history I know but I am sure some is the writers interpretation. I really enjoyed Peter OToole's character and acting in this. It gave both stars a very human character and you like them both. Although you can enjoy the movie without knowing the history of Masada and the cultural setting , you will probably enjoy it even more if you read up a bit on the historical setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masada","review":"I watched the series many years ago.

The scenery is entirely evocative of a dry, windswept, exhausted land, Peter Strauss is excellent, but of course the standout is Peter O'Toole. He is magnificently melancholy--what an actor!

My 2 yr old likes it, but might be a little young for it still - maybe b/c she can't put the baby in and out herself yet. The backpack itself is a good size for a child to carry and would carry a few baby things (like bottles, paci, etc), but the baby carrier part was smaller than I thought it would be. So far the velcro holds, but I don't have long term hopes for the baby carrier part. The bag part is a nice quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small!","review":"This carrier is cute, but Baby Stella BARELY fits in the straps, and won't fit if she has her winter clothes on.

When it arrived, I could not believe how cheap it looked. We put her Baby Stella in it and put it on her back. While my daughter ran along, Baby Stella flew out of the carrier.The velcro is not secure, the carrier is very tight and does not give the doll wiggle room, the doll just bursts out upon any normal toddler movement. The straps that go around the back also dug into my daughters arms. They do not look comfortable.We returned it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Was fun enough to fight over","review":"I gave this to my niece along with a Baby Stella doll for her second birthday.

My top favorite on this great album is the long-overlooked gem called \\"Make It Be Me.\\" This is a spirit-lifting, gospel-like masterpiece that appeared briefly on the charts in the fall of 1962. I was ten years old when I first heard it and I've been loving it ever since.

While the humor that you'd expect from the Critters isn't there like in the other films and if you are a fan of the series like I am, this is probably one of the first things that you'll notice about this movie. The writing seems to have improved over the previous three, but I'm not sure about the characters in the movie other than Charlie, who's the only character that has been in all four movies.

But that wouldn't have been a problem for me if the book were very well-done. My major complaint is that it meanders and stalls and repeats endlessly. Nothing happens while the characters drive one to distraction with the tedious rehashing of all the dull facts, page after page. The writing itself is fine and the characters are mostly well-done, but quite uninteresting. Perhaps this series improves later on but this first number is well worth a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Medieval Soap Opera","review":"I thought that this was a good book because the story really flowed and it wasn't slow. It was also a good portrayal of what life was like for women during this time. There were good descriptions of the settings. The characters were realisitic and developed. I found myself feeling for the characters. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an easy read book with lots of twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plot twists","review":"This was the first Sister Frevisse book I've read, and I can't wait to read more.

While they mildly change their ways on the surface at the end, they really ha vent changed within.I didn't find the 'humour' funny. From a female view the guys are cute but jerks with a one-dimensional attitude to women.I found myself fast-forwarding through it hoping it may change but it never seemed to.Any marks I give it are for cinematography, nice scenery and the actors who are solid enough themselves.The buffed shirt-off displays of Salman Khan do nothing for me - though they appeared to please him a lot!Guys seem to like this more than females as it is men behaving badly and largely achieving their fantasies even though it takes a bit of work and some 'comedic' misunderstandings and cover-ups. Definitely not my style of humour.The music and small amount of dancing didn't rescue it from mediocrity either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This case actually ruined the back of my phone.

Not Simon's best joke writing, but he is rather ingenious in the non-stop travails that befall this hapless couple. The running gag of taking names may wear on some viewers, but I had to laugh each time at Lemmon's neurotic ranting and bluffing. Early 70s N.Y. is a far cry from the extravaganza it is today, and one scoffs at the \\"great depression ii\\" malarky dished out last year, we have it pretty well. To get back on point, Lemmon once again gives a masterful performance that takes no prisoners... even though he nearly lands himself in jail!!

It is a classic Jack Lemmon film. I think it is funny and it provides nostalgia. Sandy Dennis and Lemmon played off each other well. It seems they will never get through having troubles and I think we all can identify with the characters somewhat. I recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of Jack Lemmon or just happens to like comedy. There is a small part in it played by the actor Billy Dee Williams...the future Star Wars actor (among one of his many roles)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all-time best","review":"If you've never seen this movie, you must see it to truly experience great comedy...one thing after another and you just can't believe that this could happen to 2 people all in 24 hrs.

Lemmon and Dennis - so great - a true classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"If you like comedies where you can relate to the experiences shown, you will love this one! Far, far superior to the more recent remake, the performances of Jack Lemon and Sandy Dennis are unbeatable. The couple starts out on what should be a minor business trip to New York and encounter a series of snafus that continue to rachet up on the comedic scale. For those whose taste runs higher than all the toilet humor of the last 20 or so years, this is not to be missed. Even my teenage boys enjoyed this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The performances of Lemmon and Dennis make this a must-have comedy!!!","review":"Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis play George and Gwen Kellerman, who are on a trip to New York City from their hometown of Twin Oaks, Ohio so that George can get to a very important business meeting the next morning. They board their flight, and are on their way, but a number of things go wrong for George and Gwen shortly later on. The things they go through are the kinds of things that no out-of-town traveler wants to deal with. It is non-stop comedy all the way, and Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis play their characters to the hilt (I don't think any other famous two actors could have played these characters as humorously as Lemmon and Dennis did in 1970). I did see the remake from 1999 with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn as the title characters. They, as well as the updated remake were funny also, but I don't think that it could hold a candle to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS!!!","review":"I couldn't quit laughing through the whole movie.

This movie pits a Midwestern man (Jack Lemmon) against the Peter Principle as he travels to NY City for his big chance job interview.I am a huge Lemmon fan, but I found this movie irritating, not funny. The entire movie consists of one scene after another of, \\"if it can go wrong, it will go wrong.\\" I can only imagine the grief this movie caused the New York Bureau of Tourism. Throughout the movie, Lemmon shares my irritation. In fact, that is his main demeanor throughout the film. He is irritated at all the bad breaks and he is constantly ranting, constantly rushing to try to overcome them. This got old for me about 8 minutes into the film and did not abate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware ..New York City","review":"For New Yorker,s ,like myself, this film is terrific. Its almost a black comedy as every thing goes wrong on Lemmon,s job interview in New York City. Its unrelenting and the absurdly funny scenes are almost meloncholy.

The story is sweet and any gal that has ever brought home a guy that didn't quite fit her dad's perfect image for her will relate with all the \\"hoops\\" the guy in this film jumps through to try to please his prospective father-in-law. I found it offered both humor and an endearing quality with what this guy was willing to do for his love. Probably is more a gal movie but if you like the farm, hunting, or the outdoors you might enjoy it as well. In a time where a nice romance seems harder to find...this is a keeper! Just don't expect a big blockbuster movie frill budget effects with the male and female actors of the moment and you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Made for TV movie","review":"This is more than a romantic comedy- it has heart.

So this is a chick flick for guys. You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family film","review":"This is a good family film that contains some humor and the importance of family. It also shows that money (the main character is offered a six-figure salary) is not the most important thing. The only downside was a slip of the Lord's name in vain.

Folks, the world has seen this kind of cultural white wash before, albeit on a grander scale. It was the Yehudi (a.k.a. Jews) described by Roman historians as an Ethiopian race with broad noses, thick lips, wooly hair, and burnt skin. Europeans became so facinated with this culture that many learned to speak the language and many books were written about the culture, eventually making it a religion while history forgets the culture. Now the world is left with Text Book Africans (a.k.a. Christian missionaries) conquering the world with the old and new testament - teaching all that the people in these books are Caucasians while leaving Yehudi culture in the past.So be wary of the likes of white washers such as Lynn V. Andrews or our future world may be filled with Text Book American Indians.Note: American Indians and Africans still live - learn cultural spirituality from the source!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HATAALII","review":"I enjoyed reading Medicine Woman, as well as the follow-up book Flight of the Seventh Moon.

To respond to a previous critique of this book -- don't be fooled -- it doesn't matter where a writer lives, but what she writes.Especially in these times, women don't need to be beating down their sisters.

It's not part of their culture.The last and final huge mistake is the fact that most of this story could not have taken place outside without huge huge bottles of mosquitoe repellant as anyone who lives in the bush in Manitoba knows especially those who may have a reason to go naked in the woods.Perhaps Lynn shouldn't be peddling her strange brand of spiritualism as true when it's not.

The dials provide the right amount of contrast and are highly luminous even in low-visibility conditions. With the stainless steel strap, this watch looks like it just as easily belongs in a boardroom as it does on a boat.After having owned this watch for almost two years, I can see just a slight indication of wear on the bezel surface, which isn't bad considering how much my watch has bumped against scuba cylinders, lead weights, boat railings and the occasional concrete wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for laying out flow charts.

But there is more to these recordings than the voice; the rich musical arrangements and large supporting band and singers are cheerful, broad, and effective.

It takes a little extra effort to learn the language simply because the book is not formatted aesthetically. Otherwise, the grammar is fine, although it is a must to get the Lao-English Dictionary to implement what is learned in the grammar book. This book is the only game in town so we have to use it, but it needs another edition to fix the layout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As the only teach yourself Lao book I have been able to trace it was a great disappointment.

I have not seen the Tuttle publications book. The one by Buasawan Simmala and Benjawan Poomsan Becker (Baipoon publishing 2003) has lot of audio. It has many problems, but the words in Lao are spelled correctly.Teach yourself methods have recently become very flimsy because few of the buyers actually get through them, so an author can sell a lot of substandard books. But for those who want to learn this is rather cruel punishment. It would be useful if the authors tried to learn a language from a book like what they have produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn to speak Lao","review":"The books offers an easy to understand method of learning to speak Lao.

However, the intricate pop-ups of these characters make these books difficult to keep for little ones. The bugs are too enticing -- they want to put their fingers around every piece, and although as pop-ups go these books are pretty sturdy, some of the bugs are delicate and tear easily. This is a terrific treat for a kid who understands pop ups. For littler ones, I'd recommend Feely Bugs by the same author, which essentially can't be torn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Adorable!","review":"My 16 month old son loves this book!

Firstly it makes first class drama - like KNIFE IN THE WATER, it has unity of time, action and place. 48 hours on a boat with a stranger and his knife - the 29 year old narrator does not know what he's let himself in for. Secondly it pays great attention to marine jargon and knows the subject of fishing. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the reader is able to follow the ebbing and flowing of the thoughts and feelings of the narrator on this emotional and philosophical journey. This novella is good enough to be used as a study text by High School literature students. Read it in one sitting and enjoy. Oh, I forgot to mention, the presentation of it by Chronicle Books, San Francisco is such that it is good to look at, touch and retain. It would make an excellent gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"More pieces of truth","review":"As a \\"Christian\\" myself, I personally have seen much fraud in the \\"church\\" system and this book is one of many which gives valuable info into the search.

He does provide some very select information such as Jesus being Roman royality! He does fall into a common error regarding Krisna, I have read all the sacred books of the Hendoo and there is no simularity to the birth of Jesus. But this Krisna connection seems to be a common error. The Egyptian God Horus is truely a much better Proto-Christ and the author does correctly refer to Horus being called Christ from ancient Egyptian writing in stone. He puts forth a theory that Galalee was Pagan and likely Celts but he could have included a reference from \\"Galilee of the Gentiles\\" - Matthew 4:15. There were several references and theories that he could have proven if he would refernce the Bible. In fairness to the author he is doing something that is very difficult to do in light of the massive destruction of evidence!

The adapted script, the direction, and acting all feel underwhelming. Kathleen Quinlan gives a fine performance, but Peter Strauss clearly fails to deal with material well above his capabilities. In better hands, with a bigger budget, and a longer development cycle, this could have been so much more.Some side notes:This may have appeared on Lifetime at some point, but it originally aired on Fox.Mary Higgins Clark did NOT write the novel. I don't know why someone would tag this movie with her name.The ending of the movie differs GREATLY from the novel's ending.Apparently, there were several difficulties in bringing the novel to the screen - which is why the movie appeared two years after the novel's initial publication date - but my memory is too hazy to recall what they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrelentingly morose","review":"Evidently a TV movie, but it's a little better than most of those.

There was no institutional structure or authority. There was no ritual. There was little doctrine. It was, basically, the ancient Mediterranean version of going out with your buds for Sunday brunch.It's a very pretty picture. Sadly, it isn't true. Trust me, I've spent my entire adult life trying to get a grip on what authentic early Christianity was like, and it was nothing like this. If you want the real story, I'd suggest you read Wayne Meeks' 'The First Urban Christians: The Social World of the Apostle Paul', especially chapters 5 and 6.

The pictures by Ruth Wright Paulsen are also a big part of it too. I think this story sends a great message.This book has words in its pictures. An example of this is that the fish look like they are swimming whenever it shoes them in the water. This book has very descriptive words. They describe the motion of the butterflies wings as swish. The author barely talks about the person, but more about the animals. They make it seem like they do, but they really describe the nature instead. The example of this is where the person is going down the creek in his boat, and the animals are around him and they talk about the animals.This book is a classic. IT sends a great message. It had good words and pictures, it is very descriptive. IT is a nature based book. This story was great"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential...","review":"The illustrations and concept of this book are wonderful. The writing, however, is disappointing. The title, \\"Canoe Days\\", is plural, but the story seems to be about a singular day trip in the canoe. Also, Gary Paulsen uses sentence fragments (ex: \\"Watching for frogs to make a dinner.\\") and awkward punctuation, which prevents this from being an excellent book. He ends his description with a review of what he sees, and includes a reference to \\"the badger\\".

It's more of a dessert drink now that I actually ENJOY drinking. After a few days now of drinking it, I can tell that it decreases my appetite and the scale may have been lying, but it was two pounds lighter today than it was 3 days ago, so overall, 4-5 days into drinking this tea, I'm happy with it.

Mr. Real's courageous book points out exactly what that price is and how it affects men, women, and society. This book is an eye-opener for everyone, therapist or otherwise. It gives the Oedipus myth another well-deserved blow. It provides the reader with a powerful perspective on current news events, such as sadistic hazing, so poorly explained by facile remarks concerning \\"peer pressure\\". Moreover, this book will allow the reader to examine his own ideas and attitudes about our socially constructed roles. The book is not so technical as to be beyond the average interested reader, the examples are clear, and the message well thought out. Mr. Real has laid down the framework for a genuine men's liberation movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't want to talk about it by Terrance real","review":"When counseling, I use this resource often.

At one point, I began to draft a plan for a book on this subject myself, since I saw a need that was not being fulfilled.

I have been using it with both men and women clients, and they have made many positive comments. Dr. Real does a great job of explaining men's experiences in our culture, and how sexism hurts both men and women. I especially like that he explains how other (ultimately self-destructive) behaviors can be a manifestation of unidentified (atypical)depression. Also, because he contrasts men's and women's experiences, he also has something to say to women who are depressed. And, he points out the importance of connection and nurturing for all children, not just girls. Several clients have reported increased emotional attunement with their children as a result of their reading this book.

There are too many participants and they are all over the place and not keeping up with Alan. Alan himself hardly ever leads the class, he is always hopping off the step and running around the room, the camera angles are terrible (you can even see the 2nd camera person in many shots) and they focus on the faces of the participants and not their feet or the step so it is difficult to follow.An amateurish, back-yard production dvd with a premium price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD...

He worships Shane as we worshipped John Wayne and the other icons of that great genre, the western.

From incredible panoramic shots of the American West and a sweeping musical score; to the eternally relevant story of struggle between classes and interests; Shane brings it all to the screen. The total package and predecessor to most of the great westerns we know today, Shane is a memorable movie you'll never forget. Even by today's film standards it's a longer movie, but it keeps pace and the story fits in well to the longer format.

He finds it in a yeoman farmer whose wife and small boy who take him in as a hired hand.Where so many westerns are little more than vehicles for transmitting clichés, Shane offers a serious moral tale with masterful plot-action and lightening-like intensity.

The scenery is beautiful and the movie is just well-done all the way around. Alan Ladd, Jack Palance, Ben Johnson and the rest are outstanding. A gunslinger who is trying to make a new start in life thinks he's escaping to a peaceful area. Then he discovers that conflict is there too. He does his best to avoid involvement, but realizes that he is the only one who can defend the defenseless. He eventually embraces his role as a sheepdog of sorts and goes to battle the wolves.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, ABSOLUTELY GREAT","review":"SHANE to me is the finest Western ever made. Alan Ladd's performance in the title role should have brought him the OSCAR for Best Actor. Why he was not even nominated is beyond my comprehension. The storyline is familiar with the good guys winning out over the bad guys but beyond that here are characters who really grab your attention and the supporting actors,Van Heflin,Jean Arthur,Brandon DeWilde and Jack Palance perform their roles with dedication that you don't always see in other movies.

My 20 y o daughter began to read Justine, invited by me, but she stopped after some chapters finding the book \\"unreadable\\" (sic).Has the \\"Zeitgeist\\" changed? Maybe so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durrell ; A rocket that failed to fire .","review":"Lawrence Durrell's biography fails to tell us why he seemed to be a British writer who mattered ,for a brief time only.An enormous book tells us little or nothing of his work on behalf of Britain, as a PR man, a spy, even a propagandist in odd places such as the middle of the Argentine pampas .Durrell is said to have produced books that are now almost incomprehensible--the Alexandria Quartet. Perhaps it was all a joke .What is all the hoo-haw about then ? Why a biography about a man who seems mean spirited and humorless.The writer fails to bring Durrell to life and never explains why this writer's books were once praised to the sky.Pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon's Great, Weber was a disappointment","review":"I ordered it on 12/23 and received it on 12/28 (today) w/ the one cent shipping option. Every place it was soldered and press welded was rusty and a couple of the leg pieces appeared as if they had been heat discolored. For a $700 grill, I expected quality stainless steel w/o flaws, particularly w/o rust. On a positive note, the pieces fit together fairly well and it was easy to assemble. For the body quality, it should have been half this price. I plan to contact Weber tomorrow and voice the same complaints. Unfortunately I had not viewed this exact model prior to purchase; instead relying on the 6770001 reviews and another more expensive model I had seen at a local store."},{"rating":"2","title":"World Music","review":"I have purchased \\"Mercan Dede\\"s music before.

So, naturally, I was quite excited when I learned that it would be making its DVD debut. :) The \\"Premier\\" is such a great ep - interesting establishment of characters and setting - that it still makes me laugh. Crichton is an instantly lovable character and the introductions to the others' will pique the interest of any sci-fi native. \\"I, E.T.\\" reminds me of Star Trek TNG, the glory days of yore and all that jazz. It gives a thought-provoking spin on close encounters and learning about alien life through the eyes of our very own confused \\"alien\\" Crichton. It's a little hokey, but layered underneath the somewhat predictable humor is a deep message that teaches us even more about the unlikely crew of Moya. In conclusion, I was overtly impressed with the DVDs, and can't wait for season three! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Farscape # 1","review":"My reveiws are unknown , because I ordered farscape # 1 on Feb. 10 , 2001 with a delivery date of 24 hours .

Unlike that show--which may have been state-of-the-art in the mid-60's but whose sets look pathetically low-budget to today's Industrial Light and Magic overdosed fan--\\"Farscape\\" pushes the envelope to new and glorious heights in every respect: from cool special effects, to phenomenal makeup and masks, to innovative animated and 'Muppet' characters that make Star Wars' Cantina crew look tame! Add to this intriguing human-esque characters portrayed by actors of a caliber no longer seen in American television or movies (actors with the ability to convey, with heart-rending conviction, a myriad of emotions with a single glance or gesture) throw in some stunning sets, and you have a production that is unmatchable.

I especially liked reading the history of Berryman, and how the cartoon of Roosevelt saving the bear came to be, about the two cartoons depicting the famous event 100 years ago, and about how Roosevelt did not actually spare the life of the bear tied to a tree, just refused to allow it to be shot.

Overall, it's an amazing product.Bifacil is a little bit pricey, but totally worth it. The free sample bottle was only 1.7oz or something.

It will take off /anything/, as far as I'm concerned. It doesn't burn or sting your eyes, and it just leaves you feeling refreshed. However, it is quite pricey so I am docking one star off for that (otherwise 5 stars all the way), and there is another brand which makes a similar eye makeup remover for a few bucks cheaper and it does the same thing. :x But if you can afford it, I definitely recommend it since Lancome almost always makes quality products :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not New.

The last section deals with Hoover's involvement in the escalation of troops in Vietnam during the Johnson administration.

I've gone to several drug stores and natural food markets and have not been able to find all the ingredients.Secondly, the ingredients are expensive, and contrary to what others have mentioned in their reviews, they don't last that long. Sounded like most reviewers hadn't started the program quite yet and were swayed by the author's claims.Lastly, this book, as well as the follow up, \\"Grow Hair Fast,\\" are extremely poorly written.

Seemed like a must read. What a bust. There is very little about Rats in this book---not more than a few pages. If you are interested in obscure New York History (which is not even slightly connected to rats) then this is the book for you. The book continues to get great reviews, even in this forum. I must have missed something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a different title","review":"This book does contain some interesting facts and anecdotes about rats. But the subject is less \\"Rats\\" than it is \\"How I spent a year writing a book about rats.\\" You can judge for yourself if that sounds like an interesting subject for a book. For my part, if I'd done my shopping more carefully I'd have skipped this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this book is compromised by two serious flaws. One, rats turn out to be an insuffiently engaging subject for a micro-history of this sort. I don't feel like I learned much about them that was particularly interesting or unexpected, and the book feels padded. Two, Sullivan is a lousy writer. His prose is rambling and disorganized. He makes spelling errors, misuses words, uses tenses in disagreement, and more. Was this book even edited, I wondered? I doesn't seem like it. The yarns he spins to pad the book are not very interesting and tend to petter out without going anywhere. He wrote a book about himself writing a book about rats, and it's not a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who would want to read a book about rats..you should!","review":"In this fascinating account of an unseen world, Robert Sullivan does the unthinkable-makes you sympathetic towards rats! From a brilliant cover to the history of how rats came to the United States, to the impact of this animal on big cities--especially New York--Sullivan writes with passion and pathos about these critters. Especially memorable was that Sullivan's alley of choice for viewing rats was blocks from the World Trade Center and the tragedy there on 9/11. What happened to the rats after 9/11--read this book and find out...don't worry you will only squirm two or three times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"As a rat fan and history major I was excited to read this book. I am very glad it was a library book and not one I'd purchased for it was a huge disappointment. There isn't a whole lot about rats in the darn book! I tried really hard to like it, but the composition of the book was poor and it is not very well crafted so I have to give it a single star. If he'd had the guts to get up closer to the rats it would have made for a more compelling story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good title, poor book.","review":"It's hard to believe that this author actually spent a year observing rats in a New York alley. If he did, he must not have seen anything interesting because almost the entire book is about the history of New York and its politics. Even that material seems padded. For some strange reason the author seems compelled to tell us the clothing description and occupational history of almost every character he mentions. Equally strange is the fact that he often tells us how tall these people are! What little information there is about rats is usually common knowledge. The sad part is that he claims to have read a great many books on rats and their behavior during his research for this book but tells us almost nothing of what he learned. I suspect that he is not very interested in rats after all but just used the title to sell his book. Unfortunatily it worked"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love rats","review":"This book is wonderfully written and recommended to anyone thatis considering incorporating a rat or two in to their family.The history of rats is fascinating.

It is clear the book was scanned, and then never checked for errors. I have counted no less than 50 typographical errors. (Nice Quality Control, AMAZON!) It reminds me of the free classics on Google Books.Next, the book itself is not well-written. The author jumps suddenly from 9/11 to plague to odd figures in New York's rat-fighting history.This book reads like a series of loosely related articles by a person with ADHD. Or, like a series of rat factoids from CNN Headline News or USA Today.It is not a \\"book.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have rarely found a more poorly-written book on such an interesting subject. Darn shame, as I (like other reviewers below) really wanted to like this book due to its subject.The author does not move himself to the background. This book is not about rats so much as the author's adventures as he learns about rats. Rats are interesting, Robert Sullivan is less so.The book is full of distracting misspellings ('They' for 'The' for example) and nonstandard capitalization ('Edens alley' for 'Edens' Alley' throughout). Each page has a half dozen places that brings the reader out of the story and back into the real world.Further, the author is unable to write in a linear fashion. His description of of the alley is a jumble. I read the entire book and still cannot make a mental map of the place.All in all, the subject deserves a better treatment than it receives here. An interesting, readable book on the urban rat remains to be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Difficult Business of Siblings","review":"Mr. Gilmore's book is an aching history of siblings growing up in an abusive household. He explores complex and painful bartering of abused children's lives: children trading against each other for a little bit of peace or shelter, then he traces how that economy plays out in their adult lives.This is a book that is far outside the normal boundaries of my reading habits. To describe this book to others, one must resort to words like \\"true crime\\" or mention that Gilmore wrote for Rolling Stone and therefore this book is okay for the hip literati to read. These words do such a disservice to Mr. Gilmore's work. He has written a painful biography of himself and his family, from which all of us who are siblings can and should learn, and it is an important book for people trying to make sense of violent family history. It is a transformative book in the best sense: you are not the same person after this book -- he has changed you."},{"rating":"2","title":"shot in the heart","review":"Unbelievable. Fantastically written, gripping and a very quick read. The best summer read I have had in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authenticity.","review":"Perhaps everyone has one good book in them, but it is rare to have witnessed and researched what Mr. Gilmore has here. Another review used the word artifact and that touches on the authenticity of the book. To simplify, the reader can infer that the intelligent and artistic Gary Gilmore came to expect repression as the expression of fatherly behavior and ultimately appealed to have himself shot in the heart. In contrast, the equally willful crimes of Mr. Bundy, who may have killed hundreds, never resulted in a desire on his part to submit to his punishment. Society may be thankful for the honorableness of Gary's decision. There is much to think about in this book. Much as the current Monica story, reading the tea leaves here will reveal more about the reader than the tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was really interesting.","review":"I learned a lot from this book. I had to read it for a Criminal Justice class. It talks about the way this family grew up, and you learn a lot about the attachement of the family and how it relates to the crimes that Gary Gilmore commits. Read it, you can learn from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Mailer left out.","review":"This family put the fun back in dysfunctional...not! Frank and Bessie Gilmore were two of the worst parents in the history of civilization, with the brutal alcoholic father and the cruel, abusive mother. Mikal Gilmore goes into detail that Norman Mailer left out, probably because he didn't know about it when he wrote The Executioner's Song. Gary, who was the most abused of the children, grew up to be an alcoholic sociopath and multiple murderer who had spent most of his life in prison. Mikal chronicles the Gilmore family history in excruciating detail, and his follow-up with Nicole and with Vern's family years later. This fine biography should definitely be read if you have read \\"The Executioner's Song\\" for a much deeper understanding of Gary Gilmore and his family--and the dynamics of murder. You will be horrified and shaken, but you come away with pieces fallen into place."},{"rating":"2","title":"book called shot in the heart","review":"Kepted me interested from start to finish.

I read Truck first because it appealed to me, having come from a small town in the U.P., fully knowing about the truck in the driveway that one intends to fix, although our driveways were gravel and not asphalt. Grass grew underneath rather than the truck sinking into. If you intend to read Population: 485, do it before this one. It sets the tone for events in Truck, and a major event happens at the end of Population that is referred to in Truck. I was surprised by Michael's style; I expected the redneck language I had grown up with, but even with my PhD education, on occasion I had to pull out my dictionary or wonder if a word he used was a real one.

He thoroughly enjoyed it and recommended it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat interesting","review":"Interesting look at life in rural Wisconsin..The author seems to have got hold of a thesaurus in order to select words for this book that might suggest he is an accomplished writer, but fails in my view as his poor choice of esoteric words make the text difficult to follow at times, leaving me to wonder the true meaning behind his words.He is best when using words he is familiar with. The story is a stretch when one considers the topic of the book is a '51 truck..There are far better choices out there than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Title","review":"This book has to have one of the best titles ever. It implies a love for his truck, but as you delve further into the story you get a sense that the title implies more: a love for a women, a love for gardening, a love of simple life. It is heartfelt and at the same time deep. The simple stories of the local town and its inhabitants makes you yearn to have close relationships with your neighbors no matter how weird they seem. His love of working the earth and reconstructing a truck makes you want to start a new project around the house. It is just an uplifting look at real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midwest","review":"If people from the coasts want to understand the thinking in the flyover states read this book. It is both touching and has humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for some I'm sure - but I hated it.","review":"I gave it two stars instead of one because I have to admit that I could not bring myself to finish this book - I stopped short of halfway. I can also see how some people would like this book, but I simply can't relate to the main character, and frankly if I met him in real life I think I would be annoyed by him.Perhaps it's because it's about a complaining middle-aged single man. While I generally appreciate self-deprecation, I found him wimpy. He's clueless under a hood. He's agnostic and borderline offensive toward Christians. He daydreams about traditional gender roles while apologizing profusely out of political correctness. His most likable feature: he's a former volunteer firefighter/EMT.Don't get this book for a real gearhead or for someone who will not appreciate philosophical ramblings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truck is Mired in the Muck on a Slow Trip through NoWhere","review":"This reviewer was born and raised, and still alive and quite well, thank you, in the Midwest - so the following is not a biased Coastal PutDown of \\"the FlyOver:\\" and maybe that's my problem with this book - maybe Perry can dazzle them that ain't here with a bucolic (and false) (and misogynistic) (and meandering) (and portrayal of locals-as-Green-Acres-TV-caricatures) sense of a peaceful, pastoral life out here in the hinterlands.

The editions are identical except for the physical size of the book and the font size, but I find the larger (standard) print size is much easier and much more convenient to read. A LITTLE knowledge can be a dangerous thing, and this book is NOT for you to be-your-own-doctor, but if you read in this book relating to your own specific medical issues and/or concerns you should have a better understanding and should be able to discuss your own health issues more intelligently with your health care providers, i.e be a 'better' patient.

Other guides were losing me if they tried to show me how to do anything more complicated than single stitches. That was not the case with Crocheting in Plain English. The title does not lie. I was doing complicated stitches in a relatively short amount of time. I also like the stories that accompany some of the stitches, and there are plenty of pictures to give you ideas on where to take your next project.

Most true beginners, however, will need more detailed diagrams (if only to check that what they are doing is correct).I can't testify to the helpfulness of this book to more advanced crocheters (which is why I gave it two stars rather than one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not quite there!","review":"When I bought this book, I thought it would have good diagrams, good patterns and good advice. It did not have any of the above. Miss Righetti sounds too matronly, always talking about \\"mother nature\\", \\"foremothers\\", \\"She\\", meaning God.

This version is definitely the one to watch. Not perfect by any means, the Robert Redford, Sam Waterston, Bruce Dern, and Mia Farrow version essentially captures the subtext of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel of the vapid lifestyle of the rich before the 1929 crash. Thanks to a superior script by Francis Ford Coppola and great acting by the entire cast, the meanning of Fitzgerald's novel become very clear without overstating the obvious. This film is a perfect companion to any discussion of the novel. Reviewers who cannot see what Gatsby sees in the flighty Daisy miss the point of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely Unfaithful to the Book","review":"Though many of the characters' lines are taken directly from the book, they are often incomplete or in the wrong order. This destroys some of the thematic statements made by F.S. Fitzgerald in the novel, on which the film is based. These themes, such as money, the American Dream, friendship, hypocracy, dishonesty, and carelessness are severely lacking in the film. In some cases, these subjects are present, but are shown in a different way than they were in the book. Many of these themes are almost totally absent, and wouldn't be detectable unless one read the book first, which is highly reccommended.Read the book, rent the movie, experience its shortcomings, then return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Gatsby","review":"The Great Gatsby ended up being, not so great. I am a movie fanatic and found this to be one of the most boring films I have ever saw. I literally caught myself dozing off at times during this movie. I don't think that they should have had Redford or Farrow playing Daisy and Jay. They should have had new faces to play the parts, people who would have actually cared about the movie. The best played character in the movie was the store owner Wilson. He was very dramatic and the only one who kept me awake. Nick and Tom were also well portrayed. I wouldn't waste my money on this film if I were a viewer and I wouldn't carry this film if I were you Amazon.com, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all impressed by this adaptation","review":"I am a high school student and just finished reading and discussing F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby'. The book is wonderful. This movie is not. First, the movie does NOT stick to the book well, at times, extra scenes were added which did not add to the overall plot at all. In fact, it just made the movie seem frightfully dull. The actors, as well, were not well picked. I especially was displeased with Mia Farrow as Daisy. Robert Redford did possess Gatsby's good looks, but lacked the charm and mystique that was so important to his character. Why the two stars instead of one? Howard da Silva's very short appearence as Meyer Wolfsheim. At least they got something right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great take on a classic","review":"The movie was well produced.

It's like some cheap romanse, and even worse, with this flat character of Daisy by Mia Farrow, who seems not to know the difference between \\"acting\\" and \\"pretending\\".The rest is played not so bad,but Daisy made me so annoyed...I had to watch it at school,and that was the only reason for which I saw the whole film-otherwise I wouldn't make it to the end.The music is horrible,and the photographies - like those of lonely birds on the grass - made me want to commit a crime on the teacher for forcing me to look at something that disgusting.So, my piece of advice - you better read the book than watch that crap,or you're gonna break down and never be the same again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dialog is so bad, I'd rather hear nails on a chalkboard!","review":"This movie was painful to watch.

I don't think there is a more handsome man than Robert Redford circa 1974."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great.","review":"Great novels shouldn't be filmed. Period. They're not great because of their plots, but because of their style, and writing style is, needless to say, not the same as cinematic style, and can't be duplicated on film. You can't duplicate, for instance, Fitzgerald's description of Nick's first look at Daisy, so why try? It's taken me years to get Mia Farrow's awful Daisy out of my head, and I don't want to dwell on it too much here, but it's not entirely her fault. Daisy only lives and breathes on the page. Mira Sorvino tried hard in the recent A&E version, but it's still an inevitable misfire. (A&E's version is so faithful, though, that it seems like a film of the Cliff Notes instead.) I'll say this, though; the Redford version truncated the narration at the very end, and yet, for a movie, it seemed to end right where it should. If only the filmmakers hadn't shattered the mood with \\"Ain't We Got Fun\\" and prancing flappers behind the closing credits . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Missing Score","review":"I could watch this film over and over, and was delighted to find it at Amazon.com. But I was bitterly disappointed to discover that the original score had been replaced. I would not have made this purchase had I known. With the original score, I'd rate The Great Gatsby 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Yochum - Megan Carone","review":"This is an enjoyable movie for an excellent book. You won't be disappointed by differences in events or entire scences cut out in this movie version of a book. The only differences were how I imagined characters; the book describes the character of Tom to be a very tough strong man, but in the movie he is not. The rest of the cast is perfect for the roles. This movie is an exceptional portrayal of F. Scott Fitzgerald's book.For those who have not read the book (although I strongly recommend it) this story is a great account of the 1920s. It shows the excitement and the fun of that time in American history, as well as a little added drama. From the dress to the extravagant life styles of the wealthy as well as the lower class, it shows us a wide-ranging view of the 1920s. This is an appealing movie from beginning to end, full of events and surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I agree with most of the reviews. This was a great movie, with Robert Redford doing his best. Mia Farrow, well, they could have picked a better actress for that role. Bruce Dern was great and so was Sam Waterson. I sure wish they kept the original Nelson Riddle Soundtrack in the newer VHS/DVD recording. I liked the original that was in the '74 movie, and not the boring one included in the newer video. Why in the world would they do that, can anyone explain that to me? Nelson Riddle got an award for the music too, and yet they nixed it. I would love to hear \\"Charlston\\" or \\"What'll I Do\\", etc., again in this film. PLEASE, PLEASE put back the original soundtrack when making a video tape/DVD of this 1974 movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUSY","review":"\\"The Great Gatsby\\" is one of those books that should not be a movie. Redford is pretty good as Gatsby BUT that's all the credit I can give this horrible addaption of Fitzgerald's classic.

The casting of the film was terrible. Redford did a par job of protraying Gatsby but Farrow turend Daisy to a bimbo airhead that likes pretty colors {watch the flying shirt scene} and Nick was BORING.

The one star in my rating of this video goes to the beginning of the credits, which were very well done. I did not enjoy any of the actors, in particular those playing Tom Buchanan and Myrtle Wilson. He was too sedate, and she was far too melodramatic. The movie as a whole was far too melodramatic, due inpart to the horrendously intrusive music (Watch for Gastby silloetted againt a sunset, and listen to the music; you'll laugh out loud). This movie makes a mockery of possibly the best book I have ever read.

No way I'd accept a replacement from this company. They pass off junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"This adaptation does not do the novel justice. F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterpiece is better left to the imagination. My opinion is not based on the quality of the actors (which was poor in some cases but not all). Rather, I am of the opinion that this movie, instead of focusing on the theme of The Great Gatsby, made the movie more of a soap opera starring Daisy and Gatsby and Tom. This may not be a fault peculiar to this particular film; I doubt that any director could adequately support Fitzgerald's theme. It cannot be conveyed on a film reel.The movie also made the idea of Gatsby's and Daisy's reunion seem too contrived, a problem which Fitzgerald managed to avoid.In short, the actual novel is a better choice than its film adaptation. If you must watch it, read the book first. At the very least do not substitute the movie for the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Hess 5th Period Yochum","review":"I thought that the movie was a good movie for the Great Gatsby. Its vivid pictures and scenes displayed the time period of the book very well. I really got a better understanding of what the parties of Gatsby were like and what kind of character he and the rest of the crew were. I did not like though how they left out some of the parts of the books, which were helpful to understand the whole movie. The actors all played their part very well and all exemplified their character, making it come to live just how i imagined it. The movie was really fun to watch and easy to follow. It is definaltey a movie that everyone should watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware VHS Version Without Original Score!","review":"I too would rate this film MUCH higher if the original musical score was reinstated by Paramount. TV editions still have it, but some music royalty issues scuttled the VHS version, effectively destroying the whole tone of the movie. Without the original film having Irving Berlin's \\"What'll I Do\\" and a few other '20s standards, the mystical, romantic soul of the movie is banished, and what comes across is a shadow of the original production. If there's ever a DVD version, the original soundtrack BETTER be reinstated, since this is NOT the true film otherwise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"It's the best. Don't get the newer made for TV version released in 2000. You'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book Is Better","review":"When I saw this I wanted to gag. Literally gag. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen. With the exception of Scott Wilson's portrayal of the garage owner Mr. Wilson. In this film version it is impossible to feel sympathy towards in any of the characters, it is also impossible to like any of the characters. Sadly, it gets worse. The score (from what I have heard, in this VHS edition was not the one in movie) was way overdone and overblown. With the back acting and score combined I half expected Jay and Daisy to run towards each other across open fields of wild flowers with open arms. Jack Clayton uses the eyes of Dr. Eckleberg too much, and in doing so the movie loses some of the meaning that the book held. The only reason I gave this movie two stars was because the costumes and sets were wonderfully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great Gatsby Movie","review":"I have read Great Gatsby easily 15 times and I think this movie rendition is excellent. What makes it so good is the casting. Redford is perfect as Gatsby as is Farrow as Daisy and Dern as Tom. Waterston is just as I pictured Nick. The music is well chosen and the costuming is superb.

This book is not it.The back cover states \\"Woodruff perfected these recipes ... for more than 60 years as a scoutmaster ...\\"That period is 1929 to 1989, the publishing date.By today's standards, these recipes are dated. My son is a scout, and I have been on a number of scout camping trips - and believe me scouts mostly need simple meals to prepare. But Woody is too much into canned veggies, soups, and packaged mixes. You have to look long and hard to find a recipe in this book that uses fresh ingredients.I suspect that if Woody were alive today, given his obvious commitment to Scouting, he would update most of his recipes to reflect more of today's thinking about healthy eating and fresh food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, perfect book for basic dutch oven cooking","review":"I just ordered this book and found it to be perfect for just starting out with the dutch oven.

I'm glad I purchased this book for learning how to start dutch oven cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A camping cookbook, useless otherwise","review":"This cookbook appears to be a collection of basic camping recipes, all simplistic. If you are looking for recipes to help you learn how to use your new dutch oven at home, this is NOT the book. One reviewer said that it listed oven temperatures. That is true, but they are all 325 or 350. Any experienced cook should know that these are standard temperatures for standard oven cooking. The value of a using a dutch oven at home is SLOW cooking, not standard cooking. That would typically be a 250 oven, not 325 or 350. You do not need a dutch oven to cook at normal home cooking temperatures. None of the recipes are for slow cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"very general and limited book - if youre looking for medical astrology, dont look here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hidden and overlooked gem of a book! Seriously!","review":"I found this book in a Value Village, for 50 cents! It caught my eye because of the title, and I recognized Norman Vincent Peale's name. I have to say, I didn't know what to expect, but I was really surprised at how good it was.Peale comes across as a really interesting, humble man. I felt like he was genuine in his accounts and his faith. I was really inspired when I read this book, and it's helped me with some things I've been struggling with in my own life....To be honest, I'm surprised this book doesn't get more attention (or at least as much) as that other book he wrote (The Power of positive thinking). I think if more people read this one, they would understand the Christian walk, and God's power in their life. It's a GREAT book, and I highly recommend it to people wanting to understand God's heart and love for people.Considering I only paid 50 cents, I feel like I was given a hidden \\"diamond\\".

My only complaint is that the scriptural approach is fairly narrow...so it is very helpful to read the scripture passages in their entirety to establish a context for a fuller and more accurate understanding. But, as it is, it's a thorough personal spiritual inventory that helped me to uncover several areas in my life that needed to change. There are also some great vignettes and stories of martyrs and missionaries...and some church history which is not always pretty.This book is not just for people recovering from sexual addictions, this is a book for any Christian who desires to live a life in full submission to the Lord.

Thanks to state-of-the-art computer enhancement this docuent is blown-up and parts of it can be read. It's nothing short of devastating and the implications rattle the very core of our beliefs.

There's something creepy about dressing like a woman. Some burly men may have no qualms, but I find transvestites, ahh, uncomfortable. I know. It's me and there's nothing wrong with that. In Some Like It Hot, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are cross-dressing to escape some killers. They're not very attractive as women, which allowed me to enjoy the sex identity farce. Farce in America means screwball comedy. If Monroe crawled into my Pullman berth to sleep, hmm -- Lemmon pops one no doubt, and I'm not sure it was in the script if you know what I mean. Then he's swarmed by bunches of scantily clad ladies and the fun escalates. Monroe wears two dresses that give an interesting illusion.

Her performance as Sugar is funny in a tragic sort of way and she can more than hold her own with the likes of Tony Curtis.Jack Lemmon is halarious as Jerry and his scenes with Joe E Brown,as Osgood, are a work of genius. One of my favourites is when Jerry returns from a date with Osgood and announces that they are planning a June wedding, much to the disbelieve of Curtis' Joe.I love Some Like It Hot because its a sweet, harmless, fun movie and I know Ill never get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & White & Blue","review":"Just because a film is black & white doesn't mean that it's not worth getting on blu-ray. Like any film that is somewhat older, it has to be restored properly. Case in point. Psycho, The longest day, Casablanca, All about Eve, and this film look awesome on blu-ray. But others such as Young Frankenstien, Mutiny on the Bounty, and King Kong offer no improvement at all over the standard DVD. When I bought Psycho, the scene when Marion first goes to the Bates Motel, you can see every rain drop on her coat sparkle like little diamonds. So don't be afraid to upgrade some of your favorite B & W DVD's to BD. Just make sure that you read some reviews first about the quality.

I remember watching it as a ten year old on Saturday Afternoon Theatre or the like on T.V. and it was a pleasure to see it without commercials for aluminum siding and the transfer seems great to my eye. My objection is with the special features included. The interview with Tony Curtis contains off-color remarks that could have easily been left on the cutting room floor. I'm not a parent myself, but it's seems a shame that a parent couldn't feel comfortable giving a \\"tweener\\" this DVD to watch and exposing them to a monumental film instead of just more of the same old language and crap that they could see everyday on daytime TV.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richer than even its admirers will allow.","review":"For too long this treasure has been dimmed by the gender bores, who seem to think that a man dressed as a woman is suddenly initiated into the joys of menstruation and pregnancy! I know, it is pretty revolutionary. But from a historical perspective, it emerges as an inspired attack on 1950s conformity, with its celebration of transformation (Wilder's films are always transposed fairy tales) - it is the men who cannot adapt to change, eg Spats, who must perish. The film is set in 1929, just before the Crash, this shadows everything that follows, especially the fact that Osgood is a millionaire. It's also a great gangster film, and the opening scene of a mock-funeral, and the terrifying proximity of our heroes to being slaughtered give the film a metaphysical reach Wilder rarely has. I mean, it's great fun as well, although, as ever with Wilder pacing and self-editing are a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"I like this movie a lot.

Their witty repartee is simply the freshest, sharpest, funniest dialogue ever committed to one film. A huge tip of the hat to Wilder as producer, director and co-writer of this comedy gem. It's a pity the trio could not be reteamed in another film. Their on-screen chemistry is dynamite! Marilyn was never more luminously beautiful or better. Lemmon was just stretching his talented wings and Tony's underplaying is marvelous. Can't leave out Joe E. Brown as a dirty old millionaire! The DVD print is pristine, love the black and white cinematography, and the sound is sharp and clear. But, more importantly, savor two laugh-filled hours of this timeless comedy farce and marvel at the simplistic genius of Hollywood movie-making at its zenith.

At least Wilder learned his lesson & subsequently used Shirley MacLaine, an actress far more versatile talented & attractive, with Jack Lemmon.

I look at all the Peg Pergo systems and for the money this set has everyone beat.I can open and close the stroller with one hand and to open it you use for feet more than your hands, so really you could even hold the baby and open the stroller. It's great to take to the mall, becuase it's small and easy to control. It folds down like a tripod, so you can fit it in any trunk. It drives very smooth. It's lightweight. It's very chic.The car seat is a little heavy. It is very easy to click onto the base and even easier to take off the base. Also clicks on & off the stroller hassel free!The cuphold that attaches to the stroller falls off easily, but it works. There is nit much storage room and no cubby for your keys, so make sure you have a small purse or diaper bag. This travel syetem is not made for someone who wants to pack everything.

We were going to go with the Metro Lite until we saw this one. We thought the Metro Lite was lightweight. My mom had gone with me this time and we are both smaller. She is only 5'3\\". She couldn't believe just how light this stroller is. The stroller is only 19 lbs and the car seat is only 7 lbs. Most of the rest of the strollers were 25 lbs to up over 30 lbs. We didn't have any problems with any of the functions of the stroller either. I guess we may need a few more people to check out this stroller and give more reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pictures, little else","review":"This is basically a \\"coffee table book\\" of pictures of bayonets.

I take my house cat too. The cat bitches constantly until I put Bonnie's All In One Voice CD into the player. The instant Heaven (first song) begins she quiets down and settles in. This is my most favorite album of everything I have. I have several Bonnie Tyler albums but I'd put this group of songs above my Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Emmylou Harris and all. There is not a bad song on the album. This album and Heart Strings I believe to be her two best. I rate All in One Voice #1 and Heart Strings #2."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lighter sound","review":"I am probably the biggest Bonnie fan there is. This is not my all-time favorite album, but it is very different from what she had done until then. it has a lot of irish sound and for a good reason; it was produced by Celtic people. This album is a pretty good album one can enjoy just sitting back and listening to it. it is somewhat smooth and entertaining. The cover to \\"IPut a Spell on You\\" is one of the hightlights of the album. \\"The Rose\\" offers her a wrenching repertoire and a new twist to the song, while capturing the solemn feeling of the original one. This album is a good buy. If you are interested in irish music with a pop/rock twist to it, you might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like crystal: Dense, Clear, Brilliant","review":"At only 50 pages in, I am already locked on. I'ts always gratifying when I purchase a book due to an interview with the author (in this case, the June/July issue of The Door), and find the writing style consistent with his or her conversational style. In the case of Stephen Long, the author seems to have done the heavy lifting in advance so layman that I am, I can follow the direction and intent of the text without stopping to back up too frequently.Also, the subject of Capitalism's dependence on essentially Theological issues for its survival is an extremely exciting idea to contemplate! I expect to purchase more work on this concept and to look up some of Mr. Long's sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite kitchen items!","review":"I bought this for a friend who had visited me and loved mine after using it. I would not be without a butter mill. With the butter mill, there are no chunks of hard butter to spread on toast. The thin ribbon of butter melts on muffins, pancakes and veggies quickly. A ribbon of butter coats corn on the cob perfectly. For those who are on a butter conscious diet, you use less butter because the ribbon that you twist out is very thin and goes a long way. Also, because the butter is contained, it stays fresh and never discolors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading, lots of information","review":"The author is clearly anti-surgery. He repeats this over and over again...a little too often, really. However, his position is backed up by a lot of hard facts.The author definitely favors radiation as a preferred option when surgery is the other main choice. He makes a strong case that radiation has a similar treatment efficacy and fewer side effects. There isn't much in the book about nutritional therapies.I found it definitely worth reading. Most urologists seem to favor surgery as \\"the gold standard\\". However, after reading this book and checking out the research upon which it bases its conclusions, surgery definitely seems to be oversold."},{"rating":"1","title":"five years are up","review":"\\"Surviving Prostate Cancer Without Surgery\\" quotes Dr. Gary Onik, M.D., Cryosurgeon and Director of Surgical Imaging at Celebration Health Hospital, Celebration, Florida, who says: \\"I expect that within five years we will see the death of the radical prostatectomy as a treatment for prostate cancer.\\"Well, it is now 2010, the five years are up and surgery remains the gold standard.

No, he hasn't (although he claims some relatives have had it). Is this author an expert in prostate cancer? No, he's not a surgeon, not an oncologist, not a urologist, he's not even a practising MD.

It's cheaper too, and written with the help of real experts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"This author is on a campaign, a misinformed and poorly written campaign, against prostate surgery which, for many men, is by far the best choice.

His earlier book, Corporation Nation, was a real eye-opener. Now, in People Before Profit, he continues to profoundly illuminate how corporations are shaping the newly emerging global economy. His call for global democracy is well-founded and, best of all, accompanied by concrete proposals for its achievement. If you want to understand how a new world order is being shaped by corporate driven globalization, this is easily the single best book to read.

I bought this novel at the airport, read it on the plane, and still find myself tempted to copyedit it and send it back to the publisher with red pen markings aplenty. Folks who watch CSI are smart enough to want books that are intelligently crafted and carefully edited.

The first time I used it, I realized what a poorly made product this is. My camera (Canon 20D) would not fit snugly on the base and easily moved around. Then, one of the hinges fell completely apart and I had to search in the carpeting for the small screw holding it together.Even after putting the hinge back together, the hinges will not operate well. Like the another reviewer said, the concept is great, but it is truly not worth a nickle. I also own the regular Stroboframe Flip Flash Bracket. That works great, and I have gone back to using that. It's just awkward to pack in my camera bag since it doesn't fold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly crafted - Piece of crap","review":"After using this on just a couple of shoots the joints started to fall apart and some of the screws just fell out.

Until hearing Polyansky's & Hillier's recordings I thought to myself while listening to (other) recordings: \\"Nawww... this CAN'T be the best recording of Rachmaninov's Vespers!\\" lol but this one really caught my ear. I like the sound of small(ish) chamber choirs much better than big ones (like Robert Shaw's) & the performance is very fluid, basses \\"rise from the centre of the Earth\\" (as some other review said elsewhere) but aren't muddy & the soloists really get into it. In particular Iris Oja on \\"Blagoslovi Dushe Moya Gospoda\\" (track 2) sounds like he's practically crying for the whole thing.

At ONE CENT, it was OVERPRICED!The front cover of the disc (not visible here) warns the unwary that all of these great old tunes are modern-day re-recordings. It seems all that was necessary in the minds of the producers to label these songs as done by the \\"original artists\\" was that a SINGLE original member of each group needed to be present.Imagine \\"The Beatles\\" with ONLY Ringo there at the recording session, or the \\"Berlin Philharmonic\\" consisting of a roomful of hacks and the original triangle player-- that's about the size of what you get here.Thirty years ago, K-Tel was a label you could trust. These days, it seems all you can trust them to do is ruin your fond memories of classic old Top 40 music. Thanks for nothing, guys!

I find it a little too hard to sit on, and to use it in the car, one has to be a rather short person or have a very tall car. I am apparently too tall, because it brings me up right under the roof of the car, which is not comfortable, plus there was no room for my knees under the steering wheel.

This fine ensemble has surpassed the already World-Class recordings of these same works of Gabrielli by the Phillip Jones Brass Ensemble, the London Brass, and even the fine recordings by the Canadian Brass. Again, I simply cannot say enough about Empire Brass' performances & Telarc's recording methods. Don't hesitate; this is the one Gabrielli disc to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Glory of Sloppy Ensemble","review":"In short, this CD is abysmal. Ensemble precision and togetherness is extraordinarily sloppy, the playing styles from choir to choir do not match at all, balance is abominable (Choir 1 is 'in your face' while Choirs 2 & 3 sound like they're a football fields away), and the most reverberant space in the universe could not hide the fact that Rolf's chops sound fried from the very first note of the CD!! What is Telarc thinking anyways??? Don't they know that it's over???Anyways, if you want a truly great recording of Gabrieli, buy their 1988 release entitled \\"The Music of Gabrieli\\" on Telarc CD-80204.

It's clear when one sees an album like this that the label is just trying to snare the unsuspecting record buyer...but why bother when nobody who's ever heard the original versions would be satisfied with a collection like this? The only thing I can figure is that this is K-Tel trying to capitalize on the recent wave of \\"tribute album mania,\\" and they figure that if they make it cheap enough people won't mind...but if that's the case, say right up front what the album is, instead of trying to fool consumers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"Briefly discusses several sub topics related to the main topic of the book.

Good stuff for those REAL old heads or when you want to put something on and go back. A number of instrumental versions of classic Motown-era stuff, too (\\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\", \\"It's Your Thing\\", etc.).All in all a great funk (or pre-funk record if you want to be specific), but not for people who only know Parliament or Funkadelic.

Thank god I did not see it in the cinema as I would have totally embarassed myself with my laugh.It is a total feel good chick flick, so get your wine, munchies, etc and get rid of your man, invite your friends over and relax. It was not even as predictable as I assumed it would be, unlike the comments above.The things she does to the poor man, are hilarious, so go out and watch it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Funny Movie","review":"There isn't anything groundbreaking or sophisticated about this movie, but it is a good movie nonetheless. Kate Hudson's character is hilarious! I went to see this with one of my guy friends and he was laughing the whole time! :-) This is a good choice if you love romantic comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ACTORS! VERY FUNNY!","review":"A VERY FUNNY MOVIE, REALLY FUNNY!! THE STORY IS NOT TOO REAL BUT THE ACTORS, KATE HUDSON AND THE TEXAN MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY ARE GREAT TOGETHER. WATCH THE MOVIE IF YOU WANT TO LAUGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick Flick Everyone Can Enjoy","review":"How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days is not only a movie women can enjoy, but men as well. It's a humurous love story with an ending you would not expect. It's not your typical girl meets boy, and they fall in love story.Kate Hudson works for a style magazine, and Matthew McConaughey works for an advertising company.They both end up dating one another for work. Kate uses Matthew for her next big story, \\"How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days\\" and Matthew uses Kate to beat out two coworkers in a job by making a bet that he could make her fall in love with him. After everything they put eachother through for work, they end up falling in love.How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days kept my attention throughout the whole movie. I've also found that whenever deciding what movie to watch guys dont seem to mind watching this one, because its humur and unpredictable ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"A chick-flick that even your date will enjoy! My husband and I have watched it several times. If you haven't seen it you should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, shameful movie","review":"Almost unwatchable, so bad it made me angry. The entire movie is Hudson mocking what are cliche chick mistakes in dating. Both lead characters were just total unbelievable jerks and very contrived, and would never recover from the anti-seducing they do to each other. No subtlety, very irritating jokes. I somehow hung in to the end and the one part that was worth watching was the pretend Debeers dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Days in 90 minutes","review":"I love these two. They are free spirits, easy to love, and deliver their performances effortlessly. A lot of their schtick was improv and thus all the more enjoyable. The movie is brain candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Hilarious","review":"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a comedy about Andie Anderson, an up and coming how-to magazine writer whos career is lying in the hands of her next column. It is entitled, \\"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\\", where she is supposed to meet a man and try to lose him by doing all the things that women are not supposed to do in a relationship. Andie meets Benjamin Barry, who is actually trying to make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. As their relationship progresses, Andie realizes that she really does not want to break their relationship, but make it.This was a really sweet, and utterly hilarious movie that I will watch again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Husband Not Only Laughed","review":"..Okay, we've been married for 18 years; however, we not only remember, but we're also still of the opposite (and opposing) genders.I think, in addition to the Monostat on the sink and the Tampax in the medicine cabinet (much funnier for me), what we both found absolutely hysterical were all of the GUYS' takes on the situation. (Especially the \\"horse\\" line with the \\"couples therapist\\".) I can't remember a romantic comedy that channelled the guys in such a true-to-life manner..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great romantic comedy","review":"This movie was a great movie. The best part is watching the two main characters Andie (Kate Hudson) and Ben (Matthew McConaughey) date each other not realizing of the fact that Kate needs to try to dump him for her article whilst Ben needs to provide proof of true love to win his ad campaign. As silly as it sounds I think that the \\"game playing\\" that the two are doing is something that is done in real life and only when you move past the game playing and find yourself head over heels does real love occur...just like Andie and Ben find out in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A date movie for everyone","review":"It was such a good time.

Not a terrible movie at all. I would watch it again if I had too."},{"rating":"1","title":"How To Lose Your Lunch In Five Minutes","review":"I don't know if there has been a more disapointing film in years. I sat for two hours and NEVER LAUGHED. Every funny gag the movie had to offer I had seen in the trailer! Since the advertisment for this film (and I use that word loosley) had been so frequent on television, those jokes were no longer funny. Boring, predictable and stupid. My wife and her mother and sister found it funny so I would say that maybe JUST MAYBE it is a girl thing and I just don;t understand. Still, I found this to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF it was not by that silly ending...","review":"If it was not by that silly ending, maybe my rating would have been higher. After all, both actors tried their best to make this comedy work, a comedy that was flawed from its inception: why would Hudson character need to do that in order to write an article? It would have been enough to interview girls and guys.Anyway, there are a lot of good parts (the \\"Princess Sophia\\" thing is hilarious). Only that bloody ending ruined it all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Alienate Your Audience Within 10 Seconds.","review":"I turned this movie off after about 20 minutes because the prospect of sitting through this whole mess was rather depressing.There is not a single likeable character in this movie. The script is disjointed, shallow, and unengaging. The premise itself makes no sense--what if the \\"Guy\\" in question completely ignores Andie after the first encounter/date? What then?I'd point out specific flawed instances in this movie, but I don't want to put in the effort for such a meaningless film.Don't watch this. There's nothing enjoyable about it at all, and I haven't met a single person who liked it, myself included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I really have to give this one star?","review":"This movie is lame, even for a chick flick. It's bad enough that we men have to be dragged to watch these corny romantic love/mush-fests, but even the \\"romantic comedy\\" genre has been hitting all-time lows lately. This movie was so boring, even my behind fell asleep.It's an old, cookie-cutter plot with a minor twist in it. Kate Hudson stars as a woman assigned to ditch a guy in 10 days. She, of course, does things to irritate him and drive him away, all to no avail. And guess what? Surprise!!!! She falls in love with him. Bet you couldn't see that coming a mile away. This is the long and short of it--it's time for a change, for a new idea. I wish Hollywood would stop reproducing the same movie, with different actors, over and over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrring!","review":"This movie hits a new low for predictability and sappiness. My major problem with the movie was that it was supposed to be a romantic comedy. Unfortunately there were only a couple of funny parts in the entire movie. The actors were cute and engaging but the movie simply failed to entertain. Also, the entire plot could have been covered in a half our sitcom. No need to take 110 minutes to tell this tale. Thank goodness I saw it on an airplane for free and didn't waste any money on the piece of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible.","review":"This movie was one where it is so bad I just had to keep watching it. I almost never post a negative review. But this movie is an insult to anybody's intelligence. Story is insipid. One cliche after another. This movie mashes every cliche together in one. The characters are basically shallow jerks, so it is impossible to feel for them or care what happens. And an otherwise decent cast can not save this trash. It is the McDonald's fast food of romantic comedies. And by the way, there is no comedy. I detected zero jokes. Filled with lame pop music that was obviously not just available cheap, but intentionally produced with an eye and an ear towards the lowest common denominator. One of the lamest of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously silly...even for a light chick flick.","review":"This movie is terrible. Matthew M. s charming as always, but Kate Hudson's tactics for losing a guy are so over-the-top it's embarassing to watch. I love \\"light\\" chick flicks as a good escape, but this one was just a waste of 2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didnt like it","review":"I really didnt like this movie, it is way too predictable, it reminded me too much of the movie \\"Overboard\\" because Kate Hudson acts just like her mother in this. This is nothing more than a date movie. So if you want to go out on a date. Then you can go see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"I rented this movie and I'm glad that I didn't buy it. I've seen Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey in other films and both have done better. I was skeptical of the movie to begin with because none of my female friends have or would have done any of the things Kate Hudsons character Andie did to Matthews character. I felt embarrassed for both Kate and Matthew and wondered if they have really bad agents or just don't know how to pick the movies they will star in. If you decide to see this movie - go into it with extreamly low expectations and you might have a chance of feeling entertained instead of realizing you just lost 115 minutes of your life that you can never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really long two hours","review":"I had never seen a preview for this movie before I went to see it, I didn't even know what it was about. I figured it had to be good though because I really like Kate Hudson (despite the fact that she never wears a bra) and I adore Matthew MacConeghy (despite the fact that I can't spell his last name). The first 45-60 minutes of the movie were pretty funny, after that it really began to drag and I wished it would end. It was sad to see two very talented and attractive actors with such possibility for chemistry, go to waste on such a bad script. I give the movie 1 3/4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"how to lose a viewer in 10 minutes....","review":"0 stars if it were possible...ugh...these people giving this POS 5 stars are so far gone. This movie had no humor in it or characters to care about. Pretty faces in NYC, thas about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Thought It Would Be","review":"I have to admit that this movie went beyond my expectations, which were not high. I'm am giving this movie 4 stars because it took me a little while to get into in at the beginning, and I thought the ending should have been longer. Besides that, I thought the plot was very creative, and not like the usual romance movie where boy meets girl, they fall in love with eachother, and blah blah blah. Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey looked like a match made in heaven, and did the roles very well. I recommend this movie to people who are looking for a different type of romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictible w/ a few good jokes","review":"I saw How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days(which, by the way, is a stupid title) on DVD and found myself laughing once in a while, which is strange for a romantic comedy. I could see the \\"twist!\\" at the end of the movie about 40 minutes before it took place and I thought about half and hour could have been shaved off. Don't spend money on this one, it's forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to, indeed.","review":"Look Kate Hudson was born to be star. Matthew McHonaughey born to be a stud. This movie is uneven and really odd at times, but the card game scene is enchanting and at times so are both of the leads.There are some laughs and some nice moments like I said, but all in all just formulaic romantic-comedy fare. Good, but grows thin.The extras are nice, one of my favorites is the alternate opening sequence, which because there is a formula to these things gave too much depth to the character of Andie (Hudson). Unfortunate, indeed.But really this is a cute movie and will be great background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the movie !","review":"Perfect romantic comedy. My entire family loves this movie and has watched it many times.

This movie is just so realistic. You know, the things that took place in that movie happened to me just last week. And the names! Andie Anderson, Benjamin Barry! Highly imaginative, hugely inovative. And movies like this are rare in todays world. Such an incredible script. I'm blown away.P.S: I'm a compulsive lier. My shrink told me I should warn you that everything I just said was a HUGE PILE OF CRAP, much like this movie. Let's all hope together that it takes less than ten days to stop having nightmares about this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cute movie","review":"I Like this movie very much.

If you've seen any of the previews on TV don't buy it or rent it or anything. You've seen every good part of the entire movies wrapped in a spiffy 30-sec package.Sadly this happens with far too many movies, but this was one of the ones that I've seen that has been most spoiled by the previews.

Yes it has some funny parts, but it is more painful to watch than anything (think Meet the Parents). Do you like watching women tormenting men? Then this macabre movie is for you! And I adore Kate Hudson, but why doesn't she ever wear a bra?!! Just carrying on her mother's torch I suppose. Maybe when your boobs are small showing your nipples thru your clothes is almost as seductive as cleavage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Chick Flick","review":"I was so excited when this one finally came out of the movie theaters and onto DVD.

I could never get past the visit to the guy's family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate Hudson sparkles in this hilarious romantic comedy!!!!!!","review":"Kate Hudson deserves a Golden Globe for this movie!!! She was hilarious, extremely georgous, and totally irresistable!!! See this movie!!!Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) is the \\"How To...\\" columnist in Composure Magazine, which is the fastest growing women's magazine in the country. Her friend got dumped by her geeky boyfriend and she is crying constantly. So, Andie does a report like \\"What Not to Do\\" except she calls it \\"How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days\\". And Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughey) works for a product advertising company, and to get a bigger job, he is on a bet that he can make any woman fall madly in love with him... also in 10 days. So, Andie tries all possible ways to make him run for his life, like being clean and neaty and girlie and stuff like that, which is really hilarious.

The plot starts out with both individuals having an agenda for meeting each other. One who wants a client account and the other wanted to have journalistic freedom to write the kind of stories she always wanted to. There was no chemistry between Matthew and Kate. Despite the fact the movie keeps pushing it. The story was so unlikely that by the end of the movie I didn't care about what happen to either character. Get the Wedding Planner instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh, it was okay, but I've seen better.","review":"This movie, It was kind of funny because the jokes were there, and some women (notice I'm saying some not ALL) would do what Kate Hudson did, and I feel sorry for the charactor ofMatthew M. who had to put up with it.

Predictability and absence of more in-depth context - so much critisized by other reviewers here - to my mind does it's job of making this movie light and funny.Though some scenes and plot are not consistent (e.g.Angie's expectations to write about politics & development while working for COmposure?..), you don't really care after you have laughed so much. MAtthew is terribly sexy, and so is Kate (though she would have benefited from padded bra).I would definitely recommend it for girls' night out or with your partner after a stressful week."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to destroy two careers in an hour and a half","review":"I wonder if they'll wind up together at the end?

It might be the fact that I've seen this movie, or--closer to the truth--it could be that all movies that fall into this genre have the same basic plot, which then means they all have the same ending. The only question is how long these movies can get gullible people to believe that this movie just might end differently. But how could a movie make someone sad? We're trying to escape real life here and pretend that we can still all be princesses and live in fairy tales where relationship issues can be solved in thirty minutes with a last minute effort to stop a flight or chase down a taxi cab on a motorcycle (ahem, this movie)...oops, did I ruin it?

This movie in particular is a sole example of the decreasing talent of those on today's stage. Besides Mcconaughey, who is considered from the better generation, the rest of the actors in this film give new definition to acting that is well below mediocrity. Have the pools of original ideas dried out already? The very point of romance comedies is to have something of which people may be able to identify with, and in this case, nothing portrays reality. The idea itself is inexcusable and the interaction between the characters is more of a cartoon style that is more appealing to little girls.

My kids are very young and will learn quickly, but I purchased this cd because a previous review said their were no instrumental versions, which is the opposite. All of the songs on this cd are instrumental; there are no lyrics with the songs. But this is a great collection of kids songs on a well produced karaoke cd with easy to follow lyrics on the screen.

There are so many projects to make from dolls to give to your daughter to dolls to make for the adult collector. The faces in particular were very well done, I just love love this book! I bought it and there were not any reviews, which for me means I usually do not get a product because I would rather not take my chances getting a book where I can only see the cover, if I really wanted it I would drive to the bookstore which is a bit away, so... taking a chance I bought this book through Amazon hoping it wouldn't stink. Believe me it is really good, I have been making cloth dolls for a few years so I have no idea if it would be too complicated for an absolute beginner, but I think if you are reasonably intelligent you will be able to do these projects :) Happy dollmaking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!","review":"I just finished making the cover doll, Poppy, and she turned outso cute!

It seems like Susan Kramer is the only one whose mind is still clear. Why is her cousin John Kramer acting so strange? You will have to read it and see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I was surprised to see Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni starring in this dark comedy; and I loved it. As a person in recovery, it portrayed realistically the trials of staying sober, albeit in a rather unconventional way. Great movie and I loved the music too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted AA","review":"I love this movie! Having said that, in order to get the subtleness of the subject matter, folks will need to be more than familiar with the issues of addiction and the process of recovery. For someone in recovery and whom has worked on themselves, the movie is a kick and you can bet more bizarre information has come around in 5th step discussions than what was revealed on screen. There will be questions that the content of the movie will raise, but here is where the suggested practice of \\"not taking onself too seriously\\" will fit. This is entertainment - great movie making in fact - but in this writer's opinion, not for general movie watching public. Enjoy, its killer!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie!","review":"Director John Dahl did a wonderful job setting the tone of this film. Great casting, great acting, interesting story, all done smoothly and understated. Ben Kingsley and Téa Leoni are marvelous and create real chemistry on screen. Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Philip Baker Hall and Bill Pullman all put in great performances. This is a film I saw in the theater and immediately decided to purchase on DVD to own at home. The extras make the disk (interviews,commentary) even more worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Re-watchable","review":"I like this movie and its excellent cast. I first read some reviews before ordering and guess what? It's just as good if not better! The best compliment I can give this film is it's the type you'll want to watch again every so often to catch more of the dry (and dark) humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Kill Me","review":"Could not believe how much I really liked this movie! Ben Kingsley is awesome! Keeps an interesting storyline going while showing the true stages of change for an alcoholic. Good movie for a counselor to show clients in recovery if the whole contract killer plot does not bother you! John Dahl came back with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL MIX OF COMEDY AND DRAMA!","review":"'You Kill Me' is one of those films that comes around every so often. You will run through a gambit of emotions watching this great little independent film. Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni are exceptional in their roles, but even small roles by actors (Bill Pullman & Luke Wilson)that usually don't impress me are really good in this quirky, smart and funny movie. It's short, sweet and it has the right amount of comedy and drama for my taste. This is a very good film that should be seen by all movie lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie will kill you with it's boring script.....","review":"Somehow we are supposed to like all the disfunctional human beings in this picture. I can not honestly say which is worse. The lackluster script or the weak performances of Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. There is no one to like here, and you will get sick of it very quickly. Avoid this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious fun!","review":"This is a great under-rated movie. It's hilarious--very tongue-in-cheek. If you like Ben Kingsley or Tea Leoni, you'll enjoy this movie--they both do an exceptional job in this funny--I'll admit odd--movie! It's definitely not for kids though."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining way to learn the AA Steps!","review":"One of the most difficult things to impart to newly recovering alcoholics and addicts are the 12 Steps of AA. This is an entertaining movie that approaches the subject with skill and comedy. Even though the main character is a contract killer who has a drinking problem, the viewer can enjoy watching him work the Steps interspersed with comedic relief. Ben Kingsley plays the alcoholic hit man and with Tea Leoni learning about killing people and the 12 Steps, they make a delightful pair. Throw in Luke Wilson, who plays Kingsley's sponsor and you have a killer (pun intended) comedy with a great message. In life, we all take two steps forward and, sometimes, take one step back; the whole idea is to keep going."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Fans Only","review":"Unless you are a hard-core Roger Corman or Jim Wynorski fan, stay away from this movie, especially the DVD version. It is in 4:3 format, and obviously taken from the VHS tape master. Very, very poor video quality.It's also just a dreadfully boring movie. At just over 80 minutes long, it feels like it's twice that long. You know a movie is bad when the commentary track is more interesting than the movie itself.For those of you who read the previous reviews, and might be interested because you think you are going to see \\"all\\" of NicoleEggert - sorry to disappoint you, but she uses a body double in those scenes. Don't feel bad, though; hopefully I just saved you from wasting your time and/or money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A SHAM! HAUNTING OF HORRIBLE!","review":"Every female in this movie gets naked --EXCEPT NICOLE EGGERT!She has an OBVIOUS BODY DOUBLE and its an insult to all of herloyal fans. What a sham!!! This movie sucked! It WOULD havebeen a cult classic if Nicole and the director/producers wouldapulled their head out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"B movie with skin, great movie in my opinion. A witch burned at the stake comes back years later for revenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever Made","review":"I rented this movie for 99 cents, and I think I was ripped off even at that price.The acting was terrible, the plot predictable and boring. The only thing that I enjoyed was this nightgown that the lead character wore, and even then it was out of place, seeming more like it was there for the \\"skin\\" and to make the character more sexy than for plot development. Edgar Allan Poe was claimed as the person who wrote the story, and he is probably rolling over in his grave, this movie is so horrible! Everything is out of place and/or ridiculous. The lead character hops into bed as soon as she falls in love, which was NOT done at that time. Nudity was frequently done to \\"save\\" the movie, but if this movie were to do that every time this movie needed a boost the characters would be nude the entire way through.Needless to say, this movie stank. If it's not worth paying 99 cents to rent it, it's not worth buying, unless you like to rag on bad movies, which it is perfect for."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LUV THEM!!","review":"I love Prophet Jones & their album. They are destined to become a HUGE success!! One of the members, P.Rowe, already had a song being played here in Tallahassee in 1999....and I'd been in love with that song. So I am so happy to see him out worldwide with this wonderful group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Jams","review":"Love this cd and the compilations of songs. Perfect for any couple. If you are going through it or working your way back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Nice","review":"Next the Volume 2, this is the hottest LP Jay made. Tight beats, ill rhymes. The only real thing I didn't like about this album was that he wasn't to real about the streets in this one. All of his other albums were so GANSTA, but this one was a little soft. The Takeover was a hot song, and I though Jay got Nas REALLY bad with that. But, to be honest, even though I think Jay is a better rapper, Jay got DESTROYED with Ether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"Jay-Z is an okay rapper. He isn't as talented as some, but that doesn't keep him from putting out decent music that most people can appreciate. The beats are okay, the rhymes are so-so, and he added feeling about his family problems in the song Blueprint (Momma Loves Me). However, his attempt to diss Nas ended in disaster. Takeover, Jay-Z's Nas diss, was easily \\"taken over\\" by Nas's response, Ether. Nas's song easily beat both Takeover and Superugly, another Nas diss by Jay-Z. But that is on the sidelines, and it should not detract Jay-Z's success as a rapper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the only one I can appreciate from Jay...","review":"Firstly, i'd like to say i've NEVER liked Jay-Z. He alwayz reminded me of Hard Knock Life and Puff Daddy so I steered well clear of him. A friend bought his previous Roc-La-Familia, which is questionable, but after reading certain reviews on this one I thought i'd give it a shot. I certainly was not dissapointed but my freind who bought RLF was cuz this wipes the floor with it!!I'm not goin to run through the tracks cuz i've got a life but I can say The Rulers Back has to be one of the best intro songs i've heard (ever!), Jigga Tha Ni**a is THE best song (ever maybe!) period and Renegade is a classic Eminem cut. This is not as good as every1 else seems to think it is because a few track lacked in production, Takeover & Girls, Girls, Girls.. Hence 4 stars but this is definately worth your moolaah, even tho I HATE JAY-Z."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is Awesome Baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"What's up! Hey I'm sick of all these bad reviews about Jay-z! He's one of the best rappers out there! With songs like, \\"Girls,Girls,Girls\\", and \\"H.I.Z.O\\" he's awesome!!! So for all you people writing the bad reviews bout' my dawg Jay-z... SHUT UP!!! My fav song is \\"Takeover\\". It's sweet. All of his cd's are just amazing. But this by far is his best. Trust me it's worth that $$$$$$$$$$$$$ in your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old rubbish....nothin' new","review":"Over hyped, over produced and more of the same from the consistently average Jay-Z. Jay-Z to give credit where credit is due is probably the king of the one-liner. But if you have heard one of his self indulgent, self obsessed, egotistical rantings over a well produced but boringly over-produced beats. The track featuring you know who is probably the main feature of the album but if you don't get a migrane afterwards from the annoyingly unnecessary bleeping then you are immune to migranes and will never have one as long as you live. In Renegade the multi platinum, multi millionaires address the haters. If you're that rich and that successful why care? Don't get me wrong this album is okay but if you want something more challenging and quite simply remotely interesting, you're looking in the wrong place."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could make this record...","review":"...there's really not much to some of these \\"rhymes\\".Hizza nizza wizza uzzo huzza tizza fuzza!Nick knack fack tizza see-ya funtin A.K!Remember when rap music was all about rhyming actual words? This seems to be the record that legitimized the practice of just making up words and not even justifying this with a half decent delivery.This record is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expecting everything, getting nothing","review":"With a typical Jay-Z CD, you can putt it in and let it play without skipping a single song. With the Blue Print I found myself skipping every other song. After an extremely corny single of H to the Izzo, I found myself listening to a bunch of extremely corny songs with retro beats. Jay-Z appears to have gone soft on this one. The only decent songs seemed to be the takeover, Hola'Hovito, Girls,Girls,Girls, and Renagade. Jay-Z normally sounds hot next to a weak rapper like Memphis Bleek, but on the song renagade you really hear just how average he really is. Overall 4 good songs out of 13 is completely unacceptable for Jay-Z. I don't advise anyone to buy this record. Sorry Sean, better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously Far From the Greatest of All Time....","review":"Nice try at a title that hardly describes the album. I must give Jay-Z credit for having some nice sounding beats and some nice \\"pop\\" sounding songs. But I honestly cant beleive that Amazon put this album in the Hardcore Gangster Rap section. This album is very far from hardcore. Jay-Z doesnt have much when it comes by way of rapping on hardly any of his albums. A lot of the tracks on his albums just get radio play because of the smooth beat and nice chorus. No lyrical skills what-so-ever. I give Jay-Z one star for at least attemtping to make a gangster album, but missing by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay z is trash...","review":"I can't belive diz nuggaz like gay man!!! If you listing t diz homo then you might as well listing to backstreet boys and such.Anyways, as for jay z's \\"The Blueprint\\" goes, its wack and his lirycs aren't even good or nuthing. To me, all the songs either got weak beats or terrible rap from gay z. The song \\"take over\\" wasn't even good or nearly being a good battle song but do check nas's \\"ether\\" which blows \\"the take over\\" out the water...On the real. Jay z is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a hater","review":"Now i'm gonna give this cd 2 stars, but dont look at me like some of the other cats who gave it 1. If u look at their review its just BS. Most of them are Nas lovers(i dont know y), or rap haters. I am NOT that!I wouldcopp a cd if i gave it 3 stars, but 2 means i can't listen to it. In the Blueprint's case, the beats suck.He gets 2 stars for being the best rapper, but production does matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved tha new Jay-Z","review":"Tha album was good. I liked bout 5 songs but my favorite one is number 13. Tha song is a deep one about his mom. On tha last one it was 16. Buy tha album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay- Z","review":"I thought this cd was pretty bad. Half of the words were beeped out!! And none of his songs have meaning, it's just all rap. These days anyone can get into music business. But I just want to say don't buy this cd, it's awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terse Comment","review":"I never bother with music like this but I just heard (and really listened to) 'Girls, Girls, Girls' for the first time and I feel the need to say something. Harold Cruse comes to mind, \\"If Blacks do not completely re-organize culturally, politically and economically, they will not survive regardless of what changes America undergoes. That quote says it all. The reviews below fascinate me. Black people's minds have been constructed to think this is who they really are.P.S. This is the most sexist, misogynistic song ever made. This cd is an affront to any sensient Black person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jigga Controling the Game","review":"Jigga's back and on top again!!! He drop one every year and it seems as if he just gets better. Definitely the hottest album of the year!!! He takes his state of mind back to his Reasonable Doubt days and dimisses all thought that he's just a flashy jewels rapper. Nas and Prodigy get a piece of his mind in the \\"Takeover\\". The only guest apperence on the cd is made by Eminem on \\"Renagade\\" and if you listen to it you'll see why. He keeps bumppin in the whip with hot beats like on \\"Hola' Hovito\\" But my personal favorite is \\"All I Need\\" There is something for everyone on this and its already at classic Status. A must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blueprint Is The Latest Classic","review":"Three years since 5 mics but it was well worth the rating it got in the Source. This album doesn't have a weak point. It starts off and finishes solid I have had this album since the day it dropped and it hasn't any appeal yet. Go get it if you still don't have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"this is another hova classic plan and simple, he really surprised me after that dynasty album, i definitly think he did his thing on this joint from start to end all of the tracks are hot"},{"rating":"2","title":"The bomb, but could be better","review":"The Blueprint is ill, but it has too many samples, just like In My Lifetime Vol.1. \\"Renegade\\" is the best song, but mainly because of Eminem, who continues his reign as show-stealer. Also, it seems like that even Hova is bored with himself, and that's when he goes back to biting Snoop and Biggie lyrics. Other than that, he has redeemed himself from the Life and Times of S. Carter days. Yet if he were to wait for more than a year to create an album, he could be able to make another classic. P.S. The only dudes that call this album a classic are the jock-riders from New York."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song rocks!!!","review":"The title pretty much says it all!!! if your a true hip-hop fan jay z iz ya man. His lyrics throughout are complete genius on such songs as U dont know, Takeover..... well all of them are!!!!!! Just buy this album. YOU HEARD ME. BUY THE DAMN ALBUM!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pickup","review":"This is a tremendous album with great vocals and beats behind Jay-Z. The song \\"Takeover,\\" which highlights Jay-Z's climb in the music industry is a great song. While it's heavy, the album has other songs like \\"Heart of the City\\" and \\"Song Cry\\" which contain beautiful chorus verses supporting Jay-Z. A necessary complement to this album is definitely his MTV unplugged album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but no Stillmatic","review":"I've always liked Nas more than Jay and Jay's latest hasn't made an exception. While Stillmatic never had a track I skipped over, this has a few that aren't needed. Takeover is great, but Ether crushed it, Izzo's a real good partyin' song, Girls, Girls, Girls...well...it's all about girls...Song Cry is another high-point when Jay finally gets into a little more meaningful stuff. Buy this album if you're near it at any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn","review":"This LP right here is one of the hottest joints from last year! Since 'REASONABLE DOUBT' some have said that jigga fell off, this album is the one that will set the critics straight. From 'THE TAKEOVER' the God-MC murders QB's Finest members: Nas and Prodigy among others (buy this album just 2 hear jay burn these 2). From here things only get better. with the likes of 'SONG CRY' and 'HEART OF THE CITY' Jay z is the only rapper who can make 'CHICKsongs' that will get the nastiest thugs bumpin they heads.When you 1st hear 'RENEGADE' be prepared for the 1st feature artist on the album: EMINEM... Lyrically this is one of the finest rap tunes ever produced.BUY THIS FOR YOUR OWN SAKE..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that","review":"I have to say when i bought Jay-z's album 'hard knock life' it was hot. I hadn't heard nothing like it in a long time so i looked forward to 'Blue Print'. I hated it straight away. It was the same old thing. Jay-z talking about how hard life was in the Ghetto and how he's living it up now and how much women he's got. Lets face it he's not the best looking thing and women only like him because he's got money.The beats are the same. You can't feel the music like hard knock life. The man can't rap to save his life and he's toooo boastfulH.O.V.A, and Renegade is about as good as it gets and Neva Change. Take my advice, Ja Rule is where it's at. Get his album, Jaz-y's finished"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold but good","review":"Wow. Jigga did it right. Despite possible conflict with fellow rappers DMX and Nas, Jay-Z's new joint comes unwrapped blazing. Its a strange mix, of well...unique tracks. Renegade is a great track, and Eminem is raw, yet its kind of sad trying to hear Jay-Z keep up with Em's lyrical flavor. Go for track 2,3,5,7,8,12. All great stuff. Izzo is a pop single, check that out too. A bold ove by jigga, but it worked for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay-Z at his best","review":"Everywhere I talked to people about Jay-Z, they told me Reasonable Doubt was his best cd. I disagree, I think The Blueprint is. His rhymes as always, are amazing, he could probably rhyme in his sleep. The production was awesome too, especially on songs like Jigga My Nigga and Hola' Hovito, and not to mention the Eminem assisted Renegade, which happens to be my favorite song on the cd. That's all I really have to say hopefully this review helps you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much mo' smoother wit this one! Blueprint sumthin diffrent!","review":"i cant get over how Jigga gets better wit his rhymin and new production wit Kanye West on most cuts. he brings tha classic beats back but a lil betta (which is nyce). this ones very smoother than his other albums but comes back hard! 2 bad i like hard rap but i keep comin back to Jigga. Jus my fava cuts are w/Trackmasters-Jigga that Nigg@ (bouncy!), Timbaland-Hola Hovito (changes tha game!), and tha one and only Slim Shady-Renegrades (hardest colabo eva!!!).

He's ok as a rapper though i like alot of people over him. But this cd is worth buying i won't lie i have the bootleg and so does everybody in my school but i like it so much i will buy the actually cd nah sayin.Every song is tight on their the only thing wrong and it's a good thing to is that he only makes one collabo on their thats emienem. one i'm holla"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This album is banging. Each song could have been a single. You know you are never dissappointed by Jay Z!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOVA'S FINEST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think that this is Jay-Z's best album to date. I have been listening to this one over and over and I don't have to skip over any songs like I have on his previous work.

YOU WANT OLD SCHOOL STRAIGHT UP BRAGGADOCIO, ITS HERE. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FOR THE PLAYER IN YOU ITS HERE(GIRLS,GIRLS,GIRLS). IF YOU WANT INTROSPECTION FROM THE LIFE OF A \\"BORN HUSTLER\\", CHECK \\"BLUE PRINT\\". AT THE END OF THE DAY JAYZ IS THE COMPLETE MC. IT IS MIND BOGGLING THAT WHEN MOST MC'S ARE COASTING MERELY ON THEIR NAME OR CREW AFFILIATIONS HE IS STILL PUSHING THE ENVELOPE.THE ONLY LIGHTSPOT IS THE LEAD SINGLE AND THAT IS SO INFECTIOUS THAT YOU FORGET IT IS ONLY ABOUT 24 BARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM IS SOOOOOO HOT!","review":"I can honestly say that I like every song. This album isn't for the novice Hip-Hop fan. The lyrics on the Blueprint is on another level. Jay-Z definately pull out all the stop for this one. Without a doubt the best album out in a long time. Some hot tracks to look for are:The Ruler's BackTakeoverIzzoJigga My N****Hola HovitoHeart of The CityNever ChangeRenagadeto be honest, all of the tracks are good. This album is a should be bought by every Hip-Hop fan and a MUST HAVE for the true fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.O.C. Runnin this rap.........","review":"Jay Z is the best lyricist in the game..period. This album is a 5 star classic. People need to stop comparing this album to Nas' and just look at it as an album by itself. Plus, this album blows away Nas' Mediocrematic anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay's Dopest Release.","review":"This is one of the greatest hip-hop albums concieved in a long time. Jay raises the bar for lyricists and emcees will have to worker harder on their flow if they will ever reach the pinnacle that Jay is at.My favorite joint is \\"Take Over\\", besides 2Pac's \\"Hit Em Up\\", this is the hardest diss song ever.Other hot ones include \\"Renegade\\", \\"Ain't No Love\\", \\"Hola Hovito\\", and \\"That ... Jigga.This album has everything that a classic album should. Pick it up as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter trash...","review":"What happened to 'Reasonable Doubt' or 'In My Lifetime Volume 1'? Those were dope albums. This release is Jay's worst and proves that not only has he sold out to a more pop style it proves he's fallen off alot as well. And he has the nerve to diss Nas for fallen off? I don't think he should be talking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gulity!","review":"Hip Hop is stuck in a rut and Jay Z is part of the problem. There's a reason why the biggest artists sell most of their records to 16 year old white kids from the suburbs who listen to their cd's in daddy's car-it's because it's a cliche. Just like this music. Tired,old and boring. It may not be as obviously lame a cliche as Fat Joe or Ja Rule but sill...When you get to heart of the matter, a \\"big\\" band like Outkast (one of the few big artists that are really creative and mostly cliche free-yet that Scooby Doo song lowered my opinion greatly) runs circles artisticly around Jay Z while groups like Black Eyed Peas, De La Soul, Atmospere and the Roots just put him to shame.To SHAME. Show me the difference between Jay Z's Girls,Girls,Girls and Motley Crue's. Both are just as empty..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Jigga I mean really","review":"First off people who like jigga are the same people who like the New york Yankees. Jay-Z does the same thing now the Yankees do. What they do is buy themselves greatness using money or their name. I hope these same people really judge this album by tru hip hop and not the Jay Z name someday. Second the production was what I expected.It was good cuz other people did it, but his lyrics have to be the weakest in the business hands down. He has no punchline in his lyric and no uniqueness. Listen to this album and that's proof enought to not get it. Most of the songs are a mess lyrically and he gets by by buying the best beats and spittin these horrible lyrics and mellow people will flock to buy the album. Recognize real talent not these fakes like Jay Z."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album is BOOTY","review":"Once again, Jay-Z has produced another boring, mootone, and dry album. Every song is cliche filled or has a verse or two that has been bitten from another emcee. It's commercialism is perfect though. With choruses that my lil sister enjoys singing and plenty of club hits to keep the girls backin that thang up. If you're lookin for true gangsta ish, pass this one up. This is not one hardcore song on this album. It is pretty tame and i would recomend it as a christmas presnt to the young ones. If you have any education though, you'll be disappointed if you buy this for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" eminem murdered on your shi** \\"","review":"this album is technically good but i wonder why jay-z uses a sample in 95 % of the songs he make? he never tried to do his own stuff, there is one song here that doesn't use a sample from other song, i mean this is good and really bad,let's talk about the album.\\" takeover\\" you all heard this, while most of it is tue,it's a bad move for jay-z to diss Nas, since jay-z sampled nas's voice on some of the songs he made, so Nas killed jay-z on \\"ether\\"and the album, there some catchy tunes here, \\" heart of the city\\" has a catchy hook, but again it samples other song chorus, in \\" renagade\\" eminem kills jay-z, he difinitly outshines jay-z, just like Nas said, \\" eminem murdered you on your own shi** \\"lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressive","review":"I feel that I am a true hip-hop fan, unfortunatly I was not impressed with the new release from Jay-Z. I only found about three of the songs listenable while driving around in your car to work or back from the club. When I listen to a c.d. the beat is as important as the lyrics. Hopefully, jay-Z will get it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the HELL is this!?!","review":"What is this crap? The blueprint is straight BOO BOO!! Being the hardcore Jay-Z fan i am, I wanted to cry when I heard this cd. The Blueprint 2 sucks two. I have every Jay-Z cd but these too. Please bring back the old Jigga. Oh and stop sayin \\"Yep\\" and \\"Hovi's Back\\". Where the hell did you go?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay-z Blueprint","review":"Normally I am a fan of Jay-z, but this ablum makes me wonder if he is more worried about the number of cd's he will release \\"In his lifetime\\", rather than the quality of his music. At first I couldn't believe he released IZZO as his first song off the ablum, but after listening to the ablum many times I realized that it is the only song anywhere close to decent. Every song off the ablum just seems to be thrown together. The hooks are weak and his lyrics are just plain old. If you want to be lulled to sleep by the same old stories and...beats, then this is the ablum for you. Just remember that when you buy this cd, you are doing exactly what he wants people to do and that is make him go platinum. That way he will have something to brag about on his next cd. which will probably be released later this year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"amazed at His Popularity?","review":"Jay-Z Aka Lay-Z to me still is riding on most of His Same themes&topics but hey if it ain't broke don't try to fix it huh?no matter who He brings to guest on His Albums He still gets all the attention but nothing has really changed on His Albums.His first Album had Promise but after that He is a Corperate Rapper with little new to offer&He is all that Matters on His Own Label so it makes sense that He has to rush out so much Product so soon because His Material doesn't Hold up like it should.Lyrics are Predictable He just uses a real basic Groove&His Rapping Style can put you to sleep.I don't get the Lay-Z Opps Jay Z Hype??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This album is truly amazing. Every song on here is amazing... the only drawback is that Jay-Z features Eminem on one of his songs... Eminem can't rap and shouldn't be featured on any CD... Now to settle things about the on-going Nas, Jay-Z war... in my opinion, Nas has better flows but Jay-Z has way better beats... also, Jay-Z has put out so much more work... Nas' stuff just isn't as ill as Jay-z's.. period. If you want a prime example of Jay-Z at his greatest, go get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic #3","review":"This is the best album that I have heard in a long time. Out of fifteen songs(two hidden tracks), fourteen of them are scorching hot. There are not a bunch of guest appearences, just a tight MC at his best. Jigga brings the pain as if he is an hungry MC instead of an accomplished artist. This album can convert the biggest Jay-Z hater into a devoted fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely worth 5 stars","review":"at first i didn't feel this album as much as everyone else, but i listened to it a few more times and it grew on me. this is the realest album jay-z has done and maybe his best, and just recently got 5 mics in the source. best album of 2001 by far, so pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of 1996's Reasonable Doubt, No Doubts","review":"Once again Sean Carter has released a CD to throw the rap game for a spin. The flow and whole vibe of The Blueprint takes us back to 1996, when Jay-Z stepped into the rap arena with Reasonable Doubt. The best track on this neo-classic effort would have to be Takeover, on which Jay-z answers his detractors while the sample from the Doors Five To One blares in the background. Jay-Z's production teams earn their money and always have, he stays on the cutting edge and has proven that anything can be samopled and made to sound new all over again...remember The City is Mine, or Hard Knock Life? Rap enthusiasts must share in thanking whaterver or whomever it was that convinced this brother to drop more than one album and blow out of the game. And oh yeah Jay, \\"No you are not better than B.I.G., but you are the closest one\\". keep it coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jigga's Gettin Better","review":"You know what I enjoy Jigga! He has some great songs like Watch Me, Change the Game! .... only a couple good songs! But this cd has amazing beats and a nice flow! There's only one thing that makes this whole album! And that is in most songs he has little kids singing stuff! It should be all gangsta rap! That's what he needs to do!~ something that would make you want to put it in your ride and bump like Redman - Let's Get Dirty! I compare this album to the single Kurupt - It's Over! He's gettin better! at least no bling bling in this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is too over rated","review":"This cd is too over rated for 1 main reason. Jay-z fronts about what he has done and what he does in the hood. Let me clear the air around hurr, HE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE QB, NAS DOES.The only thing that i did like about the cd were the beats. He has some bangin beats but the lyrics lack the truth. Eminem even disses him on his on song. Bottom line, download it off the net and burn it because you might be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Overshadowed by the September 11th attacks the blueprint quickly became a huge hit for jay-z staying on the charts for weeks. the blueprint combines soul samples and hip-hop. which earned jay-z street crediblity on both cases. But on the contrary this is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay-Z returns to form","review":"Prior to \\"The Blueprint\\", Jay-Z had released a number of albums that failed to live up to the standard set by his debut, \\"Reasonable Doubt.\\" Although his arrogance is still annoying at times, Jay-Z delivers some of his best lyrical performances on \\"The Blueprint.\\" Whereas some of Jay's other albums have been watered down by guest appearances, \\"The Blueprint\\" only features Jay-Z, with the exception of an overshadowing performance by Eminem on \\"Renagade.\\" This album isn't quite the masterpiece that \\"Reasonable Doubt\\" is, but it definitely has a consistency that Jay-Z had seemingly abandoned after his debut. Despite the commercial singles on this album (and his corny battle with Nas), \\"The Blueprint\\" is definitely worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fire coming out of ya speaker","review":"As a devoted Jigga fan, this album was everything and above what I expected. Every track from beginning to last consist of stellar production with complex rhymes. Jay shows off his wide array skills and versatillity with backshots at Nas(Takeover), radio cuts(I.Z.Z.O), emotional wordplay(Song Cry). Highlights include \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\", \\"Never Change\\", and is topped off with \\"Renegade\\" which in my opinion CONTAINS HIP-HOP'S GREATEST VERSE OF THE PAST 10 YEARS by Eminem. Even the bonus tracks would be leads for the next rapper. Jay has been called commercial, but who ever says that ain't listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC","review":"This is definitely Jigga's best album, and the best east-coast rap album since B.I.G.'s Ready To Die in '94. This album has everything you want in a rap CD. It's got great lyrics, good beats, gangta songs, slow songs, etc.1) Ruler's Back- 3/5- Not bad.2) Takeover- 4/5- Diss to Nas & Prodigy3) H To The Izzo- 4/5- First single of album4) Girls, Girls, Girls- 1/5- Stupid song5) Jigga That Nigga- 5/5- Great beat and lyrics.6) U Don't Know- 5/5- Totally gangsta.7) Hola Hovito- 3/5- Pretty good beat.8) Heart Of The City- 5/5- Awesome lyrics.9) Never Change- 4/5- Good lyrics.10) Song Cry- 5/5- Sad but good.11) All I Need- 3/5- Not bad.12) Renegade- 5/5- Great. Features Eminem.13) Momma Loves Me- 4/5- Good lyrics.To all y'all Jay-Z haters out there, Hova's the king, whether you like it or not. Nas ain't sh** compared to Jigga, just dirt off his shoulder."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Reasonal Doubt about this one!","review":"Shawn Carter is back to the ol' Jay-Z. He reminds everyone on this album that he reigns as the best at what he does, and that's constant delivery of lyrics! Personally, I wandered away from Jigga because he became so commerical, but I have to say that he took it back to the Reasonable Doubt hunger that he once had! I love the way he calls out names on this album because so many rappers and MCees be hatin and politicin on Jigga for what? In my opinion, It's Envy! Don't get me wrong, Nas is nice and has been nice, but for him to scoop to the level of Memphis Bleek which Jay needs to dismiss, really disappointed me! On the album my favorite cut is Renegade feat.Slim Shady. The beat and the lyrics by both artists were blazin! Get the album y'all! U won't regret it, Ya Herd Me Holla!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?!","review":"I admit, I kind of abandoned Jigga after Reasonable Doubt, but when I first heard some songs on the Blueprint, I was going to pay attention to him again. Then I started hearing of the Jay-Z/QB beef going on. After that, I heard the first version of \\"Takeover\\" that attacks Mobb Deep. When I listened to the final version, I heard he added a verse about Nas. After that, he almost lost all of my respect, but has only an ounce of it left. If it weren't for \\"Takeover\\", it would have been at least a 4 star album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the music?","review":"Great music was created in 60's as we grew up and moved beyond what our parents were listening to. With open mind, I try to listen to rap and I just don't see the point. Background is always the same, voices are almost the same from one album to the next. A sentence doesn't go by without an obscene statement. I try and try to hear something that will move me to a new realization but it can't be found. I can almost sense that the genre can move to a new place with the help of a genuine musician but I haven't seen that musician as yet. Jay-Z isn't definitely the one. I don't care about how much he makes and how many women he knows. To me, he, like the others is nothing special, just a passing noise in the long life of great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I worth if I don't go after overrated rap?","review":"GUYS, I DISCOVERED THE MOST AWESOME THING!!!!

Buy this cd. I'm not sure what to say, this is just an instant classic. This album alone puts jay up at the top, as the king, not just of NY, but of rap today. This is just an excellent, excellent, album...I can't describe it, the first time you listen through, and everytime after that is the same. It leaves you in awe, and this album is up there with Illmatic, Enter the 36 chambers, Ready to die, All eyez on me..I can't say enough good things about this cd. Just five words, and I've said them already... but their worth saying again. THIS ALBUM IS A CLASSIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made For MTV Hip Hop","review":"I've never had a problem with JayZ until the beef with Nas started. Now, I've heard both Stillmatic and Blueprint and I've found that where Stillmatic is strictly Hip Hop, Blueprint is more Hip Pop if you know what I mean. JayZ makes sales, yes. He knows how to make hits, yes. But... I don't know. I've never seen Hip Hop as just that. Don't get me wrong, I bopped my head hard to some of the songs on the album and smiled enigmatically to Girls Girls Girls but the only song on the album that made me rewind selecta was Song Cry. This is really the only song where you feel you're listening to something that has substance. Other than that the rest of the album is forgettable. And yes.. I did forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"the blueprint of hip hop","review":"i love this cd, jay z is finally matching tight rhymes with tight beats, whole cd banging please jigga fans unite and throw ya damn hands up that's the anthemn, izzo."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD's so damn GOOD!!","review":"When I heard that Jay-Z was coming out with a new album, I was totally psyched cuz Jay has always had awesome songs with great beats and lyrics. I immediately bought the CD, and I was not definitely not disappointed. The CD's really good with tight songs. The Blueprint has been in my cd player ever since I bought it cuz i can just listen to the songs over and over again. My favorite songs are 2 - The Takeover, 3 - Izzo, 4 - Girls, Girls, Girls (even though the version on number 13 is better,) and number 12 - Renagade (feat. Eminem)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classical album from (The Certified King Of Hip Hop)","review":"Jiggaman is the illest out there in the rap game.

Good battle rhymes for Nas to swallow but a subpar effort nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Admit it!","review":"Yo son! jus admit that jigga lost to Nas. Takeover wasn't betta than Nas's Ether.

While Jigga does have the talent to create great hip hop, people are still feeling the Dynasty and there was no need to come out with the Blueprint, especially when it is probably one of his worst albums.Every song here sounds like he has either already released it on another album or was left out of some of his previous work. Every song has some whiney voice on the background with a piano, there is no diversity here (except for biting The Doors \\"One in Five\\" for \\"Takeover.\\")I think that if he took his time on The Blueprint it could have been something so much more than what is being released today. His next album should definitely be something different than this, and maybe that would occur if he didn't rush through them so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blueprint waste of money","review":"[Jay] z his album is wac his come back to ether was horrible nas killed him.

The beats are pretty tight for the most part. Out of 13 joints---3 cuts I just can't stand--and the others are pretty much on point and worth listening to. I'm feelin' \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\"--the beat change-up is bangin', \\"Song Cry\\" is nice, and \\"Blueprint\\" is hot. Well worth buying---Jay-Z..........arrogance at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pen and Ink","review":"First of all I usually don't listen to rap/hip-hop music. I like R&B. Reading the reviews got my curiosity going. So I got the cd. This is a really good cd. I am surprised! I really don't like Jay Z. I think he flosses too much. But that is just my opinion. This is a really nice cd to add to a hip-hop heads collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"In All Honesty...","review":"The Truth is, this is not only one of the best albums to come out this year, but it may be Jay-z's as well. I know hip-hop heads have come to love the fact that they have a scapegoat in Jay-Z for hating on what we call that wack bling bling stuff, but this album is incredible. It has all the elements of a perfect album, the battle tracks, the \\"Song\\" songs, it's well-rounded. One may dislike the radio hits, but the fact is, Izzo and Girls... are both really good songs, both lyrically and musically, and that's what's missing in a lot of underground stuff out there. So go out and buy a used copy, don't tell your friends, and forget that it's platnium and what not and listen to the songs (With the exception of \\"Jigga That Nigga\\" or whatever, coz that song is pretty wack), the truth is it is a great album!BRILLIANT CORNERS IS GON BLOW UP ONE DAY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"King of NY","review":"This album proves that he is the best out there in the rap industry right now.

Britney Spears used more elements of rap in her songs (Neptunes' beats), than Jay-Z used in his songs. I don't want to say much more about this ... . It's a waste of my time. The only reason i gave this album one star, is the verse from Eminem on \\"Renegade\\".

Jay-Z rips it from track 1 to 13. Even the bonus songs are on point. Jay-Z came back to reclaim his thrown with this one. I mean this album has everything you could ask for. He even strikes back at nas and mobb deep. i mean his disses made me lose respect for them as men and artists. i see why he named this \\"The Blueprint\\" it is what what other artists must follow to have a successful album after Jay has changed the game.

The happy :\\"I feel Love\\"...the sad \\"You are losing me\\"...And the mixed \\"I will be your bride\\"..which begins sadly but have an happy end.

I have read other books by this author and that is why I was surprised that this book is even called a biography. Why was Alexander the Last Great Tsar? -- I still don't know because nothing is mentioned to address this. If you think that this is a real biography, do not buy it. If you are interested in how a small group of people coordinated his assassination - then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets better to the end","review":"This is a difficult book to get into. Some of it is the subject matter and the way it is introduced, and some is the style of the author. He warms to his subject as he gets to the end. Also, unless you are used to Russian names, all the Patronymics and family 'nicknames' can drive you to distraction.Because this book is written by a Russian, it has a totally different bent to it. It takes many more chances with the 'truth' and makes many more subjective guesses as to why things happened the way they did. But this leads to a discussion of the characters pecidillos, which you won't usually find in most \\"European or American\\" historiographies.The subject is well researched and understood, so that you can almost see some of the conclusions coming, and when they do they then tend to make more sense.All in all well worth your time if your interested in how the Revolutions of 1917 came about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Biographical Work","review":"This was a very interesting work by the author.Mr Radzinsky does a phenomenal job in describing the Tsar Alexander II and everything that sorrounded him.It was very interesting to read about Alexander's view of the War in Crimea and against the Turks.Also i think the author does a very good job in capturing the court of Alexander and what was happening in Russia and in St Petersburg and the time of his reign.His account on russian terrorism is very good, altough i think the author dwells too much on int and it takes pages away from the life of Alexander.But, again, excellent work."},{"rating":"2","title":":)","review":"Im still about half way through the book, but I've enjoyed it so far.

The video work is pretty annoying and at this stage in the ELO saga, Jeff Lynne relied heavily on backing tapes during live performances. In Jeff Lynne's Flashback liner notes, he admits that \\"Sweet Talkin Woman\\" was stitched together with a mile of editing tape which makes playing it live at the time completely improbable. A large majority of the other cuts on the video also employ backing tapes.If you're an ELO fan and want to relive the spaceship experience, then it's worthwhile to buy. However, if you want to hear ELO live, I would recommend the \\"Live at Winterland\\" or \\"The Night the Light Went on in Long Beach.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase \\"Zoom Tour Live\\" Instead","review":"While I haven't seen the Wembley show on DVD, I know from the VHS version that the sound is not up to DVD standards, and the video effects look like something from a local cable show (can you say \\"Wayne's World\\").Zoom Tour Live however is incredible!! The lineup may not be the same as Wembley, but with Jeff Lynne at the helm, it is still a show to remember. The songs are fresher, the sound quality incredible, and the cello players are BABES :)If you want to live in the 70's, and like bell-bottoms and the classic \\"hamburger\\" stage, but Wembley... but make sure you buy Zoom as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting...","review":"Well, this dvd has completed my elo collection. I have all their albums and both concert dvds. Having listened to their albums over the last 15 or so years, I always imagined ELO would do an amazing concert.Pros- It's good to see some elo footage from the late 70's and the stage spectacle that everyone talks about. I wasn't born until the 80's, so never saw ELO live. However I did see ELO ptII in 1997 and they were amazing, wish they would come back to Australia.Cons- They lip-synched on many of the songs- Sound quality is poor- Video quality is average, the effects are terrible. However, it was probably acceptable back in the 70s.Like another reviewer said, the Zoom dvd is much better. Neither this nor Zoom are that watchable. Jeff isn't a very interesting performer. Unless you're a big fan, don't bother with this dvd, get Zoom instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the True ELO fan","review":"I agree with pretty much what everyone else has already said. For the true ELO, this is a must. BUT, you will be screaming though \\"Rockeria\\". The video \\"effects\\" during this song were beyond distracting and completely unwatchable. I had to turn my head. Only a hit of acid could probably save it, because I think whoever was doing the effects was on some!! They almost blew \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" with the same horrible effects. With that said, the video gets 4 stars. I would also recommend the \\"ZOOM\\" DVD. The songs are very tight, the audio and video are great. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough way to remember ELO","review":"ELO had great live shows! This DVD has some great stuff on it, but the quality does not live up to the potential. It really does not do ELO proud.

The worst is it often fails to pull the paper from the tray, and gives the error message \\"Paper jam in tray 1\\", although there is no paper jam. I tried different weight papers, but no help. Occasionally, it will pull a page and print. When it gives the paper jam error message, you have to go through a lengthy warmup-calibration, etc. schedule, and then it tries to pull paper and fails again. The bottom line: it is not worth your time, money and frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Door","review":"The product was very easy to install and works very well for our dog to keep the elements out expecially here in the midwest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last","review":"This does not last, it has very flimisy frame. I put mine in in Nov and it broke Christmas Eve! It has a plastic flap that opens with the door on one side and that never worked properly, it would get stuck open half way all the time, sometimes it snapes shut later on the dog when they try to come back in. I called the company and with receipt they will replace or refund, but if they refund what do you do with the big hole in your door if you cant find another door that fits that hole!!! Very disapointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overcomplicated piece of doo doo","review":"Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeell, my journey began trying to find a cat door that was \\"TRULY\\" transparent. In fact, I passed up all the ones at the stores because none of them were truly \\"transparent\\" or \\"Clear / See-through\\", as I like to say. Bought this one because the package depicted \\"clear\\". \\"Transparent\\" or clear to me is like looking through a window. Turns out NONE of cat doors by any manufacturer is clear. They are ALL \\"fogged\\" or \\"opaque\\". Adapting this door to a well constructed, outdoor cat house, I thought the cat would enjoy being able to see through the door to be aware of whats going on around it while also observing me. Not only was I disappointed that the door wasn't clear, the door is designed in a way that doesn't make any sense to a cat. It's a funky 2 flap, one door design. I threw this door in the trash. Get a PetSafe Cat flat - It's well constructed/designed - I like it and the cat likes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a large door","review":"This is more of a medium size door. It says for dogs up to 100 lbs. but my dogs are about 75 lbs. and they hated it. They would hit their knees and/or back side when going in or out. Had to get rid of it (waste of my money) because my two dogs stopped using it. Went with a PetSafe door where a large door is an actual large door."},{"rating":"2","title":"my dogs are thrilled","review":"We've only had it installed about 2 weeks. So far it works great. My chubby collie & old black lab are both going in and out easily. It was easy to install. It was hanging up a little when closing but seems to be working through that. It was supposed to be a clear door & it is not. Very disappointed in that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tight fit for a medium size dog","review":"Unfortunately, you can't believe the picture on the staywell box. Border Collies and English Springer Spaniels do not easily fit through the door flap ...unless they are on the very small & skinny side. Picture a contortionist going through a small opening because that's exactly how a 35lb dog will look going through the door flap - they fit but only just and with some work to get through. If the dog weighs any more than that, good luck making them squeeze through the narrow opening.The flap is made out of plastic and has a cheap plastic \\"rod\\" system that supposedly holds the door flap in place. Two days later and the plastic is broken. Definitely not worth your money. We tried the larger, too, and had the same issue ...big enough for our dog, but broke within a short-time after installation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excels in step-by-step instructions","review":"A very detailed introduction to calligraphy aimed at people who have NO prior experience.

This would make a great gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the old Hot Wheels track","review":"Remember when Hot Wheels didn't require batteries? The gravity powered tracks are still the best!My kids got this for Christmas and love it!

My 4 year old really likes moving the crank to have the car reach the top and then watch it scream down the drop when she releases it. It was cool to watch her set up different dismount/fly through the ring of fire options by changing the height of things (adding books or boxes underneath stuff, maneuvering how close/far back the ring was put, etc.) Can't tell how durable it's going to be yet, but the plastic drop seems pretty thick so hopefully it will maintain its sturdiness. Definitely a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"6-year-old likes it","review":"My son picked this out. The permanent assembly was easy (5 minutes), and my son is able to take apart and put back together himself when done playing. He quickly tires of it when he uses the elevator (a bit slow for his taste), but he likes to drop the cars down manually. Overall, this Hot Wheels set is easy and stays together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring very quickly","review":"I have a six-year-old and a nine-year-old; my youngest got this as a gift. It is easy to assemble and worked fine, but like most Hot Wheels toys, although the box and the ads look like it is an amazing, fun experience, once you drop a few cars down the track you it starts to dawn on you....is that it? They played with it for about five minutes and then moved on to other things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Wheels V-Drop","review":"Do NOT buy this product at any price.

Trite? Pretenious? Boooooorrrrring? While Kate Fansler is both amatuer sleuth and professor of English, there is absolutely no reason for her to go around spouting off obscure Joycean witticisms to any and everybody (and I actually like Joyce)! For the non-English studies person some parts of the text will make absolutely no sense, and for the English studies person those parts will just seem senseless. I was literally more than 1/3 finished with the book before I realized that the crime had not yet take place because Cross had spent most of that time making sure that the reader was well aware of her knowledge on Joyce...."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ACADEMIC MYSTERY","review":"In this early Kate Fansler mystery, Kate spends some time away from the university, sorting letters from James Joyce to his American publisher.

Whatever the venue, hearing Dr. Martin speak on the subject of cults, the defense of the Christian faith, and Christian spirituality, was an inspiring treat. Those who benefitted from his ministry will appreciate this latest book by Dr. Martin, published posthumously by his oldest daugher, Jill Martin Rische. In Through the Windows of Heaven, the reader will be treated to many spiritual gems drawn from the many public lectures of Dr. Martin. This book has great broad appeal to the Christian public, not only to those with an apologetic interest, but also to those interested in gaining practical spiritual insights applicable in their daily walk with Christ. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant !!","review":"I can hear Dr.Martin's voice as I read this book. I had the privilege of attending some of Dr.Martin\\"s Bible classes when he was alive,and I'll I can say is this book brings back some wonderful memories.

I sure hope there will be another volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long time student of Walter Martin.","review":"Very well written.

It'll be cheaper and re-usable than any costume bought at a store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"I wanted a bar grill for a 12\\" sub. You have to put it together from the 6 parts with the screws provided, a couple of the predrilled and threaded holes had pieces of metal in them and that provided a bit of difficulty to put it together, but it ended up being fine. I wanted to protect the bottom of my sub and the sides and you can either install this horizontal or vertical, so I put it on almost a 45 degree angle, it protects things from sliding into the bottom of the rubber on the sub and keeps back packs/boxes, etc off the sides and cone of the sub. I put it on as tight as I could and it does not rattle at all, thats the first reason I wanted a simple bar grill. Overall, great investment to protect your sub. I'm very pleased I bought it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control.","review":"Looks nice, seems to be heavy enough steel (not easily bent).

For the price, it's not a bad recorder, but plan on being very careful with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate - but not great","review":"This is an okay recorder for occasional use. But the sound reproduction isn't all that clear so if you need it for extended recording or listening, spend a few more dollars and go for a Pansonic or Sony. THis also doesn't have a counter so it's hard to find specific areas of the recording, and you have to stop it each time you rewind or go forward. On the plus side it does have a seperate mic jack so you can use your own mic when recording a lecture or meeting. The price is right, but the quality just isn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"The retailer got me exactly what I paid for, in a timely fashion. No problem there. As soon as I got it I popped in some good batteries and a good tape. Plugged in the earphones and pressed \\"Play\\". Wow - what a bunch of wow. Do you remember what wow is in a tape player - this things got it bad. They advertise 2 speed operation. Actually it includes ALL speed and it constantly hunts through them. I tried another tape and it was the same. So I took my good bateries out and threw the thing in the trash. At the price of this thing there was no point in complaining to anyone.

I know a lot of critics whine about how this band doesn't protest like RATM, but hey, this ain't RATM it's Audioslave! Anyway it's the music thats important--and this music is freakin' awesome. No one sings like Chris Cornell, a great musician in the vain of David Coverdale, Robert Plant and Rob Halford. Like early Zeppelin this band is awesome and they know it! I'm so glad to have found a metal band so engaging. Heck, even the cover is great, done by the brilliant Storm Thurgeson (there always has to be a person on the cover)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly good","review":"when i heard that ratm was merging with chris cornell, i wasn't sure how singing would mix with the pure intensity of the ratm instrumental section. well, i must admit chris cornell does a great job. his screams are wonderful and his voice is amazing. the album is great, but it just lacks the unparalleled intensity of de la rocha. thats the key word: unparalleled. nobody can be more intense and in-your-face as de la rocha. but, as i said before, chris cornell does a really good job it just cant be compared with true rage against the machine material. ratm was so intense, soundgarden was so raw, and the combination is almost as intense and almost as raw. this album was almost. definitely four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I was skeptical about buying this album because of all the hype surrounding it but, this album is totally worth all the raves it has been getting. What more can you expect from two superbands coming together. I even went to a see them live and they were awesome.

This album is LOADED with tight, heavy, classic rock and roll RIFFS!!! Man, Morello has never sounded more aggressive and innovative. And the rhythm section is so unpredictable, they keep you on the edge of your bed the whole time! Chris' vocals sound like he's gargling water -- ...Thank god he's lost all that annoying articulation from the Soundgarden/Temple of the Dog days. And the lyrics, .... They make de la Rocha sound like Britney Spears!!! The deepest, most politically offensive lyrics you'll ever hear! No self-centered, ambiguous, emo garbage here!

Wverything was very planned and safe. Now I know that I was wrong. Never once on this album do I feel that the band is toeing the line or pushing its limits. I thought especially with the creative input on Cornell, that th band would expand its vocabulary. But it sounds like COrnell doing karaoke over throw away RATM tracks. As good as Morello can be, he NEVER stretches out and really lives on danger's edge. He is the most one of the most conservative guitar players out right now. He can make a few strange noises, but any player in their closet can do this and would get bored quickly. And the drummer NEVER throws anything in to catch your attention. Very safe. I know they can all do better than this. I just never felt that they were trying to push the envelope at all. Boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Audioslave is like a tear from an eye dreaming","review":"Ony great Musicians like Chris Cornell and the Rage guys could ever record such phonomenial tunes. This album is even better then when I first heard Nirvana\\"s Teen Spirit. The Grunge scene is back again. Once you have played this album from Audioslave it takes you back to the Grunge days in Seattle. Brilliant vocals from Chris Cornell. I can't even begin to describe how successful this album will be. I have been a HUGE Soundgarden fan for years, but this can't even compare. Please I encourage anyone who admires great music, to really check this out. If is well worth the money spent. I wish they stay together forever and I hope they get the show on with Pearl Jam, that would be like a tear from an eye dreaming. Chris Cornell ROCKS!!!!!Bin Yang"},{"rating":"2","title":"About time","review":"This is a fine cd; unfortunately, it's not getting the credit it deserves simply because it is a huge departure from the previous work of the parties involved: Rage Against The Machine and Chris Cornell. The co-mingling, however, has produced a unique sound that is closer to true rock-and-roll than anything on the market today. As with any first album, there will be kinks to work out, but I don't think you can go wrong with purchasing this, and I predict they will only get better. Rock on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Idea","review":"I don't understand the excitement over this and all the hype like it's the savior of rock. This is Tom Morello at his worst, and the rest of Rage at their dullest and most monotonous. BTW, Soundgarden's Kim KILLS Tom if you use this album as a comparison. Only those who don't play guitar themselves would think otherwise. Cochise is the only descent song on the album. The rest of it sounds like Soundgarden, but drained of all musical ingenuity.And I really don't understand those who keep disrespecting de la Rocha in their reviews here. Especially those who say that he held Tom Morello back -- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. Morello was FAR more progressive with Rocha in front.This corporate merger is an EMBARRASSMENT to rock because it blew so much potential to be something great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Rage By A Longshot","review":"How wonderful was it to see the band of RATM back together minus Zack. However I was disappointed in this album because I expected the intensity and energy that Zack gave to Rage. It is just not present in this album with the new singer.

Don't buy this album if your expecting something along the lines of Rage because it doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"exactly what Kommisar Vassily Zaitsev \\"Socialist Metal Head\\" said","review":"rage against the machine = godssoundgarden (omg what a gay name) = rubbishcome on people, rage against the machine is great and they dont belong with this new singer who is nothing compared to zdlr. just face it, audioslave is overrated. nothing against tom or anyone. go listen to rage against the machine they are a million times better. tom morello isnt even trying in audioslave and it makes me sad to hear such talent going to waste :( id rather rip my nipples off and sleep with a rabid mongoose then listen to these boring lyrics being sung by an annoying voice.thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was a huge RATM fan, and while I was shocked when they broke up, I tried to look at it as a way for the remaining members to explore different creative avenues. These three play together as well as always, and they retain their familiar style. While I wasn't expecting another RATM, the vocals here do not mesh, or blend well with the music. They seem to clash, instead of work together to make an enjoyable album. A perfect example of this is track 6, \\"Set It Off\\". The song starts out great, and I almost expect Zack to come in spitting rhymes, but instead, Cornell comes in. Instead of flowing with the song, he comes in and takes over, almost pushing his way to the forefront. In the end, maybe this album just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"RATM is better...","review":"After listening to Audioslave, I am confident in saying RATM is better, much, much better. RATM's singer has a much better voice, and I like the way the guitarist (same in both AS and RATM) plays better in RATM.Conclusion: Get any of RATM's CDs instead of this. End of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya know what sucks?","review":"When Chris Cornell was approached by the members of RATM, he said that he absolutely refused to write political lyrics. WTF!I can't believe that Tom Morello being the intelligent graduate of political science from Harvard would join such a band.Tom is tremendously involved in politics and is one of the strongest voices on the left along with System of a Down and countless punk bands. So isn't it awful that he can't voice himself or even be himself in this supergroup?Obviously this is something that the former RATM members thought would be fun, but the real reason that Audioslave exists is money. All members had nothing better to do than form a radio-friendly supergroup and sell out big time.I still like Tom Morello, but selling out is when you put money before your values and that is exactly what he has done.So free these slaves by not buying their audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"So you say this band is comprised of memebers of Rage Against the Machine, one of the most innovative metal bands of all time, and Soundgarden, probably the best grunge band of all time?

Audioslave is just a regular band that would be a garage band if the elements weren't VIP's.Just buy Battle of L.A. if you want some real stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Rage, but still worth buying","review":"Let's get one thing straight before you buy this cd. This is NOT Rage against the machine, if you are expecting heavy guitar riffs and hard rap vocals, prepare to be disappointed. That said, this is an excellent cd. It is very melodic and well written, and Chris Cornell has an amazing voice. Tom Morello, Brad Wilks, and Tim Comerford are as solid as ever, and some of Tom's solos are incredible.

I took a gamble on purchasing this CD not really knowing what to expect. However, I can literally say this is an amazing album release. These band members are talented and there is no doubt about that. The album track listing starts off with Cochise which has a heavy set Rock theme. The styles of each song differs and its differances is what makes this album stand out. Several of these songs like Show Me How To Live, What You Are and Shadow On The Sun have become radio staples. Or for the more hard rock fans, the songs like Cochise, Set If Off and Exploder will suit them.Personally I found that this album has it all, punk rock, soft rock, hard rock with alittle bit of grunge added in to spice up the flavour. I enjoy listening to this CD and any fan of Nickelback or Creed should enjoy this helping from Audioslave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On","review":"If you are a Chris Cornell or Soundgarden fan, this album is a must.

It isn't Rage and it isn't Soundgarden. this is an entirely new band with a style all their own. If you're like me and loved Rage's music but thought Zach De La Rocha's voice was annoying This is the album to get. There aren't really any bad tracks, but the would have to be \\"The last remaining light. Some of the best tracks are \\"Show me how to Live\\", and \\"What you are\\". If you're a soundgarden fan who wants some new, good old-fashioned rock n roll, also get it. Something on here for everybody. If you don't have it yet, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audioslave","review":"All and all this Cd is Fanatastic. Songs like \\"Conchise\\" and \\"Set it Off\\" show that the refugees from rage against the machine can still kick some serious ... and now they are even stronger with Cornell's vocals. Songs you can mosh too are nice and all but the album's Appeal lies mostly in the slow songs. With De La Rocha, Rage against the Machine was held back, having to keep the tempo going almost all the time at full speed since De La Rocha couldn't hold a note to save his life. With Cornell taking the mike, Audioslave is able to make songs with a slower tempo and \\"epic\\" sort of quality similar to alot of soundgarden songs(think \\"Black Hole Sun\\"); the best examples being \\"I am The highway\\" and \\"like a Stone\\". The only fault with this album is only that some of guitar riffs sound ridiculously similar. But this is something that has plagued every Rage/Soundgarden record and none of there fans have ever seemed to care, just as Hard rock fans wont care about Audioslave's record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but needs moore rage guitar","review":"This was a great Cd. The mix of Grunge with the indepth sound that rage but together in there earlier records. This is a great Cd but with one problem... More Rage guitar. In this Cd there was not enough guitar that rage allways put together. That was what i was looking for when I got this Cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great cornell album","review":"In typical chris cornell fashion, this album rocks! i never liked ratm, but i love this album. if you like it, you should also try Down On the Upside by Soundgarden, his former band."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classical modern cd","review":"Audioslave is the first modern super group to combine the sounds of great 70's band like led zepplin and pink floyd while keeping the same funky funk of rage against the machine. this cd is a must for all alternative music fans and mainstream rock fans alike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy alternative","review":"Hey all you \\"Rage\\" and \\"Soundgarden\\" fans. So there is life after break up. If any of you hardcore fans are looking for a \\"Rage against the Machine\\" or \\"Soundgarden\\" alternative then you are looking in the wrong spot. However if you are looking for hard, rocking, bottom line good music then look no further. Tom Morello still offers up hard biting licks and Cornell offers up his sultry and sensual revved up voice. All in all it wasn't what i expected, but in that sense....I'm glad."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD ROCKS!!!!!!!","review":"No it's not exactly RATM and no it's not exactly soundgarden but it was better than i expected. The instrumentation is amazing, the band does and awesome job, you even hear their roots from rage in every song. Chris does a good job vocally. I didn't like this CD when i first got it but now it's one of my favorite ones ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"The combination of Chris Cornell and RATM is amazing! These guys are taking rock music to new heights. My favorites are bascially all of them, but \\"Gasoline\\", \\"I am the highway\\", \\"Shadow of the sun\\", \\"What you are\\", \\"Cochise\\", \\"Gasoline\\", and the gem, \\"Like a stone\\". This is one you can put in the CD player and let it play through the whole album. It doesn't get much better than this. I can't wait to see where the talents of this band will take them."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this a great CD?","review":"I have to admit that the music in this CD is pretty good, but when Chris Cornell's voice comes in, it just totally ruins everything. You're lucky i gave this 2 stars. It should really only have a half star, but i felt i needed to at least give credit to the former Rage members who can actually play music. Chris Cornell, find some other band to screw up with, instead of making these guys listen to your horrible voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slave to the grind","review":"2 1/2Only a few tracks can rise above a tyrannical sludge pulsating in predictable time- elevating this particular supergroup only slightly above the stale stylings of a Velvet Revolver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I love Audioslave","review":"The lyrics of their songs are so meaningful and profound. It shows that they enjoy what they are doing and that they want to make an impact on people. I loved them after hearing just one song, then i sampled more and loved them and now i own the CD. They are, to me, the best band, great lyrics, awesome vocals, and realy good guitar playing, if you like rock music, or lyrics that actually make you think, and mean something (not like most teenie boper bands like that Britney \\"oops i did it again\\") then they are the band for you! I hope they will come out with another CD soon! I hope people like this CD as much as i do!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is for all the na sayers","review":"I just bought the Audioslave album and i think it a very good album. I don't know why people are comparing audioslave to nickleback or creed, they are totally different. No way was this made for commercial success. It is definitely one of the better albums of the year. Im a big fan of both rage and soundgarden and when i heard of this combo i was all over it and was not disappointed. yes there are several dry tracks on the album that are dry but overall it is very very good.

I loved their purposeful lyrics mixed with the distinctive R.A.T.M sound. I think that Zach WAS R.A.T.M, and as soon as he left I knew the band couldn't live on without him. The way he sang with his raspy voice you could feel the hate and rage of the lyrics. And mix that with Tom's crazy guitar playing and you have the unique sound only R.A.T.M could produce. The band itself still has it, but when you mix their sound with Chris Cornell it is horrible. R.A.T.M was all about the rap/metal sound, and mixing that with Cris Cornell's alt-rock voice doesn't work. I think that these guys will forever be looked at as \\"the 3 remaining members of R.A.T.M and Soundgarden's lead singer\\" and never just the band Audioslave. I don't see this band lasting for a little more than a year. P.S- that name is horrible, is that the best they could come up with?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not terrible, but definately not for RATM fans.","review":"If you're a big Rage fan I guarantee you probably won't like this album. I know I didn't. Tom, Tim and Brad are perfect together (Zack is perfect with them too), but I don't know about Chris. Chris changed the sound quite a bit. If you like Soundgarden get this, but if you like Rage Against the Machine, don't get this. If you like both... get it, but expect more Soundgarden than Rage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic, Magical, Genius","review":"I was given this album shortly after its release and I listened to the the hits I had heard on the radio and then, sadly, it was set aside. I recently picked it up and listened to the full CD. Man, I was missing alot of goodness between the radio hits. The entire CD is gripping; the melodies, lyrics, everything. This CD sends chills down your spine it is so good. Chris Cornell does an amazing job with the vocals and all of the songs fit together so well. I don't think I own another album that is so coherent and worth the replay value. This CD is a must own and its a bonus if you like the radio hits (Like A Stone, I Am The Highway)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD - if one accepts that it is not RATM or Soundgarden","review":"This is NOT Rage Against The Machine. This is NOT Soundgarden. To fully appreciate Audioslave, one must accept the band for what it is: a completely new band. The musical style is different (WAY different) than those other bands. It took me about three times through the album to understand the genius of it. At first I was still nostalgic for the angry, incendiary, machine-gun-like vocals of Zack de la Rocha. Chris Cornell is not that vocalist. And because of that, Tom Morello, Brad Wilk and Tim Commerford have also toned down the pyrotechnics.However, this album rocks on its own. From the opening thunderous riffs of \\"Cochise\\" to \\"Like A Stone\\" to my favorite track, \\"Shadow On The Sun\\" to the hardcore riffs of \\"Exploder\\", this is an album that does not disappoint. Accept Audioslave for what it is: a great band in its own right. If you do, you will be amazed by this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cornell howls and the disc rocks","review":"I picked this cd up the morning it came out. It rocks.Every track is solid.

I got his solo album Euphoria when it was first released due to my love of his prior work. Definitely a worthy purchase if you love his moody work! This CD sat in my collection for the last year or so because the first listen left me underwhelmed. However, I pulled it out and listened again, and it hit me. I love the CD. I am not sure why I let it sit so long, but now it is time to buy up the rest of this band's CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I don't give a rat's ass what people think of Audioslave, I love 'em. And as far as the complaints I hear from people whining about how this CD is \\"watered down\\" or \\"laid back\\", listen to it again. Songs such as \\"Cochise\\", \\"Set It Off\\", \\"Exploder\\" and \\"Light My Way\\" are heavy as hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tunes man","review":"In my opinion Chris Cornell is better off without Soundgarten, and the guys from Rage always make for a good CD. Put the 2 together and ya got a fine mix of tunes.Only problem is i think I blew a speaker with \\"Show Me How to Live\\" it's got a nice bass kick, and if ya got some fat sub's, they'll hear ya coming for a block or 2"},{"rating":"2","title":"Audioslave debuts a hit cd","review":"Audioslave has reached a new level in rock. With the Rage Against the Machine in the band, there is no problems with the music. The lead singer has one of the coolest voices ive heard. Audioslave is pretty good all the way around. There are no weak songs on the whole CD. Some of my favorites are Like A Stone, I Am The Highway, and Getawy Car. The onbe song that got me hooked on this group is Cochise. Not sure what it means but it one of my favorites. If you like any of the songs they have on the radio, you will love this CD.ROCK ON AUDIOSLAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thank God for audioslave","review":"i give this album 4 and a half stars, which, i guess rounds up to 5.i dont especially love RATM or Soundgarden. I agree that they are both groundbreaking bands musically, but as for my own personal tastes, RATM had a little too much hardcore rapping, and in Soundgarden, Chris Cornell was a little more soft (as compared to Audioslave).But enter Audioslave, which combines the better parts of both RATM and Soundgarden. I love Cornell's lyrics, and the instrumentals that RATM provides complements Cornell's voice perfectly.Cochise (blasting intro), i am the highway (self-liberating anthem), Shadow of the sun (excellent transtion from soft into hard) and getaway car (blues-y driving music) are the highlights of the CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"rage meets sound","review":"For anyone who likes either Rage Against the Machine or the former Soundgarden sound, they will ove this new Audioslave CD. Some songs sound quite a bit like Chris Cornell's huge vocal range chiming over vintage Rage melodies, while others are more toned down and reminisent of classic Soundgarden songs. The former Rage rhythm section backs Cornell's vocals wonderfully. Anyone who expects to hear Chris sing over Rage's sound will get exactly what they ask for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"With the amazing riffs of Tom Morello and the mind blowing vocals from Chris Cornell this album easily gets album of the year from me. Audioslave also mixes in that bluesy classic rock sound that I haven't heard since I bought Aerosmiths:Get Your Wings. Missing out on this album really is missing out on a true masterpiece that was perfectly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy only one album this year, make it this one.","review":"This CD has not left my CD player since I bought it. The combination of two of the best bands of the last 10 years is an absolute dream. The sound is familiar yet completely different to RATM and Soundgarden's individual output and it completely blows the competition away. If you are one of those people that think the Backstreet Boys are talented, listen to this to hear what a non-manufactured band sounds like and come to the conclusion that there's currently no band out there (except perhaps U2, Foo Fighters and Red Hot Chilli Peppers) who come even close to matching the musical quality of this fantastic new band. Let's hope there's many more albums to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Sweet Irony","review":"Sure. Some of these songs are a little catchy. But honestly, how did Chris Cornell think this was a good idea? Audioslave is Rage doing a Nickelback impression and Chris Cornell writing lyrics straight out of the late 90s mold of horrible, devirative hard rock like 3 Doors Down, or god, even Creed. The horror.If you were ever a fan of ANY of these musicians, do yourself a favor and never buy this. The originals are ripping off the rip offs. Aye curumba."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Over Rated","review":"This cd is by far the most over rated cd of the year. The only thing it has going for itself is who is in the band. The truth is if this was a first cd for any other band it would bomb. So do yourself a favor, think for yourself, dont follow the crowd, give it a listen and I bet you will soon feel the same. Dont let the media tell you whats good, for this is a cd that has been done in the 80's to the 90's. Chris Cornell seems so out of place with the sound of rage backing him. Rage was awesome we all know that, and Chris Cornell is no replacement for Zack, just like the former Rage boys are not a replacement for soundgarden. This just smells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to agree with Jay Stevens here","review":"It lacks the fire of both early Soundgarden and early RATM. The songs are there, they sound like \\"rock\\", but they also sound like the very reason kids today are looking elsewhere.There is nothing here you haven't heard already, but that would be excusable if it just had a little fire going. Rock'n'roll is yelling into a microphone with a loud wailing guitar and a thundering base. Here we have the dictionary definition of rock'n'roll, sans anything that would endear the listener. What made Soundgarden and RATM great is what makes this mediocre. That both bands were waning before this is notable.They only sound truly inspired every so many songs, and usually they can't even get a full 4 minutes out of it. The sound is great, the chops are there, and the music goes in one ear and out the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"To be honest, most modern rock bores the tears out of me. So much of it follows the same old tired formula that it is reduced to nothing more than heavy pop. Soundgarden was one band in the genre that always managed to overcome this and caputure my attention. So Audioslave comes along...it sounds like Soungarden minus the latter bands uniqueness, and so it comes of as just another dull mordern rock album...well played, nothing terrible, Chris Cornell's voice is still wonderful...but if I want to listen to Soundgarden I'll listen to Soundgarden, thank you. This must be the year of failed supergroups as Zwan (aka, the new Smashing Pumpkins)'s debut is a likewise decent yet dull modern rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock is on top","review":"This cd brings true rock and roll back to the genre.All these one hit wonder, Nu-Metal, drop D dummies,should listen and learn about REAL rock music.Long live Audioslave!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And so it begins!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"... Hopefully, this album will spark the ignition for rock and roll once again. Amazing...period. \\"Cochise\\", \\"Set It Off\\", and pretty much every track on this album is as intense as both Soundgarden and Rage were in their prospective era! Buy this CD..."},{"rating":"1","title":"please!","review":"I mean, with all the rockers on this album, why did it turn out so lame and predictable? Its basically Sound Garden. The songs are all forgettable and the ballads are too many and boring. You would think that this would be one of the greatest albums of the year? Cornells vocals are still mellifluous and amzing and Morello's guitar rocks............but it just doesnt combine well to make a great album..........boo hoo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Blue","review":"Who would expect Chris Cornell to join the remaining members of Rage Against the Machine? Well they have done it, they have formed a band like no other, forming their own sense of soul into the music. The music will leave you breathless, the lyrics make you realize about life as one would have never defined it."},{"rating":"1","title":"coulda been so much more","review":"I love Soundgarden and I love Rage Against the Machine but this album was a let down on so many levels. Most would assume that if you combine two great elements from two great bands you would get a decent product in return however this wasnt the case. Audioslave's debut album is in no way a bad album just a dissapointing one. All the songs felt so flat and unispired compared to past rage or soundgarden material. Cornell's voice and Morello's guitars never seemed to shine on this c.d. and the whole experience was quite lackluster. I can only hope in future recordings the band can recapture what truly made them great in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"With one or two exceptions, sounds way too much like Soundgarden. I was hoping for a more balanced mix between Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but this CD has that monotone depressed feel that kept Soundgarden from being enjoyable when listened to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audioslave","review":"I'm a huge fan of Rage Against the Machine and at first I was very worried that Audioslave would fail to meet my expectations. When I first listened to the CD I was hooked. I skipped right over Cochise and Like A Stone because I already knew that they were amazing songs, and I soon noticed that the rest of the album was also amazing. I would recommend this CD to any and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Loved Soundgarden and loved RATM. Love both together even more. One of the best CDs I've purchased in awhile. Definitely worth checking out if you were a fan of either group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Slaves in America","review":"Best hard core rock in the world, has some awsome lyrics and does have the talent of singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiogarden to Soundslave...","review":"what an amazingly awesome cd. blends some hard rock with some soft ballads that seem to fit perfectly with each other. its very rare to have a band like this who didn't even play a single show before recording their album. chris cornell is one of my favorite singers, soundgarden was one of my favorite bands, and the same with the boys from rage. i was really interested in seeing the changes these musicians would have to make. it would of seemed like they needed work to get used to each, but not exactly. they seemed more used to each other then any other band who gets together after having success with another group. velvet revolver looked like they wanted to jump the bandwagon, but i'll be the first to say that velvet revolver flat out sux ASS!!! i love the stone temple pilots but that little idea just did not seem to work out, not like audioslave anyway. to sum up audioslave=GREAT BAND!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven","review":"Overall, there are a handful of excellent songs on this cd. But, in its entirety there are a couple of misses. I was never crazy about \\"Cochise\\" and its exciting that there are songs on this cd that blow that track away. The stand out tracks have the thundering bass that both Soundgarden and Rage are known for, great drums and guitars, and Chris Cornell's amazing vocal range.Some songs are very Soundgarden-like, some are very Rage-like, and a few (the ones that in my opinion are not so good) are very Cornell solo-like. Also, there are a few vocal experiments that I think just don't work, and I am one of Chris Cornell's biggest fans, so its a tough call to make. They are almost uncomfortable to listen to.Overall, its a solid effort, and I can't wait to see them live."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album of the year","review":"What can I say.. this album absolutely knocked my socks off. What one expects from a Chris Cornell/Rage Against the Machine joint venture is not what it delivers.. its altogether different than expected, and so much better. From the hard rock of \\"Cochise\\" to the quiet splendor of \\"Like a Stone\\" this is the first album I have heard all year that I don't have the urge to hit SKIP on any of the tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album just plain ROCKS!","review":"Let me start off by saying, this album rocks. Usually, these so called \\"super-group\\" collaborations don't work out very well, with the exception of Cream, but this album does and does rather well. It combines one of the great rock n' roll voices of the past decade with one of the most unique bands in recent memory. The raunchy groove throught the record along with the waling vocals makes for one hell of a ride. Standout tracks include; Cochise, Gasoline, Show Me How To Live, What You Are and Exploder. Of all the tracks on the record there are two weak ones (maybe they are growers). If you are any kind of fan of rock n' roll this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Stone","review":"It was a strong and steady album, but there was nothing that really stood out on this album. Some songs were good , for example like a stone was good, but there wasnt much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"When I heard these guys were getting together I was excited. The guys from Rage getting together with Chris Cornell, it couldn't any better than that right? Wrong. When I first heard Cochise all the excitment that built up inside of me prior to the release of this album immediatly dissapeared. The guitar riff sounds like a half assed Rage riff and the vocals aren't that good. I couldn't get into this song at all. I knew Audioslave wasn't going to be Rage Against the Machine, but I thought it would be a lot better than what it is. Rage's music was filled with anger, emotion, powerful lyrics, earth shaking bass lines and drum beats, and brilliant guitar riffs. Audioslave is just flat out boring. Like a Stone is a perfect example of an extremely boring song. Everyone thinks these guys are gonna \\"save rock\\", but I just think they're overrated and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"my word,how....inventive!","review":"NOT!this stuff is even worse than rage against the machine.\\"they've really 'grown up'with this album\\"-how can any intelligent human utter such doofus-like sayings?Go get Soulfy's self titled cd,Down-a bustle in your hedgerow,corrosion of conformity,Pantera-vulgar display of power,or Sepultura-roots,and lose the mainstream dunce cap buddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preliminary review","review":"I was a huge fan of Rage Against the Machine, so I was disappointed when Zack de la Rocha left. However, when news of Chris Cornell joining on to create a new band, I was very excited. After many months of hard work, Audioslave was born. This album is the fruits of their labor. The change of singers makes a big difference, as Zack's rap/rock is gone and Chris's more forceful rock takes its place. The lyrics are less politically charged, but still meaningful (such as \\"Go and save yourself/take it out on me\\" from Cochise).Cochise, their first single, is definitely the most popular song at this point...Definitely check this CD out if you like rock... this CD is a must buy. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD ever","review":"I used to be a huge rage fan, its actually very sad what has become of them. Chris Cornell was the last person i would have guessed would take over zacks place now that i listen to the finished product i long for the days of the old rage, the lyrics and the music just do not go together, cornells lyrics sound just like his failed solo attempt with rage music in the background, i know these guys are all friends with cornell but why get dragged down to musical mediocracy with him? i hope zack;s cd makes up for this"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crapper!","review":"This was one of the biggest dissapointments that I have ever purchased. This truly certifies that Rage is done forever. Rage and Cornell dont fit. This Cd is one of the most depressing things I have ever listened to."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE, Boring to Tears","review":"I don't care who these guys played with... They were with good bands in the past, this one is awful. Find some new ideas, Chris and Tom. In the mean time, you can take this entire album and cram it far up. There is not ONE good track or redeeming quality here. If I could give it minus five stars I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I think Audioslave's self-titled album is great. The beginning songs of the album start you off with loud rock. (Which by the way is amazing.) Then as you sink in, you start to see more creativity. Especially in ''What You Are'' and ''Shadow On The Sun''. Toward the end, the songs are good but I prefer the first couple of tracks. Overall though, the album is good for a first record from the guys of RATM and 1/4 of SG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audioslave...the current KINGS of Rock 'n Roll","review":"This CD is fantastic. Chris Cornell is probably the best vocalist in Rock right now and when he teams up with Rage Against the Machine what's not to love? The CD is awesome. Some are very good hard rock songs (Set it Off, Cochise, Gasoline) and some are nice mellow songs like Like a Stone.And talk about creativity. If you are tired of the same old rock listen to some Audioslave. \\"Show me how to Live\\" is one of my favorite songs just because the music is so original.This is a truly excellent CD.They are also a very very good live band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supergroup - Whatever","review":"Putting aside their Anti-American Politics this is not a good cd. This is a mellow Soundgarden cd at best. How many times can bands rehash Led Zepplin stuff? This is a bloated and boring cd. Most of the songs are very Soundgarden-ish when they were at their commercial best writing drippy ballads. There is no fury or angst or passion - this is an uninspired cd that is cashing in on the names of Soundgarden and RATM. Do yourself a favor and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Where to begin? Great lyrics, vocals, and a well-produced, heavy-but-crystal-clear sound make this one of the best rock albums in recent memory. I think that Tom Morello is really one of the most inventive guitarists around, and he hasn't gotten enough credit for the sounds he produces. Commerford and Wilk are in top form in the rhythm section, and Chris Cornell's wailing is as good as it ever was with Soundgarden. And I have to say that Audioslave sounds better than Rage ever did; I'm glad they lost the whiny rap of Zack de la Rocha and started playing REAL rock.Best songs: Cochise, Show Me How to Live, Gasoline, Like a Stone, I Am the Highway, Light My Way, Shadow on the Sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slighty Above Average","review":"What can I say about this album other than it kicks major ...! One of the best albums of 2,002! I've waited for this album for a long time & I can't say it is a disappointment. Although I am kind of sick of \\"Cochise\\" & \\"Like A Stone\\". My favorite song off the cd is the most likely unknown song on the album called \\"Shadow of the Sun\\". I also like the ballad \\"I Am The Highway\\" only on the account of its not getting that much radio play but I have heard it a couple of times including \\"Show Me How To Live\\". Those are all great tracks as well but you can't forget about \\"Gasoline\\", \\"What You Are\\", \\"Set It Off\\", & the one I have already mentioned \\"Shadow of the Sun\\". All I can say that this the first half of the CD is really good then it starts to go downhill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Substitute For Rage","review":"I checked out this album because I like Rage, but it didn't sufice for me. I guess I was just hoping for a \\"return\\" of Rage and didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have you noticed?","review":"Great album. One question though: is it just me, or dose Cochise sound a lot like Whole Lotta Love? Go back and forth between the two songs and you'll know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album that started it all...","review":"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, and it was good. On the eighth day, he created Audioslave. And it was good. And there was much rejoicing in the land.Ok, this band is not quite of biblical proportions, but they're only a step or two below. With the exception of a few sub-par tracks (thats why this a 4-starrer and not a fiver) this is great first try. \\"Cochise,\\" \\"Show Me How to Live,\\" \\"Exploder,\\" \\"Shine On,\\" \\"I Am the Highway,\\" the parade of awesome tracks is seemingly endless. That said, things at times feel funny, like Cornell and the band aren't quite together on everything, but that's forgivable. However, there's an alternate cut of \\"I Am the Highway\\" floating around that is markedly better than the one that ended up on the album. But my complaints are generally few and minor.Things would be more solid the second time around, but their brightest moments to date came in this slightly more scattershot, but very good, album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty, intense rock","review":"Audioslave, my friends, is not cookie-cutter garbage like Creed or Nickleback. It's actually, well, unique....and even better, gritty. While no masterpiece, this is, nonetheless, a solid album worth checking out for anyone who digged Rage, Soundgarden, or Chris Cornell's solo work. My fav tracks include Cochise, Show Me How to Live, What You Are, Like a Stone, Shadow of the Sun, and Bring Em Back Alive(Tom Morello's guitar work is sick on this one) to name a few.The first part of the CD is no doubt more solid than the slower, more introspective latter half. In a recent interview, Cornell stated that the band was feeling their roots with this album, and that the new album they're working on in the studio now will be much more cohesive and not like two separate superbands doing their own thing in each song. Anyways, this one is an undeniably uncompromising and intense first effort that rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"¡Que buena combinación!","review":"Combinación explosiva la de Cornell y los de RATM, con este proyecto dan un buen ejemplo de que hay mucho rock por delante"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very cool! The music is awesome and so are the vocals!","review":"If you like RATM and SoundGarden, then I really recommend you get this CD. The music is awesome, the lyrics and vocals are spectacular, everything is great about this CD! Chris Cornell does an awesome job doing the vocals and the rest of the band is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you need to hear this album","review":"One of the best in a long time, I was a bit anxious to see if they could pull it off as I'm a fan of both bands ...... and I have to say this album is excellant.Best track getaway car a beautiful song, just one of many great tracks.Dont listen to my opinion if you want this album, but it's definately worth buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great album","review":"i just piced up the audioslave album and i was not dissapontedone of 5 best albums of the year cornell has not forgottenanithing.a must have for any rock fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"This is a very good album and has great songs on it. It's the sound of Rage mixed with the voice of Soundgarden. These 2 forces make an incredible duo in there new debut. This is a great buy for rock fans. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I think this album has a great sound. it is so cool that the Rage guys and Chris Cornell hooked up to form Audioslave. With their successful musical backgrounds, the band will certainly produce great stuff and a huge fan following. The song Cochise is just awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the MOST overrated band on the planet","review":"They're just not very good. Maybe the radio is more to blame than the band but Audioslave doesn't even hold a candle to Soundgarden OR Rage Against the Machine. Plain and simple, this band [stinks]."},{"rating":"1","title":"i want RATM back","review":"no good, nothing special exept a normal rock band. nothing else. this cannot replace rage and will never. Rage Against The Machine needs to reform now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lets see.... nope.","review":"Rage Against the Machine plus Soundgarden minus all talent and innovation equals Audioslave! YAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake.","review":"Mainstream, Fake sounding, plastic rubbish.Its stupid.Adults to little kids are listening to this bollix, so it seems.Not to mention its very boring.It would be nice to hear Chris Cornell do some actual singing, instead of roaring and droning all the time.This band could do so much more with their sound.I think they'll prove that with thier next album - .......I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not the same","review":"let me first get something straight. I love Rage Against the Machine and SOundgarden. However Chris Cornells voice just does not suit RATM's style of music. The music is good but vocally this album is very poor. When your on to a good thing stick to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cliche","review":"If you pine for the days of arena rock and meaningful lyrics straight from Creative Writing 101 ten Audioslave is the band for you. From the Cornells Robert Plant wannabe wail down to the Storm Thorgercon cover this is as uninspired as they come.Yes Cornell as a great rock voice, but he uses it in such obvious ways and with such laughably pretentious lyrics (Pearls of swine bereft of me \\" yeeesh!) that it doesnt matter. Cornell takes something potentially dynamic and makes it clich.The band is solid but constrained compared to the days of Rage. Morello and the boys make the best of it but it sounds like they sleepwalk through each song.This CD does succeed in remained us that Rage Against The Machine was a phenomenal band tat took metal to new, interesting places and Soundgarden was just phenomenally overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard, not enough melody","review":"I don't normally listen to wailing, hard-edged bands anymore, but Soundgarden's \\"Superunknown\\" is a stellar album and for an album with such a hard edge, the songs were damn catchy and moving. This album, however, had very little that stayed with me. \\"Like a Stone,\\" the main single from this album, ended up being the only song I liked. Most of the other songs were just hard guitar wailing combined with screaming vocals with few melody hooks to speak of. If you normally like this sort of music then that might be OK, but for the rest of us... sorry. So for those of you who are NOT ashamed to admit that you mostly stick to \\"mainstream\\" music, like myself, I doubt that you'd like this album. But try it for yourself I guess. I'm done with Chris Cornell, hardcore, metal, and punkbands myself. Call me getting older, but I don't care, there's just too much good music out there to waste on this sort of stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK GOD","review":"In the day where Justin Timberlake dominates the charts, we need a good ROCK band. Thats where these guys come in. RATM was awesome but were only part rock. Soundgarden was sweet but they have broken up. Putting this together gives you 14 tracks that make up an ALBUM. thats right, not CD, album. Lets look at which rock bands are dominate on MTV...Nickelback...The Calling...Sum 41....these are hardly rock. AudioSlave is rock. Good riffs, good vocals, awesome rhythm section and plenty of crunch. I downloaded like 3 of the songs and decided to go out and buy the cd. Wise investment. These guys have potential to be the next big ROCK band. Let's see how the next 2 or 3 albums do...ROCK ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of Fresh Air","review":"We've been waiting for this album for a long time. The union of Chris Cornell and the remaining members of Rage Against the Machine have mixed the right ingredients to cook up a great sounding band. This album goes some places that you would not expect musically, and makes for a great listening experience. From heavy or political, to pensive, there is not a track that should be skipped over. This is exactly how I hoped it would sound when I heard of the band. It will be in my cd player for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHA You call this rock????!!!! How can you","review":"Give me Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, The Rolling Stones or even David Lee Roth over this, it has no appeal, it is mindless noise, how the hell can you call this rock, Cornell drones as annoyingly as Kurt Cobain, this band is trying to emulate a time that left long ago in the 70s and 80s, and isn't coming back unless the true rock legends wake up and blow these fools off the stage, they are no better than Korn, Slipknot or even Rage themselves... check your ears this album [smells], there is no true element of rock and roll in it, its BORING, i thought rock and roll was a mirror of the times, we must have pretty...boring times to produce this!!! BRING BACK THE REAL ROCK!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing close to rage","review":"I was really excited when I heard that Rage was getting a new lead singer, because in my opinion Tom Morello is one of the most gifted guitar players out there. However I was throughly dissapointed with this album...to be blunt: Thank you, Chris Cornell, for absolutely ruining what used to be one of the best bands in music today. Cornell knows how to do two things: scream, and scream louder. He ruins any creativity that Rage used to have and lacks the versatility De la Rocha gave to the group. Audioslave's bassist and drummer are nothing special, and without De La Rocha throwing in his mix of funk and hip hop, Audioslave is simply Soundgarden part two, which doesn't appeal to me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Wow, what a dreary and bland album.Rage Against The Machine members and Soundgardens Chris Cornell could of done something a bit more unploished and exciting rather than this nicely packaged album full of squeaky clean guitar solos - Boring and bland!Bring back \\"Zack De La Cockroach!!!\\" - no offence, its actually a very cool name.Chris Cornell should of just started his own new band thankyou very much.Get \\"Euphoria Morning\\" thats an outstanding album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I had never heard much of Soundgarden's stuff, but I am a big Rage fan. I didn't like this album one bit. RATM without Zach isn't RATM and that is VERY obvious in their debut. Zach had the perfect style for Rage that Cornell just doesn't have. Also, taking the political bent out of the music removed a good deal of the fire and passion that Rage had. Very disappointing, maybe one of the worst albums I've heard all year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasantly surprised","review":"I got this album hoping that it would be very similar to my Rage Against the Machine ones. However, this is not how it turned out. The new singer's style is so mainstream I found myself retching. And the lyrics have lost all of their power as well. What happened to the Renegades I once knew? Where is Zach de la Rocha?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby, you're a rich man.","review":"My name is Ryan.

This album has what all the true rock fans have been questing for: something that is different, but familiar to what we all embraced in the early 90's. Cornell + Rage = Fantastic! \\"Cochise,\\" the first single has the bottom that we loved in Rage and Morello's guitar work is stellar. \\"I am the Highway\\" is full of strength and meaning, stuff that Cornell tried to spread on his solo effort, but comes through much better in this attempt. At times, the guitar work seems a little too progressive, like Tom M. is trying to show you all the tricks he can bring to the table, but it doesn't wander to far into the trippy. All in all, a extremely solid debut. I hope there is more to come. Buy this album, tell a friend, spread the gospel."},{"rating":"2","title":"rage made audioslave slow?","review":"When I first heard the song Cochese on the radio, I loved it. When I got the whole CD, I was a little disapointed. Some of the songs are good, hard music like Rage Against The Machine used to do. But alot of the tracks on it are slower songs. I thought it would be faster, & more like Rage because it's bascically all the same people, besides the vocalist from Rage. Well, this CD is good though, for the few songs that are more rock, it makes up for the slow ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry to tell you...you missed out on this....","review":"Just as I had figured...as soon as Audioslave was released you get the people that say \\"aw man..that's not Rage.\\" I got the big one here......... It wasn't supposed to sound like rage. It isn't rage and will never be rage. It is a completely different band. it may contain 3/4 of rage, but one of the things that made rage was zach.he's gone. there is no more rage. There is, on the other hand, audioslave though...they're a pretty sweet band..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great match","review":"Chris Cornell and Rage musicians move toward a new territory in this album. Hearing both Soundgarden and Rage influences it's inevitable and actually something you expect. Powerful guitars from Morello, Cornell's voice taken to the limit with more insightfur lyrics. When you hear it you think that they didn't care what the fans would say. They reached my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"please ignore the one star reviews on this page.this is a terrific alternative rock album from this supergroup and is one among my favorites.five stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am satisfied","review":"I first saw the video for \\"Show me how to live\\" on MTV about a year ago.I thought the song was excellent but hesitated about getting the cd, eventhough I love RATM. I concidered this album a poor mtv record with only one hit single and didnt want to get swindled in buying it. So, i didn't, I downloaded it. And I must say I'm not sorry. Definetly not sorry. I really think its an excellently played, sung and produced record which has enough trippy, psychedelic guitar sounds by Tom Morello and copyrigted screams by the exSoundgarden frontman Chris Cornell. And they are well put together. I am satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not pure","review":"I find that most who like Audioslave, don't like Rage Against The Machine. Those people are tasteless. Rage was perfect. Anyone who would rather listen to Audioslave has a deaf mind.Now for the review. They're a good band, but not pure or relentless. Same with their CD. I suggest buying Rage Against The Machine's first Album and listening to it prior Audioslave's."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no...","review":"Why'd ya do it Rage? I know you do have Zach anymore, but your fans would have rather you put out an instrumental album than collaborate with Chris. Granted, his voice works well with Soundgarden and even his solo stuff is all right. But this collaboration feel strangely mismatched. It's like getting Paul Simon to sing with Slipknot, the combo doesn't work. We appriciate the effort, but I'm going to have to say \\"no thanks.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The soul of rage still Burns, but Cornell is killing Rage slowly","review":"This Review goes to all Audioslave's work not just this album being their 1st albumi have both of the albums and quite frankly, out of 26 songs over the 2 albums i only like 6 of their songsi personally think Tom Morrello, Y Tim K and Brad Wilks coulda done a lot better handing their talents over to someone with way more talent like trent reznor who i consider a rock legend think of what Trent Reznor, Tom Morello, Brad Wilks and Y Tim K could of done instead of someone with far less talenti hate having to rubbish originally what was such a good formula but Cornell should be given the bootC'MON RAGE BRING BACK ROCK TO HOW YOU GUYS USED TO DO IT!!even if you have to bring the voice back one more time(Like thats gonna happen)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly Average","review":"I was Hyped with Chris Cornell&Tom Morello both United here.I enjoy Cornell's Vocie&Mrello's Guitar Playing but something about the material after a while feels Formula driven.Rage was Cool but I dug Soundgarden more so.hopefully they will get it right on the Next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rage will never be forgotten","review":"I don't like it. without zach de la rocha the band will never be the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its 1992 all over again, THANK GOD!!!!","review":"Finally, in this day in age when music was bad (especially among rock music), a band comes along to blow our eardrums out again. While Audioslave is a Supergroup of some of our favorites, it is also the first band to come out with an original sound in quite a few years. While bands like Tool are off experimenting and losing track of who they are, and Nickleback and Creed are just no good, some granddads of grunge come around and remind us (well at least me) of what rock music should sound like.An excellent first effort for a bunch of guys with distinct musical and lyrical styles. Hopefully we'll hear more in the future from them. Hopefully they'll kick the industry in the pants and help improve the state of rock too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom morello and Chris Cornell Rock it Out..","review":"The voice of Soundgarden and the Strings of Rage against the machine.. 2 talents great together, too bad they broke up before the album came out.

This album contains songs that are reminiscent of each of the former bands styles, but they seem entirely fresh due to the added dynamics that each of the former musical factions participants bring to each others tables. While Zack De La Rocha brought a lot of the rage to Rage, his political/activist jibber-jabber was too preachy and ubiquitous to the point of being annoying. Cornell's harmonious vocals and range allow Ye Olde Rage Boys to explore musical territory they were unable to with De La Rocha behind the mic. Some songs are so melodic and beautiful that I'd have never guessed that members of Rage were the ones who created them. These melodic tunes add just enough of a break from the harder stuff, that they seem that much more thundering when you do hear them."},{"rating":"2","title":"should have","review":"Not as good as any Soundgarden or RATM but still very good rock and roll.

It tore my leg up and I was in the hospital for what seemed like eternity. I remember thinking, \\"Wow, this is probably the worst moment of my life.\\" I was wrong. Audioslave is like you stick Chris Cornell's whiny voice into a blender with Brad Wilk and YtimK's obvious hatred for music, and Tom Morello's \\"I-wish-I-was-Superman-because-I-want-to-save-the-world\\" attitude, puree, then pour it all down the sink because this album is TRASH.

Opportunities RATM had only come once in awhile. Their inability to set aside their personal differences for the good of their political agenda is truly a causality for progressive politics in the United States. It truly saddens me to see the rise of an \\"Audioslave\\" and the demise of a \\"Rage Against the Machine.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"no surprises","review":"I bought this CD on the strength of the Cochise single. I thought the powerful guitar and great singing would lead to a great album. As it turns out, the singing is without any real surprises, nothing very melodic or musically interesting. No twists, no turns.The guitaring is powerful, but also dull. A few cool tricks here and there, mostly in the 'cool noises' category, but nothing to make me perk up and listen carefully.Also, I found the dynamics were flat and boring. Since I wrote this originally, the music has grown on me (well 2 songs have)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Stuff!","review":"Take a piece of Soundgarden (a premier band of the early '90's) and combine it with pieces of arguably the most politcal band of the late twentieth century (Rage against the Machine), and what comes out is something fresh and unique! Audioslave provides all the sounds of modern rock'n roll, with excellent, versitalle vocals, and even some hints of classic rock. Don't miss tracks 1, Cochise, and 8, I am the Highway, the best two on the album. Enough talk, though. Pick this one up and experience it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best new rock bands.","review":"When I first got Audioslave I was taken a chance on it. I never heard of them befor. I think it is one of the best new rock bands out ther. I think if you have not got it yeat go get it now. You will not be disapointed at all. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ratm plus chris cornell. good","review":"This is a good cd. It's an interesting combination of rage minus de la roche plus cornell. It's definitely not rage, but Morello's solos rip through the tracks, and they just sound cool. In my opinion that's the best part of the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"heavy guitar-driven rock","review":"Audioslave is a unique combination of Rage guitar riffs and Soundgarden lyrics and voice. Those looking for either a Rage or Soundgarden sound will be disappointed. All the songs are heavy guitar-driven tunes with depressing lyrics (all written by Chris Cornell).With the other boy-rock bands out there (linkin park, matchbox twenty), this is a refreshing alternative. The music is nothing innovative or mysterious - straightforward rock is what I say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good...","review":"Slow at times, a little too long, but a great debut with four or five very strong songs. This gives me hope for the future of music. Standout track: I am the Highway."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Go on and save yourself!\\"","review":"It's so nice to hear RATM be able to rock -- and I mean ROCK --without being bogged down by the politically inspired messages so prevalent in the Zach de la Rocha years. The new voice the band has welcomed provides something of a rebirth and a cleansing of the messages that, while impactful, frequently got in the way of the band's musical superiority."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock n' Roll at it's finest","review":"Rage against the Machine's TOM MORELLO, BRAD WILK AND TIM team up with former SoundGarden frontman Chris Cornell to make the best hard rock experience of the year!

A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAN OF RAGE OR THE GARDEN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better than this!","review":"This is hands down my favorite album of all time. As some of the other reviewers said, it combines the best of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine.I really wish they would get back together. I saw them in concert in 2005 and it's still to this day one of my favorite shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, maybe classic, but still not as good as Soundgarden or Rage Against the Machine","review":"While I can't argue this is a well-crafted album (maybe one of the best-produced albums of the last 20 years), it feels really...slick. Over-polished. Not at all 'raw'. Audioslave is a great piecing-together of two great bands (Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine), but it feels almost too deliberate. This doesn't make Audioslave's self-titled debut album a bad listen by any means. It just feels overly radio-friendly, and not as subversive as one would like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audioslave is awesome","review":"You have to get this cd it really is just top of line work. They have very inspiring lyrics and its just truely beautiful. Do yourself a favor and buy this cd because its like looking at god and having him smile with greatness at you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"It might not break new ground, but none the less, this album is good. The guitar work is Tom Morello's unique style, playing everything from great arena rock riffs, to acustic mellow tunes. When it comes to the rest of the band (drums, bass, vocals) it is pretty generic, yet, it has a lot of soundgarden in it, not much Rage Against The Machine. Still, this album is pretty good and if this band proceed on making music like this, we will have a classic in here.Highlights: \\"Like A Stone\\", \\"Cochise\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the Beginning","review":"As these guys keep playing together they are really going to get a lot better, but thats not to say this album wasn't of high quality, as one reviewer said, I was expecting something purely legendary. The song structure is pretty generic and seems like childs play compared to some of those Soundgarden epics. But, the musicianship is first rate, the lyrics are pretty good and Cornell's voice is of course, divine. The drumming is servicable but nothing really extraordinary. Morello does enough great stuff on the guitar to make this a good listen alone. There is not a single weak song on this album, only a few are mediocre, very good, very listenable album. The Best tracks are: Like A Stone, Shadow of the Sun, Last Remaining Light, I am the Highway and Cochise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"This album is, and will continue to be, my all time favorite. Every track is solid. Their opening song-cochise, bring me into the mood of the album immediately. Very catchy. Gasoline isn't that catchy, but the lyrics are top-notch. What you are and Like a Stone are solid tracks that present deep and thoughtful lyrics. Shadow of the sun, exploder and getaway car are solid tracks.The best track in the album is no doubt \\"I am the highway\\". Solid and catchy tune throughout the whole song. I find this song to be really addictive and it stayed in my stereo for a long time.All in all, this album presents over 1 hour of solid music, and it's worth every cent of its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"I have always been a huge RATM fan and a pretty big fan of Soundgarden. But when I heard of Audioslave, I wasnt expecting anything of this high of quality. I was unbelievably impressed with every track on the CD. Cornell shows his talents as a vocalist and Morello shows his amazing ability as a guitarist, while Tim and Brad complete the sound that is called Audioslave. As other reviewers have mentioned, this CD is not hardcore nu-metal or any new genre. It is just plain good ol' rock'n'roll. Standout tracks on the album are difficult to decide on such an excellent CD, but I would reccomend: Show Me How to Live, Light My Way, Exploder, Gasoline, and The Last Remaining Light. In my opinion one of the best rock albums to come out in the 21st century and my favorite CD by far right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I thought I would like this CD based on the songs that get radio play, but I was sorely disappointed! On the more melodic songs, Chris Cornell's voice just ruins the entire thing, plus he can't carry a melody unless he's yelling. Nasty, this Cd is just gross. It's Rage with a new singer - wow, that's really original. I suggest writing some more original lyrics and creating a new sound, not just cashing in on the old sounds of rage and soundgarden. That shows originality alright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Cornell is back!!!","review":"With all the mediocrity on the radio these days it is no wonder this album stands out. However, some of the production is overblown, and some of the slower tracks should have simply been trashed. That criticism aside, Chris Cornell is back to his old howling self. Praise the Lord! After his sullen and unimpressive solo effort, \\"Euphoria Morning\\"(zzzzzzzzzzzz), his vocals on this album mark a return to form. Easily the best rock singer of the grunge era, it was a shame to hear him singing in such limited range when his talent demands so much more. I hope these guys stick together. Their future looks promising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy It For \\"Like A Stone\\"","review":"This fusion of Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine is much more of a win for Soundgarden fans than Rage fans. You will not find any of the hip-hop influences or rich grooves often found on a Rage CD. That said, this is not that great of a CD. It is almost painful to listen to it from start to finish. The first 5 tracks are tolerable with the best tracks as bookends. \\"Cochise\\" starts the CD off strong, but sadly the CD cannot maintain the momentum. The opener is followed by 3 run-of-the-mill tracks that can be listened to, but quickly forgotten. The legacy of this band will certainly be \\"Like A Stone\\". This track is worth the price of admission. Chris Cornell works the catchy lyrics much like he did on \\"Blackhole Sun\\".If you buy the CD, you will probably find yourself listening to \\"Cochise\\", skipping to \\"Like A Stone\\", and repeating. The other tracks are either uninteresting or plain aweful."},{"rating":"1","title":"just average hard rock","review":"It's always good to see Chris performing,but this project is a big retrocess in his career. I thought that with Euphoria he was making some progress...but he has returned to his roots,just rock.Buy this if you wanna headbang a little, or \\"amaze at the great lyrics\\"...I reccomend you go get Ultramega OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular - Extreme display of raw emotional vocals","review":"Wow is all I have to say about this cd. It is just awesome. I mean the raw emotion you can hear in Chris Cornell's voice when he sings songs Like A Stone, or Shadow of the Sun just make this CD falt out spectacular. Quite possibly the BEST CD I own or have ever heard. The songs are just so awesome. Heavy guitar rifts, mixing with heavy drums and raw, emotional vocals make this CD what it is. There is not one bad sng on the entire CD, but, my favorite songs go in from the Cd go in this order:1. Like Stone2. Shadow Of The Sun3. Getaway Car4. Show Me How To Live5. Exploder6. Cochise7. What You Are8. Gasoline9. The Last Remaining Light10. Set It Off11. Light My Way12. Bring Em Back Alive13. I Am The Highway14. Hypnotize"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I only like 4 songs on this cd......\\"Cochise\\" is OK, \\"Like a Stone\\" is about the best one, \\"I am the Highway\\" is ok, and \\"Show me how to live\\" is good......the rest of the songs drag on and are BORING.

Chris Cornell's vocals are bad. Why does this guy get such praise for that high whiney voice?. Its annoying as hell.Anyway this band is weird, I dont know what to make of them. When listening to the old RATM I felt like kicking the sh-t out of someone. Their music had an empowering presence.Audioslaves music however, seems like some self pitty bull sh-t.Bring back Zach or Get Chuck D on vocals. We need someone with some balls to sing"},{"rating":"1","title":"I took a chance","review":"Wow, how much do I not like this album--lets just say I'm still trying to work my way up to a second listen. The only songs I really like are the ones I'd heard before I bought the album. I could have just played them on YouTube and been happy. There are only five good songs on the whole thing, in my book that's not good enough. I found myself getting irritated little over halfway through. What is going on here? I thought I found a sure bet and all I found was regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Slave to their Audio (Sorry, that's corny)","review":"I was a bit disappointed with this album. After all the fuss \\"Like a Stone\\" got on MTV and such, I figured the album would be impressive. It's as if they were trying to please everyone. Some songs are angry and cynical, others are mushy and metaphorical. Good bands are able to easily attract people on different levels with one cd, but this was not one of those bands. Of course, \\"Like a Stone\\" was okay and \\"I Am the Highway\\" is pretty good, but the rest of the album isn't worth listening to. Go buy some Radiohead instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the Greatest","review":"Honestly this is the best piece of music I have ever heard. I can't name a single bad thing about this album. This is an album that every fan of rock/alternative should own. The bassist, Tim Commerford, makes every song have a great tune which flows with Chris Cornell's voice. Every song on this album is a highlight but I guess there are a few that stick out from the rest. Those songs include: Bring 'Em back Alive, Light my Way, Set It Off, What You Are, Cochise, Hypnotise and..well lets just say all the songs on the album are my favourites. The last thing I'd have to say is simply... BUY THIS CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very original","review":"this isn't nessecarily a terrible album, however the problem for me was that it really didn't break any new ground; these guys are still pulling out the same bone-headed riffs that groups like AC/DC and Black Sabbath did 30 years ago. i heard cochise on the radio before i had heard the rest of the album and i was really excited coz its a really catchy song, however i found the rest of the album was very hear-one song you've heard em all, not including \\"i am the highway\\" which i think is a shocking ballad. if i want to hear well constructed ballads i'll stick to my ben folds five and coldplay. if you want well-constructed heavy metal/rock listen to tool or rage against the machine, when morello, wilk and tim bob were actually making decent political statements in their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got to love that chris cornell voice !","review":"I've always loved Chris Cornells voice, so to hear it teamed up with Tom Morello's incredible & unique guitar playing.....what more could you want.Great record !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The wait is over...","review":"Audioslave have finally released the long awaited \\"stunning\\" album.The articulated torent of hard-core rock accompanied by the melodic and astounding vocal capablities of Chris Cornell.A must for anyone with taste...:o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I had some reservations, but not anymore...","review":"It's not Soundgarden, and it's not Rage: it's just Audioslave. The name may be cheesy, but the music speaks for itself. It's a blend of thundering guitar riffs in \\"Set It Off\\" and \\"Show Me How To Live\\" that only be from Tom Morello and soul-pounding songs like \\"I Am the Highway\\" and \\"The Last Remaining Light\\" that have established Cornell as the most versatile singer of the past two decades. There are a few slow moments in the album with \\"Like A Stone,\\" but make no mistake, rock has finally returned to the ariways. I really didn't care for the CD upon the first listen, but after the second, I was on board."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool NEW band has a lot to offer","review":"Rage and Soundgarden were two powerful, important bands of the 90's, helping define a sound that carried rock in their time.

HUGE LOSS of the older style","review":"This T-shirt, while still of Danskin's always-wonderful quality (that's why I gave it any stars), is unfortunately not a good replacement for the #3735 tees I used to purchase as my only nightshirts -- I loved the sturdy but lighter, loose and comfy, and very nice, high-quality 100% cotton of that older \\"model\\" -- the fabric in this t-shirt is considerably heavier, and because it's made with a bit of Spandex, it isn't light or cool -- it is (to me) stretchy and bulky and consequently does not have a nicely flowing shape any longer -- not attractive if one is disguising a little extra \\"heft\\"...

I had sold it within weeks. Poor projection despite its shell material along with a fairly flat and lifeless tone. (And that piercing overring is NOT tone). A very limited tuning range.As it is not a true piccolo, it's hard to get that crack that one associates with a shallower drum; but due to the combination of shell material and the shallower depth of shell one finds it hard to get a fatback style tone either.

The content reviewed leaves out an extraordinary amount of information. I just took the test yesterday and there were at least twenty questions on the Praxis itself that concern topics which the CliffsTest didn't even mention, much less provide background information.

I took an entire semester on the Renassiance and Reformation and the book provided this period with 9 sentences. I found many typos and errors in the book (see other reviews for discrepancies in questions). The worst part I found however was to not be able to judge how I did on the practice test.

These are not difficult errors to fix on the part pf the editing/revision process before publication, but the errors do cause confusion, annoyance, and some additional anxiety when under pressure to prepare for an exam such as this.

While no book can adequately review all the content included in the Praxis, this one leaves out basics that should have been covered. However, it is good for a couple reasons... it has two practice tests. The practice tests seem to have the most typos. The best way I've found to study for these tests is to use a combination of things- old textbooks/lecture notes from college, cliffs notes of each individual section (econ, US history, etc.) and the actual prep book from ETS (which also had it's problems).

She has a good voice and these songs were pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grateful Australian Fan","review":"It appeared that Jennifer had all but disappeared altogether. This album was not realised in Australia but I am familiar with the original version of \\"These Days\\" by Bardot and I have found a copy of her greatest hits in a discount store. For those who enjoyed the melodic pop sounds of Jennifer's debut album, these are still present, only now with a tiny more edge. This realise is equally as radio friendly and the last but growth and maturity are self evident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively Somewhere should be everywhere","review":"My son had sought this DVD everywhere and has been unable to find it. I told him I would run a search on-line, and found it on Amazon. I printed it out and gave it to him and he asked me to purchase one from Woody's in California which was about halfway in price, but it was new. It came extremely promptly and my son listened to it and was so happy. He said it is wonderful and just pleased him entirely. Thank you for the opportunity to let everyone know how great it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer's back with a newer sound","review":"When I found out that Jennifer Paige was releasing a second CD I got so excited.I hadn't heard anything new by her since her first album(released in 1998)and was starting to think if she was just a singer who would put out only one hit CD.Well then I heard Positivly Somewhere and was blown away.Jennifer took these past few years to record and write a truely amazing CD.The CD has is filled with a ton of songs that could be potential radio hits.I really do hope Jennifer is here to stay for a very long time.A must have for anyone who loves music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best","review":"I bought this CD because I have her previous release, and I am truly dissapointed.In all truth, 'Jennifer Paige' (her first CD) was not really a masterpiece, but for a first release, it showed promise. Her voice is nice, and there were lots of catchy tunes (what you'd expect from a pop album), but 'Positively somewhere' makes you wonder where that somewhere is, exactly.The CD is one long list of flat tracks (12 in all). No single one stands out. I guess she was trying to play it safe, but the finished product came out quite lame.Guess I'll wait for the next one...and even then I'll try to listen to as many tracks as I can before buying it...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"understand the meaning of the word 'cover'","review":"just because you haven't heard a song sung before, does NOT make the song an original. they are still cover songs- she didn't write them and she didn't record them first. i really liked some of the song's catchiness but i'm very disappointed that jennifer paige would randomly cover 2 songs from plumb- making it seem like they were her own songs- and then sing them just like plumb sang them- without any real change/improvement in melody, tempo, etc. they ARE great songs but listen to the real thing- buy plumb's album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here...","review":"Sorry folks, for those of you who were hoping that Jennifer would release some new material worthy of the immense talent she showed potential for from her previous cd, you won't find it on this one. I bought this cd hoping for the best, but found it sitting unspun on my cd rack collecting dust a few days after I bought it. There is just nothing worth while to listen to on this disk, and I was really disappointed to here her cover version of the Tiffany Lee penned song \\"Here With Me\\" from the group Plumb. Don't waste your money on this unless you are looking for some uninspired pop or if you have some cash to burn and don't mind getting it as a filler to take space up on your wall after a couple of days. Sorry folks... but that's my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimaginative","review":"Her voice is okay but she doesn't have a strong, dedicated band and I was disappointed to see that she isn't writing much of her own stuff. Stranded and Here With Me were written by Tiffany Arbuckle whose band, Plumb, is much stronger than Jennifer's backup. Obviously this is just a case of a record company like Universal trying to push a pretty face and a decent voice to sell records, which is really a shame considering Plumb deserves more attention than they ever got."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing New Album from Jennifer Paige","review":"Sadly, Jennifer Paige is another forgotten artist in the world of \\"Pop\\". She doesn't get the recognition she deserves. When I first heard \\"Crush\\", I really liked her voice and her style of music, very catchy and different. I've been listening to \\"Positively Somewhere\\" in my car and I've been burning that CD up! This is an album that you don't get tired listening to. She is more mature and contemporary than say, \\"Brittany\\" and \\"Christina\\" and has way more talent! She has real talent and is a \\"true\\" artist. A natural talent, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, sad, SAD!!","review":"Jennifer Paige's voice is just as beautiful as her face. What a talent!! I remember seeing her perform the song \\"Crush\\" on the Today show, and I immediately bought the CD. What I loved about her was the fact that with the kind of talent and integrity she was displaying, there was NO WAY she was going to be heard on the radio. She seemed unwilling to sell out just to be popular. Well, after listening to this CD, obviously somewhere along the way she decided to sell out. Fortunately she hasn't sunk to the level of going around scantily clad and falling down drunk in public (thank God). This CD is so heavily studio-manufactured that it really doesn't even matter who's singing. It's a real shame, I'd love to see JP come out with a new CD, but for now, if you want to hear her purely beautiful voice, you'll have to stick with her first (self-titled) CD.BTW...Jennifer sang a song on the Disney movie \\"The Country Bears\\" called \\"Kick It In Gear\\" and she ROCKED an otherwise worthless movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paige can certainly get somewhere.","review":"\\"Stranded\\", the very first single off Paige's sophomore offering \\"Positively Somewhere\\" is oozing young Natalie Imbruglia but with a lesser edge. Such a very good rendition and I consider it much appealing than the original Plumb has recorded. She maintained her \\"girlie\\" image and that's what I like about her. \\"Here With Me\\" is a total standout along with the upbeat \\"Stay The Night\\", the ethereal \\"Vapor\\", \\"Way Of The World\\" and the very \\"insulting\\" \\"Not This Time\\" is just pure girl power! Nicely done here. The songs off the album are co-written by her and that plays a very vital role in interpreting each song and Paige all made them her own. Check out the very personal \\"You Get Through\\"... surely tears will run down... I just love this album. Why 4 stars only? her vocal range is somewhat limited, if she could reach or belt out a note like Tina Arena then I'll give her 5 stars. Still... the album is all good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same product in the picture","review":"I bought this product expecting to get a bottle of 120 capsules, which was shown in the picture, but ended up with the 60 capsule bottle at the same price.

The only times that I did was when the tears blurred the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranch of Dreams","review":"This is a very interesting book and very informative about animal issues.

I have tried getting each individually on cd format. However, they are all out of stock.So I was very delighted when the Ultimate Collection came along. Keith was a very unique singer. He sang his songs with passion, wit, and love. Simply put, Keith's music entertains and inspires like no other!The bonus DVD was well presented and I have to admit, it brought me to tears. This man served the Lord well during his time with us and he continues to serve through his legendary music. Keith will always remain a phenomenon, a sensation, and a testament to God's love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trip down memory lane!!!","review":"Wow! Keith Green's music never gets old! Excellent collection that has my wife & I singing along in the car. Great item to introduce our children to the wonders of Keith Green!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blessing To Own","review":"I purchased this CD/DVD set for my husband and we just absolutely love Keith Green and his music. I think other reviews have said it best so I'll just give my opinion and say that if you're debating on whether to buy this go ahead and do it. It's a wonderful blessing to hear such love and compassion and truth in his music. Too bad there are not more singers out there that are truly singing to God and praising him.The DVD is excellent as well. It's a must see and would be great to share with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"music","review":"Wonderful and inspiring. The dvd about his life was enjoyable. I had never heard of him before. Would recommend for others to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Sure brings back memories. Am glad I can listen to this in the car - all I had were cassette tapes which, of course, are old, old, old."},{"rating":"2","title":"honest","review":"I just loved the honest way he approaches the material. He is not perfect and that is what makes his voice so real. There is a real quality and passion in his voice, one that comes from in side the heart. It is also nice to play music that my friends enjoy and to hear them request to look at the liner notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rich, Warm Voice","review":"I had never heard Safina sing before and it was a pleasure to be introduced to him. He has a very rich voice, warm and emotional, but the songs began to sound alike to me as the album progressed. Perhaps that was due to my unfamiliarity with them. At any rate, I will be most interested to hear more of his singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This album is one of the best new albums I've heard in years. Safina has tremendous range, not only note-wise, but emotionally. Although I don't understand Italian, I feel I know exactly what he's singing about. As romantic and lushly produced as the material is, it never falls into saccharine or self-indulgence, because the material is so fine and Safina sings it as though he is living it.One can understand why his popularity is growing so fast in Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Che Bello!","review":"I was channel flipping and saw Alessandro singing \\"Luna\\" in an international song festival. As a professional singer married to an opera singer, I immediately sat straight up and continued to listen slack-jawed through the performance! How could I have not heard of this amazing singer before? As I don't have much time to browse the record store, I was thrilled to find his CD on Amazon.There is no comparison with Boccelli. Safina is far superior. His voice is rich, sexy and musical. He knows how to sing a song.Alessandro, ti sei maraviglioso!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Infinitely better than Russell Watson","review":"I do think that Safina is infintely better than Russell Watson, as Safina has a better and stronger voice and a much more secure singing technique. He looks even more imposing on the stage. He, instead of RUssell Watson, is the real singer of our times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When is his next album ?","review":"I found this wonderful voice from Moulin Rouge's soundtrack, track 4 - Your Song. I couldn't be happier when I got this album, but I have been wondering when his next album will be available.I have no issue with Andrea Bocelli, nor with Josh Gorban, but Safina's voice just way too addictive to put it aside. It's the true Tenor that uses his voice to wrap around you with power and emotion in every note."},{"rating":"1","title":"No taste","review":"Hibidee Shibbitz has no taste. Many people like opera. It is much better than the insipid pop, hip-hop, and R&B music available on the market today. He should go back to which ever hell hole (New Jersey) he came from.There are no opera tracks on this CD. Hibidee is very mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alessandro Safina","review":"He's definitely no Bocelli! When I listen to the clear and pure beauty of Andrea Bocelli's voice, I am filled with the passion he presents when he sings. He either brings me to tears or calms me. Alessandro Safina, on the other hand, did not show any feeling in his singing and I found his voice rather irritating. He has very little range. Maybe he should contact Bocelli for voice lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harsh","review":"this may possibly be the worst piece of music i've ever come across. Why anyone would think to combine techno with opera is totally beyond me. nobody likes opera. nobody likes techno. it stands to reason that the fusion of the two would be an abomination. this is an insult to the public's taste. ridiculous, completely ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not of this earth- Again??","review":"I have seen both remakes of Roger Corman's Not of this Earth, and I must say his 1957 version with Paul Birch and Beverly Garland was better! I'm truly not a supporter of remakes, because they never capture in my opinion, the original director or author's \\"touch of class.\\" I also don't understand why they haven't released Mr. Corman's 1957 version? Two remakes, but not the original on VHS? I think somebody has it backwards. Besides, Mr. Birch and Miss Garland have my vote any time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beg, borrow or steal the 1957 original","review":"This story has been made into a movie at least three times. Don't waste your time or money with this awful remake. The earlier version with Traci Lords is OK.. but the original is one of the forgotten classics of the 1950's.. There are often DVD or VHS copies available on EBAY. The quality of these transfers is not wonderful... but the movie is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not of This Earth","review":"Had only Traci Lords been in this re-make it might have been a little better movie. As it is the special effects are hohum and ordinary even by 1995 standards. The cast do a acceptable job with what they have to work with. Some bad writing and directing in this version brings up the question. Did any of the producers stop by the sets during the filming of this opus? Bottom line. Poorly done movie even for a re-make. Save your money on this one. Rent it if you must see it. Suggest the original R. Corman movie, or wait for the re-issue of the 1988 re-make just to see Traci in that little yellow (or was it blue) bikini. Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Corman...or Corman,s Corman.","review":"This film has nothing to do with the Traci Lords remake or \\" Not of This Earth\\" 1957/The 1957 film starred Paul Birch and Beverly Garland.The only interesting point here is the 28 years between the Corman film and his own remake.( exposing a true sign of the times)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy semi-stars crank it up to badly remake a masterpiece","review":"Michael York and Tracy Lords (York - Lords...where's her Royal Highness?) stumble their way through what was a classic 50's film by Roger Corman. Lately Michael York in a movie means they couldn't sober up that other actor they really wanted. And Tracy Lords can't wash off her porno image and slap on a pretense of being able to act. It's just a waste of time. Unless you'd prefer not to watch infomercials. I'd rather watch the infomercials."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disapointment","review":"While showing signs of thorough research, this book is peppered with errors and generally flawed by the author's extreme bias against airpower. A more evenhanded approach to the subject matter could have produced a winner from the material available but this is just another pseudo-scholarly rant against US involvement in SEA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of information","review":"Although the books is not a marvel or a classic piece of literature, it has a matter of fact style which gives the reader plentiful information and a welth of very well organised data regarding the Linebacker raids of 1972. John Smith writes with short, simple but powerful sentences and he also uses many first hand accounts, some of them from the Vietnamese side. I found especially useful the appendices which cover such topics as the air refuelling, the electronic war, the SEAD missions etc. The book is recommended for the serious students of the Vietnam air war, but a certain background of knowledge is necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foul Mouthed Loser","review":"Terrible song.

Her second single, far more superior to her earlier works, is not only the best song from the album, it is also the best song in the world!! This infectious little number is complete with a sexy, yet glamourously trashy, video and more disco than any revival material from the last few years. This girl really knows what she is doing. I brought the album months before the single was released, and my eyes still light up when it is played, 3 months after its release. It is the kind of song that has 'classic' written all over it and I'm sure I'll still be rockin' to it well into my fifties. Sophie, keep up the good work. The album is fantastic, you are fantastic and this single is truly divine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much static!","review":"I have the model without the answering machine.

My 4-year-old son finished it in less than an hour on Christmas Day. That's it? He enjoyed it enough to play it over again several times, but I felt cheated. The pictures you see on the box are pretty much the entire game. I think there are less than 20 areas, some of which only take a couple of minutes to get through.

I like to watch it every 3-4 months, which is why I had to get the DVD (my video tape version was about worn out).

I'm surprised by the other negative reviews about this movie.I am a recreational mountaineer myself, and have read many mountaineering adventure books. I wish there were more mountaineering movies.

Miles, taking the lead from Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon who, like Miles, lost the front man for their band but unlike Miles, remained active despite the death of SRV, releases the surprisingly good Blues Berries. The sound of the disc leans heavily toward that SRV Texas tone thanks to the superb guitar playing of Rocky Athas and the contributions of Layton and Shannon. While I was at first skeptical of the inclusion of \\"Tobacco Road\\", the band does a good job of freshening it up and, as it turns out, is surprisingly good.

Besides having the nihilist in the Anarchist Cookbook, there are countless parallels between the two movies. Best friends, tragedy, group of counter-culture hacks, counter-culture hacks disappear, etc. etc.It was ok I guess and mildy entertaining, but not something worth purchasing. If you can rent it or buy it used for under $5 then sure, it might be worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird movie","review":"It's kind of a goofy movie. Nothing like what I expected. It's neither a comedy or a drama. A little of both. It follows a group of young people (well except the leader is old) who want to change the world but really just living haphazardly. More like hippies than anarchists. It's a group that looks out for each other...until Johnny Black comes into their lives and remakes the group into his idea of how it should be. Which is very destructive. Most leave. Puck doesn't like the changes and leaves but returns to take care of the remaining original members.I really disliked the ending. It was interesting in a mildly entertaining way but I can't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"I tried so hard to give this movie a chance. Right away, I noticed similarities to movies such as 'Fight Club', 'SLC Punk', and even 'Suburbia'. I recommend any of these three films, but can't do so for this one. Now that I think about it, it even features a basketball game that smacks of a scene from 'American History X'.From the first couple of minutes on, this film offered nothing original. From a technical standpoint, the shots are static and seem to go on too long. The writing is pitiful. The dialogue is unbelievable and made me roll my eyes so much that I memorized the inside of my eyelids.The extras are scarce; only a commentary from the director. I'd be willing to bet that there were enough goofs to warrant a gag-reel. With one of those, this may have scored two stars.Bottom line: the movie is distant, plodding, and predictable. The actors bring nothing original to the table. Some scenes seem meant to shock but fall short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Silly Ridiculous","review":"This mess is easily the worst attempt at portraying the punk/anarchist movement ever made. Add the horrible acting and idiotic conversation, and you got......just what you'd expect. Nothing Worth Watching! Boring soundtrack adds to the nauseating affect this will have on the viewer. Geez, tough lead character. Wears a pink button down shirt. The scenarios are crap, and sometimes border on preachy. Garbage through and through. Nothing funny in their attempts at humor. There's nothing going for this thing at ALL!! You gotta watch it just to see how horrendous and dull it actually. is. I warned you. Rent, do not buy. Unbelievable. SLC Punk thrashes this feeble attempt. One star for the gorgeous young ladies in this and the other star out of pure charity because I'm in a good mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Although the movie did have a few redeeming qualities, I found it disappointing. As a student at Susman's high school and a memeber of the scene that his movie tried to represent, I was upset with the way it was portrayed. This is not because it was portrayed in a negative way, but because it was simply false. If it had been set in a different city with a different scene, I might have reacted differently, but it seemed horribly unrealistic and shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring, very slow, horrible script.","review":"The idea for this movie could have been good. But whoever wrote it needs a serious crash course on punk and what is means, and more importantly what it meant when it first became a major movement.The story moves painfully slow, having no real plot line whatsoever, and constantly changing direction. The acting leaves a lot to be desired, as does the basic script, as if the horrible outline wasn't bad enough, even the actors lines are written by someone who obviously doesn't know how to write, or write for the type of film this was supposed to be.I could not even finish this movie, it was that bad. I love indie films, and have a lot of respect for the people that put all that time and effort in making them, but this film flat out sucks. I don't recommend it for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorous","review":"This movie is so, so bad. Particularly the ending, which gave it an after school special kind of feel. The only reason I can recommend watching this is so you can marvel at how ridiculous it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully Bad","review":"This movie is a complete misrepresentation of both anarchy as a philosophy and I hope it also misrepresents the way anarchists think. I'm not familiar with such a subculture as the one portrayed in this movie, but the logic employed by these characters is totally contrived, frivelous and ridden with cliches. Simply put, the writer is not smart enough to write to be writting about this stuff. I assure you that my hatred for this flick is not rooted in personal politics...its rooted in anger because I lost about 6 dollars to blockbuster and 2 hrs of valued leisure time. Anyone beyond a prepubescent brain capacity should NOT enjoy this movie. If anything, it has marginal comedic value as being a completely ridiculous joke but if that's what your looking for its still not very entertaining. That so many adults appreciated this film makes me very cyinical with regards to the general population and their capacity to think."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this movie","review":"I found this movie to be extremely boring, and difficult to sit through.

I walked in, watched one scene and said,\\"What, for the first scene of this did they flash the definition of anarchy?\\" Yes, this pedantic piece ... reads like a none too subtle right-wing rebuttal of Fight Club. The leader is caricatured as a pedophile, and the idealistic young rebels soon descend into drug use, petty crime, and eventually jail time. Fortunately the main character is redeemed by a ... young republican co-ed, and he rediscovers the joy of borgeouis sterility just in time.

But Kinski's presence in this bizarre creation amounts to perhaps ten percent overall, and as always his voiced is dubbed. 2) The story may be based on an Edgar Wallace novel but the events portrayed in this movie never make any sense at any time. 3) Besides the extraneous footage mentioned, whenever the story threatens to become predictable or just plain stupid, the events portrayed always revert to the exceedingly bizarre. 4) I can't really say this is a \\"good\\" movie (even as a good bad movie) but the attempt to film a murder mystery with multiple twists to the plot becomes so tortured and incoherent that it is well worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get unless you just have nothing else to watch","review":"I like old scary movies, but these two are just not up to par.

Having been a longtime Michael Crawford fan, I was intrigued to learn he was recording a CD of Disney music. He has chosen some of the most moving and memorable songs from some of my favorite Disney films. The songs are all perfectly suited to Michael as a singer, and he brings his own fresh, gentle interpretation to each one. One wonderful thing about Michael is, since he has such a strong background in theater, as one listens to the CD, one can imagine his acting each part and feeling each emotion. As a Disney fan, the songs will bring back happy and sweet memories of some of their classics. As a Michael Crawford fan, you will certainly enjoy his renditions of some familiar and beloved songs. He has another wonderful recording here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD - I looked forward to this for a long time.","review":"I am a huge Michael Crawford fan and I looked forward to the release of this CD.

I am beginning to think that there is nothing that Michael Crawford cannot do when it comes to music. He has success with absolutely everything. This album has already gone platinum in Australia.I look forward to a tour, but seeing as how Michael is going to be starring in \\"Dance Of The Vampires\\" on Broadway, this may not be for a while.GREAT CD!

If Michael Crawford's Disney Album is a reflection of the times, the days of youthful Disney are gone. Taking the majority of songs from more modern Disney features, Crawford sings such despairing hits as \\"I will go sailing no more\\" from Toy Story and \\"I know the truth\\" from Aida. His once robust voice now lulls these not-very-cheerful ditties and instead of putting a magical smile on your face, you're only left with a saddened heart.

The Disney Album is no exception! Firstly, he wraps his voice around these pop-rock tunes, which, to say the least, are a bit different from the majority of songs found on most of his albums. Then, not only does he adapt to this new style, but he envelopes these famous songs which we have known for years and re-invents them, making them his own and adding powerful depth and expression to each note. It is truly a very moving experience to hear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"Michael has a way of taking any song and making it his.

It was good, but not a major thriller. I'm sorry I spent the cash on it when I could have checked it out @ the library. But it is a rather good read and deserves a 7 at lest, which is what I'm giving it. It has no real plot and the characters are kinda weak, even though you find yourself falling into them at some points. But other than the few parts of action and sex, this books holds little for a vampire book fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book is nothing like any of the Anne Rice books (people think it is just because it takes place in the american south and deals with a vampire).This book had very little in the way of vampire lore, and read more like a romance novel than a horror novel. The language was not as good as Anne Rice's either.I, too was hoping this would read like an Anne Rice book, but was disappointed (especially after browsing the horror section of the bookstore for almost an hour, looking for a good vampire story - most of the books seemed really cheesy, based on the description). I am confident that Wendy Haley will never replace Anne Rice as the queen of the supernatural. The caliber of writing in the Rice books is much higher (at least when comparing them to \\"These fallen angels\\".As an aside (and as my personal opinion), the Anne Rice's witch books (especially the first two) are even better than her vampire books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great new take on cyborg-police anime.","review":"Finally there's a new police anime, I've been waiting since 8-Man, Angel Cop and Tank Police for a good series.

So if you like cyborgs and police-inspired anime, look no further than Heat Guy J, it's a fantastic new series that I'm sure will keep getting better and better.Buy this ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I'M GOING TO THE OVERGROUND..\\"!","review":"Heat guy j is a cross between ROBOCOP and COWBOY BEBOP with elements of T2 thrown in for good measure.J is part machine,part man and all philosipher, i love the interatction between j and daisuke, even clair leonetti AKA Vampire is likable as the main villian. (check out the epidsode where he has his accountant read poetry while guns are pointed at him lol.) each epidsoe is slightly different form the other.and the music is the best since bebop's especially the opening intro theme FACE sung by TRYFORCE. Vampire's theme is cool also..methinks i will get the soundtrack. anyway i highly recommend this series for sci-fi action otakus. it's no ghost in the shell, but it stands on it's own. \\"you don't be afriad\\" to give this series a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are better deals on this anime.","review":"You can get the first 3 dvds for the price of one individual, but for some reason on Amazon you can't.

I have loved this movie for years, as all I have shown it to, do also. This movie appears to be copied from a VHS format without the fundamentals that I was accustomed to in DVD format.

My kids found it to be very funny as well and several of their friends have now seen it. There are a couple of swear words, but not nearly as bad as today's movies. There are so many one-liners in this movie that we'll often throw one out here and there, and everyone gets a good chuckle.If you're looking for a cute and funny movie that you and your teen or older children would enjoy, you should put this on your \\"to consider\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilariously Funny","review":"Unlike some comedy that isn't really funny, this movie is just that.

Granted it's not the greatest album of the period, but it's a pretty darn good one. Voyeur and Does It Make You Remember- two great songs, plus the standouts Looker, Merc Man and the fun Thrill of the Grill. And it's great to hear them on CD. But after nearly 20 years, I'll still expect to hear those pops from the vinyl copy I have. I can't wait to have all my Kim Carnes' LPs on CD's shortly. Buy early buy often!

I took out the bass button cover to see if I could do anything to fix it, and I was very negatively surprised by the poor quality of the valves and the poor craftmanship. I just put the cover back and returned the instrument. Thanks to Amazon. com for one of the best and more generous return policies in the retail business. As far as the Barcelona accordions brand is concerned, I think that, even for such a low price, it is possible to find better products.After having returned the Barcelona accordion, I subsequently purchased for the same price an accordion \\"Bonetti\\", made by Parrot (China) with the same number of bass and keys, and in all honesty it is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recomended","review":"This book, explains in detail too much of the writing section, but not good on the \\"critical reading\\" and math sections. The math questions they provide does not align with the real questions asked in the New SAT. It has good explinations of the practice test, but the content wasnt all that great. I especially hated when this book gives you a list of words to remember and make you write them in cards. The other publishers GIVE you the cards, that you can just tare out, so that's the biggest downside. Again i do not recomend this, use Princeton, MCGraw, or Barrons.

An American woman is found on the beach clad only in a bra. We eventually find out she was raped and strangled and drowned. So even though there would be bruises of all kinds and other evidence of rape, its decided she just drowned. Her BFF comes over from America obsessed with the idea she was murdered and then at the end of the movie suddenly decides she committed suicide and leaves. I could forgive all this if the killer didn't get away with it. All we are left with at the end is that the brutal deed was done and no one suspects or cares that it happenned. Stana Katic is great. With her drippy hair and glasses you only occasionally see the beautiful woman we see on Castle. But every once in a while you catch a glimpse of how beautiful she is even pre-nose job. Her acting is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I purchased these about 18 months ago. I have broken 2 bowls, 4 of the small plates and 1 large plate.

It's a fun & quick read. But you'll want to start right in on the second book as soon as you finish this one so maybe it isn't such a quick read!Part of the reason this book is so enjoyable is that it isn't just about romance. The premise of this trilogy is that 3 friends commit to doing something they have avoided because of their fears.The three friends are the kind of women I wish I had as freshman year roommates. Their friendship and advice (via online chat) is also an important part of the book and gives the plot extra interest.I've just started the second book of the series and already wish there would be a book about Jane, their 4th suitemate and the author of the self-help book that starts Maddy, Christine and Amy on their individual fear-challenging adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old flames reignited","review":"Almost Perfect (Perfect Trilogy)This is the first book that I've read by Julie Orleton.

Everything feels realistic and it could happen to you.Maddy and Joe are old high school flames that are given a second chance to work through past problems when she takes a job at his mother's summer camp.

Her aptly named \\"Perfect\\" trilogy has a terrific premise: three friends discover they're the anonymous subjects of a fourth friend's book on how to maximize one's potential and live life to the fullest. Each book in the trilogy explores the experience of one of the friends as she follows the book's advice. In this first book, widowed Maddy decides to fulfill her long-dormant dream of being an artist, never expecting that that pursuit will land her in the path of Joe, her long-ago boyfriend. Sparks fly, conflicts ensue, but through it all Maddy does figure out how to overhaul her life and open her heart to love. This novel does all the right things.

Maddy is the first to begin that challenge. She has one year to get her art work in a gallery. Along the way she rekindles an old love, but will it break her heart all over again?

Quick and easy to read, they take you on a fun ride through three main characters, one in each book, who are interconnected to each other.

You become sufficiently interested in the character so that you want to keep reading to find out their stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"This was a great book.

Yes, this is a romance novel, but there was just constant sex here and there. No substance, no struggle, no depth to the story. Man gets mad, woman gets mad, fight turns to passionate sex. Didn't see THAT coming. Oh wait, he's mad again. Well, you know how the story ends. I'm not saying this was a horrible read, but it's just not a great read.

It makes a great \\"shared\\" reader, and has a message that will resonate with most two and three-year olds. Be prepared to read this book to your toddler again and agian.Because of the large print, and limited number of words on the page, older kids might also enjoy tackling it and doing some \\"independent\\" reading. However, the book does not use many sight words, so would require a lot of initial parental help or a good handle on phonics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was disappointed by the organization. This CD focuses mainly on letter recognition rather than accurate letter-sound association. The directions for each task were difficult to understand. The introduction was too long. I work with a special education population and programs whose introduction is long loses the attention of many of the children. There was confusion between letter names and the sound they produce within words. The program included blends in the letter/sound recognition tasks which is confusing for children; often, these concepts are taught in simple one syllable words avoiding words with digraphs and blends."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Need More Clues Blue !!!","review":"My problem with this CD is the lack of concise instructions.My husband and I had a hard time figuring out how to make the words ,and where to place them.Also, alot of the games are so convoluted.I think that the real reason my three year old hasn't gotten discouraged and stopped playing is because it's Blue.Plese more clues Blue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good one mom's & dad's!!","review":"My son who is 3 yrs old loves this game.

His take, as a \\"black Briton,\\" has enough distance to get all the historical, social, economic connections that we Americans usually miss, and enough compassion for the underdog to be compelling and persuasive. The comparisons with his native UK are fascinating, unexpected, and often very funny.My favorite bit is his description of preparing for his first US visit. The much-trashed American book \\"The Bell Curve\\" had estimated that blacks were 15 IQ points lower than others, but then friends had told him that Americans mentally add 20 IQ points to anyone who speaks with a British accent. So he'd still come out 5 points ahead in their perceptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening film","review":"As a surfer, I was interested in this movie regardless of Clay's surfing style or autistic nature. I hadn't even heard of him before this film, but it completely engrossed me for 50 minutes. His background, family support, intellect and absolutely bizarre talent unfold in this beautiful film. He is an inspiration and definitely fantastic to witness in action. I am following his professional career more and see his ability and talent with a fresh perspective. It's one of the best surf films and documentaries I've seen in the past 10 years. Don't be shy to see it if you aren't a surfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Tripefest","review":"The only way Screamers: Hunting could be mistaken for anything but a bad bad bad bad flick is if your television set was broken, all you heard was the audio and you suffered from narcolepsy.

I have to admit that at the start I wasn't really feeling the book, but once I kept reading it got better and better. The plot is basically about a young boy named Attila whom is searching to find peace of mind. The struggle of his family and love life are the central plot. Attila's interests in imperfection made him quite the character. He wasn't your everyday adolescent boy that dreamed of the perfect woman. The irony is extremely intense and adds on to the suspense. Although it is fiction, I couldn't really pin-point what was unreal which made the book very realistic. I would highly recommend this book to teenagers or those who enjoy reminiscing on their teenage years. I give the novel five stars due to the awfully real image it depicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attila: A barbarian's Love Story by Peter Hargitai","review":"The romantic title of this novel shouldn't deceive readers into thinking it's some sappy, coming of age, starcrossed lovers tale. Because although it is coming of age and the lovers do appear to be starcrossed it is anything but sappy. The author's writing style is a lyrical sort of narrative but not too involved in poetic descriptions that you get lost inbetween adjectives. It's sometimes blunt and depicts a family for what it is and can be as well as what two people will stand up against when love is the only thing they can see and want to ever see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Love Story Too!","review":"Peter Hargitai's novel, \\"Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story\\", is not only based on true accounts but written in such a way that the reader can relate to every situation that Attila goes through. When Attila laughed and cried, so did I, not to be corny. Attila's pursuit of life and love, takes readers on a journey of his (Attila) life. When Attila meets Millie, so do we (the readers). When Millie gets mad at Attila, so do we. It is one of those novels where you can relate to most of the main characters in your own way. There is a little of Attila in all of us, because we all long to experience life, love, and happiness, with those many bumps along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting and Romantic Journey.","review":"Atilla: A Barbarian's Love Story is an exciting yet romantic novel that will leave you satisfied after reading it. From beginning to end this book will keep you coming back for more. It is based on a true story about a man named Attila falling in love with a woman named Millie and all the struggles they encountered. What I loved most about this book though is how easily you can relate to many of the characters in the story. This book is a good read and I would definitely recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Struggle","review":"Personally, I found the book very entertaining and really liked it a lot. It is about a young boy named Attila, who fled from Hungary with his family to be enriched with America's opportunities. There Attila grows up, confront his family, and meets the love of his life. Attila takes you through his experiences as a sexually and generally frustrated teenager and leaves you with eager anticipation. It's also very easy to relate to because it deals with struggles amongst his family members such as prejudice and competition between siblings. It also deals with struggles in his relationship. The Character Development is excellent. Even though him and Millie have a beautiful and loving relationship it does show their hard times too. The book starts off a little slow, but before you know it, you are engaged in the Character's lives and just can't wait to see what is going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel","review":"Atilla: A Barbarians love Story a great novel. It explores many different aspects like culture differences, racism, love, parental dissaproval, and hate. There are many dimensions to it. It is full of passion and it is obvious the author is too. Beautifully written, raw and real! It has all the makings of a great novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story!","review":"Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story is a wonderfully written autobiography by Peter Hargitai. It is the story of a young boy who stands up for what he believes in, even if it means standing against his own family. Many people think that the beginning of this book was not the best but if we really think about it, trying to escape from Hungary as a young boy must have been a really scary experience for Attila. The suffering and pain that Attila goes through in this book is more than some people can handle, but he has great determination and comes out strong. This is a very touching story and makes readers realize that as much as we may think our lives are horrible, there is always someone out there who is going through something much worse. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for wonderful and inspirational book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Barbarian's Love Story","review":"Irony, agony, and love are the major elements in Peter Hargitai's novel, Atilla: A Barbarian's Love Story. Atilla's struggle to free himself from the shackles of the past customs is an emotional rollercoaster.His post-modern fiction would be appreciated by generations who find themselves agonized by people's rejections of the joining of multicultural societies. Some may criticize the novel for the ordinary love story, however, it's what makes it worthy to read. Peter Hargitai was anything but close-minded about the current \\"melting pot\\" in America, and this is what the world needs. Even if the beginning may not be in sync with the rest of the book, it's a nice sense of Hungarian history. Despite some technical errors, the overall jist of the novel is enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching story of a boy's journey through life","review":"Attila: A Barbarians Love Story\\", is a remarkable book about a young adolescents journey through life. This book is a great read for teenagers and young adults because you find yourself relating to the main character, Attila, who is experiencing some of the hardships of growing up. While reading this book, you can almost see it as a movie being played out on the big screen. It is a fabulously written piece that touches on every subject imaginable such as sexuality, puberty, first love, a dysfunctional family, etc. Parts of this book will make you bust a gut laughing, and others will leave you in tears. This book is by far one of the best reads of my young life, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read a timeless novel, as well as discover an utterly brilliant author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story","review":"Attila proved itself to be a marvelous and compelling work of art. The title alone grabbed my attention from the moment I first purchased the novel. Hargitai imprisoned the struggle of life not only as an immigrant trying to find himself in a new environment, but also as a confused hormone driven adolescent. This is a story filled with passion, love, and adventure. I recommend this book to everyone; it's a great inspiration from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story","review":"\\"Attila: A Barbarian's Love Story\\", is an intense story that makes you see life in a different way. This book shows Attila's ups and downs. Even though some people get an easier life, this book shows many problems you may never face. I thought the book was great, showing different sides, for instance how some people are cruel to others, making them feel bad or frustrated, but at the same time how they start growing and maturing. I think this is what I like the most about the book, at the beginning showing how Attila was a fearful boy and at the end rebelling going where he wanted it to go, getting things done his way. I really recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"product did not fit","review":"did not work/fit on my 91 Honda accord LX front drivers door what nowto much to ship it back"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anglocentric and Biased","review":"Basically this books takes the idea that Indians were just waiting around to prove themselves loyal to whites, meaning we just couldn't wait to become Tontos to white people's Lone Ranger.

The text is an excellent resource for students or curious readers new to the groups studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting memoirs marred by tiresome editors","review":"A lot of the personal essays in here from women who were on the frontlines of the \`70s feminism are interesting. But the editors are tiresome. The best thing that can be said is they didn't get out of their own way. Their \\"dissection\\" of people's personal lives is unnecessary--readers (especially the college-aged readers this book is undoubtedly intended for) are intelligent enough to form their own conclusions. And why do the editors focus solely on black and white relations--what about Latinos, Asians, Native Americans, and Arabs? And why not a single essay from a feminist with a disability?Also, the editors disbelief at one of the memoirists' moving story about marching in the civil rights movement with her father is especially offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided thesis","review":"Venkatesh is pushing the thesis that the lives of the residents in the 'projects' have been too pessimistically portrayed by other authorities, and that for long periods of time they in fact managed to get along pretty well, through various informal and often criminal survival mechanisms they developed.That is, as I say, his thesis. I am reminded of a story of a man who fell out the 40th story window of an office building. Mid way down, with his eyes firmly closed, he imagined himself flying.\\"So far, so good,\\" he said.This author records comparable delusions, and the state of free-fall that of necessity must end.

Plus, you end up entering much of the same info into many checklists over and over again. Worse, the text is really painful to read. It's not broken down into bite-size pieces or written in plain-English. And I have to agree with Mr. Bingham that it is hard to use the CD-ROM because you have to click into each folder to see what's there and then click into BOTH the PDF forms and text forms folders, because sometimes the forms in the two folders are just duplicates of each other while other times a form only exists in one folder or the other.

First, it contains too many subjective opinions to be properly 'scientific'. Second, Green's sarcasms are often so biting and his views so negative, that it is likely to kill the lay persons' fascination for the subject. Furthermore, his views on art and architecture is often at variance with most authorities. A case in point is the Laocoon, which in Green's opinion is a dreary piece of art. Great artists such as Michelangelo and Rubens clearly did not share this view. I am not saying that it is not allowed to share a few personal opinions in such a vast book, but in this case it clearly diminishes the value of the text for both the professional historian and the lay person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"Green is a stuffy self-important bore, judging by this tome.

Naylor obviously has a wonderful voice, smoky and sultry, and the musicianship throughout is quite good. And yet, there's something a little soulless about it all.

Nothing truly insightful or distinctive, beyond that wonderful voice.

Jacobs says that \\"Rabbi Eliezer held fast to his opinion even against ... a voice that came from heaven.\\" In fact, the original Talmudic story (found at Bava Metzia 59b) recounts that the heaveny voice (G-d) was invoked by Rabbi Eliezer and said to the other rabbis (from the Steinsaltz translation) 'Why are you [disputing] with Rabbi Eliezer, for the [law] is in accordance with him everywhere?\\" Notwithstanding this error, the only one I have come across in many hours with this book, I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for daily quiet times","review":"This book really helped me to live a more God-centered life in some really practical ways.

Great staging, costuming, updating, and fantastic vocal performances can't possibly compensate for the homosexual like interaction of Jesus and the apostles. Either the woman director has an agenda she's pushing, or she simply has no idea about the way men relate and interact with each other. One can't watch the scenes between Judas and Jesus without believing the two are 'breaking up'... It's simply painful to watch.The priests and guards are totally cool, Pilate is great, Simon Zealots is a tremendous improvement over anything done before, but... Jesus STILL ISN'T GAY - and shouldn't act like it!!The play LOOKS great, but because Jesus interacts with the disciples like he's dating them, it destroys everything else in the musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!

Don't you get me wrong, the '73 movie was good, but let's not be too sentamental. in the new film, orchestrations, instrumental performance and vocals are top-notch, except perhaps for Judas who can't quite seem to handle the technical parts of his score. Performers are playing to the back of a hall, not overacting. Caiphas, Pilate, Simon the Zealot, Jesus and Mary M. are all the best. This performance is far more in-your-face than the '73 movie and frankly makes a lot more sense to somebody my age (Gen Xer)--not because it lacks subtlety (it doesn't).

Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. Carter's voice is truly magnificent, and the music is as strong as ever, but the supporting cast, I feel, rather let the side down. The set is a bit amateurish looking,the cast devoid of emotion and passion(except for Glenn) and Pilate? What's he all about? He constantly sounded like he had severe digestive problems, and really spoilt the whole thing for me. As I said, the music is as emotive as ever, but for the real essence of the power of the songs and score, go for the vastly superior movie version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a 0","review":"I was so excited when I heard of the revival, but then I had the misfortune of watching this. My issues center around two major problems. First is that Carter simply does not have the proper voice range to hit the high notes. Second is that the portrayal of Judas is very traditional and conservative. The original concept was one which presented the life of Christ through the eyes of Judas. The audience should identify with Judas and not hate him. In this version Judas is the typical evangelical version that you expect to see at a Christmas or Easter play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear...well not a total disaster","review":"This is actually a fairly bloodless, passionless retelling of JCS. The singing in general leaves much to be desired. The directing is fairly bland and unimaginative. To be honest just decorating a set and costuming it in a new and different way does not a directorial vision make. Acting is generally weak and the choreography is ridiculous.Skip this and see Norman Jewison's version instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"glenn carter is perfect","review":"i cannot say enough good things about this film. it is simply perfect. glenn carter is absolutely riveting -- his gethsemane gives me chills every time. what a voice!! i can't get it out of my head. but the entire cast is excellent, down to the chorus. staging is paced just right, and costumes and sets updated for the new millenium -- will appeal to every generation. my 3 kids have it practically memorized. if you've never seen this show, get this tape. it has it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie, Only two tiny problems","review":"I personally loved this version of JCS but there were two teensy problems. One, during King Herods Song, you can notice a french accent in the line \\"Aren't You Scared OF Me Christ\\" Also Jerome Pradon as Judas gets a bit whiny at parts, unfortunately. But Pradon shows a character IDEALISTIC of Judas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, not bad at all","review":"excellent rendition of the 70s classic. i'm a fan of andrew lloyd webber so i'm glad to see this production since seeing them in new york would be hell on the budget.

Hey, maybe Brittney Spears should remake \\"Revolver\\" to bring it into a \\"Modern\\" setting.Here's my suggestion, buy the original 1970 JCS on CD.

Everything was right, then Judas began singing \\"Heaven on their minds\\" and it was downhill from then on. He sounded like Bono with an even bigger whine. Jesus could not be any more bland than a cardboard sandwich.Norman Jewison knows how to portray passion, love and agony and knows how to find the people with the talent to perform those emotions. Go get the Jewison version. This is a total waste of time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This DVD is terrible and not worth watching.

This video is a pale copy of Broadway original. Jerome Pradon is inexpressive, slow and formally acting, comparing to Vincent. That is a very sad change. I wish they would ever make a recording of 2000 production as it was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful viewing","review":"This is the worst adaptation of this musical -- ever! This was my first experience with JCSS and after watching the video, I hated it -- vowed never to watch or listen to anything related to this musical ever again.The leads, although obviously talented, are not suited for the range needed to sing these songs. At times, listening to Pradon as Judas is just too painful for words. The only saving grace of this video version is the supporting cast -- Caiaphas: Frederick B Owens, Annas: Michael Shaeffer, Simon Zealotes: Tony Vincent, Peter: Cavin Cornwall .Avoid this at all costs. I was later introduced to the 1973 film version and fell in love with the story and the music. Ted Neely and Carl Anderon are wonderful and hit every note just right. Buy the 1973 version instead and save yourself a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gospel is no Longer according to Judas","review":"... I had great hopes for this production. I saw it on Broadway, and was disappointed in the loss of Gospel of Judas... Hoping the DVD would be more noteworthy, I purchased for my collection - it retained the dullness that was not part of the, in my opinion, original intent of Lloyd/Rice. rather than completing Judas' story (his self-murder) the story ends simply with the crucifixion. A shame and travesty.

In fact if they hadn't been at the last supper and sang the Apostle song you can barely pick out Judas's 11 companions from the mob.Chaias, Pilate, and Herod sing in a difficult manner to follow; despite this Pilate manages one of the better performances of the show when he asks why Christ must die. Herod simply comes off annoying.Magdalene sings the nice 'I Don't Know How to Love Him' number and Christ's moment of doubt is very moving. There are a few other good moments through the show but overall I found it disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed","review":"I was so disappointed. I bought this not realizing it was not the early version, even putting on for guests at Easter time only to turn it off in a few minutes! the music may have been there but the setting and characters was just wrong. I put one star only because there was no option for NO STARS>"},{"rating":"2","title":"you cannot compare 1960's and this version!!!","review":"I have read so many reviews saying that this version sucked and that this version cannot hold a candle to anything. I cannot disagree more this version has great singers ranging in thier styles and ranges that go together perfectly! jerome pradon as an example is a wonderful singer using his voice to tell a story it was because of his rock like lisp that i listened more intently to the lyrics and began to sympathise with Judas which i had never done befor. This movie uses the long flowing look of jesus to copare to the punk ruggad judas and thier voices are as different as thier looks! as to people saying that this version sucked they are wrong. this version was filmed entirley indoors which makes the story so much easier to understand the simplicity is genius!!so kudos to jerome pradon and he enitre cast for a superb version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding stage reproduction","review":"I watched both versions (original '70s and this one) back to back. The raw energy of the singing is outstanding in this version...a little flat in the other (like someone left out the stereo...). Not having to deal with sweeping scenery, it zooms in on emotion in the faces...the songs are the stars here....not the desert. I think people (especially young people) can relate much better to this updated modern version. Also...note how Jesus' wardrobe changes throughout the play...first appearing in cargo pants, muscle shirt and tennies and gradually reverts to the dress of antiquity. Judas is outstanding, and Pilate blew me away. Jesus' song to God in the Garden is much more powerful here. In the other version, you don't see Ted Neeley's face through much of it...he's too busy climbing a rock. This is a MUST SEE for JCS fans!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has no realworld value","review":"BJA2 has little value for the realworld player.

It was way over my head and I think most people will find it dull and boring. Also the pages fell out as the binding wasn't very good.

With four out of nine cuts being Meek originals, he also shows himself to be a fine composer.Perhaps a little too popish--although never slipping into jazz lite--for purists, anyone who digs beautiful melodies played with gusto and sophistication, plus plenty of well-crafted improvization by, esp., Meek, will want to add this to their collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Guy Can Play, But...","review":"I just can't get to like this one.

They throw in extremely clever guitar licks and staccato rhythms both on piano and drum that round out their catchy yet substantial sound. Think of it as pop music with swagger and attitude.

I really liked it and I really wish that Asprin would write a heck of a lot faster. I'm waiting on tenterhooks for the next edition and I think my bookstore's getting tired of me always calling and asking them for a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Myth-ed the Mark","review":"Robert Asprin tampered with a winning formula and it shows. Not only has Skeeve changed from the lovable dolt we knew him as but he's changed for the worst. There's a lot more contemplation in this book (who needs that in a lighthearted sci fi?) and a corresponding lack of action. What most endeared readers to the Myth series were the comical complications that Skeeve would get himself into. This book is a disappointment. Stick with the previous ones and save yourselves a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Cent","review":"I know everyone has put in their two cents, so here's my 1 cent's worth--I liked this book. Reading this got me hooked on the Myth books, thank you Robert Asprin! Please write more!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Asprin's Best Work","review":"While this was absolutely refreshing after the previous volume, it still wasn't a great read. It was made up of about 80% people explaining things to Skeeve interspersed with the occasional scene of activity. I grew very tired of listening to people talk through their philosophies of life rather than seeing something move the plot forward. It honestly felt like you could read the first 30 pages, then the last 30 pages, and catch 99% of what's necessary for any real plot or character development. The rest is talking and internal agonizing.One more quick note: The frequent turning of Skeeve's naivete into a joke got tiresome. It was mildly amusing the first time, but not the third.Just not Asprin's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such inconsistent fans...","review":"People talking about Myth-nomers screamed for less naivete in Skeeve, then don't like ti when they get it. The books considered bad by some were ones where the characters actually developed, which is ridiculous! I find it wonderful to read a series where the books actually have developing characters. This oen was as good as the others. But where's Something M.Y.T.H. Inc.?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disapointed about this book","review":"I think that this book takes away from the other MYTH books. It was more of a love story than an acton book. It had almost no point to it because Skeeve never decided who he was in love with. And Gleep said Skeeve as soon as it got shot with an arrow, why couldn't he talkin any of the other books. So if you like the MYTH series skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T READ THIS BOOK UNTIL THERE IS A SEQUEL!","review":"I love the myth series. I really adore it. I have read every book. But Mr. Asprin needs to just close it up and stop adding on installments. This book lost the usual shine and bored me. It was also a clif-hanger ending, and the next book has still not come out yet five years later! In the first books you could read any one in any order and understand them, but in these they are all clifhangers and the jokes just aren't as funny. The whole main plotline of this book is Skeeve falling for Bunny. Oh boy. And it wouldn't be that bad except in the very end a bunch of crazy stuff happens and then it just stops. Like he was sick of writing it or something. I say if you want to read a myth book read Another fine Myth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of the Myth Adventure series by far.","review":"This book has no point. The whole book is Skeeve trying to either fall in love or find out who he's in love with. There is no resolution. The only good part in the book is Skeeve's date with the vampire. Overall, lousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get your butt in MOTION!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think that there is a trend going around. All my favorite sci-fi authors are turing into slugs. It the last few books Asprin has woooooshhh squelch... down the drain. But I am going to wait him out if it kills me. I'm still young and he isn't doddering yet. But if he kills off Gleep I'm going to get mad. Gleep that darling not-so-little dragon is one of the greatest charecters in the last few books.

Riot Act is one of the most musically complex and rockin' albums out today. The lyrics are very inteligent as well.

However, if you are dying to hear something original and exciting Riot Act has your name on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best.","review":"This is by far my favorite Pearl Jam album. To tell you the truth, this is my favorite album of all time besides the Beatles White Album. Maybe it is just me, but everything just hit so hard on this album, everything sounded like they wrote it for me, and me alone. The lyrics, are like words from my own brain, and the song structures are perfect. I was an average Pearl Jam fan until this album came along. \\"I am Mine\\" brought me in, and the rest of the songs on this album took over... Fan's of Pearl Jam's earlier work (Ten, Vs. Vitalogy) don't seem to care for Pearl Jam's later stuff, but to tell you my honest opinion, Pearl Jam went from an average arena rock band in grunger clothing, to a band that makes music that appeals to them, without caring what the rest of the world thinks...If you are contemplating purchasing this cd, go for it, it is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another great album by Pearl Jam, one of the few bands that still stands up for the music.","review":"Apart from \\"The Manic Street Preachers\\" and \\"Supergrass\\", \\"Pearl Jam\\" are one of the few artists who are making music for the sake of \\"artisticness\\".While many just don't get it, and think Eddie Vedder should sing like he did on other records and the band should pull out riffs and hooks, \\"yes, that Rolling Stone review nailed it on the head, on the previous review\\", the choruses fall into place in the song instead of doing the in the studio, in your face effect, genius!Overall, the stongest Pearl Jam album as whole, but \\"Vitolagy\\" and \\"No Code\\" would have to stand as the bands most accomplished artistic efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"normal outstanding album by pearl jam","review":"Great album, from a great band. Not their best work but still very very good. I liked all of the songs but i personal prefer \\"save you\\" , \\"ghost\\", \\"You are\\" and off course \\"Love boat captain\\". Great drums, reefs, and a lot of solo work by mike maccready. But still, pearl jam's best album, is and problably will continue to be No Code. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Having been a Pearl Jam fan for years, I was disappointed with this CD. The songs on this CD seem to stray from the style of rock that made Pearl Jam a success. In addition, I felt it was a little too political. Pearl Jam should stay with what they do best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Be Honest","review":"I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam but this album sucks. What happened to the riffs, the energy, the passion and the melody? What happened to everything we love about Pearl Jam. It is not a sell out to actually write songs that people will like. These songs are listless, unoriginal and meandering. No structure or substance. Even through their more experimental phase during No Code they created \\"Hail Hail\\" and \\"Smile\\". What a huge disappointment this is! Pearl Jam fans need to stop being blind fanatics. They have done some amazing work but this is not up to snuff. Let's be intellectually honest with ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album","review":"Riot Act should have won album of the year! Although listening to the album 4 years after it was originally released, I am so glad I got back into Pearl Jam. I have not listened to Pearl Jam since high school--I can't believe I deprived myself for so long! Pearl Jam is the best rock band of my generation. Hopefully, they will stick together and put out several more albums down the road. For those of you not sure if Pearl Jam still has it, trust me THEY DO!!! Buy this album, you will be in for a pleasant surprise..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Jam does it again!","review":"This album is proof positive that Pearl Jam will never fade as a vital, heartfelt and important band. Perhaps their most diverse outing since Vitology, this album is one of their best. I would personally put it third on my all-time list behind Vs. at #1 and Ten at #2. It has something for everybody. Hard and soft, fast and slow. Even a \\"protest\\" song, in Bushleaguer. If you are a fan, you probably have it already. If you are curious about Pearl Jam, this would be a good album to start your collection with. It showcases all of the bandmembers strengths. Get it. Good, solid, beautiful rock n' roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number 8 is Great!","review":"Now I'm taking a big step, but I think Riot Act may be the best album that the boys of Pearl Jam have ever recorded. With a fantastic blend of quiet, soothing songs like \\"I am Mine\\" and \\"Thumbing My Way\\" with straight-forward rockers like \\"Save You\\" and \\"Ghost\\". I think the standout track on this album is \\"You Are\\". In a song written by drummer Matt Cameron, the guitar sound is very original (this because the guitars are processed through a drum loop machine). The choir-like \\"Arc\\" is a nice transgretion to the end of the album. If you are a Pearl Jam fan or thinking of becoming one, this is the album to listen to. Nice work Pearl Jam!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riot Act","review":"PJ is back (even though they never went anywhere). Cameron seems to really fit in well on Riot Act, and the band seems to be more comfortable than they were on \\"Binaural\\" with exploring new horizons. Vedder's lyrics are great as usual, and Boom's organ play adds a cool new dimension. Fans who liked \\"No Code\\" will especially like this album because the songs seem to be layed out in a similar fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Pearl Jam Album","review":"Can't Keep: A-Save You: ALove Boat Captain: A+Cropduster: AGhost: AI Am Mine: AThumbing My Way: BYou Are: A/A+Get Right: A-Green Disease: A-/AHelp Help: A-/ABu$hleaguer: A-1/2 Full: A-/AArc: B-All Or None: AAverage: A-/A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the time to listen to this great album.","review":"This record will be well worth your time. I have been a fan of Pearl Jam since the beginning and I am always amazed how different they sound from record to record (Check out \\"You Are\\" to hear what I mean). Only one song should have been left off...\\"Bush Leaguer.\\" Not good. Some songs may need repeated listens to get into them (e.g. \\"Can't Keep\\" and \\"Cropduster\\", both of which are great) while others reveal themselves as top notch right away (e.g. \\"I am mine\\" \\"Thumbing My Way\\" and \\"Ghost\\"). Buy this record. It's the REAL thing. Not some knock off like Creed or thousands of other bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good solid record","review":"I like this record as I do all of Pearl Jam's output. I just feel that some songs that had catchy riffs or melodies at certain points did not go on to fulfil their potential which is a shame. You're left just wishing the chord progression had taken a slightly different path in some songs in an effort to be that bit catchier. The single 'I Am Mine' is a great song as is 'Love Boat Captain' and 'Save You'. The music itself is in some ways more challenging and mature than anything that has gone before. It follows on from Binaural in a similar vein to that record. At times experimental, lovely, rocking and just plain wierd(see 'Bushleaguer' - a great spoken word politically themed song - and the chanting in 'Arc') this album has obviously benefited from a solid mix of creative inputs. Maybe I haven't listened to it enough yet but I feel it needs a stronger ending. All gripes aside I believe it will be great in the live arena.So 4 stars from a big fan - maybe on further reflection 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"Simply put, this is the bands best effort. While early \\"fans\\" want to sit around and wait for the next \\"ten\\" to come around, they are missing great rock n' roll. Love Boat Captain, Save You, Cropduster, I am Mine... this album is a ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A High Quality Record","review":"Pearl Jam is still making relevant music, period. They're not the same band they used to be, that is obvious, but why would you want them to be? I've never understood the, what I call, \\"AC/DC Need.\\" The \\"AC/DC Need\\" is a music fans need for the bands they follow to stay the same. To stagnate and endlessly milk the niche they carved in the past. Pearl Jam is no AC/DC. They're ever evolving and challenging themselves to stay original. I commend them for their efforts, and their latest release, \\"Riot Act,\\" is one of their best albums to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Jam Fan, but this is no riot.","review":"I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan, and was looking forward to this release. Unfortunately, it was a wait that was unfulfilling. Pearl Jam reminds us of their glory days on a few of the tracks (i.e I am Mine and Love Boat Captain). The majority, however, are overly moody and pensive (even for Eddie Vedder) and seem to disolve into no particular place. The album probably should have been called \\"Side B\\" or \\"Look what I found in the bottom of this old guitar case\\". One gets the feeling that the boys got together after being hassled by their record company to fulfill their contract, and spit out whatever permeated their beer soaked brains. This is obviously not their best work, and sadly may be their worst. I certainly hope it's not their last, because there is better music that can come from these talented musicians. It will be worth the wait if they choose to make it. This, however, is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The best band of the 90's really hit rock-bottom in the 2000's,and Riot Act is Pearl Jam's worst.Here are some reasons why I hated Riot Act:1.The Musicwhat happened to all thous great riffs on past albums?The greatchoruses?Lot of time there is no melodies.2.Vedder's vocals.what happened to the emotion in his voice?He sounds tired and bored.3.The Lyrics.Vedder's lyrics have become extremely hit and miss lines from poems that just sound like toss off lines and often contradict one another.Also-the whole band writing lyrics makes this album lack one voice even more.4.The ProductionThe \\"Live\\" sound just sounds really sloppy"},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of dough","review":"Thankfully I got this used, or I would've been mighty disaapointed at having paid full price for it.

I can sum up Riot Act in one letter: zzzzzzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Stole This Cd","review":"Everytime a new Pearl Jam cd comes out I buy it, why? I think because in the early '90s they stood for so much. I wanted to like each cd, but disappointment is what I receive. So when someone stole this cd from me I have never missed it nor wanted to replace it. Hopefully thier new cd will rock but I will have to be sold on it before I buy it.No one can deny what a great cd Ten was, and I didn't want each cd to sound like it, I just wanted more of the feeling but each release was flat. I know their is legion of fans but you know exactly what I am talking about.I give this two stars because with each Pearl Jam cd their is one or two tracks that are good. Just have to fumble through all the cr4p on them, and for me I am just sick of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage!","review":"how did pearl jam ever think anybody would want to listen to this [stuff]? not a single track stands out from the wreckage of this album. vedder's voice has never sounded so incapable, nor have his lyrics ever been worse. a really sad comedown for what used to be a good band."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT TO GIVE IT A ZERO","review":"I can't even listen past the 2nd track. This is 2005, grunge is soooo over."},{"rating":"2","title":"They still got it","review":"Like many other Pearl Jam fans, I wasn't too impressed with Binaural, so there was much skepticism as to what Riot Act was to sound like. Yield and No Code remain my favourites, but Riot Act has that accessible flavour that makes it difficult to dismiss the music; even those who may not be hardcore fans of the band. It's a solid rock record from start to end and shows Pearl Jam still can dish out arena rock songs (Save You, Love Boat Captain, Cropduster, I Am Mine, Green Disease) and ballad-esque sounds of Thumbing My Way & All Or None. Very easy listen and a good recommendation to the casual fans of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gossip is true! Pearl Jam are back to the fore!","review":"I purchased this album after hearing 'I am mine' and 'love boat captain' endlessly on the radio. I bought it and was extremly impressed.

Pearl Jam, as always re-invents themselves without changing their identity... when you hear it, you know its pearl jam just by the tone and the vibe. The re-invention to me felt much like an \\"art-rock\\" approach (for lack of better word), Matt Cameron's song, \\"You Are\\" is possibly one of the best songs Pearl Jam has ever written. Cropduster is deep, full of concept, and uses engenius guitar tone & texture. Stone Gossard's \\"All or None\\" is a particularly moving song, lyrics & chord progression make this song the kind that I play over and over again.I give this album 5 stars because it demonstrates Pearl Jam's amazing ability to do something new with their sound while still retaining their signiture approach. They're an amazing group of musician's that set quite an example!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a song on here called Love Boat Captain","review":"The song Love Boat Captain makes me think, of course, of The Love Boat T.V. show.

I can't understand why Doc, Gopher, Isaac and the Captain were always hitting on other women when the lovely Julie was right there under their noses. Julie was hotter than all of the special female guest stars (except, of course, for when Charo guest-starred.)Hats off to Pear Jam for honoring The Love Boat!

If you've heard any Backspacer tracks you will agree, hell if you have heard any Pearl Jam for the last 18 years you'll agree. Backspacer thus far is even worse than this horrid album.

Let me say that I am a big PJ fan, but this album is severely disappointing. There's a handful of OK tracks, but there's not even one great song or anything that stacks up to the quality of their older material. This is by far the weakest album of their career. Overall the album sounds uninspired, bland and flat out boring. Vedder's vocals even sound bored. The main problem is PJ just don't seem to be able to write good hooks anymore. It sounds like all these songs were written and recorded in one day. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for Pearl Jam and they are still a great live band.

Riot Act has changed my mind. As I listen to this album I found enough that sounded fresh and new to keep my attention and get me to listen to it mroe than once or twice.

In my opinion this is what Pearl Jam was needing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Jam just gets better with age","review":"... \\"Riot Act\\" is, in my opinion, their best and most consistent record since \\"No Code\\". The highlight of the record for me is the beautiful \\"Thumbing My Way\\", which is a perfect showcase for Eddie's thoughtful lyrics and heartbreaking vocals. There is only one track that I genuinely dislike (\\"Bushleaguer\\") and one that I am ambivalent about (\\"Arc\\"). The rest is good, solid stuff that I could listen to again and again. Aside from \\"Thumbing My Way\\", the best tracks are \\"You Are\\", \\"Save You\\", \\"Cropduster\\", \\"1/2 Full\\" and the slightly bizarre \\"Help Help\\", which grows on me more with every listen.

We get straight out rockers like \\"Save You\\", \\"Cropduster\\" Green Disease\\" and \\"1/2 Full\\". Also present is the experimental, yet brilliant \\"You Are\\". And the soulful, somber tunes are represented with \\"All or None\\" and \\"Thumbing my Way\\".This record is really exceptional, and I honestly recommend it to anyone willinging to accept that Pearl Jam are not going to write another song like \\"Jeremy\\", and that they are better off because of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a classic... yet...","review":"Once Pearl Jam releases one or two more albums (and you know they will) people will look back on this one and group it together with No Code and Vitalogy as one of the definite standouts of the Pearl Jam library. \\"1/2 Full\\" sounds like a throwback to Eddie's days in Temple of the Dog, and \\"All or None\\" would feel right at home on No Code (greatest album ever). Then you've got songs like \\"You Are\\", \\"Can't Keep\\", and \\"Bushleaguer\\" which highlight the bands ability to create all of these fantastic albums without one of them sounding wholly like its predesessors (save for a couple tracks of course).Buy this album now, before it becomes a classic, so you can tell everyone that you loved it before it was popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best work...","review":"I was let down by this one.

The death toll of this band has sounded. They are no longer interested in innovative, cutting edge riffs. The songs are drab, hurtful and painfully awful. Gone are the days of internal fire. PJ seems as though they're striving to become an amalgamation of Phish and The Greatful Dead. If this interests you, buy the CD and then buy yourself a coffin."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD STINKS WORSE THEN A 500 POUND MANS SWEATY UNDERWARE","review":"Why can't this band wake Eddie up before they record his vocals. I've never heard a man sound so bored singing his own songs.After Yeild I was hoping they had gotten passed the No Code curse of boring me stupid but then came the last album that I won't even name cause it's so damn bad. Well too bad for me this follows the same road of mummbling garbage that has now become the PJ I once loved.

I have been a long-time listener of Pearl Jam, and have appreciated each stage of their career up to this point. I have been impressed by the consistent quality of their work, their ability to succeed with different styles of music, and certainly by the intelligent and challenging nature of their lyrics. This album has at least this last bit going for it--the songs are informed by a spiritual and social consciousness that is rare in rock these days. But the songs, from a musical standpoint (excepting three or four out of the thirteen), are just plain bad. I liken them to dirges that just weigh heavily on the listener--you keep hoping for some glimpse of melody, some redeemable thing that will make the song worthwhile, but are continually frustrated. I painfully listened to the CD three or four times, trying hard to appreciate it, but finally shelved it, where it will most likely stay for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pearl Jam album yet!!","review":"This album is fantastic, by far the best Pearl Jam album yet, thank goodness its not another TEN! - everyone!!Thats the last thing Pearl Jam want to make."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Just Takes Some Time","review":"The album has a darker sound, and at first seems to be missing hooks. However after a couple of listens it really grows on you. Fast and Slow, Personal and Political this album has it all.

To me its their best yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw in the Towel already","review":"Pearl Jam just keeps falling&falling with each release it seems.this Album lacks a real knockout track&the Playing seems like going in routine.the only thing that has changed with Pearl Jam is there Hairstyles.Pearl Jam is mainly a Band that had a few moments&a bunch of clone acts like Stone temple Pilot,Creed,KnickleBack,etc... keeping there sound&Vocal stylings around.but all I hear here is another Band doing a formula round."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled again","review":"I have been a Pearl Jam fan from the beginning and lately I've been buying their albums with his mindset: \\"OK so the last album was disappointing, but this one is gonna be their return to greatness.\\" This is what I've been saying ever since Vs. I'm still waiting. They haven't been great since Vs. and they haven't even been good since Yeild. Vedder lacks any emotion in his signing, his vocals and especially his lyrics are at best sub-par and all of the songs sound stale. There's only one or two songs that have hooks that you'll actually remember. The only thing that makes this album even listenable are Mike's solos, which Thank God have once again returned.Bottomline: If you like this album you either hear things I don't or are a hopeless diehard who will love anything they put out. It's probably the later. My advice is to skip this one and wait for their live show, which hopefully hasn't deteriorated as much as their albums have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vedder and the Blowfish?","review":"Self-importance is no longer the premium it once was in the music world...PJ is no longer vital, if they ever were.

Secrets of Body Language from the History channel is a much better representation of how to read people.

Much of the crew, composed partly of people who had paid $32,000 to sail around the planet, jumps ship in Panama after one month under sail. I can empathize with them. Rather than Coleridge's Ancient Mariner who holds his listener spellbound with his glittering eye, we have to contend with a whiny, petty voice moaning about his fellow crew members. He seems to assume not only that he is the first sailor to discover profane language, fornication and alcohol-induced vomiting, but also that the reading public will be charmed withal. I high-tailed it out of there somewhere around Galapagos, but then I never did enjoy frat parties.

And constantly telling us how gorgeous the 'heroine' is and how every man wants to jump her bones does nothing to make her likeable.The book gets a little better when it FINALLY addresses the suspense part of the plot but leaves out a great deal of detail and is fairly predictable.

She uses the same words to describe certain things over and over. Has the author ever heard of a nifty little item called a thesaurus. Maybe she should invest in one. WHATEVER YOU DO PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS STUPID BOOK! I had to force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK !!!","review":"I bought the tape. I am so glad that I only had to waste 3 hours listening. The wording on the back of the tape had different characters names so I had to stop and see if I had a same theme. It was. Too bad. Karen, you are one of my favorite authors, but you missed it on this one. Good thought but bad premises. Do you really think some one like Ronnie would give it all up for Tom after she has fought hard to get where she was? Get real. I know the goings on in Washington is shady, but to kill off everyone to hide a secret? I don't think so. If this was true Washington DC would be a dead city. I know this is fiction, but at least make it believable. Hope your next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise but vague.","review":"The tension between Tom, the political consultant, and Ronnie, the Senator's wife was well explored. I liked Tom's Mother and enjoyed the description of her home. The political references were sometimes unbelievable, however. For instance, naming the dog \\"Jefferson Davis\\" felt uncomfortable to me, i.e. offensive to some while others might think it cute. I can't imagine a modern political consultant ever coming up with that idea. At the end, I felt I was left hanging in regard to Tom's career. Also, the story did not give any insight into what motivated Tom's partner to stay in the business or to make the kind of choices he made. It was a cute but confusing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a dictionary","review":"I was expecting a little bit of how-to in this book but it definitely is not that.

Mr. Cage refrians from too much hamming it up. Is she a witch? Is she an innocent? Is she something in-between? You're drawn in by the atmosphere and the questions.....but like revealing the man behind the curatin, the director spoiled his chance at true spookiness with cgi silliness and a lame-brained explanation. Too bad, here were good production values and mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witch","review":"I just saw Drive Angry and now another film with Cage in it...But hey, he was good in this film too. I liked it more than i though i would. He's an ex crusador who takes on the mission of transporting a girl who seems to be a witch and responsible of a plague to an abby where she will be sentenced. The film had a good opening with some religious wars following and then the story gets going and keeps up. The journey has it's moments, with wolves and an old broken bridge. I like the \\"witch\\" the best. She was cool and going from nice to sane like that. I enjoyed the film but I didn't like the real truth behind the girl because it was nothing new, what with some other films that just came out with the same story. The special effects were very good and entertaining no doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"What About The Witches","review":"I dont think there were any actual witches in this movie, but I dont want to spoil it. It is an interesting movie, and I enjoyed it. I liked the \\"witch\\" and her power. She was pretty awsome. I love the twist, also I think it was overshadowed. Great idea, it just didnt hit that spot in the audience, or at least it didnt hit me. Still great idea and I did enjoy it. The young boy in the end, has beautiful eyes. The \\"witch\\" was awsome -or at least the source of her power was. I admit I was kind of hoping it would win. Just to see what would happen. NE way, great movie -it took long enough for it to come out. A lot of people dont dig Nicholas Cage as an actor and I will admit, he isnt that great of a performer, but I like him. There is something about him that I enjoy seeing him in movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story Line and Plot","review":"I like this movie. It kept me entertained and trying to guess what exactly was going on.Great special effects and some phenomenal make up artists.The \\"Witch\\" does a great job of showing you her multiple personalities via dialogue and facial expressions.A good adventure movie where the traveling party encounters many obstacles to get to their final destination - then the fun starts!\\"I see your Jihad and raise you one Crusade...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a good movie.","review":"I really regret renting and watching this movie. I felt this way about 15 minutes into it. Maybe I could've called Amazon and \\"turned back\\"? Anyway, the acting was poor, but the writing was far worse! And does every movie studio have the same special effects program or software?? Everything is starting to look THE SAME. When's the last time anyone saw an actual fire in a movie? How about smoke? Nicholas Cage hasn't been in a decent movie in ages..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, ok.","review":"I didn't think I would find a Cage movie as bad as Captain Correli's Mandolin but I guess I have. I don't know what was worse, the set or the writing... or the bad imagineered demon, which reminded me too much of the alien I hated from Independence Day. Sure, there were a few nail-biting moments but really, only very few. I now know why I never heard of this movie when it was released. Was it in the theater? I am upset about wasting $5 renting this through my On Demand. I would have been pissed spending $11 at the theater. Weird. I just feel weird about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth My money","review":"They used only about 30 actors and extras and POORLY drawn CG for there armys, The acting is just fair, and so is the story line.

I truly do. Knowing was a great movie. I even enjoyed Ghostrider. But this one was lacking in so many areas that the enjoyment of such a movie was totally not happening. The main characters, we don't TRULY get to know them at all. The beginning of the movie was okay ... but then the scenes with war after war after war after war after war after ... well, you get my point. Ugh. The ending (both of them) ... left much to be desired. Save your money, folks. Wait for it to come to television and then watch it for free if you can bring yourself to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witches? where?","review":"This movie was misleading as I thought it would be about witchcraft. I was bored to extinction; the plot was predictable and the acting flat. What happened to Nicholas Cage,he was excellent in Moonstuck and has now spiraled into very poor film choices?The so-called witch character was not interesting, nor likable as villian or victim. I walked out of the theater feeling ripped off -ugh-a BAD MOVIE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad At All...","review":"I read all the reviews and decided to see it for myself through Amazon streaming. Honestly? It was a decent and entertaining movie with great special effects. Did I go into it expecting the most amazing writing and plot? No. Did I think it would contain Academy Award winning acting? No. This isn't that kind of movie. It wasn't supposed to be the greatest film ever made or move you to tears. It was simply supposed to be an enjoyable hour and a half...and it was. So go ahead and rent it or buy it. If you watch it without the high expectations I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season of the Witch","review":"This film captured what was going on back in those days where innocent men, women, and children where being accused of witch craft. The film was very interesting to watch because it kept your attention through the whole movie with that action through out the movie. The suspense of the movie made us stay and watch to see what would happen next. The plot was simply amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money talks","review":"You watch this movie and thinK \\"What could make Cage and Perlman, take part in such... amateurish, pretentious, funky-plotted story?

Throw in a little evil, and I figured it was worth a watch. After the first few minutes of terrible dialogue, I began to second guess this hypothesis. In addition to the cheesy script, the technical aspects were shabby, especially the green screen work and costuming choices such as Cage's wig. The movie's saving grace is the performance by Claire Foy (Little Dorrit). Her pixie charm casts a spell, leaving us suspended between wondering if we can keep her, and wondering why they didn't bring more holy water."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie in years","review":"Season of the Witch is a horrible movie that takes itself way too seriously. If it were a parody it would have some value such as becoming a mystery science theater selection and there are so many opportunities to insert witty comments during this pathetic piece of misguided junk. I am usually a fan of Nick Cage but he made a career misstep starring in this bomb. The story is weak, the score is overly dramatic and the dialogue is just terrible to the point of being comical.Do not spend your precious money on this piece. Wait to watch it on Netflix Instant so the only thing you may waste is the two hours of your life that you can never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazon is bad","review":"i bought this wanting to download it because my internet it to slow to stream and it didnt work some content copyright bs i contacted them and they never fixed it its been like a month dont buy their crap i switched to itunes cheaper too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moviie is STUPID","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie and usually enjoy Nicholas Cage movies. This one annoyed me because instead of having a knowledgeable perspective it ended up being an ignorant bunch of old rubbish about what Christians for hundreds of years have insisted in believing..So they could hang, hack, and burn people who probably weren't witches to begin with.

Although now it seems like they just wanted to get rid of it. When I received the DVD I quickly put it in my DVD player and hit play. Not even half way through the movie it began to distort and freeze. So I simply emailed the company which I bought it from. They told me to mail it back and they'd send me a refund. So I asked them if they were paying for the shipping to ship it back, which they promptly told me no. So I talked to Yahoo they got me my refund and I tossed the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"The story was weak, good special effects (CGI).

Unfortunately I was taken by the hyped up trailer and paid money to see mediocrity at it's best!! This film was just a short and curly hair above the crap that cable televison has to offer and it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Obviously Nick Cage is hard up for cash because of late he has made some pretty terrible films that are not worth the DVD it is copied on. The story is OK but predictable, the acting is lazy and the CGI is less than adequate. Cage and Perlman are just going through the motions to collect a paycheck and it shows through their acting and lack of british accents. There is nothing watch-worthy in this film unless you just want to fill the pockets of those involved in this turd. My recommendation, watch it on cable and you won't be as bitter with it as I am!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have borrowed not even rented it","review":"Nic Cage is no longer worthy of a leading actor, he hasn't made a good movie in forever, and the last good movie he was in was the Sorcer's Apprentice which thankfully he didn't star in. If he ever learned how to make more then the morose, depressed, or deeply saddened faces he might be ok, seriously even when he tries to smile it looks like he wants to break into tears. Thankfully Ron Perlman was halfway decent in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle price for the book","review":"There are better chances for this book to sell, if Amazon dropped the kindle price to 9.99.

Well written and edited with each chapter covering a specific area, and written by recignized leaders in their respective area. Also, the authors recognize the fact that it is impossible to have a complete study of the topic in one text, and give many references to give a deeper dive in any one particular area. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get for loved ones","review":"This is a really great movie. I suggest you buy it for loved ones, just anybody that missed it on PBS. I happened to see it on PBS and am sure it will play again as a re-run but if you want an all around complete history of surfing, this is the best you will find. Nothing better to do than watch a surf video about the history of surfing. If you love old school surfing (Longboarding) or have been swept into the summer lul use this video to get you amped before a session. Cause we all know to surf often you have to longboard most of the summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I bought this DVD thinking it would be like all the other surfing DVDs I have bought - plenty of waves, maybe some narrative, good surfing.

Can't see myself pulling this one out of the collection to watch too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Single","review":"This single, taken from Ace of Base's first album \\"The Sign\\" is just great.

The story moves along v-e-r-y slowly, the animation is not particularly good, the acting is terrible -- it sounds like adults (trying to sound like kids) simply reading a script. Also the player has to play the game as different characters requiring much too frequent switching, which the girls find annoying. I'm sure there is a beautiful moral message in this game somewhere; it is too bad more effort wasn't put into the game itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two left arms","review":"Yea so I bought this a while back and I was really disappointed. I've been a huge fan of the games and I collect action figures and 1:18 scale cars from TV and movies. But I don't have a room full of this stuff you know. I just collect what I like. And I saw this and was really excited. When I took 47 out of the box to display on my desk I realized that instead of making two arms for the figure, the just put two LEFT arms on. The arm on his right side is just the left arm upside down.

I bought it to learn how to use my new cast iron dutch oven and learned very little that wasn't included with the oven itself. Many of the recipes were hard to follow -- possibly because of the poor grammar and punctuation throughout the book.

There are far better books out there; I wish I'd bought one of them first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"While full of recipes, this book is very disorganized. For example, Beef Stew (2 different versions) appears several pages apart. Chicken soup, Chicken Supreme Soup; and a Chicken and Egg soup, while ALL are chicken soups, they are separated by several pages as well. Instructions like \\"dump in 1 pkg yellow cake mix\\" doesn't say if you are to pour in the dry cake mix or if you are to mix it into a batter form before putting it in. Somehow I think things like that would make a difference. Even the instruction for popcorn has the phrase \\"...put in popcorn, not too much!!\\" How are we to know how much is too much?Maybe with more experience, this would all make sense. That's what I'm looking for in a book. To answer my questions, not leave me guessing. This is not a book for a first time outdoor chef."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I ordered this book because we have book one in our library but not book 2.

The depictions cannot be reproduced in reality. Impossible. Jumping rubber bands is one example. Making a simple twist in a rubber band, something's off here. Either the illustration or the description of the technique. Even-length fingers, no such thing. Flip your hand and catch the end of the handkerchief - you'd need a handkerchief weighing a pound.

A docudrama featuring genuine RAF pilots playing themselves as they go through a typical bombing attack on Nazi Germany. In this case, the oil yards of Kiel. Pickard was killed two years later during a mission much like the one shown here. This was remade by Dan Curtis during an ep of THE WINDS OF WAR. Not a documentary but a 50 min feature film.

It was a well-done courtroom procedural. I am not a lawyer, so I can't judge legal procedural accuracy, but I thought Martini did a great job interweaving explanations of the courtroom actions without seeming to interrupt the story.I listened to the audio version on a long trip and thought it very well done. The story is suspenseful, with a number of twists and turns. My only disappointment was that I had mostly figured out the final twist before its reveal. It's a small nit in an otherwise enjoyable story.I plan to enjoy more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the Book Very Much","review":"As I have come to expect and enjoy over the years this is another excellent book from Mr. Martini.

She pounds her pulpit to not just reform our economic society but to invert it. Her scheme for change requires more government intervention and less free capitalism. She is clearly in left field. The fedgov through their meddling in forbidding areas has created the mess we are seeing today. Corporations are abiding to compliant ethics (established by meddling government bureaucrats) and no more. Free capitalism abides to the divine ethics and does unto others as they would want done unto them. Ms. Kelly and those who like this book should reread Animal Farm, visit the Von Mises website or check economic books by Carson, Hazlitt or Sennholz."},{"rating":"2","title":"The plain and simple truth","review":"I think she has found the root cause of our global economic problems. I know this is a gigantic claim, but after years of observations I have come to the same conclusion as she. Nothing we do will truly change anything until we correct this flaw inherent in our economic system. Sadly, I was left in a sense of, \\"So now what do we do?\\" Nothing, save for creating an alternative system, is enough. Read this book, and then check out what we infobeings are doing about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise but too repetitious","review":"The premise put forth by the author that stockholders are really nothing more than speculators who are serendipitously granted the rights of owners and that employees should be counted as owners just as much as stockholders is spot on. The problem is that she takes over 200 pages of dead trees to basically repeat this assertion over and over again. Lacking a historical perspective of the labor movement she relies on catch phrases from Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and other 18th century political philosophers. Her suggestions about how to achieve employee parity with stockholders is sophomoric at best.For a much more profound analysis of the huge cost to society of global fascist multinational corporations read David Korten'sWhen Corporations Rule the World"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter for little money","review":"photography is new to me, and started it just as a hobby...a photographer friend told me that I really need to get a polarizer filter. not knowing i just goggled the word the prices ranged from 5$ to $50 so i just picked this one. have no complaints, even my photographer friend was impressed for the quality for little money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smaller home revelation.","review":"For those with smaller homes who are searching for ideas, this book is a real find.

The flames continued to come from the unit 1 1/2\\" from the bottom even after we placed it outside on the cement. I contacted the company (Joe Muscle) requesting an immediate refund and return label. The next morning Joe Muscle contacted me by email and let me know that they did process both those items.

The concept of slow cooker, steamer, deep fryer, etc in one unit is a great idea but this unit does not do what it advertised..I am very disappointed in the misleading description.

As a huge Styx fan bought this album on its release with high hopes! However, those high hopes sent me plummetting to the earth, landing in the desert without a camel, food or water! I must say that whenever someone tells me about the worst song they have ever heard, I hear them out and put them to the challenge. I bet them that I can give them one that is even worst then theirs!

Many musicians from the 70s and 80s can still play--but the voice is usually the first thing to go.

A great recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Styx","review":"I had read a lot about this album, but it's a thorough disappointment.Both 'Please' and 'Fire' are a couple of uninspiring hard-rock songs, the closing 'Dear Darling (I'll be there)' is a bland ballad that does nothing to stand out from any of his other ballads and 'Boys will be boys' sounds really silly, but I admit it's entertaining. The song 'Fire' doesn't even sound like a Dennis DeYoung song.The title track 'Desert Moon' is a strong ballad, nice melody, 'Don't wait for heroes' is a prophetic rocker that definitely wouldn't be out of place on a Styx album. The only 'progressive' song is 'Gravity', an airy song with some interesting synths and a jazzy feeling to it.Kind of a let-down really. Goes straight to predictable, bland 80's pop, though it isn't as synth drenched as most albums of the time. It's not all bad, but doesn't stack up against Styx albums in terms of creativity or song-writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Great CD..It brought back a lot of memories from the 80's for me.I'm glad I found this album on CD because I had worn out my cassette tapes years ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I learned a few things about what religious Jewish people do to celebrate various occasions. Although I have some Jewish friends, none practice, so this was informative. I am not sure there are actually such things as female rabbis and religious gay marriages in the Jewish faith, but this was fiction. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the silly sexual descriptions between the husband and wife, and the wife and her gay lover. Does the author really think readers need a description, in order to know what happens between two people? That was the only spoiler for me. Sex left to the imagination of the reader is so much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I am in a diversity book club where I work and we chose A Departure from the Script as one of our reading selections. What a great read! This book explored multiple levels of diversity - not only homosexuality but religion and weight issues. Additionally, the book delved into husband/wife, man/woman and parent/child issues with equal ease. The book spawned lively discussion and thought-provoking introspection. Although dealing with meaty issues, the book was an easy page turner. I not only recommend A Departure from the Script as a great book highlighting diverse issues but just simply a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important book on an important subject","review":"This book is written for physicists. Some of the information is more broadly accessible, especially some of the figures. I especially like Fig. 3.1 on pg. 123.The author does not discriminate against experimental results that he cannot explain, and this is a plus. Many potential mechanisms are discussed.Ideally it would be more accessible. The description of gauge symmetry is obviously gratuitous.The price is high, but there's not much out there to compete with it.The Handbook of Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields is more accessible, but is mostly prejudiced in favor of the current safety standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mid-60's Cool Jazz: One of Five from 65","review":"I can't add much more to what the other fellow mentioned in his review of Comin' on, so I'll simply say this is one of Chet's lesser known 60's recordings, one of five from 1965 that should not go overlooked. Unreleased but for an import some years back, it is a slow-burning, modal, and lyrical record that dismisses any notion that cool jazz was dead when the 60's took hold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect and a great price","review":"My son desperately wanted a tunnel for his combination Thomas/Imaginarium tracks. But we have some Thomas wooden trains, and I've read that they don't fit inside the Imaginarium tunnels, and the Thomas tunnels were too expensive.

Also, there are things like conceptual drawings, behind the scenes footage, outtakes,etc.The Pioneer 'Special Edition' truly deserves that label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre sequel to a excellent original","review":"This tepid,disappointing sequel is far better than Beyond the Re-Animator but dosen't equal a good sequel to the excellent original. Dr.Herbert West and his friend Dan re-animate dead bodies and when Dan's girlfriend is dying she is re-animated just like Bride of Frankenstein. The gore effects are good including the crawling eyeball but the movie becomes tedious and more predictable as it goes along. The new director Brian Yuzna does a good job taking over Stuart Gordon but this movie fails to entertain and make watchable that this looks like a Sci/Fi channel movie that would debut on TV and the movie is just disappointing compared to the first with a new cast(Except Jeffrey Combs and Bruce Abbott),lower production values and lower budget,and tepid to atrocious acting. If you seen the first your not missing much but for some reason you can recommend this instead of Beyond the Re-Animator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Your Money","review":"The picture quality is decent, the audio horrible. It has this annoying hiss and when you put it in stereo the hiss just gets louder when the rest of the audio. The story itself is boring and been done before. I realize they were paying homeage to \\"The Bride of Frankenstein\\", but this movie is an insult to that classic horror film. Not only that, it is an insult to the first \\"Re-Animator\\" movie which is a modern classic. Skip this stinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal sequel, Combs' humor hits its peak.","review":"He's back at work with his syringes of green fluid, and this time he's perfected his method...but then again, perhaps he hasn't. His companion still grieves over the loss of his girl-friend and faithfully keeps her heart preserved. However, West's new serum can now not only re-animate, but can create life, and he offers to help his friend. However, trouble ensues when old opponents don't stay dead, local law-enforcement becomes involved, and a new amour is found by Abbot. Hilarious, innovative, and at times disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankenstein-well sort of!","review":"Ok, of all the Re-Animator movies, this one is by far the worst, it has its moments and even some laughs, but all the movie is, is a rip-off of The bride of Frankenstein. The old story of man loses girl friend, but mad scientist keeps dead girl's heart and builds a body around the frozen heart, with of course the help of the girl's boyfriend. I don't think his was what H.P. Lovecraft had in mind when he wrote the story about the Re-Animator and I think he turned over in his grave when this movie was released. Even Jeffery Combs could not save this one, it is too predictable and lame. The original Re-Animator and Beyond the Re-Animator are pretty good and worth owning, this was was the flat tire of the bunch. Back to the Drawing board Doc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent film but terrible VOD.","review":"Buying this download was a big disappointment. 4:3 aspect ratio and looks more like a vhs transfer than a DVD transfer.

Right next to Aspirin and Asimov I have come up wanting every frickn time. Until last weekend!Great book. You wrote Aahz showing a huge range of emotions. I may have to read the series again (I re-read it every couple years or so it seems) but Aahz was pretty hardcore. Which I enjoyed a lot.What I would like to see in the myth books, is Skeeve learn to actually be a powerful magician. Because even now, he's pretty wimpy. It would be so cool to see him go from barely doing the feather exercise to being able to loft an entire army into the air and letting them fall to their deaths. Woot.Yes, I know Skeeve wouldn't do that, maybe he could become possessed or something.At any rate, thanks for coming back and OMG make Aahz and Skeeve a movie already.Dan"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rather have not ever read it","review":"Yes, it really IS that bad!

And it worked...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rusty return","review":"I used to really enjoy the Myth series by Robert Asprin but Asprin - for reasons he is rather vague about - pretty much stopped writing the books in the mid-'90s. Now, at long last, he has written another Myth book, and I feel I could have waited after all.This story, which takes place after book three in the series has Skeeve and Aahz seeking a cow that delivers golden milk. Of course, it is not that easy to get to said cow. It is a combination fantasy/western/vampire story, and it doesn't really work. The plot is okay, but the writing is weak, the characters are shallow and worst of all, it just isn't funny.I have enough loyalty to the series not to ditch it based off of one bad book, but this is not a good sign for Asprin's return. This book is for Myth fans only...all others should look elsewhere for their entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, I get it. It's a joke. Who wrote this? Really?","review":"No one talks like themselves. The three known characters involved, Skeeve, Aahz, and Tanda... they barely even ACT like themselves. Basic rules of magic (that the person who uses a disguise spell can't see it, that the sources of magic are called 'force lines') are just forgotten about. Completely. Everything sounds stilted and phony, and no one seems to want to use contractions or sound at all natural. Aahz in particular has been replaced by a poorly realized doppleganger of himself, and the interplay between the two main characters is completely spoiled.This is almost WORSE than the new \\"Phule\\" books, because this is supposed to be Asprin himself. I guess Asprin doesn't even know how to write Asprin books anymore.If there's another book in this series, I'm getting it at the library before I even think about buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Myth-Ion Improbable Just as good as any other myth book!","review":"If you are a fan of the myth books than read this newer adventure. It is just as good as the first few myth books that Asprin wrote, if not better. I couldn't put the book down, and read it in two days.I have seen a couple reviews of this book and some seem to complain it is not as good or the writing style is different than the other myth books. I do not agree. Don't listen to the bad reviews, buy this book and read it right away if you are a fan of the myth series. Robert Asprin has once again writen a great myth tale. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Goodness for small favors","review":"I had all but given up on Mr. Asprin and his Myth crew thinking the series was getting too big for it's own good. After all, by the end of the second to the last book (I am trying very hard to forget the awful \\"Sweet Myth-tery of Life\\" which read more as therapy to a scorned divorcee than a Myth adventure) our Heros were so well off and had so many people working with them, there were no really tense moments. What new mountains could they climb? So it was nice to return to a time when they did not have all the answers and were struggling to make it to the end of the book. This may not have been the best addition ever but it is a good apetizer to what lies ahead. But after so many years of waiting, I'm not sure if I'm ready for the promised novel. It could bring about too many painful memories of the book it will be written around."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poorly Written Throwback","review":"I simply did not enjoy this. I find the rest of the series (at least the first 9 books) kind of silly and absurd and not great reading in any way, but amusing enough. This, on the other hand, was not up to par. I understand that Asprin was coming off of personal difficulties and hadn't written these characters in numerous years, but his characterizations were very off, and the light-heartedness that was present in the preceding books was simply gone. The beginning was somewhat redundant, and the end was a confusing mess. Having picked this up to see if I wanted to read the rest of the newer books, I may decide to set it down again. It's just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Myth-Use of My Money and Time!","review":"This was a truly terrible book. I am glad that it was not the first Myth book I read or I probably would not have read another. I wonder if this book was one that was written many years ago and just brought out of the closet and dusted off because the publishers knew poor suckers (like me) would buy it just based on its author. I don't know. I do know that I am sorry I wasted my money and my time. Sorry Mr. Asprin but your other books are in a completely different league and selling this book as a true MYTH book was like a used car salesman's bait and switch tactic."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a Myth book, it's not much...","review":"Don't get me wrong, please; I'm a HUGE fan of Asprin's Myth series, and I was happier than anyone else to see a new Myth book! Unfortunately, though, it's not MUCH of a Myth book. Many of the characters suffer in this work, but Aahz seems especially flat and unconvincing. Asprin explains in his introduction that he needed to ease himself back into the series after such a long hiatus, and I certainly appreciate his artistic need to do so - but the book just isn't very good. Collectors, die-hard fans, and those with lots of cash could invest in a personal copy, but I would reccomend that the casual reader check a copy out of their local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the love","review":"While I was happy to see the Robert Asprin is back and writting the Myth series again, I would be lying if I said I was satified with this installment. While the action, adventure and humor are all still there from the previous books the heart is missing. Aahz is just plain mean. Very really to you get the feeling the he likes Skeeve. Unlike in past books where you always could tell that under Aahz's gruff and grumpy personna you could tell he really cared for Skeeve.It wasn't just Aahz none of the characters seemed the same. Still, this book was written to simply get Mr. Asprin refreshed with his characters again not to really further the series. Hopefully, he has done that and the magic will return in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I don't like taking \\"Test your Knowledge\\" tests, only to find the \\"correct\\" answers were never mentioned in the chapter.

If you're looking for a true musical - this is it! Huge disco hits throughout the movie that still get played in clubs today! Buy it - if only to see the scene with \\"Operator! My finger is stuck!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia","review":"Had this on tape years ago - sure beats some of the shows out there on TV.Just plain fun and a true history of the Village People who have always been different and diverse from all the others.

Especially the first song about New York City-super."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Village People's Music isn't Bad","review":"I actually enjoyed the movie. The plot isn't particularly good. But if You like Village People's music You'll like this and the cast is good. Parine, Jenner and Guttenberg are good together. And it's got some good humor too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's good? Hardly...","review":"Some movies are so inept and awful, that they're actually fun to watch. They have a certain charm that you feel like coming back to over and over again. That's not the case, however, with Can't Stop the Music. It's just truly, horribly awful. I'm sure the idea sounded good at the time. Disco was hot, the Village People were one of the hottest acts around, and Grease had just shown that a musical can still be a smash hit. While it may have been a good concept in theory, in practice it was just awful.With some truly awful movies, you can sit back, relax, and laugh at what makes them bad. With this, you are just so horrified at how abominable it really is that there's no way you could ever find any pleasure in watching it. It's painfully, sickeningly bad.However, the movie itself looks and sounds good on DVD. If you have to own this (and God help you if you do), this is the best possible presentation you're going to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"-*- ... and Proud of It!","review":"This movie is horrible.

An all out train wreck of a movie meant to capitalize on the very brief popularity of the Village People, the music's not the only thing that stopped. This travesty killed the careers of practically everyone involved in it. Directed by of all people Nancy Walker, it's about efforts to bring the Village People to fame in the name of a struggling record producer played none-too-convincingly by Steve Guttenberg. The normally reliable and luscious Valerie Perrine is wasted as Guttenbergs' girlfriend. Lots of familiar faces including a very confused Bruce Jenner are sprinkled throughout to no avail. This movie is just unbelievably bad. Bad disco and bad acting may make this a camp classic in some circles. Some may even find it so bad it's funny. But I wouldn't sit through it again for anything. So if you must, view at your own risk. But don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacramento VP Lover!","review":"Even though this movie is pretty bad, if your a \\"true\\" Village People fan it really won't matter.

The VP were an icon for disco and they are still going stronger then ever today. I have never known of another group to beable to draw a crowd like they do and perform like it was the first time.I enjoyed every minute of this movie, remembering when I saw it for the first time all those years ago.

This is not one of those movies. Bad casting. Bad Acting. Horrible editing and Crappy choreography. How did Varie Perrine get stuck in this after Superman the Movie?

Leah!\\" and \\"Love Is Like A Rock\\", both of which are included here. The music on this collection, despite its slickness, holds up better than most other early 80s postpunk, perhaps because instead of spewing insults (a no-no in my Jewish faith), it attempted to deepen a tradition. This CD is an essential purchase for anyone who loves pop in its purest sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...

Calling Nogueria's style \\"Brazilian\\" or \\"Latin\\" doesn't seem to do it justice. There's bits of jazz, country, and zydeco worked in here, and of course the pop/rock of the Beatles. The overall effect transforms the songs, much like Jose Feliciano's cover of \\"Light My Fire\\" - it's hard to imagine the song COULD sound like that until you actually hear it. The guitar playing is excellent (and they've even printed the guitar chords in the booklet with the lyrics, so you can play along at home!) Standouts are \\"Norwegian Wood\\" and \\"Blackbird\\" due to the intricate guitar arrangements. The harmonies and background vocals on \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"We Can Work It Out\\" really add nice touches to these versions as well.Bonus for hard-core Beatles fans: is that \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" arranged in the style of \\"The Night Before\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"pictures speak louder than words","review":"Too small photos, landscaping is about pictures,not words...Pictures can say a thousand words.

The player does a more consistent job playing discs than my playstation 2 does at home... discs that skip in my PS2 play flawlessly in the Panasonic player.The only complaint I have is that when connected to my TV (4:3 aspect ratio) at home, it will squish widescreen formatted movies (everything is too tall) instead of displaying those black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.

I unscrewed the bottom and there was a bit of dust in the mechanism.One of the reps from Panasonic said that to be sure to not just cut the power to the player when done, but to push stop and thenoff, to shut it down properly.

I have tried for the over 3 weeks to find out the status of the free charger and have gotten no answer. To make matters worse, I found out that the charger from Panasonic is $149.

Tonight we ran into the infamous H03, but had it up and running again after reading the trouble-shooting ideas below.The initialization trick (back skip/play/pause simultaneously) did not work, but taking the bottom off of the player and fiddling with the transport mechanism did the trick. For details, see \\"Jedi\\"'s review below (approx. 40 reviews from the end). It is not a difficult exercise, so do not be intimidated by taking the screws out and getting your fingers in there. You will need a jeweler's philips-head screwdriver (the tiny, long ones).As many have said, the unit is sturdy, easy to operate, and has an attractive screen. Clearly, Panasonic is looking the other way on this one, or we'd have heard of a recall by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"H03 error & solution","review":"Got this error on my Panasonic Portable DVD and did a google search to see what came up... found all these reviews.

Seems like Panasonic planted a time bomb so we would have to buy a new one after a period of time. This should be a recall, not a warranty issue (short warranty by the way). Sleazy, my last panasonic purchase.Otherwise, this was a good player, a little small by today's standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality or Bad Engineering","review":"For the price I expected a better built product. I unpacked the unit and thought to myself that I better hold onto the receipt.... within 24 hours the screen went nearly black. Not sure why, I was running the unit off a car adapter AC Power Supply. We shut off the car while the player was in pause, and it never recovered... I would think that a portable unit should be able to handle interupted power supply issues.. As far as I'm concerned, its Junk. We'll be returing it Monday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge waste of money","review":"I've read many reviews concerning this particular model, and I have to say most of them were horrible.

But, I'm sitting in Iraq right now, without my receipt to \\"prove\\" when I purchased it. I can't even pick up the phone and call Panasonic because I'll be on hold more than the 15 minutes I'm allotted weekly, like I'll use those precious phone calls for them versus my family.

It went very deep in a lot of different subjects. The book describes many different breeds, what they are used for, where they originated, how tall they can get, how much they can weigh, and the usual care for that breed of a horse.Also written about in this book is the different sports and events that a horse can be used for. It also goes deeply into the ancient history of the horse.I definetly recommend this book to horse lovers and anybody that is really interested in learning more about horses then it would be very great to read, but if you are more into the medical aspect of the horse then this is really not the book for you it really does not go into any depth with medicine.

I read [this] book prior to a week-long trip to Venice. This book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives. It is a poor \\"guidebook\\" and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue--to quote Simon: \\"Abysmal with a capital A.\\" The history and art of Venice are covered better in books from those genres. The only upside is that it is short. Yuck, what a waste of time. My advice is: get a novel about Venice if you like novels, a guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book. At least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of these and fails. Actually, in terms of a travelogue, \\"Vendela in Venice\\" far surpassess any other Venice book I have seen.

I tossed it about half-way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea Marred by Infantile Style","review":"This novel has such a great premise but is unreadable due to the lousy writing. From the critical and reader reviews I thought Beggars in Spain would be the work of a top literary stylist; instead, it's the work of a rank amateur. The dialog is especially bad. Granted, the book starts out from an infant's POV, so I didn't throw it across the room until page 100, at which point the main character was a fully grown woman. Too bad the author's style didn't mature with her character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy science and flat characters","review":"I was deeply disappointed with the science in this book. Clearly Nancy Kress hasn't bothered to do much research on sleep(its importance to long term memory) the immune system(the ravaging effects of sleep deprivation on health) or genetics (which she treats like big on and off switches).Because the book was so highly recommended to me I attempted to enjoy it in spite of theses flaws. But the characters were flat and didn't seem grounded in reality at all. Their conversations never sounded true or honest. Instead they seemed like tele-marketers reading scripts to one another. The whole book seemed to boil down to a hair care commercial touting,\\"Don't Hate Me Because I'm Beautiful\\" as a central philosophy.Over all I would say that this book this was one of the most hateful reads I have ever endured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful -- until she betrays it all in the end.","review":"I really enjoyed this book, right up until the end. Kress gives us a world full of great new ideas, very well thought out and believable. I often said to myself, \\"She really understands!\\" But the way she wraps up the story inspired me to swear to never read another word of her output as long as I live. Readers should be warned that if they really identify with the views seemingly expressed through the main body of the book, they will feel utterly betrayed by the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I purchased this book in Spain... Besides this curiosity, I must say I really wanted to read this book after reading some reviews, however it slightly disappointed me. It is a good book though, but to me it was very plain and simple. I thought it would have deeper characters but i find them to be pretty simple and not much realistic. The story looks to me rather unrealistic too, the events and actions that happen.. i'd never think they could really happen. I was expecting something that would have some \\"philosophical implications\\", or let's say something that would make you think about it, but there was none of this.I would say it's like a long tale, but a tale nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel.","review":"Character development: poor to nil.

This sets up a moral and political battle between the \\"sleepless\\" and the \\"sleepers\\" that explores prejudice, cooperation, fear, protectiveness, envy, and a host of other emotions. Our present is explored by extending current trends, in the best tradition of science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"I recommend this book for its strong characters and interesting plot. Kress did a good job of showing a world with sleepers and sleepless. A must read for a good \\"what-if?\\" situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big fuss?","review":"This book is a mess from beginning to end. Why is everyone so excited about it? The main character does nothing of consequence for the entire book, which is amazing considering that, as one of the sleepless beings Kress has created, she lives without aging (?!?) for centuries. Kress doesn't know what she is writing about. There is nothing plausible in her science, her sociology, her characters, or, worst of all, her plot. The plotting comes from the \\"One Damn Thing After Another\\" school where things happen because the author needs a plot complication (see Jack Whyte for another example of this style). There is nothing organic at all about the characters, either in how they relate to each other or to the plot occuring around them. this is truly Shakespeare's \\"tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit boring","review":"No plot spoilers here. Look at the 5 star reviews for a good summary.A good chunk of the book involves the legal battle of the sleepless. Way too much in fact.Major contradiction (in my mind): if the sleepless are so super intelligent, why make casual references to their following of religions? Why mention 12 times that one character is wearing her abaya (Muslim headscarf) if there is no discussion about relgion at all?Too many minor characters are introduced.Oh! the main character - just hangs out on earth for decades, not doing much of anything except maybe trying to form relationships with her sister's family.I would give this book 1 star.....but the beginning is quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable and Engaging","review":"Reading the reviews it seems as though this is a book full of references and echos. The Ayn Rand echos are noted, as are the Ender Wiggins. I will add one more. I was struck that this was a more mature version of Anne McCaffrey's To Ride Pegasus.I thought it was clever how the hatred for the super-talented sleepless is first seen in the fact that their competition is seen as unfair. I like very much the way that Kress developed the question of whether people who can contribute to such a high degree are obliged to help the \\"beggars\\", the sleepers who can never be as productive to the society. I even like the way that she turns the question of being a beggar on its head later with the super-sleepless (although I can imagine that people who were following along with the political thread were a little disappointed at the easy way in which art becomes the redemptive factor.)Smart, very readable, and makes me want to read the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly dated","review":"But only in the sense that the book starts in 2008, and we're nowhere near this level of genetic engineering. Otherwise, it's an outstanding story that addresses the age old issues of the haves vs the have nots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"This book is brilliant and thought provoking. It is a good sci fi choice for a book group because it generates discussion. Even groups that usually don't read science fiction can enjoy the story, characters, and philosophical/ethical issues introduced in the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised by nature of criticisms.","review":"I figured this book would have critics, but I thought they'd criticize the dysfunctional family aspect, the fact that it works with fairly old themes, the somewhat political nature, or the Americentricness. Although I'd agree the last half seemed sort of implausible & incongruitous with the first half. Regardless I really liked it the line \\"Alice is special\\" really stuck with me. Also it's nice to read a book with a rational woman in it. I hate to say this, but women authors seemed to have abandoned the idea women can be rational & bash reason as a \\"patriarchalist\\" value. Of course rationalism is mildly bashed in this book & I don't think it's enough to get by in life. Also the people were more real then in most sf, strangely the fact you only got glimpses of who they were is more true to life. Oh, by the way Kress recently married hard sf author Charles Sheffield"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly deserved the Prizes;","review":"Tightly written future history story about a genetic alteration that permits a person to not need sleep.Probably the biografies of Thomas Edison, and Napoleon inspired Ms. Kress to create the detailed vision of human nature combined with one small physical change. Strangely enough it reminds me of \\"Flatland\\" bya Square."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy successor to Huxley","review":"Nancy Kress's BEGGARS IN SPAIN, is, IMO, the best SF novel of its kind since BRAVE NEW WORLD. Certainly it's one of the most thoughtful to tackle the subject of DNA manipulation in humans in many years. Her eye for story + character is wonderful, as well as for the large & small details of her future world. I'd recommend this SF novel to people who don't usually like the genre. She covers the subject matter much more thoroughly & realistically than the film GATTACA, which owes more than a little to the sibling-rivalry theme in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failing to add interest to ambition","review":"When I read this book, I was impressed by Kress's ambition to tackle a sweeping series that extrapolate the future of human culture, in the grand tradition of classic writers such as Aasimov. Unfortunately, in my eyes she fails. The characters read to me like the typical product of soap opera, and the plot is at least as old as comic books - guilty-feeling people with superpowers and the sullen normal folk who resent them.

The microphones appeared to be set up in the audience and not near the orchestra as at the end of each tune, the clapping from the audience was deafening and the sound had to be turned down, also during audience participation, I found the clapping to drown out the orchestra. The 2 hour show was split into 2 parts and you had to go back into the menu to click on the 2nd part.

In my opinion, Demon days was the best album of 2005. That being said, this collection of B-sides is really below the bar that was set by its predecessor. A few of the new tracks are pretty catchy, the demo version of 'Don't Get Lost In Heaven\\" especially, but for the most part it's all fluff. The remixes are even more unremarkable, and in some cases just downright annoying. Though it's nice that they're giving you 13 new tracks on top of the 9 remixes, this album isn't song for song as worth your money as the B-side collection (G-Sides) that followed the first album, even though it only contained a handful of new songs. Even for hardcore Gorillaz fans, D-Sides is really a stretch, and should be purchased only by those concerned with completing their CD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorrilaz","review":"It's Gorrilaz.

This is my next encounter with this band, and things haven't changed much, which isn't really surprising. I've learned that there has to be a level of memorability in a record that will make me want to play it over and over again. But like Sadistik Execution, who actually bore me to death, Revenge relies on speed to make its point across. The execution is tight, but really how long can one stand hearing an overwhelming amount of non-stop blasts and monotonous riffs? Luckily, this is only 28 minutes long. But still, after listening to such a record, you feel like you have just been through a hostile, adverse environment and usually that would be a complement to a metal band, but not in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"lol this thing","review":"this is the worst thing in the world i don want to call it a vest the protection is terrible and if you get hit with a 370 or higher fps the plastic inside will break i got this thing with a gun but it is the same exact thing plz save the money buy something else"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phatboy Slim","review":"Let me just praise you Norman Cook for putting out a cd that dared to be different. No it is not like all that other pop stuff that is drowning the industry. Norman Cook dared to put a cd out that had great beats and just \\"catchy\\", so you can go out and have some fun. If you are looking for a cd with high lyrical standards, go elsewhere, this ain't one of them. This cd is meant just to have fun and enjoy life. Songs like The Rockafeller Skank and Gangster Tripping are sure to have you up and enjoying life. Cook is in the same area of the Chemical Brothers, but to a certain degree, better. The songs Praise you, and Right Here, Right Now are also good. For the most part the entire cd is strong except for a few songs like Illin In Heaven. I'd give this cd 5 stars but I reserve that for the cream of the crop and Phatboy Slim misses it by a bit. But if you want to have fun with life and get the party going, go out and get this cd, you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting, eclectic mix of electronica, funk and hip hop.","review":"The meshing of diverse musical styles keeps you in suspense throughout. Every tune is unique and solid in its own right. While there isn't a single \\"skip over\\" tune on the album, \\"Right Here, Right Now\\" is by far my favourite.

I got this because I loved the \\"Praise You\\" video and track and when I found out that \\"The Rockafeller Skank\\" was also on this thing I just fell for the whole package. This version also has a very decent 4-track bonus disc which for strictly trance/dance reasons is actually better than the main disc. \\"Kalifornia\\" is another stand out track from the main disc. Good sound quality, two good discs, great value for money are reasons why this is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"You've come a long way baby is a really great electronic album.

It was all over the place in the late 90's, and might have even suffered from over-exposure. I could be wrong. However, \\"You've Come A Long Way, Baby\\" is really good, though extremely repetitive, and has quick burn-out potential. I throw it in just a few times a year, but do like it when it's played. \\"The Rockefeller Skank\\", \\"Gangsta Tripping\\", and \\"Praise You\\" were the hits from this, but I like a few of the others just as much.

This is a wonderful CD. Even though the songs are a little lengthy(Rockafeller Skank is 7 min, 21 sec long), there is a lot of groovieness packed into it. It has everything from the blown-out speaker sound in Love Island to the radio broadcast at the end of Right Here, Right Now. But what's with \\"Ooh Ooh\\" in Soul Surfing? A little annoying, but it's funny. Illin in Heaven has got some major bass lines. A must have for....EVERYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatboy Slim rulz.

Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better stuff out there","review":"Norman Cook a.k.a. Fatboy Slim is good at a couple of things. First, he has a wicked sense of humour and anyone who has seen the non-US cover to this album or the Spike Jonez-directed clip to 'Praise You' will know what I mean. Second, he is good at taking other people's sounds and making commercial hits out of them. Anyone who is a relative newcomer to breakbeat will find this CD refreshing and new, but older fans will find it too derivative of old-skool Chemical Brothers and Beasties: only 'Right Here Right now' offers something different. For sure, try it before you buy, but also give 'Gatecrasher Discotech' and BT's 'Movement in Still Life' a listen. I have a feeling that these are where the future of dance music lies, whereas the Fatboy seems to be stuck in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purty Darn Kewl","review":"FBS has been one of my favorite artists since I got \\"Better Living Through Chemistry\\" in 1997. \\"You've come a long way baby\\" show FBS's versatilty as an artist.

Although, I suppose the UK version of the album cover, with it's _incredibly_ obese, and obviously American, bloke with his 'I'm #1 So Why Try Harder?' T-shirt probably wouldn't have gone down very well in the US. Still, got to laugh, haven't you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated mess","review":"Other than a couple of killer tracks, this CD is pretty repetitious and boring when you really listen to it. 'Illin' in Heaven' is a total waste of disc space (the 'F' word repeated ad naseum - how deep), plus 'Praise You' sounds an awful lot like 'Unbelievable' by EMF. The Housemartins (Cook's band from the 80's) simply blow this mess away. No they weren't dance pop, but they had far more depth and variety than found on this limp CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an awesome CD","review":"Buy this CD.

He is repetitious beyond belief, to the point of madness. Of course he is ruining what is known as 'big beat' (another idiotic sub-sub-genre) but this is to be expected. This is simply mass produced beats that anyone with the same equipment could squeeze out. For all their faults, I'll take the Chem Brothers, who at least seem to have a better record collection.

From that track on, he never stops laying down the grooves. He is a genius, and possibly the most recognized Electronica musician in the world.

It is a collection of rare grooves that Fatboy samples (for instance -- check the vocals on Praise Yourself). These rare grooves are funky jams from the early 1970s -- from the Vanguard vaults!! The best part is that Fatboy Slim himself has a bonus track on the CD!!! It is a remake of the 1970 funky, weird moog jam E.V.A. by Jean Jaques Perry!!! It is some of his best unheard work!!!

I really liked \\"Rockafeller Skank\\" when I heard it on the radio, but the longer album version tends to get on my nerves a bit. Some of the other tracks are equally annoying. \\"Illin in Heaven\\" for example, is barely music, and seemed to be just an excuse to have an \\"explicit lyrics\\" sticker on the cover. \\"Gangster Trippin\\" and \\"Praise You\\" are good tracks, but they can be found on the \\"Go\\" and \\"Cruel Intentions\\" soundtracks, both of which are much better CDs to buy. I wanted to like this CD, but was strongly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the MTV.","review":"The video is great, the rythm is great. No doubt, \\"Praise You\\" is a wonderful song. It was wonderful enough to make me check out the album. However, I sold it the next day. After listening to all the songs, I discovered that the entire cd only contained four different words, one of them being the \\"f word\\" which, in the song \\"In Heaven\\" is repeated constantly for upwards of 60 times. Creativity? I see none. \\"Praise You\\" is a catchy song, but the album itsself is anything but catchy. Don't waste your money like I did. Instead, if you're into good pop music--check out Cher's new release or the new one by REM. If you want other better alternitives to this album that don't involve music, try beating your head on hot rocks. Better still--stab yourself in the chest repeatedly and go for a dip in your psycho neighbor's alcohol spa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatboy needs to slim down the running time....","review":"In Heaven is a terrible track, period. There are some solid tracks, but the album is weighed down by too much repetition. After listening to about 2 minutes of a track like Gangster Trippin' I'm ready for the next track.

Advertisers were desperate for a catchyhit that they could use to sell their product and Fat Boy Slim's albumhad a compilation of such tracks.'Praise You', 'Right here, rightnow', 'The Rockafeller Skank' were all played religiously throughoutthe year of their release. Fat Boy Slim was a cultural phenomenon.However nothing lasts in our fast-food culture and so, an album likeMoby's Play came along and took over the mantle of the new advertisingweapon.So now, You've come a long way baby doesn't hold up as well.Sure, the hits at the time still have novelty value but the albumitself doesn't allow repeated listens.

I tried listening to the whole disc in order in the car without jumping forward or backward during the songs. Couldn't do it. It's like having the television remote in my hand on a Thursday night at 3 a.m., there's just nothing to get into for more than a few minutes.

HEY! One man's trash is another man's treasure! The reason for my tardiness is I'm usually turned off by artists, groups, CDs or songs that get too much attention or airplay! In fact, I usually stray away from them! Fatboy Slim was/is definitely one of those artists. All that said, I was thouroughly impressed with this guy's skills as a DJ/mixer, although at times some of FBS' music becomes repetitive, nerve-racking and down right noisy. That notwithstanding, songs like \\"Right Here, Right Now\\", \\"You're Not From Brighton\\" and \\"Acid 8000\\" are winners (IMO)!

The songs are like nothing I've ever heard before. It's like a surrealistic painting coverted to sound. Nonetheless, most of the songs are great. There is one that is absolutely idle and in short, sucks. That song is track number 3. Never have I heard such monstrosity. I don't usually mind the use of profane language, but a song that repeats \\"Fatboy Slim is...\\" (you know the rest) goes down absolute crap and a complete mockery in my book.

CHECK IT OUT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a kicking album, should be top of everyone's list.","review":"This album starts off strongly and gets better and better. While tracks like \\"The Rockafeller Skank\\" are instantly catchy, \\"Right Here, Right Now\\" slowly gets into your head, takes up residency and will not leave. Similarly, \\"In Heaven\\" is lethally funky - assuming you don't mind hearing what Fatboy Slim is doing in heaven... This is an excellent album that only slightly suffers from the \\"a few great songs and some filler tracks\\" syndrome - a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"I don't like to completely dismiss an album... but this really is a piece of crap. Mr Slim aims for something between dried-up electronica and commercial pop and, with the exception of Acid 8000, misses every time. Anyone with the equipment could make an album like this, as there are no clever musical twists, no melodies, just the same samples being sequenced over again - has there ever been a more repetitve song than the Rockafeller Skank? Several of my friends were under the impression that this was a \\"cool\\" album when it came out, but no one I know listens to it a few months later. If you think this is a good example of dance music, then you've clearly not heard any Orb, Future Sound of London, Boards of Canada or Autechre."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland","review":"after hearing this disc i don't get all there hype.the beats and chants sound alright for a fast food comercial but not something that is worth all this attention.the beats are dated and weak just like the group."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give a negative number","review":"Are you people on drugs! You do realize that Rockafeller Skank consists of about 6 unintelligible words repeated over and over for more than 8 minutes don't you? How can you consider that great music? I think it should be used as a torture device to get enemies to spill their guts."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST TECHNO CD OF 1998!","review":"5 STARS? NO WAY! THIS CD IS TECHNO AT ITS LOWEST! I LOATHED \\"PRAISE YOU\\". FATBOY SLIM'S MUSIC IS SOOOOOO GENERIC. SO IS MOBY. I GO WITH DAFT PUNK OR JAMES HARDWAY ANY DAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus Ten","review":"Unfortunately I cannot rate this Minus ten stars. This \\"Song\\" is pop music at it's absolute worst. For those who enjoy listening to this repetive six word line for ten+ minutes I would like to have some of whatever it is you are smoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great book.","review":"I think that this book was a good introduction to children starting to read the Sherlock Holmes mysteries. It showed how he thought, and was a good children's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book, and the other mystery books by Robert Newman, are great reads. They are well written and interesting. They don't have too high vocabulary for kids, but they are still interesting and have enough plot to satisfy anybody who enjoys mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product needs to be refined! Holes formed in material after only a few days!","review":"Hole formed after less than a week of use.. Exterior fabric is not suitable and should be refined or cease sales!! Highly disappointed after beginning to like this item only to have the fabric form holes, spilling out the contents after just a few days of use. It's a shame these items aren't reviewed more by actual consumer product officials. Will never buy this brand product unless the materials are updated and warrantied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thermalon Heating Pad","review":"I thoughly recommend anyone getting this heating pad. I is so easy to use. You just put it into the microwave for 1 min 30 sec each side and then place where your pain is. Also a great price for $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife Loves It!","review":"This is the third one my wife has owned. She uses them to keep her warm, particularly since she has been undergoing chemotherapy treatments the past 15 months. She loves it! It has proven to be the longest lasting warming pad of any kind she can find. I bought her two, as the first one lasted just over a year. This was only due to being heated in the microwave at least a dozen times a day over that period, otherwise it could have lasted longer before the smell finally got to her. Very good product for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thermalon Microwave Activated Heat Pad","review":"This Thermalon Microwave Activated Heat Pad is lightweight, a perfect size and shape to provide moist heat to the abdomen, back, shoulder or hip. It can be folded for easy storage in a night stand, and offers comfort when in bed, in the car, or lounging around the house. A member of our household is a cancer patient undergoing chemotherapy and radiation and he couldn't get along without this Thermalon pad. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold the head","review":"Hi FolksOthers may have liked this pad, but compared to the one my sister in-law sent me from Australia, it isn't very good. It holds the heat about 1/4 of the time the Oz pad does. Now to find out where the sister got it from and start selling them in the USA!Cheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"I wanted a replacement while my Thermophore was being repaired, but this isn't even close. Didn't get hot enough or retain the heat long enough - not much moisture, either. Better than nothing, but I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for back and abdomen","review":"I use this for lower back for PMS or before stretching to soften the muscle, fascia first. I also sometimes use it for cramps or stomach aches. I love thermalon products; would've given it 5 stars but I like the newer material used in other products of theirs, and straps would make this one more versatile so it could be used standing up or while seated. Covers pretty good amount of surface area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Products like this are usually under-rated but this one is great","review":"This product is easy to use, retains heat for a good amount of time and easily stores when not in use. It DOES help with pain, at least the kind I have. I'd highly recommend this product and any of the others in this product line. They are inexpensive and long lasting. I plan to buy more of them in different sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"heats and stays hot","review":"This product heats in the microwave in two minutes and stays hot longer (with no odor) than others I have tried. Great for heating up the bed on cold nights or soothing aching muscles."},{"rating":"1","title":"not safe","review":"Just purchased and the case got damaged by microwaving as per manufacturer instructions. Case melted and two holes formed. All the beads spilled out all over the entire kitchen... what a waste and a hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT DURABLE ENOUGH FOR MICROWAVE","review":"EVEN WHEN MICROWAVING AS PER INSTRUCTIONS, THE HEAT PACK EVENTUALLY SPLIT OPEN, SPILLING ITS CONTENTS. HAVING USED OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS THAT PERFORMED WELL, I WOULD ADVISE AGAINST BUYING THIS PARTICULAR ITEM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!","review":"I had to return this product. It leaked after about 4 or 5 uses. Don't waste your time and effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Mom loves it","review":"My mom is going through menopause and experiencing horrible back and shoulder pain. She has been using a warm wash cloth every night to help, but the water keeps running down her back which is uncomfortable. The first night she used this she called and said \\"Oh my gosh this works fantastic\\". She has used it every time she has had pain and says it works great every time. You simply microwave it and it feels warm and moist. I bought the same brand sinus mask and it works great also. Just be careful to not overheat as it does get quite hot quickly. I highly recommend and so does my mom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the guy below said \\"Nice Cover\\"","review":"I have been programming off and on for a couple of years now. I started reading this to refresh my memory on some techniques and gain a better understanding of others. This book mangaged to confuse me on things that I thought I new pretty well. I had to put it down after the first 200 pages. It has some great information in it but the way it is written and the code examples will drive you batty. I would highly recommend NOY BUYING this book. Don't even READ it if it is given to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"I'm an experienced programmer, and I was trying to use this book to refresh my memory of simple VB features. Frustrated at how terrible this book is, I decided to write this review so no one else falls into the same trap. Sure a few of the examples are nice, but they are only listed verbatim, without any explanation of the implications or reasons of what the code is doing. It tells you how to do something, but not why you are doing it. The index is also terrible, with no entries for common VB controls and programming constructs. If you absolutely have to use this book, use it for the examples, not to learn any real VB programming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Impossible to follow! Bad examples! Incomplete! Touched on a thousand different topics and didn't explain any of them well enough to be able to do them unless you already have extensive experience. The catch is.... If you already have extensive experience, you shouldn't buy this book anyway as it would be a waste of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!!","review":"This book teachers nothing about VB. It all deals with stupid Active X. Which no one cares about. It is a total waste of money. Never buy this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ted Shackley's Memoirs","review":"I knew Ted Shackley personally. Many called him cold and extremely calculating, which he was, but he also had a heart (and a sense of humor) and made time for his family. Now we can all know what he did, where, and when."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omissions, omissions, omissions","review":"Shackley could have chosen to enlighten us about what he learned as head of CIA's Miami office in the months before and after the JFK assassination. He chose not to do so. There is no mention of many issues raised in other books that he could have discussed to make a major contribution to history. He never mentions Operation 40, or operations against the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (which Oswald made famous by his association with it), or the efforts of anti-Castro operatives to blame Castro for JFK's murder (which he would have known a lot about), or his testimony to the House Assassinations Committee, or his knowledge of operatives, or alleged operatives, accused over the years of complicity in the events preceding JFK's murder. On the other hand, there is ample coverage, with many pictures, of the award ceremonies in his honor, if you are interested in that sort of thing. I wonder why this self-named \\"Spymaster\\" bothered to write this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Music","review":"This is the first Robin Spielberg album/cd/mp3 (depending on your generation) that I have purchased. It won't be the last. Each song is a wonderful composition. Unlike some other recordings of solo piano, Robin's compositions are structured with repeated themes, breaks, stanzas and refrains, openings and closings. A good lyricist could work wonders with these pieces, if Robin were so inclined. In addition, Robin is a masterful pianist, showing an impressive command of the instrument. Her melodies are singularly memorable; they stay with you long after you're done listening to the recording. I bought Dreaming of Summer because I listen to instrumental music while I'm writing, and these evocative songs fill the bill nicely. But even if you're not a writer, you'll listen to these songs over and over again. I know I will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreaming of Summer","review":"I very much enjoyed Robin Spielberg's album, Dreaming Of Summer....Whether sitting in an easy chair and listening on my stereo, or taking a solitary walk through the woods with her music on my mp3 player...it makes for a enjoyable listening experience!"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],O={key:0},x={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const R=d(B,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-d47dcb01"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/25.md","filePath":"people/25.md"}'),W={name:"people/25.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
