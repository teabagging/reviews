One of few \\"rock\\" records that put me to sleep, it's only 30 minutes long yet it feels twice that much. I don't understand the critical praise showered on this group at all.

Ugggh, this is all they have to offer after 2 years of their overhyped debut album? When I hear \\"12:51,\\" I ask \\"Is This It?\\" The song starts out with notes that sound like \\"Chopsticks\\" on the piano. And the guitar is just plain repetitive and boring. Saw these guys on the cover of Rolling Stone this month (10/03). They have absolutely no presence of true musicians. They appear to be a bunch of preppy college guys who have had fashion makeovers in attempt to make them look like music heads. Well, this music fan is not fooled!

I'm sorry but they are the most overrated band of the last couple years. It just doesn't make sense why they are as popular as they are, and as for this latest album, IT'S BORING, and sounds exactly the same as their last. The singers vocals are mixed so low and have a filter effect, do to his lack of singing ability. I have also heard the strokes live, and it really doesn't make much difference. They are unimaginative, and are not doing anything break through. Their music style has already been done,so I wish media would stopmaking it seem like they are these KINGS OF ROCK??????(According to rolling stone) Also, shame on the record companies that concentrate their efforts on this mediocrity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah","review":"So I bought \\"Room On Fire\\" the day it came out (actually the day before; those pesky independent record stores), threw it in my car CD played, and listened. It seemed fine and dandy, much like a continuation of \\"Is This It?\\" with well-written songs and Television-like guitars. I decided I'd have to listen to it a few more times before really passing judgement.But you know what?... IT'S BEEN A MONTH-AND-A-HALF AND I HAVEN'T FELT THE URGE TO LISTEN TO IT AGAIN!! So I guess that's my final judgement; it's a pretty \\"blah\\" album so to speak. I don't dislike it, I'm just really apathetic towards it.The Strokes haven't failed or put out a horrible album with \\"Room On Fire,\\" but they've defined the term \\"holding pattern.\\" If you need to feed your rock and roll mojo for 2003, I would like to direct you to Guided By Voices new disc \\"Eathquake Glue.\\" It's everything that you want the Strokes to be (that goes for GBV's live act too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strokes deliver","review":"Room on Fire is a great album if you were a fan of the first. They pretty much stick with the same formula, which is fine because it sure worked for me on Is this It. Stand out tracks include \\"What Ever Happened\\", \\"Reptilia\\", \\"12:51\\", \\"You Talk Way Too Much\\", \\"Under Control\\",The End Has No End\\" and \\"I Can't Win\\".The Strokes are the most original and interesting band in a world of awful modern rock. I Can't Wait for the Next album..Keep up the good work and thanks for the great music guys.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this the next step?","review":"The Strokes exploded onto the scene caked in hype in 2001 with 'Is This It?, and in my opinion lived up to it with fast paced, simple, rythmic, emotional rock. But here they take it not so much to a new level, but expand on their debut. The base is still the same, simple basslines and drumlines, but the lyrics and melodies have become more complex. The guitars use different filters that seem to be borrowed out of the 80s, and the best part is, it works. 'Room On Fire' is one of the best albums is the last couple of years. 'The End Has No End' is my favorite track because its probably one of the looser tracks on the album. But to gain a full appreciation of The Strokes, see them live. I saw them at The Norva on the Megadonis Tour, I was awe-struck. Julian Climbed onto the balcony during 'I Can't Win' (I think thats the right song) and nearly busted his ass a couple times. Amazing show and an amazing band"},{"rating":"2","title":"lights","review":"Ha! Finally, this cd really creates a relaxing aura about it. I recommend it to Ska/new-wave lovers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insta-Fan","review":"I wasn't attracted to the strokes at all when they released their first alblum. And still wasn't into them when they released their second alblum. Then I was coaxed into seeing them in concert; from that day on I have not blasphemed the name of the Strokes. Guys, if you are riding the fence on your likeing for this band, go see them live. Its like having a come to Jesus meeting. With that said, Room on Fire: good but not great and it stays in my CD player quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely unbiased...","review":"Are The Strokes the saviors of rock? No. Did they deserve all the acclaim their first album, Is This It, got? Probably not. Are they talented? Not particularly. Are they better than Interpol? Certainly Not. Are they any more than your average, garden variety power pop band? Hell no! Is this CD Great? You bet it is! Drawing equally from The Cars and The Doors, The Strokes have come up with a nice little formula and stuck with it: Poor production, cheesy synth work and tight song structures that get right to the point and will always entertain, no matter how \\"manufactured\\" their sound is. The production is shoddy, but it works. While the strokes are terribly overrated, they strive to live up to their praise with their sophmore release. And they come pretty damn close."},{"rating":"2","title":"RoCk N rOlL","review":"In my opinion, this is what rock n roll is. None of that rap/rock, bullcrap, just solid easy going rock n roll. The Strokes are by far one of the best bands on tv, well, one of the best bands period. They did a great follow up with this album. IF you wanna buy it, but not sure of how good any of the songs are, I strongly suggest you listen to \\"Reptilia\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, catchy album","review":"The bass player is inept? Are you joking? Sure, he takes a minimalist approach to the songs just like all of the other players in the band, but the guy is awesome. Him and Fab are incredibly tight both live and in the studio, and his parts are expertly crafted and go perfectly with the songs. Check out the bass lines on \\"Is This It?\\" and \\"New York City Cops\\" on their first cd if you still have doubt. Anyway, back to this album. All of the songs are nice and catchy and upbeat. This is what I bought the album for, and I think that's what it is intended to be - a fun, well thought out rock album. The Strokes have never claimed to be the \\"saviors of rock,\\" that's just something other people have attached to them, and I don't think they should be held accountable to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"why the strokes should win a grammy","review":"the strokes are one of the best new bands out there. surviving on word of mouth for a couple years, they are finally getting the attention and the recognition that they finally deserve. this album is my pick for the best of the year. this cd contains no filler songs, no leftovers. every song on this album is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"NYC Hype","review":"The Strokes epitomize the East Coast hype machine gone berserk. Their handlers, record company execs, the NY media, and everyone else that is desperate to see any hip dudes from the Big Apple succeed on a national scale have all done their job in trying to convince us that these guys are the modern Beatles (or at least the modern Television). Meanwhile, people who know and love rock music aren't any more fooled by it than we are by Nickelback and Creed. Is This It left me thinking just that. I thought maybe The Strokes had more in the tank and the second album would show the world what the fuss was all about. So I anxiously but cautiously approached this album only to realize for sure that the tank is empty. The Strokes come across like a like a one-trick pony. This album doesn't suck but it's not that great either. Buy the White Stripes back catalog instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the album of the year","review":"The Strokes decided that their fomular works so they copied it and took the safe way out, basically they did another \\"Is This It\\". This is what made my dislike the album from first listen. I believe that every artist who releases an album has to make progress whether it is more mature lyrics or going into another direction (eg: what radiohead did after ok computer). I couldn't help but be dissapointed by \\"room On Fire\\"BUT no matter what people like me say, we all should know now that they can and are getting away with this album. They have garnered so much respect from the rock world and reviewers that in-return they could not bring themselves to bag and tag this album as a dissapointment. The Strokes have power.

There sophomore album \\"Room on Fire\\" has been criticized as being \\"This is It Part II\\", so to speak, but I question, is that all that bad? The solos and guitar work are much improved on this album as represented in songs such as \\"Between Love and Hate\\" and \\"I Can't Win\\", and with songs such as, \\"The Way it is\\" and the first single \\"12:51\\", The Strokes prove that they are hear to stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass","review":"Jink jink ka-jink jink ka-jink.This is me expressing the rhythm of every single song on this album.oifdhaegfsadf;l,a\\\\fasoijfsThat was me getting slightly angry at seeing the strokes on the late-night music video show once again.jfasdf\\\\sdfjsdfchndsThat was me choking on my drink, laughing as I read an interview where they throw in some loose connection to the Velvet Underground, somehow giving them the 'underground cool'.That empty space was left there to represent the relevance of this band in 10 years time.G'night."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you stoopid?","review":"ahh, i mean c'mon...there's alot of great music on this web site, but not here...this cd is like day old cold pizza..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes good rock but blah boring.","review":"Does this kind of rock music get anybody excited?

Even the illustrations of charts seem hard to read and decipher using my newest charts, trying to pin point the areas the writer has described. The book is not worth buying because the information shared is not worth it either.I would have loved to have seen why and how these type of fish come into this area and what things do you look for in the contour and bottom terrain including tides, moon, water temp., current, salinity, time of year, spawning, specific bait types ie lures color sound rattles size etc ..

A great deal of the activities I do comes from this book alone. I have a full time career also, so I don't always have a lot of time to plan and this book makes it possible. Even if I don't follow an idea exactly, I receive inspiration for other activities/crafts and always find a use for any type of container, paper roll, rocks, pinecones, etc. So if you want a book that not only has great craft ideas but also ideas for groups, games, things to keep your kids entertained while they're waiting for dinner; then this is your book!

One file was cracked but functional. The real problem was that there was one file in each box that had the little plastic tab that connects them broken off. I've seen this issue in other reviews so I think it's pretty common. It's both a quality issue (tabs too flimsy) and a packaging issue (not protected during shipment). This basically means that you can't connect them to one another to be hung in a group. I wanted one long column of them, hung together down the wall. With the broken tabs, that's not possible - you have to hang them individually. I glued them together, but that is hard to do and get them to hang straight, plus now they look really ugly (glue shows through the clear plastic). When I bought these Sparco files I also bought a set by officemate. They were much better made and arrived undamaged.

Of course Serre is a leading expert in the field, but he (nobody) cannot be regarded as the inventor of the theory, so the absence of such a bibliography is not justifiable.The contents of the book are: Lie algebras, filtered groups and lie algebras, universal algebra of a Lie algebra, free Lie algebras, nilpotent and solvable Lie algebras, semisimple Lie algebras, representations of sl_n, complete fields, analytic functions, analytic manifolds, analytic groups, Lie theory.

Instead of the song, Xiao Foo brings Big Bird & Barkley home to ask her mother if she can help them find the Phoneix. This is where you have the same words both in Chinese and English and is very nice. It helps tie the dvd together and would have been nice if they included it in the video. And in the book big Bird does not come across as such a whiner...

Because there is no index, you will find it difficult to go back and find the inscrutible passages. Because there are virtually no margins (1/4 inch instead of a standard 1 inch) there is no place to write notes or even put stickums without affecting the text. The lines are closely leaded (too close together for comfortable reading) perhaps to save paper or cut costs, but regardless, a less-than-comfortable reading experience.

Bad chromatic aberration, its slow to focus, and it is tough to calibrate. Add to that it also does not allow tight portraits because of the poor minimum focal distance. Get the 135mm f/2, you can stand closer and you are already optically closer so you can get a much tighter portrait, and the IQ is top notch. This lens is not worth $1800. It pales in comparison to the Nikon 85mm 1.4. If you must have 85 for portraits buy the Nikon adapter and use the 85mm 1.4 from nikon, it is half the price so you still get off cheaper and the optical quality is top notch, one of Nikon's sharpest lenses and let's face it.

What I like best about this book is author Joyce Lafray tested these recipes in her kitchen. I've done a few of these recipes on my family (who are picky when it comes to food) while vacationing in Key West and they loved them all. I was happy cause they talked about it on the long drive back to New Jersey. I'm comfortable using this cookbook, from the tips to the descriptions of the ingredients makes cooking easy.

It is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused and rather pointless","review":"I feel for the HSPs in the world. In many respects, I am one. However, this book had a pervasive pointlessness to it. Despite the promising title, the book offers little of substance. What's worse, it thoroughly confounds two separate traits: emotional sensitivity and sensitivity to one's environment. The two are vastly different and jamming them into one trait, \\"sensitive,\\" misses much ground for exploration. I was excited to start the book the first time I started it...and I never got very far. I started it again a year or so later wondering, \\"why was it again that I never got very far in this book?\\" I figured that out rather quickly. I doubt I'll pick up this book a third time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and enlightening","review":"I bought this book a number of years ago when I began writing [The Introvert's Guide to Greater Success at Work and Home...]. Although I am not a strong HSP (highly sensitive person), I discovered that I was more physically and emotionally sensitive than I realized. Aaron indicates that 70% of highly sensitive people are also introverts. Since there is often a prejudice against introverts in western culture, I encourage the reader to find a good book that addresses strategies for introverts to go along with this book. This is an excellent read for those who often feel overly sensitive throughout the day . . . and for those who live and work with highly sensitive people."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book speaks to me as I now know I am a highly sensitive person.","review":"It was a neighbor out for a Sunday morning walk with her husband an little girl in her stroller.I was asked if I had ever heard of the book \\"The Highly Sensitive Person\\" of which I had not.

All the suspense for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Highly Sensitive Person","review":"I was disappointed in the book. It didn't tell me much more than I already knew. I was hoping for some solid coping skills or other ways to survive in a noisey, smelly, rude world. I learned that I was probably born being highly sensitive. I knew I had this trait from an early age. So? What is the solution??? Ear plugs? Padded rooms? (yes, I padded my room). It is easy to write about the problem. How about a few suggestions to de-sensitize our nervous systems (medication apparently doesn't work well for me anyway), or something besides avoidance, which is pretty much impossible without moving to a deserted area. Not practical, even if it were available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the hype","review":"As someone actually diagnosed as highly sensitive and high-strung in general, this book came as a recommendation. If only this book was actually useful. I got pretty disgusted by the author's pop-psychology and pseudo-intellectual ramblings on how sensitivity is actually over-arousal from one's environment. The use of the word \\"arousal\\" for what could have been more neutrally termed \\"awareness\\" was a pretty big tip-off that this eminent psychologist and lecturer is pretty insensitive to those around her and that this book is meant to make waves and sell copies rather than actually help the people it is marketed towards. If you are indeed someone who falls into the category of highly sensitive, or easily overwhelmed, or hyper-aware to the point of withdrawal from society, get yourself some professional help and do not buy this book.

Ms. Aron does not discuss emotional sensitivity at any length and consistently rambles on about over arousal. While I have learned to deal with lights and sounds that bother me, I have not learned to deal with emotional sensitivity and this book did not help. The first few chapters are all nearly identitical, and Ms. Aron gives specific studies of her peers to describe what happened during early childhood to shape sensitive people. I am not interested in what happened in early childhood, I am interested in now, and what to do to make my life a little less emotionally charged.

But my mother has not stopped talking about it. I think it is interesting how many people gave it such bad reviews. Perhaps they are reading the wrong book.When my mother stumbled upon this book accidentally and started to read it, she almost cried with relief. She could not believe how closely it described how she has felt for most of her life. As she read it, she felt as though it explained so many things to her about her anxieties and she felt as though a weight were being lifted from her. It gave her hope and ideas on how to deal with her sensitivity.

It might even change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading for professionals!","review":"This is a landmark book, a breakthrough book. It is truly original and much-needed. Only once before have I heard myself so accurately described, or felt so validated. And that was the Myers-briggs test. Many professionals who want to categorize us and label us neurotic and shy should read this book and Dr. Aron's revolutionary research. And of course, if you're an HSP, you will benefit immensely. All of a sudden, everything makes sense, and you don't feel so alone in the world. You also recognize your gifts, and see the critics of the world in their true, rather limited garb.

The fact that we can all then appreciate these differences in a positive light can be transformative for all.

After just a few chapters I was able to find the courage and the freedom to redefine who I am, what I want to accomplish in my life, and how I want to accomplish it. I guess I always knew that I was different from others - more affected by things that seemed banal to others, but saw it as a character flaw rather than just accepting it as me. The only slightly negative comment I'd have is that the writing style is somewhat dry. But this is more than made up for by the content. My blessings and thanks to Elaine Aron.

I did not agree with all of her analyses of love/romance for highly sensitve people. I think she was a bit too negative and missed out on some of the higher-level love/soulmate stuff that HSP can experience. But this book is one I will be recommending to many people.

King of Fools was the album that all who hear love, live it's out of this world. People have moaned at Mezzamorphis for not being as worship focused as previous material. So? Sure you can't lift losts of the songs and take them into a church service, but that's not the point. If the singles off the album had the air play, and publicity they deserve, intead of being shunned because Delirious are unashamedly Christians, the album would be huge. Buy, listen again and again (it's worth it), then see them live and you'll know the reason why the guys put out Mezzamorphis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety","review":"I've been a Deliriou5? fan for a long time and i've come across about all of their music. And I can just come up with one word for this band. VARIETY. This band isn't just any joe shmoe band that comes up with just the same music all the time in their albums. IT'S ALL DIFFERENT. That's what I absolutly love about this album. IN FACT one of my favorite d: songs is actually on this album and the song is titled \\"Blindfold\\". This song basically talks about our confusion in life and in our walk with God. But at anyrate, If you are one into variety in bands and you want something different everytime, THIS is the band to go with. This album has both depth and pure worship in it and I would HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone that would want to get into Deliriou5? for the first time.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best music ever","review":"This is the best cd I have listened to in my whole life - its awsome!

I would give it 100 stars if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"have they lost heart?","review":"With the release of their new album Delirious have confirmed their position as one of the most uplifting and thought-provoking Christian bands in the world. Their lyrics remain challenging, their message is uncompromising and they have reached a new level of musical skill. However, this new 'development' towards a somewhat over-produced sound seems to have precipitated a loss of depth and emotion within the music. Live, they are as magnificent as ever, but on disc they seem to have lost their initial conviction that the rough and raw style of virtually live recordings ultimately makes for a far more sincere and profound album. Long-term fans of Delirious will be disappointed by the light-weight, commercial feel of this new release. Whilst it is still a worthwhile purchase it simply does not have the buzz of 'in the can' or 'King of Fools'. Let's hope that Delirious can return to their roots and become 'history makers' with the next recording - they deserve it and so does God..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy and noisy -- Good Christian Rock","review":"One thing is certain about the men of Delirou5?: They love Jesus Christ. I believe that this current release in comparison to the previous discs of this band prove that worship doesn't have to be schmaltzy -- it can be soulful, honest, grungy and pretty funky.Mezz has a strong U2 Zooropa feel to it. The vocals have similar passion to Bono's and there is a familiar melodic ring to the vocals.Be prepared for a different sound if you liked their previous stuff. It's a bit different. Kind of like going from Joshue Tree to Rattle and Hum to Achtung Baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian music done right.","review":"Too often Christian music is done wrong. Horribly wrong. Either it's seen as a way to get started in the music industry(\\"just write a song a slap 'Jesus' on the end\\") or it's used as an excuse for mediocrity.Delirious thankfully erased this notion of mine O so many years ago. While they had written some very good worship music with Cutting Edge, no one could have seen Mezzamorphis coming. The melodies are wonderfully put together; and the lyrics have a surprising habit of touching me, even after all these years.

There are catchers that are fun to listen to and have catchy rhythms and melodies (but unfortunately they usually get old). There are bloomers, that first I ignore and then they grow on me. Then there are duds. Mezzamorphis has plenty of the \\"catchers\\" to get you hooked, but I was surprised that THEY DIDN'T GET OLD! The more I listened the more ALL of these songs grew on me!

This is in line with the research interests of the authors of course ( at least that is what I concluded by viewing the reference lists at the end of the chapters - the authors have published extensively in this field).

It really irritated me, because up until that point, I liked the book! It ruined the end, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange style","review":"The story isn't bad, but the reader makes the whole thing unrealistic.

Alex Delaware is a thirty-something, retired, child psychologist. When his cop friend asks him to help on a murder case, the good doctor suddenly becomes a sleuth asking questions with no apparent purpose. His questioning leads him from one seemingly unrelated death to another. All of a sudden, our novice detective is racing for his life from a motorcycle assassin, wrestling with a powerful athlete, and brandishing a gun while talking like Bogart. The conspiracy plot just isn't believable either--a group of pedophiles running a children's home? And they all happened to be college buddies? Come on. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five reasons why I disliked the book...","review":"1. I felt as if I were being talked down to--and looked down upon--by the author throughout the entire story. 2. There were continual references to the hero's intellectual and professional \\"brillance\\"; and since our hero is a psychologist just like Kellerman himself is in real life, I kept getting the icky feeling that I was witness to some sort of vicarious ego trip for the author. 3. Often the dialogue comes off as a lecture or lesson. 4. The main character showed little regard for the feelings and situations of the other characters. 5. The story culminates with a kind of improbable perfect-timing luck that makes me question the author's creative effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to our liking","review":"It took me forever to get through this book.

Well done.","review":"This was the first book I read by Kellerman, and I still feel it's his best. The author spins a well-woven drama, with important characters and a steady build. It was at times difficult, but really more sad, only because of what happens to a child. The tale is gripping. It got me hooked on Alex Delaware novels. I've read most of them since reading \\"When The Bough Breaks\\". If you haven't read any of Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels, and read but one, make it this one. Then you'll find you've made a liar out of yourself. It'll hook you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I thought that this book was one of the best that I have ever read. The author does a great job of making the beginning interesting, and it drew me in right away. He develops the characters well, you really get to know them. You can tell that the author has a lot of knowledge about the medical field, specifically child psychology. This isn't your normal murder mystery, there is so much more to it. While reading, there are clues that lead you closer and closer to the answers, and it's like a big puzzle that comes together at the end. It's a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken","review":"I've read more recent books of Kellerman's characters, Delaware and Sturgis and was delighted to find the book that started it all.

He's actually an excellent singer as well and since leaving Free in 1972 (where his vocal talents were obscured by the prowess of the mighty Paul Rodgers) has infrequently released some classic soulful rock music in the 1970's and early 80's. I really wanted to love this CD but I can't. Musically 'Naked' has a Sting vibe to it and Andy's voice sounds great. Unfortunately, this release is quite ponderous and bland. He's obviously comfortable and proud of his lifestyle but one would expect some real energy to emerge. Instead every song sounds similar and, considering its his first album since 1984, you'd think he'd come out fighting. I hope he has more music in his future and we won't have to wait so long for the next one. But I also hope Andy brings a little more energy to the party next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???..\\"Stripped Down\\" is more like it!","review":"I am a long time Free fan as well as a fan of Andy's earlier solo releases....NONE OF THAT HERE!!

The venom trees having adopted a defense of spraying acid at dangers, including people.An easy enough task except for the intervention of people, from a land developer who simply wants to cut the forest down for lumber to a quasi-preistess come to reside among a back-to nature cult in the same area. The local dinosauroid natives simply add flavor to the typical mix up of different people striving for different goals, none of which match.Too bad so few books were written in the setting.

However, if you don't find the book compelling, you can flip to the end of it and order \\"The Time Travel Handbook,\\" \\"Atlantis: Mother of Empires\\" or \\"Lost Continents & The Hollow Earth.\\" I'm betting those books are better reads than \\"The Christ Conspiracy.\\" If you hope (and that's all you can do - hope) to calm your fears about Yahweh, you'll have to dig do better than \\"The Christ Conspiracy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"For total lunatics","review":"Many great historians have studied Roman history and church history, and they would all laugh at this book which only a mental retard would believe.Do you believe that men from Mars actually created life on Earth? Then you will probably believe in the worthless contents of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"scholarly work from unscholarly sources","review":"For me as a former chirstian this book makes me worry about were did the author get her information from. A bunch of the information that the author gives is proven to be wrong and she is basically just someone who is anti-christian. In the first couple of pages she states her personally opinion. I really don't think the author knows much about the Chirstian Bible since she states some facts that are wrong. Like when she said the Son of God is really the Sun of God, and she realted Jesus story with Horus and many others. Those facts are false it came from an 18th century German writer. I personally like facts and make up my own mind from the facts. This book is unscholarly work plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look in the Primary Text; Half Her Claims Are Bogus","review":"As shocking as this sounds, half of the parallels that Acharya S lists literally do not exist when we examine the primary texts. Of those that remain, they all appear in post-New Testament manuscripts (i.e. the Avesta, which wasn't written until the 4th century A.D.) I don't mind books that are critical of the Christian world-view, but this book is outrageously dishonest and consists of very poor scholarship. If Jesus was alive today, he could sue for libel. Please consult www.tektonics.org/copycast for more information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an easy read","review":"This book is very \\"texty.\\" I figured it would contain facts and figures and would be informational, but it actually contains very little of that. The author spends more time citing other authors and publications. She seems to sway the reader to a conclusion rather than offer meaty food for thought. I was hoping to get a different persepctive, but after reading this book, I've decided that it doesn't matter whether Jesus was real. It's still a great story and he still gives us good example of how to live in relationship to one another. Peace out ~m"},{"rating":"2","title":"a strong and thorough read","review":"Don't be fooled by the critics or the light-hearted new age cover.This is a raucous, yet refined, analysis that is meticulously researched and thoroughly reported. The author pulls from many different sources and weaves an intriguing, if not blistering, synopsis of the gospels.There are over four hundred pages of illuminating ideas served up in a slightly (no, majorly) caustic and bitter manner. What makes this approach so tolerable is her incisive analyses and comparative understanding of the most relevant issues.The sleeve claims this author is experienced in several different fields.

The author bases their \\"theories\\" not on fact, but on wild assumptions and vague accusations. These same ideas were repeated in the internet movie \\"Zeitgeist\\" and are woefully uninformed. She makes claims that are unprovable and then asserts that there is some sort of conspiracy theory in which scholars and historians have re-wrote history. This same idea has been repeated by Brian Flemming, Bill Maher, and a host of other militant atheists in an attempt to mislead people.I love challenges, but this was just full of deceit in an attempt to prove the authors assumptions. So, she assumes something, then uses conjecture and assumptions to prove her own assumptions. This is far from scholarly, but weak minded people unable to do research get caught up in this garbage. I have little patience for blatant liars in my field of study, and Archaya S. is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parental Guidance Suggested","review":"I've read about 25% of this book and the more I read, the harder it gets to put down.

The author has merely repeated the research of other authors, who have said it better and said it first. Perhaps some original research on her part would have improved the book. As it stands, it is every bit as exciting as summer re-runs of tired soap operas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"The author doesnt know jack about what she is writing. Saying something wild does not make it true, no matter how much you want to believe it - you must give some basis for saying something. I know for a fact that all the stuff she wrote about Krishna is unsubstantiated - there are no references from any Indian source to substantiate what she writes about Krishna. It seems quite cooked up and even though its a conspiracy book - it is really lame in research quality - at least definitely on the indian sources front. That makes me suspect her other writing, too - that it may be full of improper research (BS, in other words).There are many books on similar subjects in the market with at least some authenticity. But this book seems a totally cooked up thing.Well, this author is definitely off my list henceforth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christ: Another Sun God?","review":"The author, Acharya S. Guides the reader confidently, skillfully and unemotionally along the multitude of paths that led to the religion we know as Christianity. She makes the connection between the emerging Christ and many of the other gods: Buddha, Krishna, Osiris, etc., and the connection between them and astrological phenomena.Regardless of ones beliefs, the verity of these connections with the Zodiac cannot be denied even if they fail to shake ones faith.This book is well written and deserves attention by believer and non-believer alike.A read well worth the cost of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair but flawed","review":"A fair book with many interesting ideas but takes too many leaps of faith/logic? in coming to concusions based on data.

Further reading would beThe Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion (Abridged Edition from Ancient Wisdom Publication). Kipling's saying would be appropriate for this book.\\"there is nothing new under the sun\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning scholarship!","review":"While Christianity has disaffected many of its adherents and freethinkers have long looked askance at the various cons pulled off in the name of Jesus, few scholars examine so thoroughly the religion's true historical roots in conspiracy and parapolitical manipulation. The Christ Conspiracy is a feast of scholarship (400+ pages; fully illustrated), not only debunking the notion of a historical Jesus but establishing clearly the roots of that mythology in the solar precession. In pursuing this avenue of research, Acharya S has attained a panoramic view of world religious history especially useful to students of conspiracy, but also one accessible to mainstream readers. She is a veritable Joseph Campbell of dissent over commonly held assumptions about Christianity. Believers will find a new and quite formidable challenge to their faith and others will be blown away by the depth and breadth of scholarship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gottes tod","review":"This book is totally amazing, i only wish i had read this book as a child prior to seeing The Exocist on Tv, i would not have been so afraid of evil lurking behind every corner, this book dispels all the demons, the myths and all the lies that have been propagated for 2k yrs.

I would prefer to read some the books she quotes (at least she has a bibliography in the back as a resource) and draw my own conclusions, many of which will probably agree with hers.But at least I wouldn't be overwhelmed by bits and pieces I consider uninteresting and uninspiring, such as astrology (as one form of mythology) and a global civilization for which there is no record. I consider the lost continent of Atlantis about as factual as the historicity of Jesus as the christ or as factual as the practice of astrology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science?","review":"The Christ Conspiracy: by Acharya S, much like her website, is geared more for sales than science. Instead of her book I suggest: Why People Believe Weird Things, by Michael Shermer. It looks at psychic phenomena, religious belief, and other aspects of the supernatural. It also guides one in how to use critical thinking and to look at something scientifically without bias. And unlike Acharya's book, it reflects the standard of the industry reference citing."},{"rating":"1","title":"RECYCLED EARLIER MATERIAL","review":"THIS BOOK IS NOT A NEW \\"REVELATION\\" AS MOST OF THE REVIEWERS THINK.

However, if you're pursuing this subject, I strongly recommend you don't waste your time on this ridiculous book. It's filled with irrelevant information, quotes from New Age gurus and feminist icons, and the author apparently expects us to believe that Jesus Christ is mythical for no better reason than the fact that Margaret Sanger (the founder of the infanticide group Planned Parenthood, who was also an admirer of Adolf Hitler!) found Christianity \\"oppressive.\\"Fortunately, there have been a number of scholarly books expounding upon the mythicist position that are both well research and well written.

Platonov is among the best short stories writers almost as great as Chekhov. This is my bias that he was even better than James Joyce and Guy Maupassant because he never use too cynical, satirical or poignant attitude to his subject (even to the ugliest side of the human nature). He accept the \\"most\\" good and the \\"most\\" bad one too. Unlike Chekhov, he showed us the straightness and rustlessness of the Russians, his nation-people and the influence of Soviet Union on Russian culture.

It's not. Unlike Williams, Kelly Willis is pure country - the warbly voice, pedal steel, etc. I hate it ! On top of that her song writing is no where near the class of Williams. There's not one song that draws you in. Summary: very disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This album is professionally recorded, and Willis has a potentially interesting voice, but the arrangements are staggeringly unimaginative. Every song (every song!) plods along at an ennui-inducing mid-tempo. Willis's original material is not especially imaginative (and that description greatly overvalues the grating title tune), but what really nails this album's failures are her covers. Among these, she has recorded songs written by Nick Drake and Replacements-era Paul Westerberg. At that point in his career, Westerberg was writing hooks to die for, yet Willis's rendering of \\"They're Blind\\" is utterly indistinguishable from everything else on the album. And when everything else is as undistinguished and bland and passionless as it is here, it's time to look for a new producer."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than worth the price","review":"Kelly Willis has a fantastic voice and creative stylings, but with this latest CD, she was set free to do things her way. As a result, she SHINES! This is the finest CD I currently own. I don't understand why I can't hear her on mainstream radio stations. Listeners need and deserve a chance to hear her.

Standouts are \\"Wrapped\\", written by husband Bruce Robison, \\"Fading Fast,\\" which appeared on a regional EP a few years ago, and the title track.

I had only heard a few songs from her ep \\"Fading Fast\\" on the internet and at Lilith Fair, but I did like them. And that's what most of this album sounds like. And the more I listen to this cd, the more I have come to appreciate Willis' huge voice, which will never get the radio play it deserves. I beg every fan of real country music to go out and buy this cd, if only to show the evil popsters at country radio that some of us do appreciate that kind of stuff.

Especially with a tight horn section. And it is hard to find big bands that have trumpet players talented enough to play the ultrasonic high notes. Probably the king of those notes was the late Maynard Ferguson, God rest his soul. He had players like himself that could pull it off flawlessly. So, too, this album has the rareified air of talent that can pull of those incredibly high trumpet notes with a full orchestra playing at the same time. Priceless. Every song on this album is the kind of music I can listen to over and over again. There are two songs with Sammy Davis, Jr. singing, and although I was not a fan of his prior to buying this album, his singing here is excellent, and I likely will start to shop for some of his music as well.

It is very plain that the the doctorine on sex that we are taught today is not from the bible but rather from Roman Greco Platonic philosophy that infiltrated the church in the 2nd century. It pains me that the Poisoning of eros is out of print. (Though you can get one easily here or other used book sites) The Poisoning of Eros enlightens us on what is biblical and what is cultural and anti scripturual dualist philosophy. I would also recomend Dirt Greed and Sex by Wilianm Countryman Dirt, and Divine Sex: Liberating sex from religious tradition by Philo Thelos.

His writing style is not overbearing or arrogant in his views, and he presents his case transparently and methodically.I didn't give it the fifth star simply because it's not exactly a page-turner either. It's written for the (very) interested layperson, but not for anyone seeking sensationalism or \\"pulp non-fiction.\\" Perhaps that is its greatest strength.Considering today's one-size-fits-all model of how relationships and sexuality are \\"supposed\\" to happen (all other options bearing the default label of \\"evil\\" -- or at least \\"suspect\\") based on an allegedly Christian tradition, it might surprise you to know that all is not as it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Statuatory Rape As Romance?","review":"What a shock my wife and I had when we discovered that my 11 year old daughter had checked this book out from her middle school library.

So, I started buying their records too. Sometimes they play with David Lantz, a third sound which if played with Tingstad and Rumbel is like another dimension. A great thing about most of Narada's music is that it doesn't disturb you if you are studying or writing like a lot of classical music, it inspires you to work better, at least that is my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best latin group in america---- better than kabah!","review":"okay i just have to say that this cd rox! it is great for dancing or just driving in your car just blasting it out loud. one of my favorites has to be caleidoscopico or busqueda. what ever your favorites is you are bound to fall in love with this group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy bueno!","review":"Este fue el ultimo disco con el nombre Onda Vaselina aqui perdieron a uno de ssu integrantes, y mas adelnate fue reemplazado por Kalimba, este cd suena muy jose ramon flores, felisatti, en esta epoca a sus proyectos le inyectaban esos ritmos muy eurodance, y canciones acousticas, casi rockeras, algunas. muy parecido al trabajo que habian hecho estos productores con \\"el color de los sue?os\\" de fey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Song","review":"This is one of Julio best albums.

It would seem to be the author's own view also,as anyone who has read Darconville's Cat will testify; nobody is spared the cruel, seemingly pathological tirades of this writer, with the exception, maybe, of vacant young women who sow beanbags and don't grumble. But, I love the style Theroux brings to his work - the wit and the lucidity - so I can forgive him his harshness, most of the time. An Adultery is a brilliantly involving novel, with so many observations and memorable lines that I can't begin to summarise it properly.But,if you come across this book, you should definitely read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece from the other Theroux","review":"A wonderfully excoriating novel from one of America's greatest authors. Ever. Though not as rich and encyclopedic as the better and better known Darconville's Cat, it is honed and tightly written, and at home among the several great American novels written in the last 30 years. Written in three parts, Adultery is constructed like a logical syllogism. This is the framework of its humor: the attempt of an overly intellectual and emotionally hermetic character to work out of the randomness of passion and persona an ornately mad logic. When he is happy (alone), he can paint (how he tells us so!) and he can deride (particularly when his talents are affronted with indifference). But what he cannot do is function in a properly human manner.As to be expected, the quality of the language and the vituperation in which it is often adorned is for its own sake worth the effort (and yes, effort is required) and worthy of the cited Frederick Rolfe.Who? \\"Do you read?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy going - great writing","review":"Be prepared, this is not easy reading. Theroux's writing style is packed full of convoluted and fantastically created sentences that require close attention and rereading. That being said, Theroux is a truly literary writer who dwells in the realm of introspection. His main character, tortured by love and full of misgiving, is led on a not-so merry chase by one of the most devious and conflicted females of literature. A truly remarkable depiction of a pathological love affair gone horribly awry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferable characters","review":"The only thing that prevented me from giving this book 1star was that there were some good observsations - otherwise the characters are annoying, the writing is pretentious and the general effect is both creepy and pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you.","review":"After getting over the annoyance of Theroux's \\"hoytie-toytie\\" way of writing, and the largely unrealistic dialogue, this book truly grows on you. You find that you have to force yourself to read the first 1/3 of the book, but after that, you then look forward to what's next.

The demeanor style that permeates the book is a mirror image of the manner and philosophy this individual personifies and exhibits in his TV diatribes. Just as he fails to allow a guest to answer a question before he interrupts and answers for him, so too his writing style fails to allow the reader to question his pomposity and know-it-all divel.

The underlying commentary about our world situation is fascinating and I really enjoyed reading the opinions of this intelligent author. However, my enjoyment of the book was compromised by the constant typos. This book was obviously not proofread but relied on spell check.

Colliding Forces has everything, Light vs. darkness, good vs. evil, also things we are subjected to every single day out here in the real world - new media that deliberatly sets out to frighten us! As a big bonus this book really has a message for everyone! Not to mention romance, shapeshifting and FUN. I gave this 5 stars, it deserves many more much more.

Remington (Timothy Muskatell) is the main character in the film and he is good as a crazed grifter hell bent on doing what ever he feels like at any cost.

I spoke to them about the dog, but there is little they can do about it themselves. The problem with the bark-stop is that it will not go off when the dog barks! It is only ~20 feet away and the dog barks very loud (big dog), but the thing only goes off when I move or bump it. I tried all settings etc and no luck. I don't recommend you buy this device and would hope there is something more effective on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"This did not work at all!!!!!!!!!!

The next-door neighbors got two puppies for Christmas, but now they are of barking age and tend to bark in the mornings. I bought this product thinking it would be my cure-all. Unfortunately, a fence and some trees are difficult for this product to penetrate. It needs a clear line-of-sight in the ultra-sonic mode so it is very difficult to use for my purpose without very clever placement. More importantly:This product is outdated. A much better product is the 'Super Bark Stop.' It's by the same company, however it has more control such as a Volume Setting, # of barks Setting, and is battery powered allowing more placement options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but not for long!","review":"In principle, this should be a great product. We got one and set it up in a few seconds. Our dogs responded to it very well, and stopped most of their barking. (In spite of some false triggers when it was not screened from the wind.) Then after less than 10 days of use, it went dead. The vendor responded politely and quickly with a free replacement unit. That one worked great...for 5 days. Then it went catatonic, with a click every second or getting stuck in permanently ON mode. The vendor responded politely and quickly with a refund.That's 2 out of 2 units defective, which tells me there is a major defect in either the design or the quality control at the manufacturer. Instead of wasting your time, maybe you should look for a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viatek Professional Bark Stop Dog Bark Doesn't Stop Dogs From Barking.","review":"\\"Viatek Professional Bark Stop Dog Bark\\" doesn't work.

Installed the bark stop transmitter and no matter what setting we put it on, it went completely unnoticed by this golden retriever. We tested it first with the audio signal and it did sound each time the dog barked, but in ultrasonic mode, the dog wasn't deterred at all. It says on the box it doesn't work under certain barking conditions (like protection barking), it's mainly for nuisance barkers. We've had it up for 2 weeks. NO CHANGE at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and not made for outdoors","review":"We bought 3 different bark deterrent devices. This one is by far the worst. The design is very poor and can not withstand any outdoor use.Mine broke apart at the plug after only one use. I have never had a power box break while unplugging it from the wall. The plastic was brittle and thin.As far as the usefulness of this product, it would constantly get set off even when turning it on or off.

Well, the bad reviews are dead on. The item came to us and already had something broken floating around inside but still worked so we tried it. The \\"ultrasonic\\" setting appeared to stay on all the time regardless if the dog was barking or not and the regular setting would shut the machine down completely if the dog barked for more than 5 minutes. I am returning this product and would not recommend anyone to purchase this for training their dog from not barking. Citronella collars work WAY better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY","review":"Great Idea, liked that it ran off of DC current, Loved that it had an extra cord to move the device around. But It has to function to be effective. Lights and everything works, but even a basset hound barking loudly in the same room did not cause it to go off. Should have trusted the reviews I read and not wasted my time. Have to tap the mic area to set it off, so I know it can function, just think that the size of the dog needed to set this off would be on the scale of livestock."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK","review":"This product does not work at all! It didn't even almost stop the barking or lessen the barking. And no matter what setting you put it in, the \\"inaudible\\" noise was very audible. Also, it takes 4 'D' batteries which will be very expensive when it is continually running because the dog won't stop barking!!! We are returning and looking for another solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work as expected","review":"This device seems nice and well build, at first begin it worked fine, not as a 100% bark stopper in terms of full eficiency, but overall it worked, a few weeks later it seems to be in good working operation but does not stop dogs barks, so I just give 2 stars. Cheap devices are expected to give low satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't work on all dogs, but it works on my Great Pyrs","review":"As with any product, it will work on some dogs but not on others, as some dogs have more acute hearing or training issues. My Great Pyrenees is the usual guard dog and got to the point that she was barking at children, which I don't like as she loves children. I bought this and every time she barked more than 3 times would go out and turn on the Viatek Bark Stop. It works 95% of the time. Again, not all products work on all types of dogs, but if you have a problem with nuisance barking it is worth a shot.

Our dogs are completely unaffected by the \\"ultrasonic sound\\". We tried all settings, low, high and even audible.

I feel really bad for the dog, but hey, I gotta get sleep once in a while too. I had high hopes for this device after reading many of the online reviews but am sad to say it failed miserably. Perhaps because the dog is so old, it may have lost some of its hearing. I don't know. Either way, it didn't work for me. Setting the tone to the lower (audible) version did nothing more than frighten my cat and irritate me everytime the dog barked.

Echobrain knows how to rock, but they also just plain know music.Within the twelve tracks in Glean, their sound meanders between that of Pink Floyd, the Kinks, and even Radiohead. But even as I made mental comparisons to these bands while listening, I never got the sense they (Echobrain) were ripping anyone off, as they always manage to maintain their own edge.Seems to me there's a crap load of bands getting a lot more attention than Echobrain ever did that aren't half as good.Do yourself a favor and check this CD out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfortunately overlooked","review":"I never would have said that Echobrain's first album was particularly heavy until listening to Glean. Newsted's absence from the creative process is apparent. On the other hand, it allows for some spectactular dynamics and songs that hide heaviness behind beautiful sounds. \\"You're Sold\\" and \\"Heroic Dose\\" are a microcosm of this album--heavier sections and big guitars combining with soft, warbling vocals and a swirling sound, constantly backed by outstanding drumming.Not like much music out there in that Echobrain still refuses to be pigeonholed. That's not even criticizing other bands, but rather an admiration of their versatility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glean - Echobrain","review":"Fantastic album, ubelievable melodies along with mind blowing vocals. Still as unique and unlike anything I've ever heard. The first album blew me away, almost every song on that album has become embedded in my mind and after one listen to Glean my brain is on overload. IF you haven't purchased this cd, I believe it to be a wise addition to any rock lovers collection. I give mucho props to Donkin and the rest of the crew for hanging in there after the departure of Newsted, but that's his loss because Voivod sucks. Sad decision on his part just like leaving Metallica. Echobrain and Glean will move you in such a way that you'll never be the same after listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album, but, where's the vocals","review":"i got this album and went straight to the CD player, popped it in and enjoyed the best album i've heard in a long time. Imagine Jar of Flies(Alice in Chains) and Superunknown(Soundgarden)mixed together with a dash of Bob Dylan folkiness. The musicianship is incredible, make no mistakes, these guys can play. The only problem I have with the album is that you really can't hear the vocals that well, almost like they forgot to add them in until the last minute and ran out of available volume. They're almost muddled in spots, not as clear as they were on their self-titled debut, but with much stronger musical chops. I hope this band does well, so that Newsted kicks himself for jumping ship to join up with Voivod(what a joke, worse excuse for a band, like a poor mans dream theatre or something--they wicked suck)Anyway, great record, super musicians, if you enjoyed the first, you'll have to enjoy the second."},{"rating":"2","title":"A study of six saints for adolescents","review":"This book was written in 1953 as a response to the questions that adolescents were asking the author when she spoke about the saints.

Eventually, I passed them off on our 2 year old and gave my older daughters (5 and 7) a nicer set of Crayola's recommended on a kid's art blog. I can't believe the contrast. And the funniest part is that my 2 year old is not fooled in the least. When we all sit down to paint and I give her the M&D set, she refuses to use it and instead walks around the table to \\"steal\\" the paint from her sisters.

Thus without guessing orientation, it is easy just that there are so many photos that look alike or are alike. Sorting for the borders and then the colours helped. The cartoons were the first to be completed as that was the easiest. In all 3 puzzles, the cartoon strips were completed first. This is easier as the picture is smaller with two strips of cartoon.

While I have never taken physics before, I do maintain a 4.0 GPA, and what little I have been able to derive from Lerner's text was hard fought on my part. Lerner does not address his audience effectively. He often explains theory as his only example of a concept, he does not provide nearly enough sample problems of the very basic nature, and the end-of-the-chapter problems are occationally so badly worded you cannot really tell what he intends his reader to solve.

In other words its a freakinbargain! They didn't have to put any extras in at all, butthey did, and they kept adding and adding! These days when somany people who put out dvd sets over charge and give youvirtually no extras, its nice to see that there are somepeople who care about thier shows and thier fans enough to dosomething special like this.

A couple years ago, they decided to release a few movies straight to DVD. As of now, 2 have been released and a third is set to come out soon.There are plans to break these movies up into 'episodes,' and air them as Season 5. They will most likely go to Comedy Central, and there is talk that extra material will be added in order to make it seem more like a TV show than watching a quarter of a movie.However, I wouldn't count on seeing the re-release as episodes (especially if they add new material) anytime soon, as not all of the movies are even released yet. So, all in all, this represents all of Futurama except for the movies - so just buy this and add the movies to your collection as they are released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too pricey for a full set with no worthy bonus features...","review":"This is an outstanding series, but at an incomprehensible price.

This series is not a rarity (in fact, I've got a good third of it on my DVR). Amazon was selling each volume for $18 a while back, which I'm assuming was to celebrate the release of Beast with a Billion Backs. That's about what each volume is worth. I wouldn't pay more than $24 for it. Trust me...it'll be around for a long, long time.I'd say not to purchase this now.

As a hard drinking recently demoted shock jock now working for a tiny talk radio station in Pontypool, Ontario, some callers start sounding a mite odd. Then their \\"chopper\\" goes down. It can and does only get worse from there. Really gets the claustrophobia going and a nice original idea. The movie is a low budget one room play. The BD also has a good commentary track with the writer, producer and director all sitting around talking about both this film and their aspirations for two more, which I don't think is gonna happen. There's also a 58 min radio play on the disc. But no subtitles. There are a few scenes where I'd like to know what was said but the off camera words are too muddled for any sound system to pick up. Too bad. It's the only negative thing I could say about this disc.

If you have any taste and enjoy good thrillers, stay away from this movie. It will only suck up your time and leave you with the sensation that some brain cells have gone missing. If irritation were entertainment then this would meet the criteria. But it only stirs up interest and misleads you into thinking it will lead somewhere. This is a thriller for people who don't really appreciate the idea of an actual plot with their thrillers. At 96 minutes, it plays like twice the running time. If you love french, find the thriller genre too anxiety provoking for your delicate truffle-loving soul, and wish we could all just sing songs of hope in the middle of tension, in lieu of actually... umm... resolving the damned plot, then this is the movie for you!

It was clearly originally a radio broadcast but even without that, the story itself is awful. It piggy-backs on one of the oldest conundrums we have ALL inevitably found ourselves in (perhaps as a seven year-old??): saying a word over and over to the point of it losing all sense of meaning. That is a VERY loose basis for this movie admittedly but where the story goes from there is just as pointless and painful.This film actually served as the equivalent of the spoken virus it circles around trying to explain.

It pretends to be a zombie movie but has the dumbest take on zombies ever put to film. If you want to go out on a limb and call these \\"mind-infected\\" or \\"brain-tampered\\" zombies, you would be doing this crapper a huge favor. Not scary or intense at all. Poorly acted, shoddy makeup, ridiculous premise & execution...I could go on and on. The only good thing I could say about this was that it was sooooo bad, it actually provided plenty of material to rip on for hours after watching it.

Billed as a horror movie, there's no real horror - none whatsoever - until sometime before the movie just succumbs to its own runtime and bows out. And the scares aren't big payoffs either. Like in \\"Megan Is Missing,\\" we got a lot of yackity yack, but when the last 20 minutes of the film DID show up, they made a serious impression not to be forgotten, ever. Pontypool does NOT do that.Pontypool puts you in a radio station forever talking about the devastation going on outside until said devastation finally gets INSIDE and makes things moderately interesting. For over an hour, it's not really even a movie. It's radio with some video laid on top of it.

They also take many of the mil spec brushes I have. I have had a problem breaking rods with new brushes on them while trying to clean dirty barrels, and this one has enough tensile strength that it holds up.

Talbot mixes traditional songs with newer contemporary material which gives her work a sort of June Tabor-ish flavor. Most of the new songs were written by the album's producer, John Doyle, who also provides nimble, supportive guitar work. Talbot has a really lovely voice, with a bright, clear quality similar to Brit-Celt divas Bill Jones, Niamh Parsons and Kate Rusby, and even coasts into some contemplative, confessional material that may bring Norah Jones or Beth Orton to mind. This album is ideal for anyone looking for warm, well-crafted Celtic music that is richly based in the style's roots, yet embraces modern singer-songwriter folk without mucking things up. Nice album -- highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, soothing album","review":"I picked up this album because it was on sale, and the blurb on the back sounded interesting.

I found some of the topics much more interesting than others, but there is a good amount of variety amongst the thinkers in this film.If you are looking for fancy animations or backgrounds you won't find them in this set. The person simply sits in front of a blue background and speaks on their field. I'm not quite sure if it's entirely worth the $40, that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It's incredibly interesting, but I think it should be more like $25 or $30.If you have watched What the bleep or have read any other books on meditation, spirituality or the brain, this DVD set will provide a more in-depth look giving many different viewpoints & opinions.

I think it was simply the oddest book to fall in love with an author through, but she is such a rare talent that I immediately wanted to read EVERYTHING she had ever written. I'm still on that journey, but loving every minute of it and excited to read the children's series now.

I enjoyed Bob Holly vs. Al Snow, mainly for the fantastic table bump near the end. The boiler room brawl was simply amazing. I've never been a fan of Paul Wight, due to his horrible workrate and overall ackwardness, but he took a fair share of the bumps. Mick Foley, as usual, took some sick bumps (the chokeslam off a ladder through two tables and glass comes to mind). The main event was also an excellent match, enjoyable to say the least. Now, most of the rest of the card was simply horrible. Ken Shamrock vs. Undertaker was basically just one long resthold, and the same could be said for HHH vs. X-Pac. But what are fast-forward buttons for? If you're the type of person that wants a video great from beginning to end, avoid this one, but if you're looking for a tape with a few classic matches, and a great number of average at best matches, go for \\"Backlash\\".

It might work for other people, but I did not like the results that I got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for quick touch up","review":"I received the product promptly. I use it when my hair is wet or I wet the stick if my hair is dry. My sister has used this product for years and recommended it to me. It is a good product to use on the crown of your head when you need a quick touch up and don't have time to do a full root color. My colored hair is medium brown so I bought dark brown. My natural color is white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colors somewhat but contains a stench","review":"A completely unnecessary and strong stench: perfume I guess is what some people call it. I have seen estimates that as many as a quarter of the population is sensitive to these scents; some know it and some don't realize what is causing their sneezing, coughing, choking, watering eyes, headaches, feelings of malaise, difficulty breathing (!) etc. So why put scent in a product that is supposed to color hair? I didn't see it listed as an ingredient on the package; otherwise I would not have spent my money on it. Only when I used it and had to ride in a closed vehicle with someone else who is very sensitive to this allergen, did I realize the strong unwelcome addition to something that was supposed to cover the gray, not somehow change my odor.I THINK it does work to color the wisps of white hair I'm getting. But of course now I can't use it again. I suggest looking elsewhere for a product that won't make people sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cover-up","review":"I know others have poo-pooed this product because you have to use water for it's application. I purchased this product along with some of it's rivals. Hands down this product was better...for the following reasons:1) It was less messy to apply because only the part of the stick that is wet will apply color to your hair.2) It dried quickly and didn't rub off of my hair onto my clothes and fingers easily.I really enjoyed this product and I will purchase more of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I bought this well over a year ago and I'm still on my first stick. It covers great, but does have a smell to it when you first put it on. I have dark blonde hair with highlights and the light brown works well for me.

It's basically a dark greasy lipstick you are putting on your hair. After application It looks like you haven't washed your hair for 2 weeks.

They'd be better rappers. And the Beenie Man wannabe singing with them is twice as annoying. Don't even make me THINK about bringing up the rest of this disposable trash they try to pass of as music, despite its mediocrity, \\"Move Ya Body\\" is the ONLY halfway decent song here.

The rest sound like the girls are trying to be soulful with their voices but they really can't sing. I highly doubt that any of the other songs that will be released to radio will make a hit. They just suck. I mean, they really can't sing and every other song starts with \\"Oh ohoho ohohoh oho\\" terriblly. There is no varity in the songs and they all sound pretty much the same. They need a lot of vocal traning, and they don't even come close to sounding like Patty LaBelle or anyone for that matter. They just can't sing and I regret buying this CD.

By the middle of the course, it would lock completely.I see they have dropped the price to 14.99 from 19.99. I would not even pay that much for any EA PC game at this point. I have hopes that it will get patched. I'll keep it around and see, but anyone would put out a game this badly done has big problems.Graphic are worse than the Xbox version.

All is fine except for one aspect, as you progress so do your friends and colleagues, which makes the whole attribute point system almost worthless.There are annoying camera angles, such as peering through the bushes...except all you see is grass, or trees.There are bugs...sometimes I would hit the ball in a particular area, and the game would say it was an unplayable ball, even though it wasn't.Basically, I would not recommend this game...it's annoying and frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"No improvement in 07, lot of missing game parts","review":"I got TW PGA06 for a penny and enjoyed it.

You have to get on e of the console version. And be careful, not all of them got all features. EAsport is very bad at documenting which feature is in which version. 07 as an improvement of 06, I would have hoped to get these features. But not, there nothing new: changed a few textures (I think they were better in 06, but that's a question of taste), more people watching you (need more processing power), new courses, and that's it. Easy money for EA. Do not buy this as an 'upgrade' of 06.

The hole view doesn't even show up half the time and the game graphics in general are a joke. In addition, the players responses to shots are inaccurate. You make a putt and the players response is of disappointment. A tap in type putt requires the swing of a 50' putt?? When the putt is missed (or made) the player does this wierd back bend...thing. I'm not even sure the human body could do what they do...at least not without serious injury. Honestly...the entire game is poorly designed and almost unplayable.

There wasn't even any interesting events leading up to the death of the Red King. All of that was predictable to. The authors of books have to learn to let the Antagonists win, because people are getting bored with the Protagonists always coming out on top. I for one cannot think of any book where an antagonist comes out on top, and if this doesn't change, then the book world will go into a crisis.Furthermore, the characters of this book are blunt and boring to put it blankly.

Victor Kelleher must have a damn nerve in writing this book and in my opinion, and the rest of the \\"WE HATE VICTOR KELLEHER SOCIETY\\" he should be strung up and poked with kebab sticks. If you were not given this book as a present, and did not steal or find this book, then I will have to assume that you paid real money for this book, in that case you are a damn fool.

The strangest, probably a man called Petie. He has just recently bought a slave called Timkin. It is sometimes rather frustrating reading his speaking passages because he speaks in hard to understand ridles. But I guess it just adds character to the book.It is a classic fantasy adventure with the goody and the bady, and it takes all of the predictable twists and turns, making for a rather normal ending.

She later meets a man called Petie, arogaant and ignorant, who is bent on gaining more gold and riches. The end was over so quickly and fast it was like Kelleher was busting to go to the loo when he came to write the last few pages.

I had trouble getting to the end at around page 120. It seemed those last 45 last pages would never come, and yes i did look at how many pages there were to the end, just wishing it would come sooner.The ending was terrible, simply insignificant, they killed the (so called) king in one page!

My teacher Ms. Carr would read it to us in class, as we followed along, staring down at our own copies. I, ofcourse, would go home later that day and read ahead, much to Ms. Carr's chagrin. Now, after ten years, three cross-continent moves, and adolescence I still remember the afternoons when Ms. Carr would read The Red King to us. Sure, I remember the various Paul Jennings books we read, but Victor Kelleher's book with the acrobatic slaves, their collars, a tyrant king, an unworthy master... lingers more than is warranted.

I guarantee, you will not forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red King - Uncovered","review":"The Red King is yet another unreal, fantasy adventure from Victor Kelleher, with unreal characters in an unreal world, and an amazingly pridictable ending. It tells the story of young acrobat Timkin, who amazingly survived the notorious 'red fever'. She meets up with hippie-like trickster Petie with high hopes of bringing down the Red King, who rules over their land. Now, the only problem with that is you can see the ending from a mile off. Like all his other novels, Vic introduces many wild and wonderful characters, including a monkey who can climb an invisible rope, and a bear who can dance. Methinks you would have to be a fan of Kellahers other novels to appreciate this one. Unfortunately, I am not."},{"rating":"1","title":"'The Red King' Not-Rage Review","review":"A twisting tale of an acrobat, trickster, loyal bear and monkey, that take on the infamous deadly Red King. The characters are a bit dodgy and are not explained very well, and the trickster is too confusing to follow mostly. The story is of course extremely predictable, unlikely hero(es) take on very powerful and guarded antagonist. The settings however are quite good and under the Red King's volcano mountain is the best. Yet, again the ending is of so poor mystery and fantasy-thinking that the book should just end earlier to save the reader lots of time. It (the ending) is very predictable and is practically given away by making it obvious that the acrobat carries something around that is no importance right now, but definatley will be used. The Red King is a worth-while book for about 9 chapters, but the rest are bad. 'The King's pets'is especially good, in my opinion. The book rates 2/5 stars.'The Reviewist'"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red King","review":"Shocking, I was bored to death with this basic fairy tale. The book had good characters in Bruno a big friendly and hairy bear and Crystal a small but powerful monkey. However, the plot was as dull a blue tongue lizard lying under a rock in the middle of winter. It was the same as all the fantasy books ever written, a goody which always kills a bady. I was forced to read the book which also probably added to my discontent of the book. One good aspect of the book was its easy reading. It had no big words that would fool adults and was aimed at teenagers thus using their language.

Good guy joins with relatively good guy, they cross lands together so as to thwart the evil \\"baddy\\" who is not as evil as they thought. People die, people get hurt, people are happy etc.I would have thought Victor (with the reputation he has) could surely do better than this. I expect that he didn't take too long to do this book.

Greedy Petie, Sweet Timkin, the mokey Crystal and the bear Bruno travel across the forest-lands to the Red King's fortress. Here they battle all sorts of evil things and their friendship and loyalty to each other is tested. An exciting read with a tricky twist and full of messages. However, it is still unoriginal and the ending lets it down. I recommend it to ages between 10-12 but you should only read it if you have to for school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratches Easily","review":"This looked okay and was the exact size of an old one I was trying to replace.

The series itself was dramatization of R.K. Narayan's collection of short stories.

I never really thought the unit was working and have spent endless hours talking with the supplier, who was nice, getting instructions on how to set things. After 1 1/2 years and my wife telling me I better get it working or else, I have decided to go to one that I know works, Culligan. This Fleck does not soften the water it continually breaks down and keeps running until I reverse the flow and back wash it, then flip it back. Because it does this and it's days before I catch it, you can imagine how much water is spent. My last months bill was 95.00. Sorry but I can spend that on a unit that works.

It shows British men, of many ethnicities, fighting each other and engaging in illegal activities. In fairness, if you keep watching, the static characters end up having dynamic backgrounds. Still, this movie could have fit into a sitcom's time, rather than being the normal film length. It was dull in so many ways.The one good thing was Andy Serkis. As soon as you see him, you see his powerful, Herculean backside and they don't just show it once. If you have been saddened that Michael Chiklis have never filmed in the raw, Mr. Serkis is a good substitute. His tattoos may distract, but he's your man if you like burly, beefy types.For all I know, this may have been imitation \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" too. If you like machismo and bloodshed, then you will like this genre.

A comparison of the techniques (standard regressions x FLS x KF) is missing, and I had a hard time finding the computer code mentioned as the ftp server was de-activated (hint: [...]) These problemas aside the book is very useful for researchers engaged with time-varying regression models, with dozens of examples and plenty of source data and developed computer code written for GAUSS, that can be easily converted to other packages such as R or Matlab."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Tanith Lee","review":"Pure fantasy.

The third single (Not that Kinda Girl) is good once you devote your undivided attention to it. She has amazing vocal skills for a fifteen year old. The songs that are highlights are Baby It's You, Homeboy, Leave, Use My Shoulder, Never Say Goodbye, and Fairytales. Homeboy is absolutely an amazing song! My personal favorite.

I mean she sings about heartbreak, I think she still hasn't experience this and I really find it ironic. She's too young but she tries to be mature which I think is not right. If you compare her to Christina Aguilera when she was still 15 or 16 years old, she would seem bad, she's no match for Christina!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what the hell?!?!?!?!?!?","review":"why are you all dissing jojo saying she is 'too young' to sing about the things that she sings about?

I also heard many songs here which vocally were above average, but lyrically? Come on! Does she really expect us to believe that she, a thirteen year old suburbian girl would go clubbin' or break up with twenty million guys? I dont think so, maybe some people would fall for that bulls**t, but me and any other smart people wont. It would be okay if she was at least sixteen, but thirteen? You gotta be kidding me!

Oh yeah just to let you know Sahag, I've seen ten or twelve year olds holding hands and calling each other \\"sweetheart\\" and that doesn't sadden me. I think that it's up to the kids parents to tell them if it's right or wrong.

Her album is really good to and she writes her own songs which is also really good. For someone that is only 14 she has so much talent and i think she will go a long way. GOOD JOB JOJO."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOK AT ALL YOU PAEDO'S","review":"She's only 13 Leave her alone, or else give it a big old baby!We used to do heaps but not really anymore. These days I spend most of my time dog-paddling, or fighting geese.JoJo has a funny face, because she has no pubic hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!","review":"Hello she's only 13 what next,7 year olds with there own album and songs on the radio?Most people like her only because she so young!What a wannabe! It might be a good album...for a 16 year old to sing but not her the album just doesn't fit her.I hope she waits till she's 16 for her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave Now!!!, Zero Stars!","review":"Ok, i'll give all you 5 star reviewers that she has a good singing voice. I'm not into hipidy hop music, but if I was i'd say her voice is mediocre for that. What I totally hate about this cd is how mature she attempts to be, and it's not just for show she really wants to be that old. Hilary Duff's singing is not one of my favorites, but at least she's sixteen and is singing about sixteen year old stuff. JoJo is thirteen and singing about freakin sex, how guys cheated on her, and all this dumb rapper girl crap. She's like a white girl version of lill bow wow, all gangster and bad ass wannabe. If you think this is bad check out his jams. She's thirteen not seventeen. She trys to be to cool for her age group singing, and sing about much mature content. I'd give it 1 star, but I just can't with a good music taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"NT WAT U U WILL EXPECT","review":"YES, she does have a great voice for a 13yr old, and her single Leave(get out) is pretty well done (and OVERPLAYED). Other than her hit single, NOTHING stands out in her album....and it seems like she's going the same path as burnt out divas like britney, who have ONE good single and the rest is FILLERS. Trust me, dont buy pop/r@b trash. She is OVERHYPED."},{"rating":"2","title":"best voice in a long time!","review":"I heard Jojo was preforming on MTV so I watched and she was amazing. She has great stage presence, her first single is incredible, and she has the best voice to come out in a long time, probably since Christina. She sang the song live, no lip-synching like some so called singers and she sounded great. She hit all the notes and sounded even better if possible.As for the CD, I wish the songs were less about love and relationships and more about independence and survival- getting through things, so it would be more relateable, but this is her first CD and the people writing for her are R&B; people who tend to write those kind of songs anyways. I am sure she will grow into her personality and be around for some time. She also has the look. Kick chubby hilary duff and her talentless butt off all those countdowns! The real talent has arrived. Now go get this Cd and help make it triple platinum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Beyonce wanna be - get an identity","review":"Getting this CD on the strength of the great pop song Leave (Get Out) I have to say I was completely letdown. Not only did she try to sing like Beyonce way too much on all the other tracks she also tries covering SWV's track with no originality at all!And finally, it's too bad because she was pulling off a good impression of Nelly Furtado on Leave so there was hope for a good CD. Instead you get this typical sound in an attempt to be mainstream and end up with only filler.And really when you think of it...why would you want JoJo with her weak lyrics and boring beats whe you could have Nelly Furtado."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow some ears- this music is HORRIBLE","review":"Jojo may have a mature voice for her age, but that's all she has going for her on her self-titled album, Jojo.The tween's powerful voice is often overshadowed by the heavy beats and basslines prevalent in nearly every song on the album. By far, \\"Leave\\" is the best track because it has an appealing melody and Jojo's voice comes off loud and clear as it should.The other tracks on this disc are horribly overproduced, even down to the cover of SWV's early 90's chart topper, \\"Weak.\\" I just get the feeling that Jojo's trying too hard, from the overemphasized ad-libs to the 18 year-old image she has been trained to represent.Save your money and buy a classic- this girl won't be around too long unless she changes her style."},{"rating":"2","title":"DuCkIeLuVeR8867 Gray,Louisiana","review":"i think Leave should be the #1 song b/c it totally ROCKS it wuzso good even when i 1st heard it and all my frendz have now broke up with there boyfrendz b/c they were waitin 4 a somg lyke this so there boyfrendz would remeber them and what they did by this GREAT song!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JOJO=PURE TALENT!!","review":"This album is just crazy, some people wouldnt expect an artist so young and raw to come out and just debut a FIVE STAR album, but believe the unbeliviable cause 13 yr old Jojo will make her mark! All the songs are great but Baby its you and Breezy are my favorite! Anybody with any musical taste would appreciate this album! Its pure genius, and the girl got voice of gold! The lyrics on this album are great, nothing over her own head, its song that will stick to you, i definitly say this isnt just a \\"pick a track single\\" CD, this is a CD that you gotta listen to the whole thing! 5 stars 2 Jojo! Its great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The CD is GREAT!!!!","review":"I listened to it EVERYDAY since I got it and can't keep the songs out of my head.

I know it's going to go Triple Platinum!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"jojo's cd","review":"omg omg omg!!!!!!!!!! i love this cd her voice is so beautiful and the songs i love em peace out"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Album!","review":"This album is all that I expected it to be: up-tempo, lots of energy and songs that I really can relate to. Jojo sings about most of the things a normal teenager goes through, such as \\"Fairy Tales\\" where she sings about having her heart broken, and \\"Never Wanna Say Goodbye\\", a song about finally finding true love. The album is very R&B influenced and is a \\"repeat\\" worthy album."},{"rating":"1","title":"HMM...A FLOP!","review":"NO TALENT!= DOES NOTHING WITH HER MUSIC!

Not at all. I just dislike pop music. Also I have heard this album, I work at a record store part time. I have a co=worher and she constantly is playing this record. I just feel it truly lacks lyrical depth and musical talent that makes beautiful music.I mean shes 13 years old. Does she even know what she musically wants? I doubt it. So in conclusion. If you like pop music you will like this. If your a parent looking for some \\"nice appropriate music\\" for your young child then this is the cd for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"keep giving her money","review":"I guess people in boston need this since they will never win a world series. But seriously, while you people are eating your macaroni and cheese and saving up for a night out, JoJo is buying her second house for her friends at the beach and you small people are only invited to buy her album. JoJo, you are singing everything teenagers want to hear because you can play a good game. That is what being young and naive is all about and that is what the majority of your listeners are. I will spend my money on The Dark side of the Moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and Lyrically Cute","review":"Discard the fact that Jojo is 13 when you listen to this CD. She has a beautiful voice that, in my humble opinion, surpasses Britney Spear's. She has the talent, voice, looks, and attitude be as high as Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, and Brandy. THe songs are mostly aimed at the young age groups but her voice is for anyone. She sings about cheating, friendships, and love. Kids and teens of all ages could definitely enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jojo by Jojo","review":"Jojo is an absolutely talentless, young ho wannabe. She tries to be an \\"adult\\" by singing about relationships, getting larger breasts, and having a powerful chistina-posing voice, but the more she does to be \\"cool\\", the more it backfires on her. Go back and finish grade school before you write about driving into the club. Hellooooooooooooo you're 13. I don't know how the average review rate for this can be 4.5 stars. Obviously, the reviewers are all from the record company, and are spaming this board with filth.It is wrong for a 13-year old to do this to herself. And here is a message to all middle and high school guys: if you think you can \\"get with her\\" because she is your age, and it'd be cool to have a celebrety girlfriend, don't. She will fade off into the distance, and will become dirt poor. She already is the ugly, fake thing of yesterday. I don't think that a girl who hasn't completed puberty should be on the radio.Bye!@!"},{"rating":"2","title":"she might be young but packs a punch","review":"she might be one of the youngest artist out there being 13 but she still is a great vocalist I wish I could've had at least half her talent at her age all pun intended. honestly though the songs she is recording I don't think she undertands how or what it meansat 13, hell i am 18 and just starting o figure this stuff out."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!!!!!!!","review":"This album has 2 be 1 of my favorites this year.Jojo is so talented!!!Listoning 2 the cd it was hard 2 believe she's only 13!One of my fav tracks on the album has 2 be \\"week\\".Even though its a remake of SWV's song Jojo put her very own touch 2 it.This album is a must have 4 2004!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JoJo is a real NoNo","review":"i'm a big music lover and i like every kind from jay-z to britney spears to the beach boys and everything inbetween... but JoJo doesn't make the cut.This is one of the worst and most annoying cd's i have ever listened to. the songs are awful and just hearing them once is torture to your ears, her voice isn't really that good-- theres MUCH better out there, so why waste your time listening to her? not to mention they're terrible again, but JoJo is WAY to young to be singing about all this stuff. Hello-- can she relate to any of this? No. Like at her age she was in a \\"serious relationship\\" or the \\"worst breakup\\". That doesn't happen in middle school, its just all that stupid \\"you're my boyfriend & i'm your girlfriend\\" crap. Most kids her age can't even relate to that. Her songs are terribly unrelatable and not well written or sung, her Cd needs to stop being produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't sing worth a darn","review":"this music is so boring. how many singers (if that is what you call this) are going to continue quivering their voices in high and low pitches for effect. Every song on this cd stinks. Did some balding 40 year old man write this stuff. Music doesn't seem to come from the heart anymore. To many parents want to sex up their kids into idols for their own gain. JoJO, this is crappy music. Listen to \\"my bloody valentine\\". It will change the way you think you hear music forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh what word am i looking for...... disgusting!!","review":"wtf is up with this? she's a 13 year old girl and she's singing about things that girls that age shouldn't even be thinking about. she's just a wannabe who is trying to act older and cool to sell her album. and her song \\"Baby It's You\\" sounds sort of like a rip-off of the J.Lo song \\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\\". the point is that 13 year olds shouldn't be singing about such topics as she sings about, and they shouldn't be making millions for it!go back to bed, JoJo. and don't take your \\"boyfriend\\" with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow...","review":"This girl has no talent...if you ask me all her songs sound the same on the cd. Ive listened to it a few times to see if maybe it got better or something, but no. I dont reccomend buying this CD. the 2 best songs on the cd (get out and baby its you) are played on the radio so you can listen to them there, but dont bother paying for the rest of the songs that really suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"JoJo's Album is awesome!","review":"Are you getting tired of seeing all these girls in their 20's acting innapropriate and wearing barely anything? Well, I know I am. It's time for a change, right? Well JoJo proved that to me. She has the greatest voice, and a variety of styles for her music. Some music will make you want to just get up and dance, and others make you feel what she's feeling. She's only 13 years old and already made it to #3 on TRL! Buy her album, you'll seriously enjoy it! I'm a 13 year old singer/songwriter/piano player and I feel like I can relate to her. But it doesnt matter what age you are, you'll really love this singer/songwriter, JoJos album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jojo sings good but she is republican.","review":"I use to love jojo songs and her.but i hate her cause she is a rupublican.Rupublicans are homophobec and dont care about animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"TAKE A HIKE JO JO!!!!!!!","review":"THIS STUPID KID MAKES ME SOOOOO MAD!

She cant sing worth a damn and she wears more makeup than a clown and dresses like a hooker. She needs to act her age and learn to sing. Why do all these singers think that they can pretty much speak their songs and be good singers. Do not buy this CD it sucks. Its heartless too. All her reviews of \\"omg shes so good\\" must be written by little kids who follow every trend and morons. Jo jo must go"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my Kind of Music","review":"My friend loves this music. She thinks that JoJo is better than Hilary Duff! So I went on amazon to hear some samples of the songs on her Cd. I was kind of surprised because the music was like rap music and I hate rap music. JoJo is not a bad singer, her music is just bad. I think she sould sing songs like the ones Hilary Duff sings."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T LISTEN TO THE GOOD REVIEWS","review":"First of all this kid cant sing to save her life. She obviously doesn't have much confidence in herself either and that is why she trys to act older than her age. She acts older because she wants to be taken seriously. I seen her on trl and she reminded me of britney spears. She was wearing tight clothes and lots of makeup and jewelry, and she seemed a little snotty to. It's good when britney does that but this kid is only 13! Also I think that her lyrics are a little to advanced. Your 13 for cryin out loud quit trying to relate to older pop stars. I don't like pop singers in general but this one especially makes me mad. It's ok because she's just goona be a one hit wonder anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"who is she","review":"i hate that dumb song they only play on z100 and disney radio on the radio by her. after looking her up, i found out she is a 1-hit-wonder. thats good....I finally don't have to hear anymore junk by this piece of sh*t!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice...bad music.","review":"It's undeniable that Jojo has a very mature voice for her age, but that mature voice is no excuse for the topics her songs address. She's only thirteen; she hasn't met the love of her life yet, she can't possibly have dealt with a cheating boyfriend that would have caused so much pain expressed in the songs she sings about it. What she should be singing about are things like puppy-love, trying to fit in with peers, or relations with their parents/family, things that thirteen year olds actually do deal with.The style of music, a pseudo-hip hop/destiny's child, isn't my cup of tea. I don't know what it is, but seeing a cute little white girl trying to be black (she SOUNDS black on this CD) doesn't appeal to me. Her amazing voice could be applied to much better music than this banal style she is currently singing.I give her 2 stars because she has a nice voice for her age."},{"rating":"2","title":"JOJO HAS THA LOOKS AND THA TALENT!","review":"As a 14 year old rock and rap junky,I have never liked pop music but dang!All this music by JoJo is awesome(especially songs like \\"Get Out\\",\\"Breezy\\" and \\"Baby,It\`s You\\").

That's not the case, her C-D is very bad.Why I hate it, is because they sound like something Brittney Spears would sing- all the songs!All the songs sound like them same thing. I couldn't tell the differance of the songs!They are wierd, and none of the songs make sence.If you want something real get something else.The only way she sold a lot is because it has \\"Leave (get out)\\". Don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut (4.5 stars)","review":"Jojo blew me away with her fist hit Leave (Get out) and when I got the Cd free with my CD club I thought it might be cookie cutter pop fluff but she changed my opinion. Jojo has incredible range and soul that is astonishing at 13 and she knows how to control her voice. This is a star in the making as long as she gets behind a good production team and hitmakers. The only reason it gets 4.5 stars is because the album tends to falter towards the end but still an excellent debut. Her reindition of Weak is stunning for her age.Breezy, Not that kinda girl, Weak, Leave (Get out), Homeboy, and Never say goodbye are standouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jojo is amazing, and there's nothing you can do to stop it!","review":"Jojo is truly one of the most talented young artists out there. And Jayson Jones cannot say anything to bash that. Actually, her music is geared to all people, from even 10 to a person's late 20s! And maybe she has had these feelings she writes about, you're not her best friend. So how would you know? She's expressing her music, and there's no power stronger than that.So, if you're considering buying this album, your money will be well spent. You can look forward to bumpin' rides in your Hummer (or other car ;), loud and fun parties, and a new and excited outlook on the new generation of music! Are you ready!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cd of the year!","review":"This cd is so good. So many cds only have one or two good songs. Almost every song on Jojo's cd is great. My very favorite songs are Breezy, Leave, Homeboy, Never Say Goodbye, and Yes or No. The only song I don't really like is City Lights, but the rest are very good. I recomend this to anyone who likes the song Leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAmn good!!","review":"hey i think jojo is the best she is a good /best new coming singer please buy her cd is it better than hilary duff of any young singer so go buy jojo's self titled album ~oscar~"},{"rating":"2","title":"JOJO","review":"Amazing vocal talent for a 14 year old.

She has a beautiful voice and she is destined for greatness because she is signed to Blackground records which is home to Tank, Timbaland and of course the late Aaliyah. I mean it isn't ground breaking music but it it is a very well put-together album. I love the fact that she is speaking for a generation and her first single \\"Leave (Get Out)\\", is nothing less than infectious.Some of my favorites on \\"Jojo\\" are :\\"Breezy\\"\\"Baby It's you\\"\\"The Happy Song\\"\\"Homeboy\\" (absoloute favorite)\\"Leave (Get Out)\\"\\"Weak\\" (SWV remake and a very good one)\\"Fairy Tales\\"Overall, this is a very well good record and I I hope Jojo goes far."},{"rating":"2","title":"JoJo is amazing!","review":"JoJo has a great voice!

I lost faith in the r&b singers that are around today, but JoJo makes me have faith again. buy this CD now please, you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Gurl!","review":"I'm 13, so I guess since Jojo is also a lot of her songs really bring out how I'm feeling. A couple of her songs like \\"Yes or No,\\" and \\"Breezy\\" didn't really appeal that much. Anyway, if you're a teen or teen-at-heart, You will defiantly love her album. I also recommend \\"Now 17\\". I bought that with Jojo's CD and let me tell you, my family came into my room dancing because they could hear her song throughout the entire house because I was playing it so loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*Kelly from Rhode Island*- TTLY WORTH URE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i luv da cd. even though shes only 14 now, shes got a great voice and promising talents. almost all the tracks r great, xcept 4 a few, like BABY ITS YOU, and FAIRY TALES. its kinda cheesy dat shes singing about true love, and love @ first sight, when she was only 13 when she (or song writers)wrote and made da cd.overall, its a great cd, and worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"I can't believe people actually consider this music.

I shudder and gag violently whenever I see this horrible waste of my hearing abillity.Yep, she's right up there with the others I hate (Avril, Britney, Hillary, Jessica and Ashley, that Rose girl)If you want pop music with talent, check out Maria Mena.Otherwise, you will be brain-washed.Kiss-Kiss- JackSkellingtonsBytchps.

Hopefully her producerswill freshen up her approach on the next album. And her hip hop language is a little ludicrous for her age.

JoJo has a lot of vocal talent, and most people wouldn't expect that from a thirteen or fourteen year old. But if JoJo was sixteen and came out with an album this...boring, I don't think it would be as big of a hit. Also, because JoJo is younger, it's easier for younger girls to relate to her (In some ways). Myself, I tried listening to her album, and it was just too much R&B; for me. I would like JoJo much, much better if she sang pop songs. I might even be a big fan. But this CD just bored me. I get bored easily with slow songs, and that's pretty much all this album is. \\"Leave (Get Out)\\" is the only song with feeling, and good music. I think there could have been more of a variety of songs on this album, and I hope JoJo will be around long enough to make a better follow-up album.This review was brought to you by,GMM (Gold Mew Mew)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...Just another wannabe","review":"I saw all the great reviews on this site about JoJo and was excited to buy her CD.

I must admit that most of the songs sound alike but this is still a great album. Breezy will get you up and dancing and Never Wanna Say Goodbye will make you happy.

Now that I know who JoJo is, I can say that JoJo is better than Joss Stone. HOWEVER, JoJo is boring. I mean, the girl can sing but she needs to do 3 things: 1) Stop the screetching 2) Stop trying to grow up so fast and 3) Find a style of her own. Like I said before, she can sing but this CD gets boring because it's nothing that you haven't heard before lately on FM radio. Anyone can sing those songs. The few tracks that I like are \\"The Happy Song\\" and \\"Keep on Keepin' On.\\" JoJo's remake of SWV's \\"Weak\\" was alright, but it wasn't necessary.

I was willing to take a chance that it may be a total dud, luckily it was pretty good. She shows off some awesome vocals and she's only thirteen. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating is the kind of annoying lingo she uses. She is a thirteen year old white girl who talks like she's from da ghetto.

I figured she was just another fifteen, sixteen year old who was trying to be the next Hilary Duff. Even though I am 19, I found her single \\"Leave(Get Out)\\" quite catchy. I'd hum along with it on the radio. But after a while, I noticed somthing: the only radio statition tha played JoJo's horrible music is Z100. That tells you something right there.Anyway, my twelve year old sister, Stephanie, recieved JoJo's CD as a birthday gift. And even she hated it. I decided to listen to it one day when I was extremely bored, and I was disgusted. JoJo obviously has no talent whatsoever. And this girl is 13? Puh-lease. She looks like 15 and sings like a 12 year old. Gosh, my sister could singer better than JoJo!JoJo's music is nothing but bad, over-played pop. She's nothing but a Hilary Duff wannabe.

The reason? I'm 24 years old and have had MANY experiences with the issue in the song. I didn't find out she was 13 until about three months after listening to the song non-stop all summer on the radio. It doesn't matter that she's \\"only\\" 13. Forget that small fact.Her entire album is sung with an adult voice. Some people mature faster than others...in fact, her album is more mature than some singers in their twenties. A good example is Justin Timberlake...I'd much rather listen to Jojo sing about being \\"Not That Kinda Girl\\" than Justin singing the theme to McDonalds. I regard this album as very enjoyable, good lyrics, sung with a mature and talented voice.This album did not disappoint. Very rarely I buy an album and want to listen to 98% of the songs on it over and over. Her cover of \\"Weak\\" is far from and Jojo is not a one hit wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Or am I just too much into my new Pink album at the moment?I really liked JoJo's music when she first released \\"Leave (Get Out)\\" over here in the UK at the grand old age of 13/14. She seemed to come across really natural, and wore some nice outfits in the video. She released like two other singles, and neither of them made much of an impact. She's probably doing her exams at the moment, but I hope she comes back soon with some more grown up music soon. The rest of her songs just seemed to blend into each other, and nothing really stood out apart from \\"Leave (Get Out)\\". This is still her best song. I'm so glad I didn't pay full price for this album - it's now in the bargain bins here in the UK. Not a good sign. Come back JoJo real soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All attitude and stinky smelly music","review":"The only kind of JoJo I want is the potato kind. With extra ketchup, babe, you know where to find the flava! The female singer variety is only 13 years old and isn't what we in the biz (or in my case, formerly in the biz) call vine-ripened.What's my connection to the music industry? Shame on you for not reading my reviews regularly, but I forgive ya (wink, wink!). Simply put, I managed a mid-level pro rock band for years. So I know what talent is. JoJo is marketable mainly to easily impressed kids that wouldn't know substance if it jumped out of their tampon box (oh, quit blushing, your monthly cycle is normal and beautiful). I sense a lack of responsibilty in her lyrics, which don't make a strong connection between love and commitment. This is strictly puppy love crap and any kid that likes it, well I fear for the future of this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your money","review":"jojo has talent, but her songs realli suck! i thought leave was a pretty good song, but her other songs are not worth lisetning to. her other singles, not that kind of girl she bearly gets any words in (the background sings it all!) and in baby it's you, bow wow takes the stage and jojo is kicked to the side! jojo has a realli nice voice, but like her songs are really weak and i think she should realli tackle bigger topics then \\"oh i'm gonna be fine after the breakup\\" the songs that she wrote i realli dont see her writing talents in there...her songs gets realli dull and boring...personally, i would just buy leave (get out) the single instead of this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT AN AMAZING ALBUM!","review":"I'm a big JoJo fan, and her debut album is an incredible debut. With JoJo's beautiful strong vocals and her R&B/Pop sound, she is sure to hit the charts hard. She's only 13 year old, and with that big voice you would think she's in her late teens or early 20's.. she surpasses a lot of artists out there right now!! If she were on American Idol I'm sure she would win with her talent and grounded and nice charm. Some of my fave songs would have to be her 1st single \\"Leave (Get Out)\\", her cover of SWV's \\"Weak\\" (I personally like her version more), \\"Never Say Goodbye\\", & a song that she wrote about her personal experiences \\"Keep On Keepin On\\". She wrote 3 songs off her debut. Everytime I listen to JoJo's voice I get chills. She isn't bubblegum pop like a lot of the artists out there right now, she's R&B flavored with Pop mixed with it. Just one listen of any of her songs, and you won't be dissapointed. JoJo's definitely an album you must own in your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Is Funny...","review":"I was histerical once I read that \\"in time we will see her voice.\\" She is untalented because does nothing with her music. Her voice is just load...not hitting high notes. When she does, can only hold on for 4 seconds. Woah...ya...NOT ORIGINAL!Her singlesLeave= a #1 hitBaby It's You= a flopNot That Kinda Girl= an even more of a flop than the one above!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathing is ALL WRONG!","review":"I recently bought this album and as a trained singer, was pretty impressed. One thing I found VERY annoying though, was her breathing. She breathes pretty loud and at times it sounds as if she is gasping for air. In \\"Leave (Get Out)\\" her first single, you can hear her lick her lips ( or something of that sort!). But you do have to take into consideration that she was only 13 when she recorded the album.But JoJo has a very nice Pop voice with an R&B; twist, which is fun to listen too. My personal faorite song is \\"Homeboy\\" which I am sure many young girls can relate too. You know how most Pop singers don't write their own songs? Well surprisingly JoJo wrote or co-wrote a few of her songs including \\" Keep on Keepin' On\\" which is pretty insperational. But other songs kind of flop, because they are either boring or have lame lyrics.I do reccomend this Album if you want to entertain yourself or friends, but not if you are extremely critical when it comes to singing technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jo Jo...So So","review":"Now this is just my opinion, but the only song I like is Leave (Get Out). I think the rest of her songs suck, to be perfectly honest with you. Also about this age thing, when I first saw her, I thought she was 18-20 years old. When my friend told me she was only 13, I was shocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl can blow and I mean that in a good way of course","review":"(...)Jojo is the real deal.Her debut album is a mix of R&B/Hip hop and pop but this album sounds a bit mostly R&B.Tracks that are worth listening too are Baby It's you(Unfortunately Bow Wow is not featured in the album version),Leave(Get Out)an anthem for young girls out there about their boyfriends cheating on them,Weak a remake of the Female R&B Group 1993 #1 Hit which sounds almost pretty much the same as the original but Jojo still makes it a great track worth listening too.Other great tracks include City Lights(A Club Banger so to speak but isn't she a bit young to be going to clubs)Never Gonna Say Goodbye,great ballad about discovering and falling in love for the first time.Jojo is defitnitely a superstar on the rise and I wish a lot of a success she has an amazing voice and Highly Recommend this album to anybody little kids,teenagers,and adults you'll really enjoy it I give 4 out of stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone In Ohio","review":"This is possiably one of the best CD's I have ever listened to the songs are deep and meaningful, very hard to believe she is only 13 with a voice like that, I recommend every buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I LOVE Jojo's CD!

It's filled with lots of soul, lots of challenging notes for the young singer, and mixing/sampling intricate enough to make Mr. Hahn (Linkin Park) proud.The tracks range from slow, soulful ballads (Never Say Goodbye, Weak) to the faster, dance-style beats that have already won her fans (Leave, Breezy). It may appear at first to be just another Britney/Christina album, but behind this pretty face is talent beyond measure. A worthy pick for any music pallette."},{"rating":"2","title":"jojo's album is awsome","review":"its a gr8 cd from a gr8 girl ... she has one of the best voices i ever heared and she deserves to be #1...... love u jojo"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best R&B singer This Year!!!!!!!!!","review":"I'm a very big fan of R&B; music but I never heard a voice like Jo Jo's.The first time I listened to her debut song I thought it was amazing how I just connected with what she was saying.I went out the first day the album came out to buy it to prove to myself that Jo Jo is great.She is going to go very far, I hope, and be one of the greatest soul sistas ever.I have only heard about Jo Jo in the last month,and now I feel connected to her like I have known her for years.She is really an inspiration to me and all the Sagittarius'.I'm hoping that everyone who reads this review will help me make Jo Jo's album Triple Platinum.Much Love,T.Simpson"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING CD","review":"This is probably the best CD I've heard her in a LONG time.

It's been said that Mary Austin's work is the finest nature writing between John Muir's and Aldo Leopold's. I dearly love John Muir's writing, but Mary Austin is the better writer. There is a haunting, mystical quality in this book. At times it reads like beautifully stark poetry, like the landscape she describes. For me it reads like music. I read this after visiting Owens Valley, Death Valley and the valleys and mountains between. For me it was an affirmation of what I felt and sensed there. If you let it, the landscape has a way of burning itself into you, and she describes that very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhythm of the drums beats a story of delight","review":"As a Drummer I found this to be a story showing the power & magic of culture & music & drumming to inspire all young readers & especially girls to reach for their goals.Bilingual & wonderfully illustrated to teach about other cultures.

My son would be horrified of his grandmother if I read this to him. I'm sure there is a happy ending but I cannot get that far. Some lessons are better learned in a more gentle manner such as just telling them that some people in the world are cruel and hateful to their children. But let's not read bedtime stories about them! It reminds me of those \\"how NOT to behave\\" books where they show the brother clubbing his little sister in the head with a bat? Why even plant THAT seed???

But, more than what I got!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I purchased this toy for my 1 year old boy. He had more fun playing with the box it came in, than the toy itself. We are big football fans, and I thought it was really cool to have a toy with a football, but it is only a rattle. And it is not even a rattle that he can hold. It just spins..thats it. The baseball is too hard to spin around, and the sound effects, when a ball is put through the hoop is very annoying. There are so many toys out there, for $30.00, that are much nicer than this one. Don't be disappointed too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what I expected","review":"The toy doesn't do too much, and its very light weight. My 9 month old pulls on the basketball rim and it tumbles over, I'm still trying to find the purpose of the t-ball stand, it doesn't do anything at all, its hard to get it to spin when you hit it with the bat.

I guess this toy is meant for the really young ones. Once they can walk, this toy has limited entertainment value. It's so short, that even my 2 year old has to get on her knees to play with it. We've had it for about a week and it holds her attention for only about 2 minutes per day, tops. I'm no expert, but besides learning how to put a ball into a hole, I don't see much educational value in this toy either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Worked - baby never knew Difference","review":"Looked fun for my 11-month old daughter, however when I plugged in the batteries, there was no power.

My wife got it to make one slight noise when she pushed on the batteries with the back open and exposed, but whatever electronic features this product has, I have never seen work other than what sounded like a last grasp of breath.

He is now almost 16 months old and plays with everything he can get his hands on. Except this toy. The only thing he plays with in regards to this toy is the little \\"basketballs\\" and he carries around the bat. Otherwise, it holds no interest for him. Maybe he will get more interest in it as he gets older, but the problem is that it's really sized for kids his age. My almost 4 year old nephew has never been interested in it when he comes over either, because for the past year he's been playing with a little tikes type basketball hoop and a real football, so he has no interest in a small plastic setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Customer Service","review":"Terrible Customer Service. My son received the Little Tikes Little Champs Sports Center as a gift. After putting it together, I realized there was a ball missing.

I explained to the CR Rep that I already put the whole thing together and that it was a gift and therefore I would not be able to return it without a receipt. CR Rep told me well she would need a receipt as well. All this to replace a tiny 3-inch ball? I had much bigger and more expensive things replace from other companies without question.

But this one is not worth buying.I heard a double album a few years back that was Joao doing all Samba numbers, and I thought this was it. I was wrong. I'm still looking.If you are looking for great Joao, try these live albums: Ela E' Carioca, Live in Montreaux, and Ao Vivo: Eu Sei Que Vou Te Amar. They are all wonderful!

It's not too often that you see this particular voice used to tell a story and a powerful story at that.Trueman is an excellent wordsmith and spins a captivating tale for everyone who chooses to pick up the book. The story pulls the reader in right away and doesn't let up until the end. The reason I only gave it four stars however is that I was a little disappointed with the ending, although I recognize the ending is actually necessary to fit with the rest of the book, I just was personally disappointed with it.Overall, if you are looking for a thought provoking and fun story to read, pick this one up it's well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best young adult novel out today","review":"Terry Trueman's \\"Stuck in Neutral\\" continued to raise the bar for young adult fiction, in the tradition of Lois Lowery's \\"The Giver\\" and similar, conscious-raising books. I was exposed to the book through a friend who teaches grades 8-12 English classes, and I could not put the book down after he loaned me his copy. The story of Shawn McDaniel is a gripping, heart-breaking tale that could be used as a metaphor for even the most able-bodied among us, especially for teenagers, many of whom probably feel confined or isolated in some way. The book also brings into question the way we, as a society, look upon disabled people, especially the severely disabled. For those who have never been in the company of a severely disabled individual, Shawn's attitude and outlook on life should break away many of the misconceptions about the disabled, and cause the reader to look past one's handicaps.

It keeps you thinking the whole time and has amazing details and descriptions. It's not trying to persuade you to have pity on the disabled, but, rather, to think about them, and how they might feel, even if you cant tell.When I finished the book, I thought my book was missing the last chapter. I hated how it didn't tell you what happened at the end. In my opinion, there's no point in spending the time reading a book in which you have to write the ending yourself. When I tried to do so, I couldn't stop switching back and forth. Eventually, I, of course, chose the happy ending. I think books should teach us that real life doesn't always have happy endings. I think Terry Trueman should have told us what happened at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A awesome book called Stuck in Neuttral","review":"I beleive Stuck in Neutral is a great book! A short summary of what happens in this story is there is a little boy named Shawn who had ceribral palzie and it looks like he is telling the story but really he cant talk or anything but the story is telling from what he is thinking. Sean gets the feeling his dad wants to kill him throughout the story, and later on his dad goes on a talk show because he is writing a story on a man who got locked up for killing his son who had the same thing which makes Shawn really think he is going to kill him. I recomend this book for anybody who thinks they are mature, i say that because during this story you will find many cuss words and words little childeren or someone imature might not fill comfortable or be able to handle.

It's a super short, little book that is filled with some heavy material. I read it in less than an hour, but I will be thinking about it for a long time to come.It's written from the perspective of a smart, funny boy...that happens to have cerebral palsy. The author gives you a glimpse into the 'what if'. What if those we see as 'retarded' are fully developed people, trapped in a body that won't cooperate? What if they are misunderstood by everyone they know? Invisible and forgotten, just wanting to be loved and express their own love.Although this boy had plenty of reasons to complain and to even hate his life, he doesn't. He loves his family, takes pleasure in the small things, accepts the way he lives his life, and forgives people for treating him different.A small glimpse into the confusion and conflict that parents of special needs children face daily. The boundless love that a parent has for their child, no matter the outer packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh...","review":"In my standards of reading I think this book was not a page-turner even though it won a Michael L.

The reasons why I would not recommend this is that the problem isn't really that believable, because I really don't believe someone would be that crazy enough to get rid of their own son.

You will have to read it and find out.

Frustrated with Shawn's inability to move or communicate and the possible suffering of seizures, his father struggles with a decision that he feels will relieve his child's suffering.We felt this was a good book and thought provoking.

I will never look at the Life Skills kids in my school the same. Terry Trueman's story pulled me into Shawn's world-- and ultimately opened my mind about people that I am just as guilty of ignoring as Shawn's family is. What an amazing, amazing, powerful read. Should be required reading in high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck in Neutral","review":"\\"My name is Shawn McDaniel. I'm 14 years old. I think my father is planning to kill me.\\"With a tagline like that, you can't help but be interested in this book. While it's not about murder per se, \\"Stuck in Neutral\\" is still a little disturbing--about a young boy with C.P. (cerebral palsy) who fears his estranged father wants to \\"end his pain\\" by euthanizing him. The book was based on Trueman's own experience as a parent to a child like Shawn, which gives the story a more realistic touch, and the reader can't help but wonder if Shawn's father and Terry Trueman share the same opinions about C.P. and euthanasia.While, overall, the book was great--it's a bit of a tear-jerker, but funny and honest as well (some profanity)--I was pretty disappointed by the inconclusive ending. Still, it was a quick read (114 pages), and I was able to read it in one sitting, so I had to give it a \\"5.\\" Definitely worth reading if you're interested in C.P. or euthanasia."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Neutral Boy with a Crazy Mind","review":"The book wasn't really a page-turner it was more of a life lesson, because nothingexcited because of Shawn's immobility. It wasn't hard to concentrate on the book, but Icouldn't get into the book. I like the style of writing and how the author thinks aboutwhat mentally retarded people are capable of doing. The book was pretty boring becauseof Shawn's condition and my mind occasionally started to wander. The plot wassomewhat believable because I think maybe mentally retarded people can do things likeShawn even though it looks like they can't do anything. I think anybody who has arelation to a mentally retarded person would enjoy this book because they can relate tohow the family feels. I would like to give this author another shot to see if he writesanything captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone who has anything to say about the Teri Schiavo murder should read this","review":"Go ahead and shell out 7 bucks and see what it's like to be on the other side...I dare you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This title could actually...","review":"have any number of stars from 0-5 for a plethora of reasons. This book was slightly disturbing, but thought provoking. Thought altering. After reading this book, chances are, you will find yourself dumbfounded. The perspective this book is written beneath will take your breath away. I personally found it a bit overwhelming and did not like many of the assumptions the author placed. Stuck in Neutral is definitely worth the time, but be prepared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeezy luezy bluezy... this is a great book","review":"Stuck in neutral is a great book. Any one who doesnt like the book is KWAZZZY!!!!!! I LOOVVE the book. It is cool. Very good. Like it. Cool. Like an ice cube. The middle could need work though. All it talked about was him thinking his dad was going to kill him. Except for when collin was killed by his own daddy. Pleeeeeezz read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary","review":"This book was really cool...it helped us to see what life would be like if we had severe cases of C.P. All through the book from the time we found out he was really intellegent we were praying that by the end of the book someone would know how smart he was..maybe something would change and he would be able to talk to his father. We really enjoyed reading this book and recommended it to all of our friends. We just wish that we could know what happened in the end. Did the father kill Shawn? Is he okay? Did Shawn talk or did anyone walk in and help him before his father could hurt him? It aches at our minds! They need to have a sequel! All in all, this was a pretty great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"View","review":"Truth be told I only got this book through my school's book club and I only wanted it because at a reasonable distance and given my nearsightedness I thought the cover look horribly interesting. I found that relevant because of the irony between my wanting the book and what the book is about. The story really does show that what an outside appearance conveys can often be misleading. I would suggest this book to anyone, whether you are apathetic or not. Me being the insanely emotion-filled person I am cried for a while after finishing, even though it wasn't really a horrificly sad ending. If you think you might be interested in it even a little bit then get it. It may give you a new perspective on something you may not have given much thought to."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"I have cerebral palsy and, until the last pages, I mostly enjoyed this book; although I thought Shaun's genius and so on was rather unlikely - total recall *and* out-of-body experience? Come on, Mr Trueman ... I saw somewhere that you said children always believe Shaun's still alive because he's narrating the book. But I'm old enough to have learnt the concept of the unreliable narrator. If he's trapped inside that body how come he's writing? If he can have an out-of-body experience when he's alive, why not when he's dead? No, Mr Trueman, no. Why do disabled characters in fiction always have to have some stunning compensatory ability? Why can't they be allowed to get past the last page? Could it be because the able-bodied world would rather they weren't there ...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review on \\"Stuck in Neutral\\" by John Filippeos","review":"\\"Stuck in Neural\\" is a definite 5 star novel that shows an exemplary image of a physically impaired child's life. Shawn McDaniel is no ordinary teenage boy. At birth, brain vessels throughout Shawn's head burst causing a near fatal reaction. He lived but from that point on was not able to control any part of his body, and I'm using the word \\"any\\" very loosely. Throughout the novel, Shawn has come to terms with many amazing obstacles including the thought that his father was planning to kill him! The thing is, no one thinks that Shawn can hear, listen or know what is going on around him. On the contrary, he is a fully educated teenager, and has the ability to hear, listen and read. This book is recommended to every single person who enjoys reading thrilling but calm and cool novels. In fact, if you do not enjoy reading this book, YOU'RE CRAZY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"\\"Stuck In Neutral\\" is about a teenager who is paralyzed and is stuck in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. His father left the family because he couldnt stand to see his kid \\"suffering.\\" He visits every once in a while. Now he thinks his dad is planning to kill him because his dad wants togo onatv show and talk about other parents who have killed their children. I thought the book was all right. It was kind of boring at times though because it just kept going on and on about how hes stuck in his wheelchair and how his brother and sister feed him things that his mom wont feed him when shes not looking. Overall, it was a good book. The ending is ok, it could have been better though."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOVIE","review":"I work at a production company currently developing this book into a film. I personally can vouch for the quality and insight into a family with a child who suffers from a very strange disease. And the value that Terry's words contain and the spirit Terry inscribes with visual images and witty dialogue within it's chapters are heart stopping. Terry Trueman excels at not just being a poet but being an author with a spectacular range of emotion. I can only imagine how the movie will shake and rattle an audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"an enlightening adventure through the mind.","review":"This book, \\"Stuck in Neutral\\" but Terry Trueman is really wonderful. It makes you think about the person in the wheelchair, not just the fact they are there. The thing I found most intresting though, is that Terry Trueman's son, Sheehan has cerebral palsy. It makes you think how closely knit he is with this story. For he could put himself in the fathers shoes, and relate so closely with Shawn. I feel this is a great book and very intresting to read and learn from. My one problem is its length, I feel like 114 pages just isn't enough for this complex character. I guess you can only let it go so long, when you have a main character that cannot do anything but think. I loved this book and would reccomend it to anyone who seems intrested, its deffinetly a wonderful read and an adventure through one couragous boys mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I liked the idea of being in someone elses shoes for awhile. After reading the book, I actually felt what the character was feeling. I'll have to admit it gave me chills, but I like books like that. Anyways, I think that this book was excellent and you have to think to fully understand the story. Please try it, I read the other books from this author and they're all pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Review","review":"Even though Stuck in Neutral is a book about a handicapped boy, it can apply to anyone that loves a great story. Terry Trueman (the author) creates great characters that people can connect to. With Shawn, (the handicapped) Terry can really put you in his shoes. Stuck in Neutral has great realism, If you look around in our society, you will find \\"real\\" people just like Shawn. Stuck in Neutral's point of view is also very interesting, because Shawn describes every thing as he experiences it. These are the many reasons why I believe that Stuck in Neutral is a great book that everyone should love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy","review":"I bought this a week ago and already used several times. I have been having a terrible string of migraines lately. I say this is a handy product since it tiny, much smaller than I thought, smaller than a tube of chapstick. So you can carry it any where with you. While it didn't take away my pain completely it did bring the pain down a notch which was helpful while waiting for the pain medicine to kick in. I don't think would ever work on any of my migraine as far a relieving all the pain so I didn't have to take pain medicine. But it is a handy tool in combating a migraine down to a more manageable level. It has a nice scent, you will definitely will smell like peppermint but I think it smells way better than icy hot. And it gives a nice cooling sensation, which it does take a few moments before you start to feel it. I wish the cooling effort would last longer, otherwise a handy little product, and I will be buying it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps with migraines","review":"I have used Migrastick for years for migraines, and it's one of the best non-drug additions to my regimen of treatments.

If you have migraines I would highly recommend giving it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I MISS HEADON MIGRAINE...This doesn't compare.","review":"I was really upset at the size of this.

Although Feng Shui is a subject which has attracted more than its share of charlatans, the beginner can approach Ms. Wong's work with the confidence that she doesn't promise more than she delivers. In a well-written Introduction (which itself is worth the price of the book) she cautions the reader against assuming that this ancient art can be mastered by reading any book, even this one. More than a \\"how-to\\" manual, the book places Feng Shui in the religious and cultural context in which it developed, and without which it can neither be practiced nor understood. The reader coming to Feng Shui for the first time has to start somewhere, and I know of no better place than in these pages.

And it's not one of the best. It lacks the expert direction that Alfred Hitchcock brought to Psycho, and it lacks crazed horror of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. What Three On A Meathook is, is a fairly disjointed slasher film. Both the acting and direction are spotty overall. The only actor that is any good really is the man who played Billy. I will say that the first twenty minutes and the last ten minutes of Three On A Meathook are pretty good, but everything in between is boring and hard to sit through. I'd avoid if I were you, unless you're like me and have seen all of the good slashers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Z-Grade DVD and Z-Grade film","review":"This movie is terrible.

He has decided to blast the sultan's motives and character based on sources which appear to be no more impartial than those he eschews. However, despite his evident bias, he succeeds in breaking through the shrouds of hero-worship draped over Saladin by his early biographers and by Lane-Poole and his successors. While it may well be overkill, it presents, really for the first time in a European biography, a dissenting view toward the character of the first Ayyubid sultan. A very important work, but one which needs to be balanced with a less critical biography to put the Sultan in a clearer light."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappionted","review":"OMG THIS ITEM WAS SO SMALL IT IS A JOKE FOR THE PRICE, ENTRYWAY BENCHES?

I am happy with it overall and it is very cool. My problem is the packaging states that it is 2.4 gallons of capacity. This would be true based on the size dimensions but you lose space with the filter/pump and about an inch inside the aquarium based on design. I had two gallons ready to fill the aquarium and was shocked when I got just over one and a half gallons into it and it was full. So beware that this aquarium capacity is only 1.6 gallons and not 2.4 which makes placing anything in it other than a betta or drawf shrimp almost impossible.

I made the brown rice gravy, adding mushrooms for Thanksgiving and it was a taste sensation as well as an all around hit. I also made the oden, a five root japanese stew which was hearty and delicious. It was great paired with steamed kale and brown rice. Overall, this is a great book.

The zealous anti-vegetarian crusader? The internet guru who claims you'll sicken and die, if not for consuming vast quantities of meat? Why is her name referenced as an expert in a vegetarian cookbook?

Well the worker who assembled the one I received forced the cross threaded screws into the lower bracket so hard that they stripped out the head. This mess plus the remaining screw was just thrown in the plastic carton and sent out the door. The other anchor assembly had been cross threaded too.The anchor itself seems rugged and looks good.The pop up action operates smooth, the hook has plenty capacity and the unit as a whole is solid.

It provides pictures that demonstrate the appeal of the mini's. It provides a short chronological history of the 30+ years reign of the mini's.

It is one of my favorite SF books, both due to its style and its' intriging story. The story is told from the first person perspective of a young man, without any preface or setting-up of the situation. It is somewhat confusing at the beginning, because you, as the reader, do not understand quite a bit of what is happening. Eventually, though, information is given - a piece here, or a chunck there - that allows you to assemble the picture. I read on with anticipation of the next 'Eureka' moment, or the next puzzle piece.The downside does not show up in my rating, and that is that the second half of the series does not quite live up to the first half (each half is really two books in one volume); however, even with that being the case, I am looking forward to re-reading this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is one of best series of books I have ever read. They are complex, beautifully written, tricky, engaging, and full of brilliant imagery, characters, and mystery. This is science fiction at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book of the New Sun","review":"Great book--I found echoes of Chaucer, Bocaccio, and many others in its pages. I wanted more answers, the whole history of Urth, but if it had all been laid out I think it would have taken away from the books' mystery. There were definitely a lot of flaws (mostly characters who seemed to come from nowhere for no reason), but that acutally made it seem more like a lot of medieval literature. A ton of fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written","review":"This book is one of the most beautiful writings ever produced in the English language. It is not what I would call an accessible \\"storytelling\\" book; Stephen King is the master at writing such novels. This book is beautifully written and complex at every level, from each sentence to the whole story and every image and thought it creates in one's mind. It is also an unforgiving book -- nothing is really explained. But, the book rewards careful reading and re-reading. I enjoy it anew every time I read it. My son has read it several times since he was a teenager and has become enthralled. Without compromising, Wolfe is letting his central character tell a story that takes place in a culture and a physical environment far removed from our own. The reader must struggle to comprehend this alien landscape with only the unfamiliar and idiomatic, but still human, narrative of a single person from this other time in the far future."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite novel","review":"I first read this work when I was a teenager back in the eighties. Now I'm near 40 years old, and nothing else I've read in my entire life has approached the brilliance of this story. I must have read this complete work 4 or 5 times at least, and it's still rewarding. The language is rich and seductive. Wolfe has a way of crafting sentences that is just unique, and hard to describe. Achingly beautiful. He creates images with words that will imprint themselves onto your soul.Not everyone will like this book. But for some it will be the best thing they've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious writing and disturbing plot","review":"I don't think I've ever been so torn by a book.In one sense, it is grander than much sf/fantasy,and deserves a mention. On the other, I findthe book disturbing and the writingpretentious (use of obscure words which addnothing to the story).I'm giving it two stars for the original ideas,but no more due to the writing and unsympatheticcharacters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy of so much Praise","review":"This is the first of Gene Wolfe's books that I have read and probably the last. I was hoping to find a new exciting story after reading many other science fiction and fantasy books, but rather I found this \\"masterpiece.\\"The story starts out well enough, but rapidly goes downhill from there. There is so much imagery in the first book that there is little room for anything else, such as enjoyment. I found the writing in this book a little to heavy for me as well. I don't particularly like having to re-read every sentence again and again until I finally grasp the meaning. But maybe that's just me. While I was reading this book I felt like I was back in high school reading one of the boring literature pieces given by my professor. This book would have been much better if it were about 50 pages long.This isn't something I'll pick up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully written but extremely boring","review":"Well, Shadow & Claw is like a beautiful stage with beautifully dressed characters with blank faces.No personality and no interesting story. Maybe this book is just an introduction to the next one,but that IS NOT an excuse to make it so boring that I actually felt that I lost my time reading it.For those who are looking for an interesting story or good action, stay away from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The young Apprintice leans about what it is to have friends.","review":"The young apprintice must learn to be a friend a lover and a man filled with compassion. In the begining he has the job of a student. As he grows he leans that with resposibility ther comes a price. He learns that sometimes that to be nice the only thing he can do is show mercy. Even if that mercy means death for a loved one. Being brought up without a mom or dad not even knowing his parents for that matter. He had to teach himself how to judge a man and how to trust others. He meets with a few friends and alot of people who just want to take what they can from him. The friends he earns stay with him almost to the end. He overcomes his past and dears to try and let love in. The only problem and maybe the best part of the story is how they leave you with almost a mild depression with the want no the need to get the next book so that you can find out what happens next"},{"rating":"2","title":"An truly unique and fascinating science fiction/fantasy.","review":"Often considered Gene Wolfe's masterpiece, \\"The Book of theNew Sun\\" is a dark and supurbly detailed chronicle of a life'sjourney through an Earth so far in the future that magic and scienceare indistiguishable from each other. Now re-released ina quality paperback book format, the the five-part seriesleads the protagonist, Severian, on a life's journey whereboth his personal identity and the fabric of reality oftenblur. It is a retelling of a life of discovery, adventure,love, and terror unlike any other. Gene Wolfe executes hisprose with a simple humanity which lends reality and credenceto an otherwize bizarre and frightening vision. This is atruly unique experience and a must-read for both the sci-fiand fantasy buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not enjoyable","review":"Having finished the first 2 installments in this series I can safely say I won't be finishing it. It is difficult to read because of the lack of plot and the use of \\"big\\" words you haven't seen since the SAT. While you can infer the meaning of most of the words based on the context of the sentence it is still very annoying.The first 2 books are essentially descriptive imagery of the places and people Severian happens to meet on his completely random and meaningless journey. There is no adventure or character development - just an endless stream of bizarre imagery interlaced with hidden references to present day Earth and ancient myths. Maybe the point of this story is revealed in books 3 and 4, but I don't care to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned!","review":"While certainly a very eye-opening andcreative novel, this book is tedious, confusing, and ultimately very frustrating. I must have read the opening few pages five or six times, before I finally understood what Gene was trying to say. If you are ready to struggle painstakingly through a book, than maybe this is the series for you. Otherwise, skip it. I made the mistake of reading the entire first book, and about half of the second before finally giving up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolfe overrated","review":"When I saw that this book got such great reviews I decided to buy it - big mistake! I feel obligated to write a review to others so that they can avoid the same mistake. In all fairness some of the reviews which rated this book as great did so with the qualification that the style is difficult. This is an understatement - the characters are boring and the story is confusing. The direction is never clear, characters come and go with no overall theme and you never get any strong feeling for the main character (one way or the other). I got through the whole book and even tried to start book#3 in the series but could see it going nowhere and finally decided to put myself out of my misery and just quit. I would advice you to avoid making the same mistake and take a pass on this series.Recommend :Any Jack Vance novel - especially Demon Princes, Night Lamp, Dying Earth, LyonnesseStephen King's Dark Tower series"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"What a boring book. (Or rather, what a boring bunch of 4 books). The main character is Severian the torturer who pursues his destiny across the lands of Urth. Torture, cannibalism, grave robbing, public executions ad nauseum abound. I hope I'm not spoiling anything when I say that Severian does eventually decide to quit his job (well, duh). Wolfe uses some excellent descriptive prose to fashion an Urth of the far future. The place is alright but the motivations of the main characters are obscure and consequently uninteresting. I would suggest Zola and his pit ponies for a much better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"It's a little hard to follow at first, but I think it's a great \\"sci-fantasy\\" book and the main character really grows on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Days Journey into Light","review":"This series of five books (inc Urth of the New Sun) is singly the most imaginative and moving piece of sci fi I have ever had the pleasure to read. It is not, an easy road, as Severian the central character states at the end of book 1, but is well worth pursuing again and again. Such is the nature of the writing, different levels of meaning and suggestion are discovered on every reading, and a detailed examination of the sequence reveals a story which is so rich in texture as to suggest a visual tapestry of imagery. Wolfes books range from the impenetrable to the merely obscure, but BOTNS must be read by any sci fi enthusiast - not just the first book(s) but the whole series, as although each book is a self contained wonder, it is only after completing the final part that the whole sequence lights up like a neon sign and glows with the light of the Claw. An indisputable 20th century classic. Fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it with a friend...","review":"I bought the first book of this series because of SF awards it received over the years (e.g., Nebula). So, I went in with rather high expectations and still was completely blown away.The characters are complex beyond imagination (mine, not Wolfe's, clearly). I've spent hours contemplating whether Severian is a moral man or not...My reason for posting this review, however, is to say that I only fully began to appreciate this series after a close friend read it and we began to discuss it. Wolfe leaves so many gaps in the plot...in his universe...in his philosophy...that the reader can supply a lot of imagination. Hearing my friend's interpretation, and his hearing mine, really brought that point home to each of us.I think a casual reading would still prove enjoyable. But, this book (at least for me) really came alive after long periods of introspection and discussion. So, get a friend to read it :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomparable work - transcends the genre","review":"The book of the new sun series is absolutely superb and transcends the genre it is written in, drawing heavily on Greek myth, mediaeval imagery and a whole host of cultures past, present and dare I say it: future. Brilliant! Buy it in hardback so you can read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Yarn!!!","review":"I'm usually not too hip on the sci-fi/fantasy stuff, but this book is different. Great characters, and plenty of twists and turns. Finished it in a couple of days and i don't even really like to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tailored to nerds","review":"I found this book at a cheap hotel in Southeast Asia. This novel boils down to a guy with a magic sword wandering around and discovering the wonders of the library and having sex with just about every single female character. As an escapist fantasy for repressed nerds who read too much and have sex too little, it's a masterpiece, and even a page turner. However there was nothing to elevate it above any of the other \\"airplane novels\\" one might expect to find at a cheap hotel in Southeast Asia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storyline is not something you may drop for free","review":"After I finished reading the first volume (and immidiately cancelled the second from my order) my disappointment slowly turns into disgust.What do I care for someone dreamy imagination? The book must have a story to tell, not just being a pile of so-called \\"gems\\" of style.All the story I found is torturer in black cloak and mask staying between various decorations. Sometimes he loses his sword. Sometimes he uses it. That's all.Only thing I don't understand is why the book is rated so high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adolescent writing.","review":"Gene Wolfe tries really hard, to write that is. He has a large vocabulary, but not much else. I've never read a writer's prose that insisted so much upon itself, but came off as the writing of an \\"aspiring\\" writer. By that I mean someone who has all the window dressing but no literary or artistic form. For example, his description is near non-existent. Plot developments happen hurriedly, one after the other, without any explanation or cohesion. It was common in the Shadow part, I only read that half, I couldn't take any more, for a climactic fight to take, at most, a paragraph. Important plot changes happen in sentences; it's like a bunch of random fantasy ideas thrown into a novel without any integration. The book is kisch. Buying this book would be like going to a store and puchasing an original Nintendo instead of a Wii. Don't waste your money or your time, please!

I discovered that even as I worship the man's work, we have VERY different tastes in fiction. This book started out very strong for me, but as soon as the Torturer, began questing I began to snooze heavily and continuously. So someone tell me, did the sun die? Did someone kill it? I am totally chagrined. Sorry Neil."},{"rating":"1","title":"I regret the time I wasted on these four books","review":"I won't go on and on (as the author did) but instead refer you to the other one-star reviews. At first I was interested in Wolfe's funereal tone and odd subject matter, but after 800 pages, I'm sorry to inform you, you won't find out whether the world got saved or not. The hope of at least a bit of plot resolution was the only thing that kept me going to the end. Don't make the same mistake I did.If you like Wolfe's books or writing for themselves, that's fine, I'm not criticizing you, but the first time reader has a right to know that many people (including many people who enjoy other difficult and demanding works) don't feel the way you do.Instead, or in addition, please read John Crowley's \\"Little, Big,\\" or Steven Erikson's Malazan books, starting with \\"Gardens of the Moon.\\" Those are also long, confusing, and demanding, but they will reward you more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare for a real treasure - this book will captivate you.","review":"I pride myself on the number of books I have read in my life, so it is with little reservation that I recommend Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun Series. He writes as only the best writers do - offering just the right amount of mystery between the lines. With any writing, too little explanation soon leaves a reader exasperated and frustrated, while too much explanation can bore a reader until he loses interest. Gene Wolfe rides that fine line between the two extremes with perfection. You cannot put his story down. What he does not spell out between lines means even more than what appears on the page. He takes command of your imagination and leaves you reeling with pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fascinating!!","review":"The Book of the New Sun, brings you into a complete and different world!!.

The main character falls in love with every single women character with no reason what so ever. His development of love is like a child smashing to action figures together while saying \\"love\\". You get less description about the women than one would get before going on a blind date. I suppose you are supposed to get some idea about their personality from the few short things they say but it does nothing for their character.Also, the author describes every dream and thought with great detail but passes over the interesting parts of the story.Have you ever met someone that really liked the sound of their own voice?

My experience with this book is just black words on white paper.The fictional world created by the author was not described in such a way as to make me feel as if I were in it, or even to make me want to be a part of it.The development of the characters was also not up to par with other novels that I typically enjoy. None of them caused me anything other than a shrug.Also, this is not a poolside or airplane read. I consider myself a bit of a word-nerd, and even I was reaching for the dictionary a little too often to figure out what the author was trying to say.This one didn't deserve a place of honor in my bookshelf.

After laboriously reading the first volume, I'm not going to waste my time reading the second one. I think one way that academics and so-called literary types make themselves feel superior is to take confusing, meandering pointless books like this, proclaim them masterpieces and then put themselves on a pedestal and say if you didn't get it, you just don't have the capacity to understand a great literary work.I see no point to this story. The adventures that Severian has meander all over the place, having no flow, no theme, no plot, and I had to really force myself to finish this book. I read over a hundred books a week, and I have read some \\"literary classics\\" that I enjoyed.

If you like your writing foggy and unnecessarily complex, this may be the book for you. Also if you like torture scenes, which I am no fan of.I hate to be so negative, but that was the case for me with this book. I tried Wolfe because F&SF; magazine so highly recommended him, because a number of authors I like (including Gaiman) recommend him, and because I liked his story in F&SF; magazine's tribute issue.

Why did James Gavin attempt to write such a biography if he had nothing new to tell his readers about Chet Baker? Mr Gavin ... don't waste our time with this regurgitated dribble.Chet Baker's life was self indulgent to the hilt. James Gavin makes Baker out to be some sort of hero. Baker was no hero; he was a pitiful lost soul who just happened to be a good musician and vocalist ... whenever he could get his act together.As for making a movie of Baker's life ... that sounds like a sure way to file for bankruptcy.This book deserves to be left on the warehouse shelf.

It's hard to know how Baker could have possibly found the time to record and perform during all the heroin, rape, arson, removal of dead bodies, marriages, divorces, swindaling, cheating and stealing that Gavin claims happened. And while it is obvious that Baker was a flawed human being, he was also a superb talent -- James Gavin seems to want to take that away from Baker as well. He uncourageously digs up and quotes every unfavorable review he can find from the 50's press that suggests Baker was a hype.Mr. Gavin's book is proof that those who can \\"do\\" and those who cannot write fiction about those who can and pass it off on the public as \\"biography.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"This biography is very well done. Mr. Gavin never tries to sensationalize Chet Baker's life and, if anything, seems at times to not care much for the trumpeter. He praises what he feels are quality works by Baker, but never hesitates to be critical of poor or money-grabbing performances. He refers often to the ethereal, emotive, less-is-more style that so endeared Baker to his fans, but likewise gives voice to opinions that Chet's ascension to fame was due more to his good looks and skin color than his talent.Gavin also looks long and hard at Baker the son, the husband, the father, the lover, the person. He frames the man as having two obsessions: dope and music, both of which depended heavily on the other. Everything else in life was secondary, with much of it merely a nuisance to Chet. Jazz and heroin were the only things that were easy for him, and he devoted every possible moment to both. Gavin does a superior job of bringing this life to focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding achievement","review":"Deep In A Dream is the story of musician Chet Baker provides the first major biography of the jazz musician, covering his impact and influence on the music scene from his emergence in the 1950s to his violent death in 1988.

You could skip this one and not have missed a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honey, I love you, even if I am a jerk.","review":"If this is not the last Badge of Honor book, it should be. Griffin has really lost his way. What could have been a good read, is a hackneyed story with characters so wooden they are unbelievable. Matt Payne comes off like a loutish 13 year old discovering sex. Nobody talks like Matt Payne or his honey, Susan. In other words, a good story has been spoiled by uninteresting characters made so by sophomoric dialogue.

I don't know how Mr. Griffin does it, but whenever I read any of his series, I just fall in love with the characters. I love the characters in this series. This book is mostly about Detective Matt Payne. He is right in the thick of all the action this time as he is working two very high-profile cases at once. One is to catch a very dangerous group of terrorists who have become bank robbers, and the other is a big case of police corruption in the Philedelphia Police Department. Matt is sent on his own to Harrisburg to pursue leads on both of these cases, and while there he discovers love in the place he leasts expects to find it.

It is nice to see that all are moving up the ladder. However, Mr Griffin needs to get some insight into the latest and greatest in law enforcement.

Also, there are cell phones, and pagers, where \\"reach out\\" has a whole new meaning. I happened to be in Philadelphia recently, and a \\"smooth\\" car was coming down the street Code 3. It was up to date, with strobes in the parking lights, and tail lights and strobes on the dash. I thought \\"wonder if the is Matthew, Jason, Peter\\" ?? Naw, they are looking for a phone.

I've never seen the effect that this product had on my polish. If not for the fact that it peeled away 3-4 different brands of polish (Revlon, Essie, NYC, and sinful), I would've just assumed it was the quality of the polish itself.

It is also stringy and chips very fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst Sally Hansen product","review":"Sally Hansen No Chip Acrylic Top Coat is definitely the worst Hansen product I've tried and may be the worst nail product I've ever used. I am on my third application, shaking the bottle gently and applying -- once on nude clean nails and twice over nail polish. In each instance, the No Chip cracked and flaked in one day. I used polish remover and tried again. I'm finally doing what I haven't done before...I'm taking this stuff back to the store and politely asking for a refund. I think if more ladies do this, instead of feeling ashamed at buying a useless product, we would end up with better products (money talks, girls)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Glass! :D","review":"After reading the horrible reviews prior, I really wanted this product to work out for me (since I already bought it). Buuuuttt... alas, ladies believe all of the 1 star comments because they are true!! lolThis top coat is beautiful upon first application. It dries fairly quickly and it makes your nails really shiny and glossy like polished glass. The creators of this coat apparently wanted it to act like glass too! The No Chip Acrylic Top Coat SHATTERS just like glass! I mean it really does ...forming many tiny cracks on your nails. Once the cracks have formed, the peices begin to fall...And then, ladies, what you have after that is the demise of your beautiful freshly done manicure.I JUST did my nails and after a couple of hours of simple tasks like typing and washing my hands, my polish is starting to look like it's taking the shape of continents.Congratulations, Sally... your No Chip Acrylic Top Coat really \\"cracks\\" me up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"polish peels off in 10 minutes","review":"I guess there is some truth to their advertising. My nail polish does not \\"chip\\", instead it peels off as one whole layer! I bought the Sally Hansen Salon Effect nail strips (awesome product, by the way) and took my friends advice to use top coat afterwards to make the strips last longer. Well I made the mistake of using SH No Chip top coat and within 10 minutes the sides of the strips started peeling away from my nails! On every finger! I'm so frustrated that I spent so much time getting my nails looking perfect and then this stupid top coat ruined it with a few minutes. I also used this top coat on my toes which just had plain nail polish on them and while the effect wasn't as bad as with the nail strips, I can still see the polish coming away at the edges on most toes. Extremely dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS!","review":"This is one of the worst products I have ever used. Just like everyone says it peels off like crazy. At first I thought it was just my nails, but nope it seems to be a common problem with everyone. It is completely useless to even use this product. It makes me wonder if they even tested this product before launching it. I mean seriously why is this even on the market. It reminds me of the peel off nail polish I would wear as a kid. Im giving it one star although, I am not even sure it deserves that."},{"rating":"1","title":"chipped within 10 hours!","review":"I bought this top coat because it says right on the packaging \\"no chip\\". I put it on before bedtime and made sure it dried completely before I went to sleep. After I woke up I folded the laundry and three nails on my non-dominant hand had the polish chipped off halfway down the nail! 50% of the nail was uncovered! From folding soft fluffy towels! I had to write a review to warn others. A coworker recommended something called Pro FX Complete 3. It's a base coat, strengthener, and top coat in one. It's been working great so far. Also, Revlon Color Stay Top Coat works pretty well too. Would give this Sally Hansen Acrylic Top Coat zero stars if I could. I generally like their products, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give zero stars if I could","review":"Within a few short hours my polish was peeling off my nails in huge chunks.

Look up, already, smile at someone, you might just change their life.A good movie that makes you think and sticks with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved Magnolia....","review":"then you will certainly enjoy this film. I found the characters engaging; and the tempo of the movie fit the storytelling so well. Some may think that this is a sad film - at times I found myself thinking the same. But truly while watching - I more often found myself relating to each excellent performance in an unexplicable way. Again if you appreciate dramatic movies that cause us to reflect upon things that we sometimes would rather not, then this is one not to miss. Each individual situation was very reality based, and the actors did a superb job in their unique portrayals of every day characters that we all know or meet in our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see brain twister film","review":"Friend invited me to screening, so got to see it before it opened. Really got me thinking about happiness, positive and negative thinking, etc. It was just the right length, and had me laughing through all of the amusing (yet poignant) moments.

And so, may be all this can happen to each one of us and we might gain some wisdom from it... And so by the time we get to breathe... we may have grown so messed up that it may not matter any more. This movie may be the biggest single pessimistic brain-abuser (I'll spare your from the F word) in the history of cinematography. As a piece of art it deserves 5 stars but I just can't ignore the bad, bitter after-taste from watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"If things are bad, they can always get worse\\"","review":"\\" Thirteen Conversations About 1 Thing\\" is like 60's French Existentialist film on Quaaludes.

How to make yourself worried and depressed in a hurry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfying","review":"I just don't quite \\"get\\" this film, nor do I see where all the positive reviews came from. The film is comprised of vignettes focused on four basic groups of characters: lawyers, office workers, cleaning ladies, and college professor. But almost nothing exciting or remarkable happens in this film, nothing that really made me wonder what would happen next or how this film would turn out. We basically start the movie with John Turturro's story of being a late to home husband with a bruise on his eye that came from some encounter a few days before then we're brisked off to McConaughey's piece about a positive man who runs into some bad luck following a sermon he gives to a man at the bar about him not ever being unhappy. The rest of the stories interweave into each other before it's all done, which is an interesting concept, but it's been done much better in other films."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 BORINGS for one movie","review":"BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING.

He has an insight into the mechanics of ancient Egyptian cosmologies, theologies, and mythologies that is both direct and free of unnecessary random (and rambling) thought. His assessments are clinical but always interesting, and his work on the El Qa'la temple site is NOT to be missed by anyone who can get their hands on IFAO's pub. Be that as it may, this short book packs a scholarly punch. All of Traunecker's hard-earned, on-site assessments of the gods of ancient Egypt -- their cults, qualities, relevance, and destinies -- can be found in rather tidy, enlightening fashion. A must-have quick reference for many of its tidbits...though Dr. Traunecker does contradict at least one or two minor points he previously asserted in some of his published work. Bottom line -- Immortals (and Immortalettes) of Ancient Egypt from one of the best pros in the business!

Each brought an interesting angle to the picture. I like how Bill Kipp added the psychological aspects into play but the high point was Tuhon Leo Gaje(Pekiti Tirsia Kali).Out of all the styles shown, Kali was the truest to combat form. It is a military art and it shows. True combat has no rules or limitations. He shows this by demonstrating how all the movement in Kali is based on the blade. We cannot truly know what a confrontation will bring but most assaults have involved weapons. While most of the techniques shown by the others were good, Tuhon Gaje tried to show just how \\"extreme\\" combat can be, which i think was the whole point of the DVD.Also, there is some good bonus material by all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Incredible","review":"I recently saw Eric Lindell live, and I was completely blown away.

This toy is a box with a lid that starts out flat but becomes a box by zipping well placed durable zippers. It is a well conceived and colorful toy that comes with dinosaurs plus the bottom of the ZipBin comes out and opens into a flat play mat with a dino habitat. Everything is then stored in the box, and there is room for other toys - more dinosaurs or trees, whatever the play session involved. It is wonderful for traveling because the child puts all the toys in the ZipBin and carries it away easily. If your child or grandchild is already dinosaur crazy, then this toy will just extend and facilitate the pretend play they are already doing - but the clean up and storage make parents very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for Dino lovers!","review":"I bought this along with the bucket of dinos for my 6 year old nephew.

I'm usually a Janis Saffell girl, but I wanted to try something different. Now I know why I'm a Janis Saffell girl. The tape was really odd. The 2 girls in the background looked like they never stepped into a gym before and Aaron was strange looking as well. The tape is a new frills, low budget, horrible music type workout. In addition to that, they are no hooks or uppercuts, which I find strange in a kickboxing workout. If you are looking for even the slightest decent music, or even a simple bit of choreography, this is not the video for you. Straight forward, boring and odd. I must have missed the boat with this one, cause I don't see what all the rage is about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Only purchase this tape if it is your first of this type of workout.

At a very low purchase price, my students have an easy to hold, light weight book. There is a short introduction that gives a brief history of the play and its early stage production, and each pages has effective glosses at the bottom to explain or define uncommon terms. While a more expensive scholarly edition provides far more front matter for those with a strong interest in Shakespeare's military history play, this Dover thrift Edition of Henry V is a marvelous place to start. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beefheart!

The annoying rhythm seems to be longer than the portions that he actually demonstrates. At one point he states that what he is \\"teaching\\" is covered in his book, that does not come with the DVD.

It never occurred to me that a synthetic wig could be dyed with a water-soluble bright red dye that bleeds bright red on my skin!!While trying it on and trying to style it, I started to sweat.

However, the theological discussion which takes place at that one meal is well worth the time watching the film. I thought the comments made by the Stranger really explained Christianity well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought","review":"This low budget, independent film provokes thought and discussion regareding the philosophy of Christianity. Although it does not answer the questions presented in depth, it certianly provides enough of an answer. The dialouge and situations hold your interest. The emotional ending is a bit heavy handed.Individuals who follow the philosophy of Jesus Christ (Christians) should definatly see this film, since this message is rarely presented in contemporary churches. Non-Christians should view it with an open mind. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Stranger","review":"Great Movie! It grabs your attention right away and keeps it.

Don't judge it by the first 10 seemingly contrived minutes. They're just setting the stage. I was entranced.

The makers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves for charging money to preach. It is nothing more than a money-making movie. It has nothing to do with the message. The movie is boring.

I'm sure glad that I didn't pay $4 at the rental store.This movie has terrible acting, choppy editing and an insipid script. I watched the first half hour of it and I couldn't take it anymore. The line from the blond haired, blue eyed Jesus in the business suit that finally sent me packing was that Jesus said that his crucifixtion and resurrection was documented outside of the bible. This is an out and out fabrication. Even the canonical gospels give four different, contradictory stories of these purported events.I would have watched the whole thing if it had been unintentially funny but it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so perfect stranger","review":"I found this film to have a very black and white, right and wrong prideful view. People are afraid to deal with uncertainty, not realizing the world is full of shades of grey can create a lot of suffering. Conflict arises when people sink their heels in and are unable to open up their minds and hearts to others.To think that one belief is better than all the rest, is cheating yourself and others. It is really an act of ego and pride, not your heart and love. Anyone who has truly experienced the love of GOD knows it is achieved with the act of letting go, relaxing. A view point that creates tension and black and white views, does not allow this.If reading this makes you feel tense and irritable, it is likely that you are reacting with pride. You are right and I am wrong. Let go. Be with GOD now by understanding we are all unique and different - and that is OK.A more perfect stranger to me is found in the movie JOSHUA.Many blessings and wishes for happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie that answers pointed questions","review":"This film created a sense of the \\"real\\".

I've listened through the album once, completely, and here is my initial opinion of the album:This album has A LOT going on! Some of the songs are very...busy. The Velvet Teen seems to be trying to be more like the postal service with Cum Laude! While that isn't such a bad things at times, some of the songs are like whoa...can I get more cowbell PLEASE? Some songs that I really liked though after my first runthrough include:False ProfitsNoi BoiSpin The Wink (JUDAH IS THE MAN!)In A Steadman SprayGyzmkidI want to say that the album starts off weak with the first 3 songs; however, weak really doesn't seem to be the correct word.

Think of it as 'Middle-School' or 'Jr. High' for Linux. Not quite a primer, but not for power-users either. This is a 4-or-5 star book for you.If you fall to either side of that spectrum, then knock-off a star or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting insights...","review":"The book is excellent for its insights, conveying what one must do for the sake of another and what he can not do, for his own humanity/thoughts. I enjoyed the book, and I couldn't put it down. The portrayal of how one man must do what is considered \\"for the greater good\\" conflicts with his own ethnics and code of honour."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book that makes you think.","review":"Robert Cormier writes in a very effective way. He tells things like they are, not as people perceive them. The way he described how Milo felt was touching. The phrase 'the innocence of evil' definitely applies here. Cormier gets into the hearts and souls of people, and shows their flaws and attributes equally and without judging them. He uses multiple narrators so he gets across both sides of the story. It shows great talent to be able to write like that because it is confusing to get the details straight, but he does a good job so his story isn't at all confusing. The way he writes, his characters have emotions and they seem more 'real'. When he kills off two of the main characters, that shows he uniqueness in his writing. The only confusing part was when the general was talking to his son inside his head. Other than that I found this book easy to read and follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"realistic theme","review":"hii am a student of a small school in good old germany. and yes of course i had to read it. in my opinion this novel is the driest book i ever read. but i think through the attacks of the taliban the story get more sense. and you can see in which ways terrorists think. so you can understand the whole background, their thoughts and feelings better as before. after all it is ok but i am sure it exists better books.

It is a balanced book as it also shows dedicated commitment on the side of those opposing terrorism. It leaves us wondering who is right. Why can't people just live peacefully? Cormier, however confuses the reader in chapter eleven. Is Mark insane or is he unable to live with the guilt he feels for sacrificing his young and innocent son in the course of his patriotism? Despite the confusion, it's still an entertaining text, but for students who are reading it as a text for their 'O' Levels these are some questions which need to be clarified so as to give students a clear picture of whats going on or are they expected to come to their own conclusions? Help Please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrorism from two points of view","review":"The book \\"After the first death\\" by Robert Cormier is about two completely different young men and an incident on a bridge concerning Terrorism. The reader is told more about the plot and gets to see things from both perspectives. From the view of the victim and from the hijackers. The book is extremely fascinating, because of the realistic and dramatic story-line, with no particular hollywood-ending. This novel was especially interesting for me to read and I was able to identify with the situation, which just as well could have happened to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"My After the First Death Review","review":"I liked this book called After the First Death. I liked this book because I think that Robert Cormier, the author, was able to present a great deal of suspense throughout the book. The plot was filled with danger and fear that sent a cold chill up my spine. I enjoyed the plot of the story so much I couldn't stop reading it. The characters were very unique, some troubled, (kids on the bus), some afraid (Kate), and some dangerous (Artkin and Miro). I loved all the descriptive words used during the story that were perfectly placed that helped me vividly visualize what was going on. I would suggest this book to someone that likes suspense. Suspense had to have been the biggest and best factor of this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A no-win!","review":"This book is highly unsuitable for teenagers in todays high school.

Really the only thing that caught my eye was when it said, \\"Miro's assignment was to kill the driver.\\" That made me think...wait a minute, maybe this book isn't that bad. But I was wrong.I first wanted to read this book because my teacher said it was about a hostage situation.

I had just recently read it for a 7th grade reading project and I found it to be very graphic, very boring at times, and poorly written. The ending is one of the most confusing endings that I have ever read. The whole book looked like it had been written in the amount of time that it took me to write this review which was about five minutes. This book had some very graphic parts, boring parts, and just cruel parts in it. I would only reccomend this book to a mature student if he/she is interested in reading it.

Anyone care to guess WHY they were so over-looked? Give you one hint: BORING! Yep, I decided to seek this album out, along with HARD ATTACK, and this album was Sominex City. Their only claim to fame was that the drummer became a Ramone, the bassist became a session dude, and the guitarist produced some Kiss albums.

Loved its pure lyricism and the ease with which Salman runs his fingers over the keys. It's really an inspiring, uplifting performance! Salman takes you on a journey from the depth of emotional tones to the lightness of the airy notes to create beauty. I experience such joy when I listen to his music. And, he compliments his sensitive interpretation by playing with such authority and energy.What's really unique about this CD is that Salman has composed and plays original cadenzas for both Concertos...since Mozart didn't write one himself. The cadenza in #25 shows his versatility as an artist and the connection he has to this piece. Mozart would be proud!

It was a cheap device used to snag the die-hard fans and new readers who might not know any better.Its hard to think of these books as anything more than a marketting tool, since all the originality and humor present in the first few books of this series had long ago been burned away. Its like Robert Asprin is just noodling around at the keyboard, tossing off ideas to fulfill a contractual obligation. There is no joy in these books at all. At best they present over-used cliches, at worst they are tedious beyond belief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading","review":"Earl Weaver reveals some of the reasons he was such a successful manager. Baseball fans can use this book to get a better understanding of the strategy behind the managerial decisions. Some of Earl Weaver's advice is admittedly questionable for the current game, so he added a 2002 epilogue to comment on his past advice. Earl Weaver was not as hot headed as was the impression from his arguments with umpires. His additude is that it was better for the manager to be thrown out of a game than to have one of his valuable players thrown out. He explains how he looked upon each decision as a type of gamble, basing the odds of success largely on past performace when a player was in a similar situation. That is why he kept and used lots of player statistics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for baseball strategists","review":"As a person who has become very interested in baseball over the past couple of years, this book is a great beginners guide for baseball strategy. Earl Weaver has been one of the greatest managers of all time and his thoughts are very valuable. Although this was written in the 80s (with an epilogue by Weaver about updating his rules), it is still perfectly applicable to todays baseball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I wish I'd checked out the reviews on Amazon before purchasing this loom. While it offers a variety of lengths, they are poorly made. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, I had problems with the pegs breaking off in the middle of my projects. Superglue does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but annoyingly brittle pegs","review":"I had great success with knitting hats on ProvoCraft's small round loom and loved the loom knitting process. These long looms, though, have caused me no end of trouble with the pegs breaking off. When I purchased them, each loom had at least one broken peg (some more than one), and I've had to Super Glue 3-4 more pegs back on since then. The last straw was when 2 pegs snapped in the middle of a project this week, forcing me to pull out all the knitting. ProvoCraft really should look into using a less brittle material for these pegs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Fun and Addictive","review":"I bought this product because of the reviews. I was hopeful, but not completely convinced that what everyone said was true. You can believe it. I've had the set for a month and created 5 scarves. We also bought the round looms at Walmart and now my husband is a hat wizard. He's made 2 and I one. It was funny watching this huge guy sitting there learning to purl.What I appreciate the most, however, is the chance to use my own creativity to create different looks. Combining colors or yarn types to make something useful and stylish. And they don't take forever to make. I advise buying a book on looming and practicing the stitches. It makes completing something without errors a lot easier.This is a pewrfect family gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Peezy - pass the yarn - perfect for beginners and young kiddos","review":"What seems like a lifetime ago, my grandmother taught me to crochet. I would spend hours and create a lopsided doily. More recently, I purchased a book on knitting, a set of hooks, and spent hours and created a lopsided doily. I picked these up, spent about four hours, and created two beautiful scarfs (despite the daughter disagreeing about my color choice) only using the included directions (which are sparse and only for a scarf).So easy a four year old can practically do it on her own! There's my sales pitch - very easy and actually works. Free patterns with directions can be found on Provocraft's website or from robertscrafts dot com.The smallest size is appropriate for an adult sized scarf. I used about 2/3rds the loom length for a youngster's scarf. The largest size would be good for a crib blanket without making separate panels."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Knifty Knitter","review":"I am the Knifty Knitter's #1 fan.

After doing a bit of research I decided to give Weleda a shot. What really decided me on Weleda is that they know where all the ingredients come from because they grow the bulk of them themselves, and source the others through fair trade. I'm glad I went with Weleda because this aftershave balm is the best I've ever used. It's not heavy, like some balms, and has a very bright, fresh scent. It is incredibly refreshing on the skin and I have had absolutely no irritation since using it. And a major bonus for me--since I really can't stand plastic containers--is that it comes in a nice glass bottle.I suggest you try it. This is the aftershave balm you've been looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"This SACD has some surround sound. Songs just not for me.","review":"Lionel Richie has made some good songs in the past such as 'Destiny', 'Love, Oh Love' and also 'I Forgot'. Listen to the 'Back To Front' album and most of you will agree with me. However, his latest album, 'Just For You', is very disappointing. The songs (tunes) are not original and are not of the quality that Lionel Richie normally delivers. There is not one song that makes an impression and that stays with you.Furthermore I am not impressed with the surround sound of this SACD. There are some obligatory surround effects but nothing special. Many surround sound super audio cd's are far better than this one. On the other hand it is nowadays more appropriate to release hybrid sacd's, because many listeners have surround sound (multi-channel) systems. That is why I do not give this sacd-album one but two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summary of product","review":"I chose this rating because it does not work any better than the charges it came with.

With the small child on the steps, the child will fall. Even when they are supervised, like we always do, sometimes we are so involved with teaching him to wash his hands, we don't even realize the child is sliding away from the sink..

The factor to consider is the ability for it to \\"slide\\" on laminate flooring.

So, the half-assembled stool has been sitting in my garage waiting for the delivery of a replacement side piece, which I received today. I had done my best explaining what was wrong to the KidKraft rep on the phone, but I still ended up receiving an incorrect side piece, so the stool is STILL sitting in my garage, doing me absolutely NO GOOD FOR IT'S INTENDED PURPOSE. Seriously, I don't have time for this kind of ridiculousness. Get your product packing right, improve your quality control, and STOP WASTING MY TIME. Because of this I will never purchase another KidKraft item, I don't care if it's the greatest product on Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"good design - horrible quality","review":"the quality of this product is horrible - \\"wooden\\" steps break when you put this thing together. Wall Mart sells items, similar to this (also crappy quality) but much cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids gained more independence","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I was unsure of what to expect of the step stool. It definitely does the job! Our counters are a little higher than most and I would catch my 2 and 3 year old climbing up and hanging on the counter's ledge to wash their hands on their own. With this step stool, the height is perfect for them to reach the sink. The stool we had before, gave them some access to the sink, but the KidKraft Two Step Stool allows them to turn the sink on (with a little \\"climb\\"), reach the soap, and wash their own hands. I also bought the Prince Lionheart 2 Count Faucet Extender to enable my kids to really learn proper hygiene techniques. After we purchased this stool, my 2 year old son actually took the initiative to become fully potty trained because he REALLY wanted to wash his own hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"The step stool doesn't line up flush against the cabinet. As my toddler leans forward over the sink the step stool moves right out from underneath him. I can't imagine why they would design a step stool this way. I would not recommend it for use on wood or linoleum floors without some other protection against sliding. At this price, you can do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"I'm shocked that a company like KidKraft that makes so many children's products would create something so silly. This step stool is just dangerous! The gap between the stool and whatever furniture you are placing it against is big enough to get a little foot caught. It is also a little steep and uncomfortable and the picture looks like you'd be able to lift the top step for storage, but it's just wasted space. I sent it back as soon as I put it together and tried it out. It's also very heavy, which I guess can be a safety feature to avoid toppling, but because of the gap it actually just made it more dangerous if it tipped over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicely crafted, but angled","review":"This stool would be perfect if it weren't angled. If you have a sink with a cabinet, the stool will not be flush against the cabinet because of the angle. Small feet can slip right through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right color","review":"The two pictures of the natural wood stool are different step stools. One is a laminate wood and one is a natural wood with thicker pieces of material and inset screws. There is no way to know what you are going to get. The one I received is basically yellow laminated plywood type. I was wanting a step stool made of solid pieces of wood and stained a classic oak color. This product is not as pictured, it is correctly described in the text. If anyone goes to the Kidkraft.com web site and clicks on \\"Buy Online\\" the first item in the search list comes up on Amazon. Be warned the item pictured on KidKraft.com is not what Amazon is selling. The stool is not horrible, just not what I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy and with a weird gap","review":"This stepping stool is VERY heavy. It also creates a weird gap between the front of the top step and whatever it is pushed against. Not a very good use of space. Also, not for use with a toilet because it puts the child too high to then sit down on the toilet. Perhaps best used to wash hands and things of that sort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my 3yr old.","review":"Love the extra height!

Prior to this stool, he would go to the restroom himself but we would still have to go in and wash his hands. Now he is completely independent. The steps tool is easy to put together and sturdy. We have bathroom rugs so I have no problems with it tipping or sliding. I bought one for my upstairs and one for downstairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional, serves purpose","review":"This is recommended for kids ages 3 and up, but I could not find a step stool tall enough for my 2 y.o. that was \\"safe\\" for kids over 2. We needed a taller stool for her to wash her hands as we are finally having success in potty training but the previous stool we had was way too short. This definitely makes hand washing easier. We keep this in the bathroom and do not move it from room to room. Incidentally, my 16 mo old loves to get up on it when her older sister is going potty and make faces in the mirror. While I would not be comfortable with the little one getting on and off the stool w/o me in the room, while I'm there, it's fine. There is a bit of a gap in that the stool is not flush with the cabinet under the sink. I don't see it as a huge problem but I would have preferred the back to be straighter instead of slanted.

I did not like the movie at all. If I weren't already a born-again Christian, there would be nothing in this movie that would lead me in that direction. It seemed like a lot of big-named gospel and secular singers were trying to get in the limelight in this movie. There was so much confusion that you couldn't tell where one scene ended and began.

I don't believe Feig is relating exactly what he was feeling at the time, but rather is seeing his early years through the lens of tv/movie screenwriter; young feig's take on the situations he was in is just too sophisticated, and his mental riffing that would pass muster in a stand-up comedy club kind of takes you out of the moment.

(But am I wrong to doubt that the author could really start having orgasmic experiences at age 7?) The biggest problem is that the germ obsession sets the author apart from the typical geek, who would have gladly braved a little [spoiler warning here] puke breath to make out with a cute girl, and way too many of the experiences described in the book deal with that phobia. There are 2-3 laugh out loud passages, 6-8 cleverly turned phrases, but they don't make up for the laborious redundancies - Bill, we get it about the rope, enough with the \\"25 foot lover\\" references, the repeated return to the mincing descriptions, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the things that could break a mere boy","review":"but Paul Feig was no mere boy.

However, I love it for its rough edges and simplicity and it makes an interesting companion piece to the first official Taste album. The progression in Gallagher's guitar playing is remarkable.

Rory's playing is reserved on this album, since he was only about 19, and the demo was done in 1968, but it's still very good, even if he does some covers. You won't find all the dazzling solos Rory was famed for, but it's still solid, unpretentious, and honest music, and thank god someone snuck a copy of this demo out of the studio years later.

More $$$$Look for a printer with print head cartridges (a LOT of HP's are like this) the cartridge cost is usually a bit more than inkwell one's BUT they do not SELF cleanand waste ink, so in the long run it costs you less, also each time you do have to replace a cartridge you get a new print head.........The reason I \\"picked on\\" Epson is: I read somewhere that they were trying to stop after market print cartridges.

Is there some secret to cleaning that I don't know about?I feel the least Epson could have done was make it so one could clean only the print heads that are clogged, not all 8 whether they need it or not.

I have gotten very nice pictures and scrpabook pages -- 6 pages to be exact. The problem is that if you don't use it on a daily basis, you need to clean the print heads every time you want to use it. This wastes tons of ink. I have printed exactly 6 12 * 12 scrapbook pages before all my ink run out. This is an expensive proposition when you take into account the cost of the cartridges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware! this book may make you fall off you chair laughing.","review":"Lady slings the Booze is full of one-liners and puns! So if you can't take it, stop reading. Lady Sally aka wife of Mike Callahan stars in this one - and she is out to save the world. With the help of some very talented 'artists' in her employ she goes about it. The book twists and turns and there is no guessing the end. I was surprised it ended so abruptly. I've read many of Spider Robinson books both in and out of the 'Callahan' series and I love them. It doesn't matter where you start. I frequently had to stop reading and put the book down just to laugh at the the author's thought processes(and pun-usage). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"I personally enjoyed Robinson's books, but then again, they appeal to my somewhat immature personality. This book seemed, granted, to have been Robinsons attempts to intergrate a more direct line of plot into his story. While odd, it was very entertaining, and shocking, for this was the first \\"Lady Sally\\" novel I had read, and I read it 3 years ago, in 7th grade. My dad bought the books because he is a monster book freak. Soon after reading the second Lady Sally book, he dropped his interest in Robinson's work, which is unfortunate for me because there are still easily $100 of books I have to buy, in addition to a replacement for this particular book.Please buy this book. Robinson wrote a very funny piece of literature. I urge you to buy the other books as well. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish","review":"Gave up at around 150 pages. I received a copy of Christopher Moore's \\"Island of the Sequined Love Nun\\" that I ordered from Amazon. \\"Scipio\\" was at best interesting, and usually boring, so I had no hesitation to put it down to pick up the Moore book. Keep in mind, however, that Christopher Moore is a favorite of mine, and I just knew his book would fun, and \\"Scipio\\" just wasn't holding my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beyond boring","review":"Perhaps if Pears had attempted to write a novel with characters and ideas to hold the reader's interest instead of attempting a graduate thesis, this might be something one would wish to read. As it stands, it is a major disappointment, intellectually pretentious, and signifies nothing. It is also about time we stop trying to compare these also-rans with Umberto Ecco's Name of the Rose which still towers over all newcomers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I found nothing gripping about this story, unlike author's previous work. Others indicate that there is a reward here, and there may be, but I couldn't stay interested long enough to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Well Done","review":"The Dream of Scipio is an extremely well done novel--a challenging read involving three different characters at three different points in history. All are in the same French town, and each one affects the characters who exist after them. The story flows marvelously, moving seamlessly from one historical period to the next. The three main characters are concerned with, and perhaps obessessed with making morally correct decisions in an seemingly immoral world. Each lives in a time when tremendous calamities of historical consequences were occuring around them and all over Europe. The decisions they make are not easy and the later characters look for guidance to a writing by the Manlius, the first of the characters. The Dream of Scipio is a highly interesting read, on that I enjoyed immensely. If you are not afraid of a philisophically grounded novel, pick this one up. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"One of my favorite books. It may take a few pages to get used to the unique style of the prose and the format of the plot; but it is well worth your patience. It is refreshing to see such a high degree of talent, effort and skill combined in a contemporary novel. Iain Pears respects his audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb novel, worthy of \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\"","review":"\\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" set an exceptionally high standard, but this work is a highly worthy successor. Pears weaves a gripping account of the plight of three sets of lovers in very different time periods, but facing comparable dilemmas. Fifth-century Gaul, fourteenth-century Provence and twentieth-century France provide the backgrounds for the characters struggle with the issues of personal ethics, civic duty and personal desire.The issue of anti-Semitism also provides a common thread. There is a healthy dose of neo-platonic philosophy in the background, but Pear's exposition is so masterful that no trepidation on the part of the reader is necessary.This novel was spellbinding and, ultimately, deeply moving. A masterful piece of fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't do it....","review":"I've read Fingerpost, and all the Art History Mystery books, and loved them all, but I just could not get into this one. Other reviewers have said it is worth fighting through, but I just don't have the time or the inclination! This one didn't grab me. Stick to his series."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just so different from his other books","review":"I've read Iain Pears' art history mysteries and thought Dream would be similar, with perhaps a dash of Da Vinci Code thrown in. I just couldn't get into the book, but then I'm not the intellectual type who enjoys philosophy. It's likely that if you admire Jonathan & Flavia you won't like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal and Depressing","review":"Reading the first few pages of this book was enough for me. Page five offers, \\"Thus bagan the tale of the doomed love between he poet and a young girl that was to lead to such a calamitous and cruel ending.\\"Life is calamitous and cruel enough without needing to tell these tales in the cold and precise way of Iain Pears. I read on because I was given the book as a gift and felt I might need to discuss it with my friend. I found the same shallowness (little character developement), interest in cruelty and lack of humanity throughout.I can certainly understand that there are plenty of people that go for this kind of writing. I am writing this review so that it may save a few kinder minds the trouble of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, dull","review":"Iain Pear's new book has the sound and the feeling of one of those lectures that a professor has delivered a hundred times. There is page upon page of tedious exposition. The characters never come to life. He wasn't able to disgest his research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"After Fingerpost I looked forward to The Dream of Scipio. What a disappointment. This latest oeuvre is tedium heaped upon tedium, padding piled upon padding; a book only too easy to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"$12.99 for an old paperback?","review":"I nice used copy of this goes for two bucks. Publishers need to get a grip - people will not pay that kind of premium for the convenience of a digital edition of an old paperback book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be joking.","review":"Sophomoric meandering drivel covered with a patina of tinny allusions drawn from a very shallow reading of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, thought-provoking","review":"I know, I know, when you say \\"insightful and thought-provoking\\" it sounds like telling your friend his blind date is \\"a great dancer and has a wonderful personality.\\" In other words, a schnauzer. But for someone willing to put thought and energy into thinking about what he or she is reading, and who appreciates the extraordinary skill and forethought required to produce this, it's a real find you won't put down, I find I enjoyed this slightly less than \\"Instance of the Fingerpost,\\" which is why it only got four stars instead of five, but it's a masterpiece nonetheless. I was at the store the day it went on sale, bought it in hardback and glad I did. Don't take it to the beach; save it for a long read in a comfortable chair and a healthy pitcher of your favorite beverage nearby."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can just get through the first 100 pages...","review":"... then you'll probably get through the whole book. But it is tedious, pedantic, and utterly lacking in engagement. By the time the book ended, I had finally become interested in two of the three main characters, but really wish I just hadn't read it at all. The best thing about it is the beautiful cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One's View of Events Depends on One's Context","review":"Apparantly inspired by a short story of Borges (on the rewriting of Don Quixote), we view the quest of four individuals living centuries apart, albiet each in a time of social and political chaos, to determine life's purpose. The initial slow read occasioned by the need to come to grips with the several different sets of characters proves well worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment after the last book","review":"After *An Instance of the Fingerpost,\\" this was a huge letdown. I couldn't make myself finish it. After the organic flow of the structure of the former, the forced architecture of *Dream* intruded into the narrativ and became an unwanted extra character."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot is going nowhere","review":"I admire history and philosophy. I have an excellent knowledge of the Roman history, and love the times of Medieval Europe, but the book has disappointed me so dearly, that I was thinking to leave it on the shelf unread. I am struggling with reading despite reachness of language (1 star) and interesting characters (2nd star). But the way the plot (what plot?) is constructed, and the story is followed, the book is uninteresting and one stops caring about heros and heroines, and looks for something else to be hooked on. I could not find so far anything exciting, and maybe this novel should not be treated as a beach reading, I thought, I would have been smitten at least by historical landscape and philosophical mystery. I dare to say, you won't find any of that stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I see that I am not the first to say what I am going to say but I wish I had not paid so much attention to the early reviewers. I don't know what book they were reading but it could not have been The Dream of Scipio. This book is a big boor. I made it to page 111 before I concluded that it never was going to get better. How could anyone have thought that this book: without clear direction (except perhaps for Classics scholars), with uninteresting pseudo intellectual characters saying pithy things,and with three stories vying with themselves for the must tedious was worthy of more than one or two stars? Not me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A study in human nature","review":"The writer was able to deliver a progretion of historical events via a story. The human nature was on display for good or bad, very accurately. I was delighted with the book and recomend it as good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous but demanding","review":"This is not light summer reading. It is a fascinating historical novel that subtly sheds light on the continuum of Jews as the world's scapegoats, while also broadening the issue to make the reader ponder their own actions in life. How important is it to remain true to your values? Is it better to do what you feel is morally right or what can be coldly calculated will turn out well? Reminds us that history is subject to interpretation and reinterpretion. Highly recommended for the read as well as the questions it poses. A very unusual book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of brain :-)","review":"Pears turns in yet another twisting, turning, thought provoking narrative in several voices. If you read \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" you will not be disappointed with how the author handles incredibly detailed understanding of history with power and immediacy for a current audience. However, be forewarned that the key issues in play are civilization and philosophy, not \\"whodunit.\\"The plot involves a Provencal poet, a Roman aristocrat, the Vichy government, a troubled academic, Papal conspiracies, the Black Death, barbarian kings, forgotten Siennese painters -- oh, it's terrific.So why 4 stars? The narrative here is third person, amd maybe a bit less engaging than the first-person testimonials in \\"Fingerpost.\\" Against anyone else, Pears deserves a 5. Against himself, this should maybe be a 4.5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic interpretation driven by political agenda","review":"Burke's interpretation of military institutions is driven by her idea of how today's military needs to change. Rather than delving deeply into gender, folklore, and military culture as the title proclaims and which she is presumably trained to do as an English professor, she shallowly and aimlessly grazes over a handful of topics. If you are interested in the subject read Cynthia Enloe. At least she adds some complexity to her arguments."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time and money","review":"I must first apologize to anyone who has purchased this book in the past three months. If I had written this upon finishing Burke's diatribe perhaps I could have saved you some of your hard-earned money.My time is limited, so I will simply say that Ms. Burke distorts reality beyond recognition; portraying the marginal as the typical.

Mandarin Mint is no exception... however... once refrigerated, the taste was fairly decent. The \\"mint\\" flavor is drowned out by the taurine, but on the other hand they almost cancel each other out - which is pretty much a *good* thing. And the \\"mandarin\\" flavor is supposed to be a little more bitter than typical \\"orange\\" flavoring, so it does a good job of masking the remaining taste.

The author doesn't capture the voice of the characters nearly as well as some of the other contributors, and some items are just wrong (e.g., especially in this Season 3 chronology, Buffy doesn't drive.) The dialogue is lame, with Buffy occasionally sounding like Giles, Anya never sounding like Anya, and a villian that doesn't even acheive the insightful repartee of your cheesy comic book. Try Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder for far superior characterizations and voices that \\"get\\" the Buffy tone.3. The story, which had potential in theory, is just plain lame in execution.

Not only does 'United' contain the instant classics of 'Too Young' and Summer Days' as featured in the film, but as other reviews have mentioned,every track is a winner. A fine example where less is more... Oh if only Smashing Pumpkins had done the same with Mellon Collie..., it could have been one of the best albums of the 90's. Anyway I digress. Back to the vangaurd of the new wave retro French pop that is bubbling up here Down Under. DaftPunk, very innovative. Tahiti 80 are very similar to Phoenix and their album is definitely in the same vein as United. Sublime, exquisitely crafted pop music.Bottom line, if you love tight catchy songs,listen and love one of the best releases of.... 2000. Well it took a while to reach me, but it was worth it. Hope you love it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant American Music, From A Euro Band","review":"This CD is amazing. The disc, is very short, sadly.

They go to the Clovia Hotel, a favorite with Renie and her husband, and while there they meet Marie, a girlhood friend who was a professional dancer and is now married to Max, a famous producer. Marie asks her old friends to join her and her friends who are all luminaries in the theater. Early in the book there is a murder, and Marie and her friends are the chief suspects. Judith, of course, feels that she is better qualified to solve the case than are the local police investigators. She and Renie follow several red herrings and pursue the pasts of each of their eight companions, with sometimes disastrous, sometimes hilarious results. This is a pleasant \\"cozy\\" for those who enjoy the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't read another one !","review":"I bought this book after noticing it rated 5 stars from someone that i had noticed had read and felt the same way about other books that i really liked. Thankfully I didn't read the first one (it was not liked at all). But 5 stars ? I forced myself to read the whole thing, it is a thin book, waiting for it to get better and it just never did. The characters were overly quirky but at the same time weakly developed. The was no one to cheer for or identify with. I love reading and like nothing more than to sink myself into a good book.

And ignore the phrase \\"first collection\\" if it suggests a lack of depth and maturity, Kaufmann's work spans several countries expertly using setting to reflect themes and his writing touches on topics from McCarthyism to modern urban angst in a way that reflects each era he selects. He entertains Baby Boomers and their children with equal ease.\\"The Jew of Prague\\" alone makes this book worth reading. Like all the stories in this collection, it's complexity and depth are the subtext of a compelling tale. The reader constantly wants to know what happens next.Most of these stories have (unfortunately) appeared previously in small niche markets cheating Kaufmann out of the wide readership his works deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful images","review":"I like the beautiful photos of the Japanese gardens shown in this book.

To me, two stems of Casablanca lilies by themselves in a vase (page 95) is not an arrangement worthy of two pages in a book. There was not one arrangement in the pages that I found to be anything other than leaves or sticks in a pot or jar.

This book is timeless in its applicability. It covers all types of spam very nicely, and is acutely aware of the potential speech-related issues content-based filtering can bring about.This book offers many options for combatting spam on the user and system levels, and makes sure to present the best way to stop spam: by teaching responsible system administration and shutting down open mail relays and public NNTP servers that allow posting.I have had to admin mail and news servers for clients in the past, and I personally receive about 30 pieces of unwanted email daily. I've been particularly interested in the Procmail-based \\"friendly sender database\\", and the book presents the solution in a clear, concise fashion.If you're tired of receiving more spam than real email, or having to really look hard for high quality, on topic postings in your newsgroups, then I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No userful information","review":"Yes, ORDB does recommend this book for server administrators with open relay.

Better still, each \\"game\\" within this has 3 levels of difficulty, so the game will grow with his skill. The graphics and story line and animation are perfect, just enough to keep his interest and help him through the game, but not so much that you spend all your time watching rather than playing.

I was about to ask my dentist to preform whitening on me as I was so discouraged.I am an avid tea drinker with veneers so my smile was just starting to look a bit on the tarnished side. I however didn't want crazy glowing white teeth. This little system works nicely so that you can whiten a little bit at a time. And it is true that it whitened on the first use.I agree with other reviewers that the mouth peice is a bit uncomfy for small mouths. It is gummy and if you clamp down on it for all 5 minutes your jaw will start to hurt just from the fatiuge.Anyway, it works and if you want to whiten your teeth just a bit or a whole bunch this product is a great alternitive to having your dentist do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for sensitive teeth","review":"I have sensitive teeth so wearing Crest white strips for 30 minutes makes my teeth ache very badly.

It says 5-minutes on the box, but you can do one treatment for up to 20 minutes if you have badly stained teeth. I don't; I just want whiter teeth! Anyway, I follow the directions with one EXCEPTION that I learned from MakeUpGeek.com: dry your teeth off with a tissue before you insert the tray. I learned that the gel would adhere better to dry teeth--works with my logic--and I have experienced good results. I don't do it twice a day, per the instructions, but even with once a day I have seen great improvement. I am actually afraid of doing it to the point where I get a mouth like Ross from Friends!

I decided to give teeth whitening myself a try, and this product is the first I tried and I noticed almost immediately that the deep yellowness was no longer there. This was a couple of weeks ago. My teeth did not get bright white, but they're definitely not yellow anymore. People now tell me that my teeth don't look bad at all.

So try your local $.99 Cent Store for this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't be happier with this product!","review":"After years of smoking, tea, and coffee I needed some serious whitening but was not willing to spend a small fortune at the dentist's. Plus White delivers what it promises! I have been using it for 2 and 1/2 weeks now and my teeth are noticeably whiter and brighter. And no sensitivity!! That was the best part, especially since I do tend to have sensitive teeth and it was very surprising to see that this did not aggravate it at all.The *only* complaint I have about this product is that the tray is too small for my teeth. I have an overbite and my teeth are not dainty so in order to cover my teeth fully I resorted to using a Q-Tip to smear gel onto the portions of my teeth uncovered and really push my jaw forward. Not comfortable, but hey, it's only for 10 minutes a day. And the ends totally justify the means! I love it, and it's 1/3 of the price of White Strips!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"A dental assistant recommended Crest strips but when I saw the price I jumped. I decided to try Plus White. It has been 8 days and my teeth have lost that yellowy tinge it had from all the coffee, coke and tea I drank daily. I will recommend this product to anyone. Just make sure you follow the directions and use just a little of the gel on the mouthpiece as using too much will spread to the gums which will hurt and become sensitive. My gel was thick which meant that I could apply it to my teeth directly by a cotton swab and open wide for the same result without using the mouth tray. For the price, it is definitely a great product. Can't wait to see the final results. Not sure about the negative reviews.

It hurt so much and when i took it off on area where my tooth and gum were was completely white! My gum was white and I looked diseased! I was so scared but my mom said it was most likely plaque that the gel stuck onto when i applied it that made it look that way. It honestly just burns to much.

Its tropical cocktail of salsa, reggae, rap and disco was indeed way over the heads of listeners back in the early 80s; though well-received critically it didn't register a blip on the public consciousness. It's a wildly imaginative concept album with bold Latin horn arrangements. Just try to find anything equal to the surging horn charts in \\"With A Girl Like Mimi\\" in pop music today. The playful, rhyming chorus of \\"I Am\\" would set the charts on fire if re-released as a single today (the dated Ayatollah reference notwithstanding).

It is an exceptional book of insight into this disorder, and an incredible biography of an incredible peer of the baby boomer generation! And a MUST after reading Patty Duke's (Anna) autobiography is to read her sequel which gives even more encouragement that those of us with any mental disorder are \\"not freaks\\" but can live healthy, functional lives and be of great help to our whole society. The sequel is \\"A Brilliant Madness\\" also by Patty Duke and Gloria Hochman, originally published by Bantam books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fascinating...","review":"This is quite possibly the most fascinating autobiography ever written. Say what you will (and I see that many reviewers here have!) about Patty Duke's behavior before her diagnosis of bipolar disorder; it made for a damn fine story! From her bizarre childhood as an actress through three failed marriages, Patty Duke's account of her life story is riveting. There is so much to this book that I have read and re-read it countless times, and I am never less than enthralled. If you can't handle some salty language, leave this book alone, but it'll be your loss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Journey, Not the Destination","review":"The miracle of it all is that Patty Duke has emerged from all her troubles as a kind and generous person. Obviously a talented actress, she is also willing to reveal parts of her life that few of us would even want our closest confidants to know about. Her path has not been an easy one but it's an inspiring tale for others battling manic depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call Me Anna","review":"No wonder the book shipped in 2 days. I know it's an old book, but the cover was more than \\"shelf worn\\" as described! Had coffee rings on the dust jacket the book/spine was dirty and worn. Won't shop here again for a \\"new book\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call Me Anna","review":"I have always liked Patty Duke. I went to see her do a personal interview for publicity for one of our Community Theatres here in Spokane, Wa. She was very inspiring and told about some of the terrible things she had done before she was diagnosed and mentioned this book. Found it on Amazon's website and purchased it. Very interesting read about her terrible childhood living with her agents at the time. Anna lives in our community and loves her life here. She is still active in some of our theatre productions in the surrounding area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks alot","review":"Definitely read it. It's interesting. But this book is detrimental to public perception of manic depression, no matter how well Ms Duke meant by writing this book and then allowing the movie version. Yes, bipolar causes us (yeah, I have it too) to do some pretty dramatic things that look great and dramatic in books and movies. It gets attention and craziness sells. But as a person living responsibly with controlled bipolar, I can't appreciate this book or the film that followed it. The insurance company that refused to cover me must have seen it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most touching and inspirational book I've ever read","review":"This book has to be one of the best autobiographies ever written. Anna Marie Duke is so brutally honest and sincere in her writings that gives the book such appeal. It was the only book I have read that made me laugh and cry all the while educating, touching, and inspiring me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look inside a bipolar mind","review":"This provides an excellent first-hand account of what it is like to live with the powerful destructive and wonderfully creative aspects of Bipolar Disorder. It also reinforces the importance of appropriate, early diagnosis and treatment.Sheryl Gurrentz, authorIf Your Child is Bipolar"},{"rating":"2","title":"Call Me Anna by Patty Duke","review":"The book was very well written. The language was a bit harsh at times but that was the life that Patty lived in. I would recomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching to tell time essential!","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend's daughter, because I work in an after-school program for middle school students and most don't know how to tell analog time. It just so happened this was getting on my nerves when I spotted this wonderful toy. And apparently, my friend's daughter LOVES it! She said she could hardly put it down for days, and it may get a little annoying as it will keep talking to get the child's attention. Overall, she seems really pleased with it though (both mom and daughter), so I recommend it for the younger kids , about 3-6 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"still plays with it","review":"I bought this a couple years ago for my niece/nephew & when I go to their house, they still have it out & use it. durable, cute and good learning tool"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"We brought this for a four year old boy who typically loves toys that are fast and noisy. He loves playing with this clock even though he has to move the parts, which I, as a parent, love. I was concerned about previous reviews which indicated the sounds could not be turned off and were too loud. This isn't the case. As a matter of fact you can select a \\"shhh\\" sound when the clock chimes on the half hour. My son has been enjoying it; he hasn't lost interest, he is learning to tell time and the concepts of past, present, and future, which a digital clock alone can't teach. It is sturdy, portable, and though a little pricey, does the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work at all.","review":"I purchased the Fun-2-Learn Teaching Clock for my grand-daughter and was deeply disappointed. The clock did not function as a teaching clock. The alarm would never shut off and the music never stopped. Not a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible experience!!!","review":"I would not recommend purchasing anything from AmericaRX which is where I received this toy from. It came damaged and then took me 4 weeks of constant phone calls to their Customer Service department to get a return lable to send the product back. Now lets see how long it takes me to get a credit back on my account. Very disappointed in this whole experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DRIVES ME NUTS. It won't turn off!!!","review":"I bought this for my niece as a birthday present and her parents actually gave it back to me!!! They said it chimes constantly on the hour and they can't turn it off! I'm finding the same problem. I've put it on the lowest volume and basically stuck it in my daughter's dresser. This toy would otherwise be a great learning tool...if we can at least control it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson loves it!!","review":"Bought this for my 4 year old Grandson who is very interested in learning how to tell time. \\"Tock\\", the smaller clock, shows the current time in digital. You can move the hands on \\"Tic,\\" the big clock, and it tells you the time that you set it for. It plays music & games that need to be completed before the time runs out. There is a \\"shhh\\" mode on it to keep it quite, or you can have animal sounds or music play at the top & bottom of the hour. We keep the sound shut off so it doesn't disturb us at night. \\"Tic\\" tells you the time in 2 different ways. ie: 2:25 or 25 minutes after 2. ie: 5:35 or 25 minutes to 6. etc. Very happy I bought this as a fun way to learn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"We just purchased this clock for our 4 year old and are very disappointed in it. The games and other teaching features are just okay, but the part I really hate, is that it can't be turned off. The chime that goes off, every half hour or hour is set by a blue button on the upper right corner, that the kids press all day long. It has four sounds, a chime, a cow mooing, a rooster crowing and silent. The problem is that the kids play with it and it gets left of the annoying cow or rooster sound and then goes all night. I thought I had the answer to this by making sure it wasn't in my sons room at night, but then I could hear it from the family room all the way in my room! I was so tired and mad that I put it outside in the backyard until I could take the batteries out the next day. I am shocked that this toy has such good reviews and just wanted other parents to be aware of this annoying feature. If I had know about this, I would not have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Idea - Poor Construction","review":"I was really disappointed when this showed up. The first one arrived broken. The second one was so loud, even on the \\"low volume\\", we had to put tape over the speaker. Took 15 minutes just to \\"program\\" it with the correct time. Then, as another reviewed noted, the darn thing can't be shut off. Half the night you hear it making animal sounds and chiming noises. What idiot designs these things? I find it confusing in the manner in which it attempts to teach time, and will have to find something better. Very little thought went into this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"it doesn't work when it arrive my home","review":"When I open the box,get it out, nothing works. I thought it needs battery, so I open it. I found batteries are there, but they run out of power.

Was a little disappointed that they were cast with round holes in the top rather than the hex style seen from other vendors.

She puts a good sentence together and has a good eye for human foibles. Unfortunately, none of this makes her a good novelist. This book was not in the slightest compelling. The main character was too cliche to be interesting and the other characters drawn too superficially to be interesting either. Much of the book centered around her crazy love for an unlikely type -- unfortunately, we never had any idea what she liked about him. Or him about her. The plot? It was more like a three-sentence pitch for a movie. The writing: adept. I hate not finishing books once I've started them but this one was hard to trudge through. About half way through I started skimming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"This book is mean and not particularly interesting after the first 50 pages. The characters are cartoonish, the situations contrived, the humor at the expense of others. I enjoy Daum's essays and had looked forward to reading this novel. She should stick with essay-writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I recieved The Quality of Life Report as a gift recently, I usually don't read this type of book(mystery and horror for me), so I started this book with a not very open mind.I'm not gonna tell you what the book is about,you can read the book description for that :). But I will tell you that this book is worth reading. It's very entertaining, and will keep your attention. There are quite a few humorous points, that I snickered at, and had to explain to my boyfriend why.Like all books there were a few points that could have been omitted, and others that drag on a little to long. But all in all this was a well written book. I defintely reccommend The Quality of Life Report, and will be passing along my copy to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"The Quality of Life Report is a quick, easy, and worthwhile read. It isn't especially deep or meaningful, making it a great choice for the beach or poolside.Although I have lived in the midwest my entire life, reading this book made me realize that I, like Lucinda, have always considered myself better than my surroundings. Having said this, I can relate to Lucinda's getting drawn into some of the local traditions. Meghan Daum does portray an accurate picture of a Midwestern community, albeit condescending and stereotypical. I will admit to baking my skin in a tanning bed, getting acrylic nails, and knowing more than one person with a meth habit. Come to think of it, I have also seen women holding hands in our local Wal-Mart. Read this book for some humor, just don't expect too much out of the story and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Easy Summer Read","review":"This is a light and easy read for Summer. I enjoyed reading about the character, Lucinda and her experiences with life in the heartland. Perfect book to bring to the beach or for when you just want to let your mind wander a little. I enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Letdown","review":"I loved the essays in Ms. Daum's first book, My Misspent Youth, so I was expecting something infinitely smarter and funnier that the flimsy chick-lit fluff-fest that is Quality of Life Report. Totally surprising in it's awfulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off good, but went downhill&#65533;","review":"Lucinda Trout, a New York TV producer on an assignment in the Midwest, falls in love with little Prairie City. The reason she has been originally sent there is to examine the huge meth problem they seem to have. Otherwise, Prairie City seems like your typical Midwestern town, although it does seem to have an excess of lesbians. That aside, the Lucida you meet at the beginning of the book is bored with her life, and wants to change it. She convinces her bosses that she should live in Prairie City for a year and sent \\"Quality of Life Reports,\\" back home to show New Yorkers what life is like. Somehow that Lucinda from the beginning of the novel quickly finds herself with a house in the middle of nowhere, an irritating boyfriend, and his three children (from three different women) who float in and out of their lives. By the end of the book I really wanted to just slap the main character across the face! Not a recommend read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably Funny","review":"I know it sounds cliche, but I literally could not put this book down. I annoyed all my friends and family members by reading pages of it during breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. Maybe it's because I'm a New Yorker, but Daum seems so dead-on about finding the humor in so many of life's little absurdities. Yet all the while, she manages to convince the reader that Luncinda Trout is in fact a real character, with a real emotional investment in what has become her new life.This book will resonate with anyone who has ever had to make a major life transition, whether by choice or neccesity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This book was interesting, although I had a hard time understanding why the main character made most of the choices she did. It was quite difficult to establish what drove this woman to move to the middle of nowhere, pick up a loser boyfriend, and quit caring about her own life. But it was a very good read, nicely paced. Definately recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daum can do better","review":"Meghan Daum has proven in her essays she knows how to be funny, insightful, lyrical, interesting. \\"The Quality of Life Report,\\" however, fails to be any of those things. Once the character Lucinda Trout leaves New York, the book becomes less interesting and a cliche of midwestern life, with only minorly interesting observations. One expects to find corncob pipes in the pockets of the one-dimensional characters Daum's written.The book is mean spirited rather than funny and is not believable (why is she living with that guy??). The potential was there for the book to be an interesting self exploration by the main character but instead dissolves into a predictable Lifetime movie of the week. And why, for the love of God, does Daum spend so much time mentioning that bowl from Pier 1???"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"The worst thing about this book is not that it indulges in stereotypes. The worst thing is not that the prose leaves much to be desired. The worst thing is not the condescension. The worst thing is not the \\"witty\\" conversational rejoinders that sound like the tired one liners that a hack comedian has been using for years (and that Daum must have been carefully compiling). No, the worst thing is that it's boring and predicatable. Despite the attempt to give the story a dramatic \\"twist,\\" it just falls flat. There's no real plot. There's no drama. Snore. Yawn. ZZZZZZ. Maybe the problem is that the author tried to mine too much of her own experience, not realizing that real life isn't always that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to a fun, dream of open space and country life made reality for a city girl: I got this. However, the main character is really disappointing, shallow and not well developed by the author. Lucinda is not a very likeable character: she decides to move out in the country in the middle of nowhere, yet she criticizes everything about the people and the place. She is there to work, yet we only learn about something like 3 work-related projects she does in the whole book which covers something like 2 years and she seems to spend her time doing nothing. She is not a reliable friend, she uses her acquaintances for her own purpose and after what her experience in Prairie City has been, I wonder why she stays.Overall it's a very disappointing book. If you're looking for mere entertainment, you have it, but don't look for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The lively writing in the first few pages caused me to buy this book. Two-thirds of the way through I closed it and tossed it onto the pile of library donations. The people in this story are surely stereotypes, but they made me (who spent her first 40 years in New York City and worked in several publishing houses) really uncomfortable. Enough dysfunction already. Ick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome summer read","review":"I got the book and read it in record time. It is an excellent summer read. I found myself wanting to reach out to Lucinda and wanting to spend some time with the interesting characters. I would recommend this book for a book club as it is a quick read. Meghan Daum has become a new favorite author of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few books about the real Midwest","review":"As a peripatic Midwesterner who has lived in many places, I'm a little touchy about fictional representations of the heartland. Most urban authors paint Midwestern folks either in peeling whitewash (portraying them as illiterate, inbred yokels) or else in circus colors (creating humorous, folksy characters full of unintentional homespun wit to amuse and delight patronizing readers).Meghan Daum chooses a far more difficult and rewarding path--she writes supporting characters full of contradictions. The 90,000 \\"government employees, farmers, academics, insurance salesmen, and assembly-line workers\\" (etc.) are variously shallow, insightful, generous, and oblivious, just like real Midwesterners--or people from any other region, for that matter. Definitely pick up this book if you want to read about real people in a real (or realistic, at any rate) Midwestern small city."},{"rating":"2","title":"A High Quality Read","review":"THE QUALITY OF LIFE REPORT was a lot of fun. The humor was outrageously funny and the transition the main character undergoes is unforgettable. The novel also had a ring of emotional authenticity to it which most authors miss in their writing. Daum is obviously plugged into her subject matter, and I'll look forward to reading more of her works in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great summer read!","review":"I couldn't put this book down! Although it drags at times, it's impossible to resist reading on to find out what's going to happen in the end. Meghan Daum is a gifted author who really has a way with words. I think that most young women can relate to the main character, Lucinda Trout, in one way or another, whether it's making bad choices about men or trying to find yourself in today's fast-paced world. The characters are almost too realistic. Overall, it's a good book worthy of checking out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No one can hear me on this headset","review":"I have two of these models.

If there was a zero option I would use it!My problem is the constant turning on & off of the headset. The slightest pressure turns the headset on or off or worse yet dials the last person you called over and over and over again. My brother had to turn his phone off one night because over a dozen calls were made by my phone becasue the bluetooth headset redialed. This was with the heaset sitting on the counter next to the phone without anything touching it.Because of that I have not used the headset in over a month and left it uncharged.

For me, this one lacked comfort. Maybe it's the shape of my ear, but it just never felt sturdy on my ear. Switching from one ear to the other is very simple though. Pairing is very easy as well. Volume is quite low for me, even at its highest level. When talking to someone, they usually tell me that they can't hear me clearly...as if I'm very far away. I can't hear the other person very clearly either...unless I push the headset against my hear with my hand (kind of a bummer when you buy one to be hands-free). When a call comes in, the headset makes its own sound to notify you...which is nice. However, overall, I don't like it. There are better headsets out there, so I suggest you pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, but not the best sound quality","review":"This headset was comfortable, easy to pair, easy to use, looks nice and has a simple design and setup. I also had no problems hearing the other person on the line.

However, this is a very simple headset that gets the job done. It's also very reasonably priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Bluetooth headset","review":"I have been using this headset for a month and basically am happy with the purchase.

Perhaps I have abnormal ears, but I could never manage to successfully wear this headset! I tried it on both ears, but it never stayed still, it was always flapping around on the side of my head. Because I never got a firm fit, I had to turn the volume all the way up to use it, but it still wasn't loud enough. If you wear glasses or have small ears, assume you will have the same problems. I've owned the product for nearly a year and have used it about 4 times in total -- absolutely not worth any price, even if the phone store gives it to you for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"I used to have a Motorola H500 which worked well for my phone.

Outgoing sound is horrible in the car","review":"This headset seems to be the \\"preferred\\" headset of my friends. However, whenever I'm not in a dead-still silent room, people have told me that I'm completely unrecognizable. This is especially the case when I'm in my car. Granted, I drive an Acura RSX, which is not known for its quiet ride, but nevertheless, I need something better. I tested it out once, listening to messages that I left on other people's voicemails, and it sounds like I was in an underground cellar surrounded by lead.So if you're going to be using this *only* *only* while in a dead silent room, this is the way to go for ease of use.If you're going to use it any other way, try something better. I still am personally researching what a good headset would be. I may try the plantronics 510 or another more expensive plantronics.

For example, it would not pickup phone calls or disconnect them using the headset button - had to open the phone for those operations.The company allowed me only to return the device (at my expense) for a replacement. The sound quality of the replacement is better, but it still will not pickup or disconnect using the headset button.

I dropped mine about a week in from four feet up onto pavement, and the ear-clip chipped, making it fall out from time to time - definitely not rugged construction. This unit picks up all kinds of background noise and garbles the voice so that you have to shout slowly to be understood at all. In addition, about 60% of the time, when placing a call, you will be able to hear the person you called, but they will not be able to hear you at all, and you'll have to redial to get through."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie has it all","review":"Anil Kapoor, who plays the TV show host in Slumdog Millionaire, starred in this epic melodrama alongside the magnificent Madhuri Dixit. It's got it all -- melodrama, deceit, catfights, and of course some great music and production numbers. I've seen it several times and never tire of it. Anil Kapoor, by the way, is superb in this role -- lithe, charming, energized and enthusiastic. His physical dexterity really is remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply A Terrific Film!","review":"I can watch this movie over and over again. Brilliant performances by all in both the primary and secondary roles. The type of movie where each time you watch, you pick up something new.

If I had to take just five movies with me to the proverbial desert island, this would surely be one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"So True to Life....Perfect Research","review":"I saw this movie for the first time 7 years ago when I was a freshman in highschool. Now that I'm working in the newsroom of a network affiliate I have come to realize just how real to life this movie is. Whoever researched the script on this either worked in television news or spent a lot of time in a newsroom. If you want realism...this is it. Especially the scene where Joan Cusak is running with a video tape (one of the funniest scenes, but also one of the most accurate). I can tell you, that in just the first few weeks of working in a news room I had run like that countless times, and been totally bowled over by someone doing the same twice.

Refreshingly original too, judging by her latest romantic romp about a bride brigand...The Bride Thief is again a delightful charade by D' Alessandro with her sensitive characters who are both quirky and tender. Laced with sparkling humour and backed by endearing sub-characters like Sammie's sister and the nascent romance between the magistrate and Margaret, The Bride Thief is joyously fun and unfetteringly romantic. Even though the ending is a bit rushed and Sammie's rejection is inexplicable, The Bride Thief will steal your heart away with its riotous cast and old-fashioned comedy. Jacquie D' Alessandro again shines with her empathy for her characters and sharp wits in this triumphant outing."},{"rating":"1","title":"good introduction, but not much of expert knowledge","review":"The \\"gimics\\" part of this DVD is the more interesting part, which actually tells you how real card shark cheat with gimics such as various types of card clips.

The singer sounds like what would happen if Chris Cornell and Stevie Wonder had a child. The drummer is tight and rocking. The harmonies are amazing.

The production is excellent and suits the rhymes, I think they were meant to be deep grumbling basslines. But the flows and lyrics have had a lot put into them and thats what makes this tight. His album after this was not that good, but he still has this to show. You have to listen to this properly because he puts a lot of things into his lyrics and you will catch them the second time around if you miss them. He is a true lyricist and should be in anyone who says they like true 'hip hop's'(not rap, I know what them people want, Fake simple minded bulls#it, not this!) collection.

All that said, however, the comedy \\"side\\" of the CD is a bit tired and I would be hard-pressed to recommend this CD on its comedy merits alone. As a five-string, bluegrass-style banjo picker, however, I have to recommend this CD very highly. There's some really great banjo music contained here, and many arrangements are Steve originals (e.g., Hoedown At Alice's'; Pitkin County Turnaround; Saga of the Old West; and Banana Banjo); all terrific songs in their own right. Steve's a very talented guy, and it's been long in coming that the banjo-playing side of this force of nature is now preserved on CD for banjo pickers to learn from and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redoute' Flowers and Fruits CD - ROM and Book","review":"I am very happy with the purchase.

I have really enjoyed all of their releases so far, beginning with Silt that year. I love this album, it has one of my favorite songs - Escapades in Glass. I have yet to hear their new one, Drunk with You--but I'm sure it will be great too. I actually went to see them play last night at NYC's Luna Lounge, and was throughly impressed once again. An added plus is that they are super-nice, down to earth people you'd like to meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Please!!!","review":"I was deeply disapointed by this, my second attempt, at giving these Boston fellows a chance. The album is weak, compared to the fuzz-guitar strength and hypnotic sexy ring that most of the Boston bands seems to have. Why Did Misile Thrush get skipped by the 'fun time' fairy? I don't know. But, I do know that even while dealing with sappy lyrics, unnecassry yelps, and mean-spirited screams, the reast of the the band trudges on. They actually stand up quite well under the pressure. If you ignoore the poor recording, the lack of diversity and the general sense of hoplessness, you're left with meat. Go forth, Lamb's meat, and greet a new day (sans margaritas).

I have about 12 hangers on the rack; 6 on each side. As long as the weight of the clothes is fairly balanced on each side, I have not had a problem with sturdiness or falling over.

It is a little too tall for her to get her play clothes (she is almost three), but she will pull up a chair or get her brother to help her out.

If you've ever been to a high energy spin class, then that's how I prefer to workout. Target Heart Rate Training fails to be inspiring and fun. I rode 20 minutes into the workout before I realized an overwhelming majority of the workout only consisted of flat roads. About 5 minutes towards to end, you do a short standing climb. That's if you can defeat boredom to the end.Also, the music is Christian pop rock. It's tolerable. However, the music levels are way too high. You can barely hear the instructor talk.Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying the DVD unless you can try it beforehand.

Often, students in 3rd grade and above who are emergent writers are embarassed to write, as their writing looks 'babyish' compared to their peers. Here's an idea I've used, with Making Big Books as a resource: Have your students create simple story lines that are used with patterned books for preschoolers, kindergartners, or primary special ed students. This has the benefits of: giving a sense of purpose to the activity; engaging students in a modification of \\"language experience\\" in which students write down their thoughts, then use those for reading. Remember the strong reading/writiing connection (Adams, 1990).

In his time the air is toxic and the birth rate is decreased to almost nothing. He comes back to now to get a clean air sample and he lands at this wedding reception. He is only aloud to stay in the \\"now\\" for 11 minutes.It is boy meets girl and boy falls head over heals in love. It takes him 3 months to time travel so it takes almost 2 years to see her for a couple of hours.The story line was interesting, but man the filming aweful and the lead actress couldn't act at all. To add insult to injury this chick had an a voice that made me want to put in ear plugs.So needless to say, I wouldn't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are all these reviewers watching?","review":"After reading at least 5 reviews on every film I watch, it was a shock to see a movie about concentration camps and a hodgepodge of cities and streets, old propaganda footage, and narration in Italian, German and English. Maybe the time traveler took all those wonderful characters and hid them in a dungeon. Perhaps that is why this whatever it was made me half sick. Maybe it became a masterpiece after 15 minutes, but that is way too long for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"The dialogue in this film seems a little contrived but the acting is so damn good (particularly the lead female, Christina Mauro, and the drunk groom, Jeremy Juuso) it doesn't matter. Wish the actors could time travel to some other movies that were shot over months, rather than the day this one amazingly took, that way I could get back some enjoyment robbed of me by the studios. Hats off to the production team, actors, and director for making what must have been a complex shoot turn out so well. Great acting, great concept, really, really good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"11 minutes ago","review":"A humorous,romantic, Sci-Fi ride. A creative and unique approach to the genre. Very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Independant","review":"I think one of the reasons independent films will never overtake studio films is because most independent films suck. I went into this one fully expecting such an experience. After all, this is a one-day shoot on no budget, without any name actors. To say that I was surprised is an understatement, I was shocked - this really is a good little indie! The story is tight, the camera work professional, and the acting superb, with a big nod to lead Christina Mauro, who has some more films coming soon I hope. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around how the writer managed to pull off science fiction with such a budget, and pull it off terrifically, I might add. Everything that normally is a detriment to low budget films was used to great effect and incorporated seamlessly into this one. Also, I've never seen a film where the philosophical implications of time travel have been handled so deeply and subtly, big budget or no budget. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed watching it every time","review":"This film blows me away for a couple of reasons. 1: It was shot entirely in one day. Actually in just 17 hours. 2: The acting and plot are both great 3: It's an independent film that successfully pulled of this one of a kind fun thoughtful easy-to-follow yet unpredictable time-travel movie. Maybe it's just me, but I haven't seen many movies that claim all three. The script is as well developed as the characters, both are a little bit quirky yet still believable. It's a real treat and it's one of those that is just as great (if not better) the second time around as well. Great for the fan of indi and mainstream films alike. Relatively recent movie, so music and backgrounds and even corporate culture is easy to identify with, as well as some deeper level of human needs that are, well, timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what Independent Filmmaking is all about!","review":"The production value is not of a big Hollywood Studio. The actors are not big names. But when I found out about how the movie was made, I can't help but be impressed. The feature length movie was shot in ONE DAY! I heard the filmmakers talk after a screening at a film festival. I think this quote from a review I read sums it up...\\"What do you get when you mix \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" with \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\"?

The best tracks are \\"Respect\\", \\"New York, New York\\", \\"Smooth\\", \\"Let's Play House\\", \\"A Doggz Day Afternoon\\", and \\"One By One\\". I highly recommend this album. It carries the full package of production, lyrics, and flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album EVER!","review":"This joint is off the hizzie! Kurupt spits mad lyrics on this one.

The best tracks are \\"A Doggz Day Afternoon\\", \\"Respect\\", \\"Let's Play House\\", and \\"Smooth\\". \\"Smooth\\" is the best one. Why didn't they make it a single?? Buy the album. It is better than The Chronic and Doggystyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurupt And Daz Produce A Timeless Classic.","review":"This is the best rap album released in a long time. It was recorded in 1995, and I know that seems really recent, but you'd be surprised by how much the hip-hop ear has changed. This album sounds as new and fresh as ever and just seems to get better everytime I listen to it. \\"Dogg Pound Gangstaz\\", \\"Respect\\", \\"New York, New York\\", \\"Smooth\\", \\"Cyco-Lic-No\\", \\"Ridin', Slipin', And Slidin'\\", \\"Let's Play House\\", \\"A Dogg'z Day Afternoon\\", \\"Reality\\", \\"So Much Style\\", and many more are all awesome on this set. I recommend this album to any hip-hop fan, because it will satisfy any rap craving, especially if you like G-Funk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Talents and Beats.","review":"Tha Dogg Pound, a group of two talented rappers, Daz Dillinger and Kurupt Tha Kingpin, released this as their debuts. The album is really all about Kurupt, although both rappers have skills. The production comes from Daz on most tracks, Kurupt does a track, and DJ Pooh does a couple tracks. It is very creative, because these cats only have one out of seventeen tracks that are sampled. The production isn't just creative, but beautiful and stunning. Not every album can have rapping that is powerful and still have pretty beats full of live drums, keyboards leaping through, beautiful background vocals(most notably Val Young's sweet vocals on \\"Smooth\\"), and a great bass and guitar. This album doesn't have filler songs, either. Each track is perfect and shines in its own way. I recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic only Deathrow could produce.","review":"This is classic Deathrow material. No Deathrow compilation would be good without Kurupt and Daz ripping up the microphone on the tracks. All the tracks are laced by satin beats while Kurupt and Daz produce beautifully smooth raps. With the help of Snoop Doggy Dogg, Prince Ital, Dr. Dre, Mr. Malik, Nate Dogg, and others, this album is a classic. After listening to this album, I said, \\"Life is good.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best rap album I've ever heard!!","review":"This album was great. It was probably the best Deathrow album ever released. Both the production and the rapping is good on this album, which is very rare. Daz and Kurupt are a great team, with Daz's smooth yet hardcore style and great, genuine producing skills, and Kurupt's great flow, and I think Kurupt is the best rapper ever to pick up a mic, because his flow is less spitty and more clear than both 2Pac and Biggie's. His flow is much cleaner. With some producing help from DJ Pooh and Dr.Dre, this is without question, the best produced rap album ever. My favorite track is \\"Let's Play House\\", a great song that has outstanding production. By other favorites are \\"New York, New York\\", \\"Smooth\\", \\"I Don't Like To Dream About Getting Paid\\", and \\"Ridin', Slippin', and Slidin'\\".

Period.","review":"Okay. You can see from the other reviews that this album is the real thing. If you grew up in the '90's and rap was any part of your music portfolio, you already know this album by heart. If you are a little younger, but you still like the G-Funk style, then you must own this. It is a window into the past and a prime example of the amazing talent that hip-hop artists possessed at that time.The lyrics are great, the beats are tight, and the sound and production are as refined as anything you'll find from that era. I'm not going to give some 10 page dissertation, but I will say that if you like 1990's rap, you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential classic by the best rap duo ever","review":"I am a huge Dogg Pound fan and love this album. Kurupt's rapping is amazing and he makes this album a classic. Daz, however, has improved so much since this album was made, both as an MC and as a producer. The new DPG album, Dillinger and Young Gotti, is far better than Dogg Food. The major features that prevents this album from earning a five star rating are the stupid W-Balls interludes. They're not funny, they are just annoying. Even so, this is an essential album by the best rap duo ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"DPG 4eva (My Name Is O.I.)","review":"This album is clazzizic!

This book is all about that, It covers the creation and a good decade's worth of artisitic varatations on the Illy cup.I have been bitten by the Illy Collection bug and own a few of the sets, it's nice to have this book as a guide to the \\"expensive\\" past. The only problem is that the collection is only through 2003, so it is missing the 2004/2005 cups. Espresso has never been so stylish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pictures only with no content issues.","review":"The title of this book is really appealing, but I found this book to be a superficial coffee table book. There is no thought provoking commentary or essay which could place the \\"cup\\" within a social context or place the cup with a material culture.The color prints are on matt paper which makes the images seem a little dull and fuzzy. Not one cups seems to jump off the page and into my memory.Adding to my disappointment is that every cup appears to be the same size and shape. The decoration or embellishment on the cups is only on the surface. It seems that the artists, writer, musicians, architects, etc., that are featured in the book, were only asked to offer a graphic design to a standard demitasse cup. Why couldn't they change the shape or form of the cup?How disappointing! The idea behind the book is great, the execution is boring and limited.I would not recommend buying this book.Harriete Estel Berman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and informative CD.","review":"Rare, recordings of the architect of Black Power Movement.

HOWEVER, the tracks are basically the same as for the Cheetah Girls karaoke disc that I also bought, and I was unable to determine that at the time of purchase. This disc does contain two more tracks, but these are remixes of two of the other tracks--not worth much. Also, the sleeve says something about a computer program on the disk. On my Macintosh, all the program did was direct the user to the Disney website--a valueless item in my view.

I was very impressed when I opened my first can of LOMA LINDA Big Franks. Then I heated them over indirect heat in my Weber grill. They were delicious!I am not a vegetarian. You ask why I would bother - well, I have lived long enough now to begin worrying about my health - but I was brought up eating anything I like, and I love Hot Dogs! And you know the good part about LOMA LINDA Big Franks is we know what's in them!

I have NO idea what the 5-star reviewers ate because I could barely stomach these pseudo-food products. I'm not sure what to do with the remaining cans because relish, catsup, onions, mustard and tons of other toppings failed to camouflage the rubbery off-taste of these \\"franks.\\" My conclusion is that I think I'll eat all the condiments and dispense with this red-grey monstrosity.UPDATE: After reading responses to my review, I realize that the way to appreciate these franks is to eat them during childhood WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER (sorry... just kidding... I couldn't resist). Okay... If you don't acquire a taste for these during your imprintable years, be cautious about buying them now. You've been warned. GOOD LUCK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edible, but not even close to all the hype","review":"These canned hot dogs are not what they are hyped up to be. After reading all of the 5 star reviews my hubby and I had to try them. I was nervous to buy a full case off of Amazon so I picked up a couple from a safeway grocery store (the other was the Little Links... completely gross!) for about $9 a can.We grilled them, with great success! We used a little cooking oil spray and there was no sticking and they held together nicely. I put mine on a toasted bun with ketchup and relish. The dog was mushy and not much flavor. It wasn't THE worst veggie dog but NOT even close to greatest. They are not worth the price. Morningstar veggie dogs are the best, these don't even compare except that they are hot dog shaped.If I were building a bomb shelter and wanted veggie dogs in my canned food stash, these would be go to choice. Otherwise, save your money, try a can from the store before getting a giant amount here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"My girlfriend sent me a \\"case\\" of the Big Franks as a present, wanting me to eat healthier. I tried 2 of the franks, one in the microwave and one grilled. They were absolutely awful, like eating a mouthful of mushed up tofu. No amount of ketchup or mustard helped me swallow these down, and I didn't taste or see any resemblance to sausage or anything spicy. I will eat almost anything with an open mind, but the other 11 cans and 6 open flavorless hot dogs will sit around till someone wants them, but I would really have to wonder why anyone would. You really have to hate real meat if you are going to enjoy the Big Franks, and even then, I can only think of a few things worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS DOGS, the BEST I ever tasted!!!!","review":"Although I am a confirmed carnivore, and love all things meat, if I ever do decide to quit and become a strict full time vegetarian, these would become a staple. They can be now anyway, thanks to Amazon as they are very difficult to find. Once you taste these you will just be amazed at how fantastic they are, one taste and you will be hooked, they are simply great. You can have them in casseroles, on a bun with onions, pickles and relish or just have them all by themselves, they are unbelievably delicious and this is an excellent deal because they are very filling (without the cholesterol)and at 20 oz, one can will last quite a while, and 12 cans will def last a loooong time no matter how often you have them.

Husband eats meat but I don't. And there are only a couple vege meats he will eat, these he loves. For us finding them and then dealing with the price limits how many and often we get these. But they are great. They are salty, yes, a little high in sodium but so good. I would not compare them to meat, they are special on their own. They are hard to describe but so delicious...they are fat and juicy, with a brown salty brine, they have have what I call \\"vege meat chunks\\" rolled into them. They have a \\"skin\\" layer and fill us up faster than hot dogs.

The phone itself is flawed in that it lets the user drain the battery completely. The second problem is that the phone will *not* work without the battery even if you plug it in (that's just stupid). Lastly, if you let a lithium battery die completely (especially this one), it cannot hold a charge and thus ruins the battery.So, right now I'm left with purchasing another battery to resurrect some data that's on my dead phone. It really is just a brick when nothing works! I have since moved on and gotten myself a blackberry. It's a godsend and much more worth my time and money than the Cingular 8125.FYI: it's no longer supported in Cingular/AT&T; stores, so you have to order everything for this phone.

It's quite different from what you'd expect on a CD that is meant to relax you!The narrator also has a strong foreign accent. This, too, is distracting from the meaning of the words she is speaking.

The problem with this film is that it takes itself far too seriously. There are endless shots of birds flying, sunsets,and exterior shots of the house all for no reason.

My only regret is that because this fun loving couple had such a serious relationship, that playful lovemaking just was not on their agenda, though you get the idea that had the story continued, we would have seen Robert's playful nature come out during their intimate moments.On the 1-10 scale, I'd give this a 9.9, the only thing holding it back was taking so long for their secrets to be revealed & dealt with, and Robert being so serious during their intimacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and Entertaining","review":"I too found fault with Allie's refusal to love Robert for what he presents to her--a noble, caring, and brave man. His \\"secret\\" was fairly stupid (why didn't he just tell Allie? the \\"honor and vow\\" excuse didn't really fly) and therefore their \\"reasons\\" for allowing themselves to separate seemed contrived. However, the dialogue between them was so sparkling and their chemistry so great I ultimately overlooked that.It was also annoying how people kept \\"fisting their hands,\\" having \\"eyebrows that shot upwards,\\" and kept \\"capturing each other's mouths.\\" Towards the end, the exact same sentence appeared twice! \\"He erased the distance between them with three long strides.\\" A few pages later, the Evil Villain did the exact same thing!

That's right, 30 pounds for the candy jar on my desk at work. Fireballs have always been a hit at work as long as I could find them and afford to keep the jar stocked. This last package was purchased in December, but just opened in Feb. To me they have an off flavor, similar to soap or perfume. In my house they were stored in a food pantry in the original plastic bag and still all individually wrapped. They weren't next to any cleaners or other strongly scented products, so i don't think they picked up the flavor there. My previous 5 purchases from Bayside Candy and another Amazon marketplace seller were great. I'd be surprised if I'm the only buyer who found an off flavor in this lot.

A great beach and vacation read, very quick and entertaining and not too deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try","review":"I'm not a big fan of the mystery genre, but this book didn't help me like mystery novels. I haven't read any other books in Daheim's B&B series, but I don't think I want to. The writing was weak, the characters have very little dimension, and there was just too much subplot (if you can call it that).Joe was about the only character that appealed to me. He actually used his brains to assist, unlike Judith who could charm anyone, no matter how unwilling they were to talk. And Renie was just annoying.Attempts at comedy usually fell flat. Gertrude was pretty fun, though. I think we all know someone a bit like that (for me, it's my aunt).The reason I'm giving this book two stars is because it's a light-read and it's meant to be one. But it's not the quality I was hoping for when I picked it up at the bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FOUNDER, THE BUILDER AND THE STAR","review":"Did you ever wonder how Donald Trump could have been so knowledgable and astute at so young an age. How did he do it? Who taught him? Family that's who. Unbelievably true. Ms Blair's research spans three generations. Friedrich who eventually earned a fortune in Alaska; his son Fred Jr. who made millions from U.S. government housing programs and his grandson, \\"the Donald\\" real estate developer and promoter. The book gives us an up close view of Donald Trump's ego, his wives and their role, his survival after near-bankruptcy, his eagerness for publicity and his \\"midas\\" touch. The man can close a deal. Well written and fascinating. Once upon a time there was the Rothchilds and the Rockefellers. This era it seems belongs to the Trump Dynasty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This review is not so much on the product as it is a gift.

It has turned the light on for me, answering so many questions I have had for years, and, as the title indicates, it is a survival and coping guide. Years ago, a gynecologist told me that my symptoms were a result of my getting older. I didn't need a \\"specialist\\" to tell me that.

They had the standard cow, wolf, dog, coyote, and horse urines, nothing special. But then they bought out their small batch of fox urine and I was wowed. Such an exquisite flavor, it was earthly yet fruity, light yet bold, kind of like a vintage Urine de Badget '85. I was hooked, now I cannot look at other urines the same.Since fox urine was so hard to find, I needed a supply, I tried to make my own, I got a wild animal license, and raised a few, but they can't produce enough, eventually the wildlife board discovered my purpose of raising foxes, and took the foxes and my license away from me.Everything changed when I spotted this godsend at amazon., Thank you Amazon, thank you for brightening up my day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Kittie and Otep combined","review":"This is their most consistent album so far and easily the best. While Karyn's voice may not be the prettiest, it's certainly the loudest, and these songs showcase the wide variety of styles she commands - screaming, growling, yelping, and her surprisingly soft, high-pitched singing voice. Overall the production is very loud and garagey, with fuzzy guitars and boomy drums and ear-shredding, slightly overdriven vocals. It's a dark, angry mix of death and doom, although it goes so far beyond the confines of those two genres that it becomes impossible to classify. It's Crisis at their best, and that's all you need to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"The other reviewers did a good job so I'll just say that this is a classic album.

In all seriousness it is one of the best rap albums in the last 5 years. Like they say,\\"this is what you get when Rock and Ruck start overreacting.\\" This album destroys the new album if you are considering buying one or the other. It also contains artists like O.G.C., llla Noyz, and the Representatives. Bottom line: it's on constant rotation in my player along with the other Bootcamp hits. To end this I would like to give a shoy out to the Scottman in Wayne and Brooklyn for holding it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"too easy","review":"and not so many good songs covered.

For me, the imagery starts out fine, floating like a feather, clouds, scan for stress. Then, the journey changes into something almost medical. For me, mentaly examining all the details of my feet, then muscles, tendons, bones, marrow, atoms is not really relaxing bedtime material.The music is mostly nice except for some human voice inserts that don't seem to fit to me and add a lot of distraction.This might be a fun trip at a different time of day or if you have different goals, but for me, just not right for bed time."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be marketed as a fairy tale","review":"This book was nice in the past where most customers were at least there to be served. However, in a time when freebies and getting one over on the man has become an admireable atribute the ideas expressed are only good for a nostalgic look at how I might have wanted my business to be years ago. For todays business world of satisfying customers while keeping things like shrinkage down this book really is not much more than a fairy tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date garbage","review":"I can see his point. We've all been a customer and we all want respect. But to treat employees, cashiers, waiters etc, as if they're worthless is counterproductive. The customer is always right? I don't know who came up with that phrase, but it's wrong. Anybody in the customer service industry knows that. Nobody's ALWAYS right, if that were true our mothers would never let us forget it! To base his whole philosophy of abuse and harrassment of employees and staff on a free slice of pickle is ludicrious.This book does nothing but give teeth and claws to the abusive employer and gives nasty abusive customers bad ideas. There are better ways to get a smile with your meal, or polite, productive employees. It's called 'Thank you' or 'You're doing a great job!' and HECK maybe following basic tipping ettiquette."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"IM A IDIOT\\" Customer book!","review":"I find this book extremely amusing, although I do alternative between burning the pages, using it for toilet paper, and laughing at how simply stupid it is. If you want to know how to NEVER get good customer service - act like the people in this book! I guarantee you'll get treated just like the people in the book treat the employees - as if they are mere peasents. This is possibly the worst book ever written, and the author clearly needs to get a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously someone has never worked a day in his life","review":"To be fair, if you want to become the \\"pointy haired boss\\" from the Dilbert cartoon, then this book is for you. Everyone else, especially those who have worked in retail, then this book will drive you to alternating fits of laughter and rage. It is like all of the worst customers you have ever waited on are this man's heroes.If you are a boss and want to know how to motivate your employees, let me save you some money. Treat your people, like people. Back them up when a customer gets in their face. Stand up for them when a customer threatens and insults them. Protect them from customers so vindictive that they would try to get someone fired just because they didn't get a single pickle slice on their burger.That employee will be far more valuable to you than that one customer could ever be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a complete loser would come up with a book like this.","review":"If there was a way to give this book a ZERO,I'd have done it. One more time, folks,all together now: the customer is NOTalways right, they're usually full of ****!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Anyone in Any Business!","review":"I have read this book so many times, I know the great stories by heart! My previous company used videos of Mr. Farrell's public speaking engagements as part of our training on customer service. I no longer work directly with the public, but it will be useful no matter what profession you work in. Mr. Farrell also talks about how to motivate your employees and work as a team. Buy this book and pass it around to your employees. I guarantee your business will prosper!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete rubbish","review":"I have have been a manager in multi-million dollar stores for years. I understand that sometimes you need to put your pride aside and give the customer what they want, despite losses to your company (of which this author doesn't seem to comprehend) and just have these people leave your store happy. However, I do not tolerate abusing my staff, or letting them be abused in any way by a customer. Any manager that puts the value of a dollar over the value of a good, loyal, hard working employee will fail. It takes a great manager to strike the fine balance of being the boss, creating a successful work environment and keeping your employees happy. Happy employees are productive employees. Without them, you cannot provide ANY customer service. Without them, your business fails. Yes, the customer spends the money - but the employees are there to keep them coming back. YOU are responsible for keeping your employees coming back."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are many great management books in the world...","review":"...but this isn't one of them.If you want to send your business down the drain, then read this book.If you want all your staff to quit or go 'postal' because you treat them like garbage and allow people to abuse them, then read this book.If you have no idea that what it takes to run a successful business is hard work and not inane aphorisms, then read this book.If, on the other hand, you want to run a successful business, then buy something else and avoid insipid tripe like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Stinks","review":"This rotten egg bomb should be retitled \\"How to Spoil a Big Baby Customer.\\" The customers in the stories were out of line in all their actions. Indulging them just because they are the customer and treating the employees like trash is just plain foolish."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst customer service book ever!!","review":"In almost all his examples, the customer was wrong. managers and owners who take farrell's advice deserve to go out of business. his advice is essentailly do anything to humiliate the employees if that's what it takes to keep the unimaginably obnoxious customers happy. if waiter threw a dollar tip in the face of a party of 20, meaning that the waiter worked all evening for free, i would NEVER reward that customer with a gift certificate.good employees are harder to come by than customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word describes this book...Garbage!","review":"I also agree with the other reviewers, if I could possibly rate this book any lower I would. How can anyone be proud of something like this. Here's his point of view summed up.Retail workers are lower forms of life. They have no dignity and deserve no respect.Just about every customer mentioned in this book was out of line and should have been thrown out of the establishment.The customer is not always right. You give respect and you get respect back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Customer is NOT Always Right","review":"First off, let's set that straight.The customer is NOT always right. In fact, if you are a customer, and you utter those words, it is almost universally understood that you are using them as a last ditch effort to justify something illogical and stupid.As for the story about a $1 tip on a 20 person table. That person had every right in the world to be EXTREMELY angry about what happened.Basically, any who is stupid to believe that every customer is worth keeping is someone who needs to work, not as a chairman, but as a customer for awhile. Most of the problems are caused by customers, not employees, and helping them take things from you for nothing is a sure fire way to lose the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder the people in these examples get bad service","review":"The author of this book has to realize that retail workers are not slaves, nor are customers \\"the boss\\". Demeaning employees the way the \\"customers\\" in the examples of this book do will not get you any better service, in fact quite the opposite. I feel for any person corrupted by the views in this book. Yes, retail employees should be friendly and helpful, but dealing with the whiney, immature and sometimes dishonest actions of the examples of customers in this book could push even the best employee over the edge. Just because it is the employee's job to serve the customer does not give the customer the right to demean and torment the employee. Remember, the employee is an actual person with feelings, not a robot, works very hard and deserves the same respect everyone is owed just by being a human being. I gave this book one star, and that is two stars too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided Idiot","review":"This mockery of a person has NO clue what they are talking about. Maybe if he actually had to spend a day dealing with sucky customers, he'd rethink his asinine book. If I EVER come across this guy, he'll find out that his book has more uses than just toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Deserve Any Stars","review":"The customers in the stories were way out of line. Encouraging people to behave in that manner is just disgraceful. Businesses have policies for a reason. Just because the customer wants something does NOT mean they should get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Absolutely Terrible","review":"Anybody who buys this book is wasting their money. There are plenty of good customer service books out there, this one is bogus. The author assumes that all retail associates are idiots and every customer is a saint. In reality, there are many customers that are not always right, in fact many are dead wrong.Mr. Farrell has apparently never worked with or dealt with difficult customers, otherwise, this book would never have been written. Folks, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone needs to get a clue","review":"Obviously many people who have never worked a day with customers will LOVE this book. It gives them an excuse to be a jerk to every employee out there. Don't let me sit where I want to in your eating establishment? Fine, i will sit there anyway and order a pizza, just to prove what a pompous idiot I can be! The reason so many people complain of the downfall of customer service is because of this gentleman. Tell me this, who in their right mind, would want to serve a demanding, rude, complaining customer? NO ONE! Lets quit talking about the decline of customer service, and begin talking about the uprise of rude uncaring consumers! I guarantee if anyone wrote a book about that, every customer service employee would buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfect example of why people DON'T get good service","review":"This book does nothing but encourage the \\"customer is always right\\" attitude that is one of the major reasons many people recieve poor service. It encourages the creation of hostile work environments by owners, as well as the harassment and treatment of employees as inferiors by customers. This includes the story behind the title of the book, in which the author rewards a customer with a free sundae for verbally abusing a cashier over a five cent up charge for a pickle, then having the nerve to complain about it in a letter. It goes downhill from there. With employees being treated in such a manner, is it any wonder they're not jumping at the chance to wait hand and foot on ungrateful customers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Advice","review":"I don't believe the advice this guy gives. It is totally unrealistic. Everyone deserves respect and this book is basically instructing customers to treat service indusrty employees like crap. I gave this 1 star and I feel like that was too high, unfotunately it was the lowest option available."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just angered me greatly!","review":"Where do I begin to express the contempt in which I hold this book? If the authors truely believe the rubbish they spew forth, then they obviously have never done a days work on the front line in their life. Their book condones irrational and argumentative behaviour on the side of the customer, something we employees have to deal with all too often. To expect an employee to have to get walked all over with a smile on their face is just plain wrong. The customer is not always right and they most certainly are not the boss."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too many for this one","review":"Businesses do not need a manual on how to give good customer service. Customers need a manual on how to be good customers! The $1 tip story was horrible. I would've thrown that \\"tip\\" back at the party too. And the person that said the customer is NOT always right, was definitely correct. It is often used when the customer is not getting the answers they want to hear. Can't live with store policies? Too bad, too sad. There are policies for a reason, mostly to stop scammers and to keep prices from inflating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farrell Falls Short","review":"I read this book in the hopes of improving customer/salesperson interaction at my big box retail store. Unfortunately, Mr. Farrell's view of good customer service encourages the customer to behave abominably and expects the store employees to bow to all needs, however frivolous.Some customers have come to believe that \\"the customer is always right\\". Unfortunately, abuse of this policy has rendered this old saying untrue. Many customers, even in Farrell's examples, are downright abusive to retail workers. Contrary to Mr. Farrell's belief, good service can be rendered without resorting in complete indignity to the employee. There are some customers who might be better off shopping elsewhere.Some of Mr Farrell's recommendations might be helpful for very small business owners, however, the vast majority of his theories are outdated, even encouraging theft and verbal abuse by customers. Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This man needs to beaten with a pickle","review":"Words cannot describe the evilness and stupidity that abounds in this waste of paper and shelf space.

Still talking to the makers about the mouse movements that are not working but overall I am happy with the 1 button. With 1 button I am able to select the form and have it put in the 11 N's in all the correct places, put in my truck number and move the curser to the empty field where I need to add more info. If i ever need to change trucks all I have to do is edit my truck number on my computer and save it on xkey.

When you master these exercises, it will be your day! But unless you are two strokes from being a fitness freak, try something else.I bought this for my wife and she likes the intensity but after about three times, the interest was lost largely due to the fact that you MUST have the squeeze thingy. Yes you can do the workout without it but it's pretty senseless to do that.And then you get the squeezy thingy and you realise this is advanced stuff!

This book is really good because it presents a wide selection of Nietzsche's works from \\"The Antichrist\\", \\"Ecce Homo\\", \\"Twilight of the Idols\\", \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\\" as well as various notes and letters that he wrote. I took one star away from my rating simply because this is Nietzsche and he can be somewhat difficult to understand. All that aside, even though I am not crazy about Nietzsche, this is really interesting reading (if you can understand it) and worth an effort if the subject content of philosophy interests you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-Nazi blasphemous thinker","review":"Other than Karl Marx, I can not think of a more offensive nineteenth century writer. Unfortunately, like the writings of Marx, later generations bought into the sweet sound of the devil incarnate, and we ended up with the most murderess century in history. I would assert that these writings were in large part responsible for the moral degradation of Germany, transforming the free country that produced Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Helmholtz to the nation of sheep that produced Otto von Bismark, monetary hyperinflation, and Adolf Hitler. Notice any parallels to America today? Make no mistake, Nietzsche had deep seated contempt for his fellow man. This was a very disturbed individual,a pre-nazi, and a pro new world order philosopher. You won't find inspiration, enlightenment, or the message of freedom in these toxic writings. Best to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazon is cool!","review":"i don't read much. but, for the price and shipping, i got a really, 'cool', and 'thick', book that i will be 'practicing' with, for my choice of reading material. it was shipped quickly, and i got a really good deal on the price. the book i got is actually several books in one. it is over seven hundred pages... b.j. 05/19/2009."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is the print so bad?","review":"My review isn't of the contents of the book.I haven't seen any comments on the bad print/font in the Portable Nietzsche. Why isn't anyone commenting on how bad the print is? I would give it five stars, but the font/print is bad and the book feels unorganized. I don't mean chronologically unorganized, I just mean unorganized - for example, the editor's preface to Twilight of the Idols ends immediately above, on the same page, of the Contents for Twilight; and Nietzsche's preface is on the same page as the table of contents. The editor's preface for each book is in such small font/print. But in general the print is really bad. Am I the only one to notice this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal,","review":"A great collection for the price, but, Hollingdale's translations are much preferable in regard to capturing Nietzche's style and subtlety in English. Much of Zarathustra is awkwardly though adequately translated--unique word choices, to the say the least. Compare with Hollingdale's. Overall: Something I would pick up to have with me at all times and travel, but not the greatest substitute for obtaining better editions for study. Main feature: It's portable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Don't read. Not worth your time.","review":"This book (or rather, books) was written by a very angry, disillusioned person whose pedantic and purposefully convoluted Siddhartha-like writing style hides the fact (none too successfully) that he has nothing worthwhile to say.He also loathes religion with a passion and might possibly like to see all religious people burn in hell--if he believed in hell.Not at all edifying or useful except perhaps as a paperweight.

It has very little about acoustic guitar and concentrates instead on heavy metal stuff.

What a corker. It stood out as a gem even at the time to me - it had weird lyrcs, strange vocals, and a mix of styles from acoustic to industrial pop. In the nineties I spent hours digitising and EQing the vinyl so I could listen to it on CD, since it was never released in digital. Unbelievable. Finally, 15 years later here it is. A classic must-have. The Last Film, Frightened in France, but the weirdest and best - Big Man Restless. My son (now 20yo) has loved that track since he was a kid - it's on heavy iPod rotation. Of course, most people haven't a clue as to what the name of the band really means in British slang - but that's all the better for the subversive.

I like that it is easy to load pictures to an sd card and update in just a few minutes.

I had only around 100 photos loaded.I have seen many reviews of this frame freezing up on slide show. So this is not 1 specific frame, but a general defect in the product. The manufacturer should recall this product.Also the frame heats up,unlike the Coby Digital frame which I have.

I've used the griddle 10 times in the last month on a variety of foods (bacon, french toast, pancakes, quesadillas, etc) and am pleased with the performance. My biggest gripe is with the pancake cooking. If you place the batter immediately after the red warming light goes off you get great golden brown pancakes. However, if your cakes are on the griddle when the warming light comes on, watch out. The cakes are going to cook twice as fast and if they are across the heating elements, they will likely get an unsightly brown line across them - the pancake tan line. If they made the machine with several small heating elements instead of two large ones, this would help the problem. Last, I will say the ability to store the griddle upright is an awesome feature. My wife thanks you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"We purchased this grill based on the reviews here at Amazon and other publications. When I recieved the grill my first impression was the size. This grill is small. The cooking area is 14-1/2\\"x 9\\".The grill does heat up quickly, but, the temperature swings greatly as the thermostat cycles. From observing a small surface thermometer, I estimate a 40 deg F swing.Lastly, the temperature settings seem odd. For example, I cook bacon on a \\"High\\" setting. The surface thermometer indicated 200 to 240 deg F. Cleaning the connections between the grill and thermostat had no affect.As far as cleaning the grill afterward, I can say this grill is more difficult to clean than my previous one. This one is heavy and awkward in the sink.This grill replaced a Presto from Target. It cost less than half of the Bonjour, yes it had hot spots but temp was consistent.Now, this grill, the Bonjour, is being replaced with another Presto.To be fair to those who love this grill, I have not tried warranty solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"high-impact nothing","review":"When closing price goes up N times, buy.

I'm a Spoonful fan and \\"Wash Her Away\\" has been one of my favorites of theirs for years. It's one of their most rambunctious tunes. Also \\"Respoken\\" is another one of their more underrated songs (rather melodic). It's probably correct, however, to call \\"Girl Beautiful Girl\\", a throwaway, but with the footnote that it was, after all, the song Francis Ford Coppola chose to open the film with (i.e., can't be that bad).

You should be able to access the old coupling from underneath to see if it is corroded without dismantling anything, mine was. Also, rubber sawdust around the coupling is another sign that is is corroded and should be replaced. If it shows signs of corrosion, it's probably the problem and worth replacing. It was an easy replacement if you are a little mechanically inclined (at least on my machine). Took a little finagelling and a little help from a handy friend and an internet tutorial.

A long time Fleetwood Mac fan, I pulled out the CD and listened to the song both while I was reading the book and after I was finished with it. Though it does follow to a very small extent, the mythology of the name Rhiannon, it doesn't reflect on the story at all. The Rhiannon of the book is cruel and extremely vicious, a character with no virtue, yet the song is not about a character like that.The same reviewer recommended the book if you like mythology. Celtic mythology is discussed in only the barest terms. It isn't discussed at length, only to the slightest extent.So if you are looking for insight into the song Rhiannon or looking for extensive mythology discussion, this is not the book for you.

It provides a glimpse into a time and a place in the world that I don't often hear about(in the US).Celestial Harmonies is a most rewarding experience and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"I bought this cable from Amazon in month of Aug, 2007 for $10.

His psychological novels inform our understanding of Russian society and, at the same time, his works transcend their cultural boundaries to reveal truths of human nature. One could go on and on about how great a writer Dostoevsky is. That being said, the Village of Stepanchikovo is an odd book indeed. One could consider this novel his homage to Gogol, a stab at comedy. Although not entirely successful in and of itself, the novel is an important early sketch, raw material to be used in building his masterpieces. In addition, the story moves at a great pace and is never boring. Overall, I found it to be quite entertaining. The novel probably is not a classic but rather quite an enjoyable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"These winds blow plenty good","review":"It's nice that Verve has made this excellent Argo release from 1964 available again. Illinois Jacquet is in great form, and gets excellent support from all involved, especially pianist Tommy Flanagan and guitarist Kenny Burrell. WHEN MY DREAMBOAT COMES HOME is taken medium-tempo and played in the bluesiest manner, which brings out the best of all three frontline men. Flanagan is especially impressive on LESTER LEAPS IN, on which he playes an attention-grabbbing intro and then lays out a sparkling single-note solo later on. Burrell takes a nice solo on CANADIAN SUNSET. Jacquet presents a rare treat on BLUES FOR THE EARLY BIRD by playing alto sax, but is super fine on STAR EYES, which is the highlight of the album. This is one of those albums that could easily have fallen through the cracks into oblivion had it not been reissued; grab it while it's still available."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very informal summary of BVI history","review":"Florence Lewisohn's book is a short and informal, albeit engaging, summary of BVI history. Her love of the islands and its people shines through her narrative, and even if the text is not the most authoritative, it makes an engaging read and not inaccurate summary of the key points of the Territory's past. For an informal summary, Ms Lewisohn's cites a fairly impressive bibliography at the back of the book, several of which seem to hae eluded later and more scholarly attempts to summarise the history of the British Virgin Islands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes Disgusting!!!","review":"This stuff tastes so disgusting.

The support person was obviously reading from a template as it took him (probably doing support from India) 10 minutes to respond to every simple question. After struggling for 1 hour, he finally concluded that the unit needs to be sent back.The player is only accepted at SONY's Texas service location. SONY doesn't provide service locally even though there are tons of SONY stores in my area. Not only I have to pay shipping out of my own pocket, the turn around time will be about a month.

Just brought home an LG LCD LED 55\\" and still using the unit. An even more amazing picture. I will soon get a Blu Ray player, but the new TV used up a lot of the budget. At any rate, in about two years, the only problems are the depth of the carousel. I have had a couple of dvd hang ups because they were placed in a little to hastily. My fault.

It recognizes a child's sense of poetic rhythm without sliding into sing-song verses.In short, this collection edited by Ogden Nash has all the qualities you expect in his own work... absolutely delightful ... with illustrations nearly as delightful as the poems.An example I can quote 40 years later: Germans live in Germany / Romans live in Rome / Turks live in Turkey / But English live at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Collection","review":"This collection of letters is both fascinating and informative.

One very imporant message is that accepting the bad with the good is not nearly enough; we must embrace it,name it, and ultimately put the experience to work for us in a positive way as we wander down the path of our uncertain lives. The difficult experiences embolden us and prepare us to deal more effectively with more of the same. This is not an easy concept to accept, but it is right. All is a gift, and we must celebrate the unwelcome events as well as the happy ones if we wish to live life to the fullest."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a mystery....","review":"This book offers little to nothing.

The plots are handled well, in general, and while characters behave as you'd expect them to, there are still a few surprises.My only complaint is with the Solitaire sub-plot. This day-walking vampire idea was great, I loved it, and then there was this added twist and I was wondering what would happen and then . . . well, I don't want to spoil the book, but let's just say that plot thread ends rather more anti-climactically than was necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"To much Trouble!!","review":"For Buffy Summer's she never gets to have any thing easy.Buffy is on the verge of having to deal with to much fighting.

This publication, with it's \\"tounge in cheek\\" humor, wonderfully and acurately depicts the unusual and entertaining events that occur in a household where together, Siamese cats and their \\"owners\\" reside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I absolutely loved The Oxygen Man, so I was eager to pick up Visible Spirits, the the second novel by Steve Yarbrough. It is elegantly-written and impossible to put down. I would recommend it to everyone out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridging Race Relations","review":"I completed Visible Spirits (June 8th- a month to the day after its release). The book held my interest, especially since though fictional it was of personal sentiment for me. Had I not known the real story of the Cox episode, I would have been inclined to believe yours. The way you write is quite convincing. Your ability to cross racial lines via the message in Visible Spirits has me awed in that you were able to focus on and express the goings on in a culture which is so divided as it relates to black and white issues yet, you who grew up on the other side of the tracks- have connected mentally and spiritually. I do hope that those who read your book will walk away with the understanding that our past is a part of our present, and that our destiny lies in the hands of each of us, individually and collectively. A house divided cannot stand...perhaps Visible Spirits has come to heal us and bridge race relations in Mississippi, and the world. Keep writing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Visible Spirits - Invisible Ending","review":"Visible Spirits, while not overly engrossing or riveting, does provide enough drama to make it readable. I would have enjoyed the book more if the relationships between the characters had been fully developed or at least explained early on in the story, and if there had been more character development for others in the story other than Tandy. Then there's the problem of the big showdown between the town whites and the black man accused of murder. There's no mention of what happened. The towns people show up at the mans house, the mayor is subsequently injured, but what happened to the man accused of murder is anyone's guess.The story ends years later without much mention of what transpired between that time and the big showdown. You learn a little of what happens in the lives of a couple of the characters and then it's over.This was an okay book, but not my idea of a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"scince fiction exotica","review":"I enjoyed \\"The Meek\\" right from the start. The chief protagonists are all burnt out whether by disappointments, personal loss or the struggle to survive. The arriving engineers engage an environment in Ceres which is completely unenvisaged by anyone. Here they meet a human derived /designed race who call themselves, the Meek. The Meek are not only alien but possess a proven and very worrying pedigree of savagery. Yet, despite their motivations, their responses, and even their physiology and appearance, it is the achievement of this author that they are revealed as fully human.The last portion of the book takes the characters to another very different world where the coalition of new and old humans discover their dependence on each other. Thoughtful, excellent (but never preachy) SF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much science in the fiction, but readable","review":"The story was enought to keep me reading, I'll grant that. But the details were like some teenager's first attempt. Asteroids are equipped with singularities to create gravity, but travel from Ceres to Earth is too expensive. If you can create singularities of planetary mass, little trips in the solar system are not going to bother you.Spacesuit oxygen supplies are calibrated to the second, people are in no distress until the timer goes \\"click\\" then they're suffocating.The orbital mechanics are positively Velikovskian in their convenience at times.Some parts seem informed by video games, rather than SF.Some of the writing is turgid, with sentences cluttered with more numbers than words.I think I got this free at Torcon - I hope I didn't pay cash for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concepts wrapped in boring and bland","review":"How is this book getting 5 star reviews? The characters are boring and unimaginative, and all apparently suffer from a total lack of believable emotional response. Supposedly abandoned base filled with hostile blue mutants? Meh. Life support crisis and serious threat of a slow, painful death? Yawn. Imminent inter-solar war with super mutants? Whatever. I've seen people get more worked up over lint.If this was ever made into a film it would be a $300 million dollar Michael Bay blockbuster with a cast made up of summer stock rejects.

They must be one of the most important but underrated bands currently around. With each new listening to this album, more beauty is revealed: the melodies are so intricate that it almost brings tears to the eyes. I find their music deeply spiritual and moving. Although some reviewers may say each Low album basically sounds the same, I find that they are experimenting and progressing with each new disk, except 'Things We Lost In The Fire', which was sheer perfection. It's marvellous that they can still retain the inner core of their beautiful harmonies even though 'The Great Destroyer' is moreup tempo than their usual minilimistic style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is a terrible Cd. I can't believe I wasted money on it. All hype and no substance. A perfect CD if your contemplating suicide and you need something to push you over the edge. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"lazy music for lazy people","review":"Low is one of the great con jobs of the century (young as it is). Their low-fi \\"gimmick\\" seems to be enough for their fans, who obviously celebrate amateurish playing and junior-high poetry class lyrics. Making it louder only amplifies their weaknesses. Only in Minnesota..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cue the Strings","review":"Much of the hype surrounding the latest Low claimed the band's formula had changed considerably, namely the songs were faster and cheerier. Well, they tempo increased for some songs, but otherwise it didn't differ from previous releases, which is a good thing. And despite the presence of lighter fare such as California and Broadway (So Many People), the song I continually return to is the one that most closely adheres to the \\"old\\" Low, Cue the Strings. Basically, as long as Alan and Mimi are harmonizing over a heartbreaking melody, I'm happy. If anything, Destroyer feels transitional, as if the change is on the horizon. Whether or not the new Low will be as successful as the Low we all know and love remains to be seen, for now fans can rest easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best of 2005 so far....","review":"I heard about this group a while ago. I have bought some of their albums. I finally saw them play live in 2004 and I got to meet them. They are real nice people. Listening to their previous albums, they are quiet and slow. It is dark music. Some of their live shows last year debuted the new material. People were shocked. This music was stronger and more powerful. Songs like \\"California\\" didn't seem possible in the past. Songs with such soaring melodies seem fresh and too positive for Low. New songs like \\"Everybody's Song\\" and \\"Just Stand Back\\" are reminiscent of early REM or The Replacements. There is some old school Low on here too, as on \\"Cut The Strings\\" which highlights the presence of Dave Fridmann as a producer. \\"Step\\" is simply a great song that needs to be heard. Low has some swagger on this album, as if they are trying to change the course of history. This is one of the best albums of early 2005 so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripped-Down Star","review":"As with \\"Live\\", these recordings feature Big Star as a lean and mean post-Bell trio. The rehearsal tapes are fairly well recorded and the performances are loose, raw and even a bit sloppy in places. In some ways, I prefer these versions to those on their two Ardent LP's. Kind of like seeing a beautiful woman without all of her makeup on. The live set includes a great cover of T.Rex's \\"Baby Strange\\" as well as Chilton's Box Tops classic \\"The Letter\\". The sound quality of the live tracks is fairly rough, but listenable. Just remember, \\"Nobody can dance, okay.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Star Redux","review":"A Big Star release is always welcomed and rare. This CD is a mix of 1974 rehersals in NY and a live 1974 gig in Memphis. While a live release with Chris Bell lineup would be the most desired new release; here we find Alex's workman-like run through of all the Big Star classics. This disc even finds Alex plodding through an unremarkable version of \\"The Letter.\\" Good quality sound and worth the investment. Perhaps \\"That 70's Show\\" will shine the light on the Ardent genius once again for those who missed it the first time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Big Star to Warm Your Soul","review":"This is a must for Big Star fans. The first half are demos and remastered takes in the studio and are o.k., but the second half is from a live Big Star show in 1974 and it is vintage Big Star and Chilton. I love it all--from the announcer requesting that the audience not dance (this was in Memphis in 1974!) to Chilton's singing on The Letter and Mod Lang. Great stuff and more evidence that this is the prototypic American rock band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinking Toy!","review":"I got this figure in the mail one day and I was excited to take it out.

By listening to both of them, it's evident neither of them know how to play their instruments.

I don't see why these ppl would care if their music was d-loaded anyway, it's horrible! i wouldnt d-load it for free if someone paid me. and the sad thing is I paid money for this. Don't listen to the hype here, they're just like the beatles....extremely over-hyped but when you listen to it all you're listening to is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as everyone is saying","review":"I bought this on the hype I read on here, and expected to find an enjoyable rock album. Although this album has some great guitar playing, the vocals is what really makes me diss this. It's like the singers voice doesn't mix with the songs, he sounds like the male version of Daphne & Celeste. His voice is too deep for this album...the tabloids should slow down their sound if they want their singer to sound any good (and not like some drunken fool), or they should fire him and hire a new one. Never again will I buy a cd that is so hyped like this one. If you want some good rock, buy Juliana Hatfield's 2 new releases, \\"beautiful creature\\" and \\"total system failure\\". the box set will give u a bang for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes an awesome gift for someone u hate","review":"I heard of these guys through their stopnapster.com site and I wanted to hear what they were like. All I have to say is that they are the most bloody awful band I have ever heard...this album is just plain terrible.

There is one good thing about it though, it would make an awesome gift for someone u hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth all the hype","review":"I have heard much better indie music than this. The vocals are annoying, they sound like something off a childrens show, and sometimes you might think scratching a chalk board or playing your favorite recording backwords would be more pleasureable to listen to. and no, i am not saying this because of their recent stand on napster. i am saying this because their \\"music\\" is utterly horrible. i can see why they did go after napster, they needed some sort of big promotional boost or what not. well whatever, don't buy this if you're a sane regular person. However, if you're a Shaggs fan (you are also seeking mental help too), this one is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOT HOT HOT","review":"I honestly can't tell you how the flavor is because it is SO HOT you can't taste the flavor.

It would be better for a 5-6 year old, not 3 as the box indicates. If your child is young, it is really difficult and frustrating. It is hard for little hands to put the cars together. This set is also big so that it doesn't fit in our train table. The track pieces are so long that alternate track layouts on the train table are very limited. With the batteries our son just watched the train go around and around. We bought a wooden set from Learning Curve which is much better. He can do the cars and put the track together by himself. Since it is not batterey operated, he is actually playing with it - instead of just watching it go around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I don't see how a 3 YO could possibly assemble/manuver/\\"fix\\" this train.

It is my opinion, that the book is not appropriate for young children because of this. I also found it especially disturbing when the main character enters the scene with a gun. what is that telling our children? I guess, I simply do not understand the whole structure or purpose of this book. Can anyone explain?

In addition, practically everything the author said about dyslexia is wrong.

Some of the bots are interesting but I was unable to build most of them because they require extra parts that don't come in the Lego Mindstorms RIS. That'd be OK if the book told you what extra part syou need but I'd get 70% done and find myself short 6 #3 elbows (or whatever). True, he lists the needed parts before each bot, but he doesn't tell you which ones aren't part of the RIS. Baum does. Also, the pictures in the book lack contrast so it is hard to see details and the \\"steps\\" aren't specific. Buy the Baum books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite 5 stars","review":"This book is a very good resource for learning the mechanical aspects of Mindstorms robots.

Building tips to help you understand the principals behind the design. Joe Nagata: just go to his web site to see his LEGO creations and you'll know you're in good hands. Some really inventive creations, like the \\"water skater,\\" a wheeled 'bot that propels itself using the same motion that a skater would use.CONS: You'll need more parts than come with the standard Mindstorms kit. The book doesn't seem to be laid out correctly -the instructions for the current frame are adjacent to the next frame. Once you figure it out, it's not a problem. Some of the models didn't work very well as built - this is actually a PRO if you like to learn by troubleshooting."},{"rating":"1","title":"beginners will enjoy it","review":"this is a very basic book, if you are just starting with MindStorms or if you are 12 years old, then you'll like it.

The salt and sand get stuck on the bottom of the boots because the bottom of the boots are not smooth. They feel like suede/fabric. Unless you toss them in the washing machine after every use, it is very hard to maintain them and dry them.After using for a few weeks, the bottom of the boots began to break. There are holes on the bottom towards the front of the boots (we do keep his nails clipped frequently). They are no longer waterproof anymore. The company's website stated that \\"many dogs have worn their Muttluks for over three years\\", but it only lasted just over a month for our dog. We never use them on dry pavement or concrete. We only use them to protect his feet from salt when there's snow.The boots are also not very easy to put on. It takes us about 10 min to put all of them on the dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely essential!","review":"I bought these for my miniature pinscher 2 winters ago because his tiny feet were so sensitive to the snow & ice in Kansas City.

We live in the city without a backyard so we go for A LOT of walks. Our muttluks have held up great and really help my dog when it comes to Wisconsin winter temperatures and salty sidewalks. I've never washed these boots and they've held up fine. At most, I will brush the salt and grit off the sole of the boot, then I just put them in their little mesh baggie and hang them up next to the radiator and they're warm, dry and ready for the next walk. Once your dog is used to them, putting them on and taking them off will go quickly.I'm not sure if my dog has noticed that his feet feel better when we walk outside in the winter, but I've noticed. He's able to walk longer distances and he's more willing to go outside with these boots, so that makes me feel a lot better.

Their solution for conflict and poverty assumes that every individual on the planet is, like themselves, a kind hearted, well-intentioned individual who will readily put their self interest aside for the betterment of others. Would that it were so.But it's not, and Morrison and Tsipis' naive utopian formula is no different from a thousand other utopian prescriptions.

The book would also serve a better purpose for individuals suffering low self-esteem and despair -if you are Afrocentric. I can appreciate a mild introduction to the Ancestoral lineage and spirituality however it serves a disppointment when an author of such educational caliber does not elaborate factually.

They are definitely NOT for the student who has not already had all the grammar. I can't imagine actually learning subjunctive from these tapes. What they do do is force the student to speak complicated sentences quickly and without pausing. They also introduce tons of great idiomatic expressions that i never learned in school--but have heard travelling. The vocabulary you learn with these tapes is very sophisticated, especially the stuff about business and economics. Other people have commented about the book--i can't really add to that because I use them exclusively in my car. What I have seen of the book seemed like a great complement.

The way the end challenge resolves was super laim.Susan Ward was the only redeeming part for me as a fan of hers but I'd rather just watch The In Crowd if I want to watch her in a sexy role.

This is a strange but enjoyable film as we watch the Doctor equally enjoy balllroom dancing and giving out death to those that wronged him. Virginia North is like a rose with thorns as Vulnavia, the assistant to Dr.Phibes. The sets are very colorful and the doctor's lair really helps to show the contrast between his overblown persona and the drabness of the world around him. The film also movs along very well and really holds your attention. This film is followed by the slightly superior Dr. Phibes rises again."},{"rating":"2","title":"True classic horror!","review":"Loved this film! It sends your imagination on a grisley, dark tour.

The trailer for this movie scared me so badly as a child, that I stayed away from cinemas until I was 7 or 8! Images of locusts dropping onto nurse's heads while they slept, bats and rats devouring people - I had nightmares for years! When I was finally old enough to sit through the movie on TV with the lights out, I found it to be extremely clever and scary, but also a lot of fun! Vincent Price is great, and the film has a sort of old-fashioned 'Sherlock Holmes' quality to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memories sometime fail us","review":"I remember PHIBES as being terribly scary when I first saw it.So when I saw this DVD I had to grab it to relive childhood memories....HMMMM......... ever noticed how many things are not as great as you remember them being when you were younger ?PHIBES was one of them.I guess as an 8 year old it was a great movie.... seeing it now it is simply another casualty of the 70's when too many movies were ruined by CAMP."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS DVD","review":"MGM Midnite Movies, not to put too fine a point on it, stink!

Alternately humorous and horrific, and Price is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Price-less waste of money...","review":"I have very fond memories of growing up and watching Vincent Price movies with my grandmother.

Basically, it's the life story of Uday Hussein, as told through the eyes of a fictitious sister, Pussay. It begins with Uday as a dictator's spoiled kid and follows him as he grows into a dictator's psychotic son whom everyone fears. His idea of a good time is shooting live ammunition into restaurants' chandeliers. That or kidnapping young Iraqi women off the street. Not a very sympathetic character. Sort of Veruca Salt meets Sonny Corleone meets Scarface meets Caligula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Clam (With a Bone in It)","review":"Never Mind the Pollacks is just like every other sanctimonious book that tells the history of rock 'n' roll and why we're supposed to care, but with one significant difference: this one is actually entertaining. I read it straight through in the course of one very empty day, which, in retrospect, probably was not a great idea, as this is a thing to be savored, but I couldn't help myself. I tried, Lord how I tried, but I simply could not help myself.

The \\"Catching Up with Neal Pollack\\" and discussion questions are the funniest parts of the paperback edition. Pollack fails to mine his rich comic premise of its full potential. He doesn't explore the opportunities for genuinely inspired humor in any of the scenes he depicts, choosing instead to fall back on the same tired formula: Pollack parties with rock stars, says obnoxious but unfunny things, and vomiting ensues. This is just lazy writing, and the author is capable of much better when he's comfortable with the form in which he is operating.

I was hoping to see the landscape of the tale to broaden my appreciation of the novels. It didn't happen.This film version is so low budget in appearance that my wife and I can't bring ourselves to finish it. Everything looks like it is a set and the acting is mediocre at best. The characters, which Undset's writing makes so real, look flat in this film. The soundtrack amounts to a single note played loudly for about a minute at a time. We found ourselves laughing!It's hard to believe it was made only 10 years ago - it looks like Cecil B. Demille. I think this story could make a great film - done in the Lord of the Rings style.

She builds her characters in such a way that you feel you can relate to them even when they are totally different from one another. Definitely would recommend this book to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Like many of the reviews here, I have also read many of Jodi's books and most of them I love, this one just wasn't up there. Whilst this is a promising story, Jodi does not live up to her usual expectations in this book. I won't go into the books plot, as that is covered in the dust jacket.The son's actions were irritating so he did not generate as much sympathy as he deserved - the idea behind his actions were good, but just didn't work in this intance. The mothers character is so annoying I found it difficult to finish the book. I couldn't muster any sympathy for her, she is made out to be such a clever woman, yet she acts like such a dunce - disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make my way through this one!","review":"I purchased this book at a local book store, looking forward to the great reading experience I had come to expect from Jodi Picoult. What a disappointment! I read about halfway through, thinking, after having read My Sisters Keeper and Handle With care, both of which were excellent books, that surely it would get better. It didn't. Finally, I put it aside, and have no interest in finishing it. I've read several Picould books, and, other than the two named here, all have been disappointing. I don't expect to purchase more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated R","review":"I liked how this book was written from different points of view and how the subject matter was thought-provoking. However, I did not like this book as well as Picoult's My Sister's Keeper. It was also difficult for me to read on a personal level due to my experience working with sexually abused children. This book contains some sex, bad language, and enough F words to classify it as rated R if made into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Perfect","review":"I loved \\"Plain Truth\\" and set out to read everythingby Jodi Picoult. If there IS another book of thatquality in her other novels please tell me. Perfect Matchstarts out as a page turner, gets absolutely disgustingas Nina becomes a vigilante---something totally farfetchedfrom an officer of the court. Through a contrived plottwist her actions become even more repulsive. It's veryhard to identify with a supposed experienced attorney whodoesn't bother to seek out credible evidence before takingthe law into her hands. The cold husband and puppy dogpoliceman add little to the story however the latter atleast is not completely offensive in his actions. Theending was bizarre and seemed as contrived as the rest ofthe book.Sign me as hoping that Ms. Picoult has another Plain Truthin her.

She's a bitchy, over-worked, non-maternal misguided woman, who does what she does for the wrong reasons. I don't like her, I don't like her actions and the only part of the book I can sympathize with is the indictment of the way our criminal justice system prosecutes pedophiles. Skip this one, but buy every single other one that Ms. Picoult has to offer, including the latest, Second Glance.

There is no doubt that this author can write, her literary talent is huge! But the fact is that I just couldn't feel engaged with the protagonist Nina Frost at all.

I would hate someone that hurt my child but I know that there is a reason we have laws."},{"rating":"1","title":"How desperate was I to read this book?","review":"I tend to only write reviews when I'm mad at myself for finishing a book, and here I go again. Why did I keep on reading? It started out that I'd wanted a good, gripping story, since I'd been doing a lot of heavy reading. I loved My Sister's Keeper, and thought I'd give another of Picoult's books a go. Well, I should have heeded the other 1 star Amazon reviews, which I just reread now. I agree with all of them. The main character Nina was completely unlikable and the story line preposterous: her son is abused, she accuses her husband of the abuse, kicks him out, finds she was sorely mistaken, and he comes back and is still in love with her? That is just the start of the silly plot line. I like a trashy story every once in a while but this was just plain silly.. and pretty predictable as well. I'm done with Jodi Picoult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This book convinced me that I'm no longer a Jodi Picoult reader. I get why some people would like it--the flowery imagery and heart-wrenching subject matter pulls at the heart; but I found the book to be overwritten and sensational. Besides, I couldn't identify with the main character who would add trauma to her already traumatized son by taking the law into her own hands. Picoult is known for her ability to end the story with an unforeseen twist and to effectively use various points of views; I guessed every twist in the book well in advance and I felt like each character had the same emotive voice, even the construction-worker husband. I like women's fiction, but this was a bit too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite...","review":"I have to preface this review by saying that my least favorite Jodi Picoult novel is still nothing less than brilliant. I was quickly sucked up into this story, as I am with all of Ms. Picoult's books; however, I found myself yelling at the book a couple of times and muttering \\"Come. On.\\"I found the protaganist, Nina, to be a supremely selfish woman. The straw that broke this camel's back was her reaction to (oopsy) shooting and killing the wrong man. Why should she get away with murder when her clients can't??Also, I could guess that the \\"father\\" Nathaniel was pointing at was most likely a priest. This brilliant lawyer couldn't? Finally, her poor, poor husband. She almost seemed happy to accuse him of molesting her son. Hello? Does she love her husband at all?Ok. I'll stop the tirade, although I could go on.For the most part, this book was a gripping read, informative and exciting. Usual, great Picoult-concocted mixture of romance, mystery and courtroom drama"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top","review":"I did not like anything about this one. Talk about going over the top in being unable to write even one character that would be believable. A too perfect 5-yr old, a workaholic mother that turns into an obsessive mommy, a wienie husband, an even bigger wienie love interest, a social worker/babysitter...just not one person to like. Throw them in with a plot that goes from strange to downright unbelievable and you've got a book that merits very little time or attention.This was my 2nd Picoult book and I must say I was very disappointed. The first (Second Glance) was what inspired me to try another of hers. I think I'll wait awhile before (IF) I risk it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This is my new favorite author. Her books are original and hit upon sensitive subject matters that may be too heavy for some, but if you are a true avid reader, trust me, you will appreciate her writing. This book deals with the too oft heard subject of child sexual abuse. I felt the mother's anger and who knows how we would react if put in the same position. I found the book to be so true to life. The little boy in the book, who really, is the center of this story, is a wonderful, loving character, I am sure all of us know someone like him. I also enjoyed the relationships the mom had with her long time friend, as well as the committment to her husband that shone through in the end of the book. Although this authors books do cover sensitive subjects, they should be required reading material in school for high school kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This is the only Picoult book I've read. Someone recommended her and I am always glad to find new authors. I had high hopes. This book was just dreadful. I could tell it was pretty bad early on, but I kept reading... thought it would improve. I didn't, I just should have stopped reading. I might try one more Picoult book but I won't keep slogging through if it doesn't seem better than this one.

And it stayed with me. A great book! Readers of Jodi Picoult novels will love Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin, similar to The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks"},{"rating":"2","title":"could not put it down!","review":"I love Jodi Picoult's books! And this was no exception for me. I found myself totally drawn into this story. After reading the book and reading the reviews here, it occoured to me that I didn't nesessarily like or dislike Nina, just found myself gripped by the story and horrified by the events. I definitely found myself thinking of this book for a few days after reading it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because Jodi's book, \\"The Pact,\\" is one of my all time favorites, and it would be the one to give the 5 stars to. If you are looking for a good summer read (and a quick read!) \\"Perfect Match\\" is a great pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for our Ethics class.","review":"Hope the other books are as good or better :-) gave it to mymom afterwards to read. I think she will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't give up on her yet!","review":"I enjoy reading books that Jodi Picoult has written. This particular book, however, disappointed me to no end. The idea of the story was excellent; it just wasn't developed fully. This book was more of what would happen to her if it was a perfect world. I found myself irritated and annoyed by Nina Frost. I actually hoped for a different ending. Usually, Picoult stays within the realm of reality. With this novel, however, she completely steps into her fantasies."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor charaterization & riduculous ending","review":"I've read most of picoults novels..to me she has great plots but very corny descrpitions of emotions and often un believable characters.\\"Perfect Match\\" started with an interesting and realistic premise.. child sexual abuse , the legal system and the church.However, about 100 pages in it went off the rails....I know im in the minority with this opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, disingenuous","review":"Graphic, spoilers. Everything is wrong with this story.1.If an author is going to cover abusive clergy, she should get it right. Granted, abuse could include grabbing an extremely young child and raping him, but that happens rarely, if ever. Ms.Picoult took the easy way out when she set up the abuse as a grab and rape scenario.2. Momma and daddy should have noticed something more than a sudden lack of speech. How about symptoms of tearing, such as bleeding, drainage, and pain.3. The happy family scenario at the end of the story doesn't wash, unless Ms. Picoult wanted us to view her protagonists as total narcissists. They weren't going to be a normal happy family. Mom was still a murderer. How will she explain to her child why she killed an innocent man.This is the third Picoult novel that I have read. All of them were awful. She takes the cause dejour, and sets up scenarios to tug the heartstrings. Mostly, they gave me heartburn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Picoult","review":"This book is just what I hoped for when I bought it. It is written in classic Picoult style - a controversial topic (and mystery) and its effects on one family. \\"Perfect Match\\" is incredibly absorbing. It's exactly the kind of intense story that won't let you put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farfetched","review":"This is the first book I have read by Jodi Picoult and the review I have written, but I felt I had to tell other people how farfetched this book was. First of all they make the woman in the book sound like a heroine when in fact she is an awful woman. It was ridiculous how she lead this one man on while she was married, and also how her husband and everyone else in the storyline accepted everything she did as just. The ending is just appaling and the book may not have even been so bad if it weren't for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Girls Is Incredible","review":"The film is not directed in anyway towards a type of audience that is the slighteset bit immature towards such subjects as discussed in this film. From the beginning, the emotion put in by Robert Downey Jr. and Heather Graham are amazing. The acting is some of the best seen from Jr. and is the best seen from Graham. Wagner also held her own as the cute 2nd girlfriend. The film was highly enjoyable and definitly worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat interesting failure","review":"Slice of life dramas are an increasingly rare phenomenon in contemporary cinema. A film like \\"Two Girls and a Guy\\" (What? No pizza place?) doesn't go very far in remedying the situation however. It's way too stodgy to inspire viewers to seek out other, perhaps more successful examples of the genre. The cast is impressive, the dialogue reasonably intelligent, but it drags so, you'll be relieved when it finally draws to an inconclusive end. Worth seeing for the acting, but ultimately solid performances are not enough to carry this tedious film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this really a movie?","review":"Where did this movie go? What took place in the end? Well I sure as heck couldn't tell anyone. Robert Downey Jr. gives the best performance he could, given the watered down script and plot.Here's the movie in a few quick seconds.1) Two girls find out they share a boyfriend.2) They confront him, and all start yelling screaming.3) One girl has sex with the guy, while other listens.4) Other girl, who listened offers to date both of them and instead of being a 'couple' they can become a 'triple'.5) Guy leaves to see his mom, brunette girls also leaves seperately, and blonde girl stays in the guys apartment.6) Guy comes back crying, due to his mother passing away. Blonde girl comes to console, he sits at piano and play while she rests her head on his shoulder.CREDITS ROLE.????????????????????????????????????????????????????????HELLO????? What the heck??????? Dumb, pointless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Girls and a Guy","review":"Two Girls and a Guy is a horrendous film that indulges itself in terrible and appalling dialouge that is as uninteresting and foolish as anything in recent cinema. The movie is based and is dragged through by a pretentious script that never captivates, moves or surprises. The film, it seems, almost makes a point to push the viewer away, so it can continue exhaustingly, with its own uninteresting world. The movie begins with two women finding out that they've been dating the same man for over ten months without knowing it. When he returns to his apartment, the girls confront and yell at him for the next hour and a half. For my ears' sake, I put the film on mute for about a fourth of it, after I realized that it was going nowhere at all. A terrible, terrible film with the exception of Robert Downey Jr.'s better- than- average performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Girls, A Guy and Zero Plot","review":"My roommate and I unfortunately wasted an hour and twenty minutes of our lives on this movie, perhaps the most frustrating complilation of bad acting and no plot that I have ever seen. We stayed awake until the wee hours of the night watching this movie, hoping for the shocking turn of events that would make the whole attempt worthwhile. That time never came. This movie was like the fight that you have with your boyfriend that takes hours and hours and nothing ever gets accomplished. For this reason, why would you ever watch, rent voluntarily or much to my horror even considering buying this god awful film? I feel it safe to say that I almost went bald viewing this film because I was constantly pulling at my hair, hoping for the torture to end.

When it said, \\"The following feature is rated NC-17...\\", I thought I was in for a real erotic treat. I sat through the entire movie and thinking it might have not been the NC-17 version but rather an R version. This is not the only reason I disliked the movie. We were not given enough background regarding Blake Allen's (RDJ)mother. Why was he so unnaturally attached to her? Also, who did he inherit his magnificent loft from?

I would have much rather had a double cheeseburger from McDonald's. Also i have no idea why every other review praises Natasha Wagner's performance in this.

She has no emotion in her voice and she is annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good at all, in my humble opinion","review":"okay... i rented this movie mainly because of its interesting title, and the things i read in \\"Rolling Stone\\" about it. but i found it to be a complete waste of time. i'll admit that the chaotic dialogue between the three main characters is at some points pretty entertaining, and the verbal revenge which the two girls exact upon the hapless bastard blake gave me something of a feminist rush, but that's about all the movie has going for it. i will conceed to the fact that robert downey jr. possesses a lot of talent, and he definitely does the only good acting in this film. however, the film itself seems to have no point whatsoever, and worse than that, it has one of those really annoying inconclusive non-endings. it might have redeemed itself if it had at least some good sex scenes... =D.

Two girls (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson-Wagner) discover that they are dating the same man (Robert Downey, Jr.) and decide to confront him. Yes, many dialogues ensue, and Downey, Jr. is his entertaining self, but there is nothing else redeeming about this film.

There are many things wrong with this movie and one of them is the language, it was awful. it was so bad that it drew your attention away from the rest of the dialog, another is the characters there are not really people like this in the world who would just sit around and talk about the kind of things that are discused in this movie instead o being billed as a comedy, this movie should of been billed as a list of insults to call people.

Basic flaw was the script - two women discovering they had the same boyfriend could have turned into something clever or even funny. I kept waiting for clever or funny but it never happened.

A hugely talented actor, RDJr saved this movie! I feel sorry for RDJr because of what he had to work with. An endless conversation with these two terrible actresses and a horrible ending?

It would be every guy's fanatasy if the two beautiful women he was \\"doing\\" found out he was canoodling each of them and when they find out all they do is chew him out for not being honest about it then say, \\"I know, why don't we all three date.

Pitted against his brother when the nation of America tore itself apart, Dahlgren sought to found a dynasty in the south but endured crushing losses in battle. His turbulent life and times make for fascinating reading in this carefully researched, up close and personal account.

It re-inforces Dr. Subramaniam's unimitible style and mastery over the instrument. The piece Dr. Subramaniam played on the 5th track \\"Walking in a dream\\" is a real beauty. The track \\"Illusion\\" is a slow but powerful piece with some middle ease (arabic?) style music fused with modern jazz. Very impressive.

The maxim, \\"make it as simple as possible, but not simpler\\" definitely applies here. The only major challenge with this book is that a reader may come away with a notion of inflated comprehension. This is not a fault...just a byproduct of the big contrast between the clarity of the Dill (and Bromberg) text and the other, technically obfuscated, textbooks and articles in the field.Easily the best (introductory) textbook on statistical physics that I have encountered, and the only one that I can heartily recommend to a student or non-specialist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dill isn't just for Pickles","review":"I used this excellent book by Ken Dill for my stat mech class along with Chandler.

The video does have the usual lovely, even breathtaking shots of Seville, accompanied over 90% by the most annoying background music you've ever heard. This is not a documentary. There is a narrator who comes in very very occasionally and has a vague word to say. But this is not an educational video by any stretch of the imagination.

The result is a bizarre mixture of barbarism, fad culture and civilized neighbourly rivalry. I found it fascinating, entertaining and darkly funny.What made it funny was that, despite the extremity to which the aspects of suburban living had been taken, it was all very familiar. The satire is sharp, but Antrim manages to express it as an insider telling a shared joke, rather than as an outsider taking pot-shots at another's culture.I enjoyed this book immensely. Antrim's second novel, The Hundred Brothers, is also very good, but I think I liked Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully hilarious dark humor","review":"Like most coastal towns, Elect Mr. Robinson takes place in a world slightly askew of our own.

Sort of misses the point--and now I can't return the book! The author writes in a train-of-thought style that is difficult to follow, and his examples are often poorly documented in b&w, when color would have been a better choice (despite what Coriolis says, this book is *not* entirely in full color).

It is not a battery hog either. My one and only complaint is the same one that a previous reviewer mentioned. The cover for the CD player is very difficult to open. In fact, my grandson cannot open it. We must open it for him. And then once you open it, the cover tends to come completely off.

She has a lot of good ideas, a lot of great spiritual advice, and a lot of experience to share - I found the book very helpful.For the record, we use attachment parenting and I didn't find this book offensive [as the previous reviewer did].

She leans more that way, it is true, but she is kind of fence sitting as far as it goes.That being said it is an excellent intro to the principles behind Catholic homeschooling, and she recognizes there were Popes before John Paul II and a Church before Vatican II. This in itself puts the book FAR ahead of Hahn and others, who think that the Church was started in 1962."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr Clark may be hard to read, but its not fundamentalist","review":"I just read the critcisms of this book.

I disaggree with anybody who says she should not push Seton curiculum. Why not. She's not the founder of Seton. Ann Caroll is. But she runs and controls it now.

Seton Home Schooling is a joke and a bad one at that. It applies unreasonable pressure to a already high pressure situation in schooling your own child. Clark and her minions are rightly condemned whenever and for whatever reason they are. Hers is a false 'more-Catholic-than-Catholic' snobbery which should be disregarded.Any one that suffered through a Seton year of school knows what I speak of...and if you haven't then you have no right to talk!

He obeys me without physical violence. And the part of the book that says it is a form of perversion to co-educate girls and boys in the same classroom. What if you homeschool and have a girl and boy. Should they always stay in separate areas of the house. Her expectations are ridiculous in my opinion. The only part of the book I found somewhat applicable was the snippet on telling your in-laws and grandparents you are homeschooling and the chapter on socialization.Her ways are far too strict and her writng was confusing at times.

For Clark, \\"It's MY way or the highway. Nobody is TRULY Catholic but us.\\" Well, I'm sorry, but that isn't true. For one thing, Dr. Clark is NOT the pioneer that she claims to be (as a reviewer points out below, Mrs Anne Warren Carroll is the TRUE pioneer, who Clark has co-opted). For another thing, the materials she charges struggling home-schooling families so much to use are of such a poor quality; they are often tattered photocopies that have been endlessly recycled. Finally, the rigid approach to homework rushes, overwhelms and then exhausts the kids, even though they're top-students over all. So now, at the end of one more boring and frustrating semester, WE QUIT!

Twice they have said they'll send me an RMA shipper, but nothing ever comes!! Horrible service.Do yourself a favor and stay away from Bosch.

This replacement is much stronger thatn the original and holds a charge longer. The drill is now a top performer! I did have to call Bosch before purchasing to make sure it would work with my drill and charger which it does.

It is available for 20% less from other online retailers. I am surprised because Amazon is usually competitively priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor capacity","review":"I have a complete set of Bosch 18v tools that have seen very little use due to poor battery performance. The original set (non BlueCore) lasted for only a few cycles before failing. One melted the plug end, the other quit taking a charge. I replaced them with a pair of the newer BlueCore. These did slightly better with good capacity but again had very short lifespan, providing perhaps half dozen cycles. I was about to dump the whole tool system but decided to try one more set of batteries. This latest pair from Amazon have very limited capacity, far less than my old 9.6v Makita, but are working and hopefully after a few cycles the capacity will improve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"Item arrive quick ,and works great,reasonable price ,not knock off will, highgly recomendable.Work perfect in my 5 years old kit and add a kick i didint felt in some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great battery!","review":"Blue Core so far charges quicker and runs a lot cooler than my old batteries.

I followed the charging and draining instructions to the letter, and now after six or seven months of storage, the battery is dead. I always drained the battery after use, never left it in the charger, and never overheated it. I'll bet I don't have more than 60 minutes of total run time on this battery! I am very disseminated in the performance of their ni-cad junk. I do, however, like the jig saw and will buy a corded model. I have a DeWalt combo pack that I have been very happy with and will continue to buy DeWalt Cordless. If you only need a cordless Bosch for a short time and then plan to sell it, it will work.

Now that everyone can see the Wookie battle that's been over 20 years in the making, it's only right that people can have the action figures to go along with the different Wookies, too. Everyone always seemed to be impressed with Chewbacca and his size and fright factor. However, just by looking at the action figure, Tarfful makes Chewie look like a young pup. Tarfful at least appears to be much larger than Chewbacca. His fur is also a mixture of gold, brown, and white. And he's got dreadlocks. Tarfful comes with a Wookie bowcaster that actually shoots a \\"projectile.\\" Just don't shoot it too far otherwise you might loose it. An impressive addition to any STAR WARS collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ricky Ullman is Raviv now..","review":"Being one who enjoys following up-and-comers, this movie was great to watch.

It should be popping open minds - or should have been, since it was actually written a while back - all over the world, along all disciplines. If nothing else, it has made me completely relax regarding my child's report card and whether or not she does well in a conventional educational sense. I trust that Ken is right because I simply feel that he is speaking a very obvious truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNORE!","review":"Like some other reviewers, I had high hopes for this book after seeing Robinson's TED talk on creativity and schools. Honestly, for a book about creativity, this is one of the least creative books I've read in a while.I'm an avid reader and typically read at least 1 - 3 non-fiction books a month. I started this quite a while ago and have yet to finish it. It was just so boring.This is not to say that there is no valuable information; it's just not presented in a very fresh way.I also took the rating down because of the subtitle of the book. This book is not about learning to be creative... at least not up to halfway through it. I expected more technique for enhancing my own creative skills. This book didn't deliver what it seemed to promise in the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading","review":"This book is essential reading for anyone involved in education. It is a new world, an entirely different world and education and commerce well never be the same. This book provides analysis with respect to where we are and establishes a strategy for dealing with the future. We ignore these realities at our peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy","review":"Didn't like it. I could hardly get through the first chapter. It's not nearly as accessible as 'The Element'. (Which is an amazing must-read of Robinson's work.) I'm looking forward to reading the more reader friendly 2010 version with updated information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read with a few cheesey lines","review":"Overfal is my first David Dun and it was a fast-paced thrill ride. Sam Wintripp rescues actress Anna Wade as she is running from corporate crazies who have altered her brother's mental stability.Thus lies a tale with some cheesey dialog, scenes that are totally unrealistic - and a great plot that will keep the reader going.There are some scenes that I simply couldn't hold back the laughter, but the writing is so good - and the plot interesting enough - that it kept me hooked. Dun gets a little long winded with explanations of overfals and brain activity (those parts I tended to skim), but I liked this book enough to want to read more. And, like the female I am, I hope Sam Wintripp finds a woman to give him the balanced harmony his Indian mother says he lacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved Overfall because of the chemistry between Sam and Anna and the repartee as well as the fast moving plot. It was original, imaginative and kept me guessing all the way to the end. Anna as a celebrity was realistically portrayed and amazingly wasn't boring. Dun did a good job of making her touchable and of enabling the reader to see her life before she became famous. We could therefore be somewhat empathetic. It's hard to give highly successful people a touch of humanity and he succeeds. Sam is interesting because of his life style, his profession and his aloofness which makes Anna's conniving and plotting to romantically ensnare him a fascinating little sub-plot. The evil guys and gals are very well-done and a story unto themselves. All in all Dun has written a sophisticated entertaining thriller with just the right amount of everything for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"Perhaps it's just me but the main character in this book is too over the top. It got to be redundant the constant reminders of how much Melina loves sex, men, etc. Yet she feels hurt when Sebastian politely questioned the paternity of her child. What about loose ends. What happened to these wayward Mothers who left their children. They got enough coverage in the book but no resolution. Is Diana buried in GrandMa's back yard; Are these questions to be answered in another book? I like the author's style of writing, just not this character."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Michael Palin Around the World in 80 Days DVD!","review":"I've been waiting for the Palin DVD of Around the World.

Oh, well. I guess everybody can't be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shake hands with Barry Crimmins","review":"Crimmins' satire can lacerate like razor wire. It's also laugh-out-loud funny. His comments on the current White House administration, and Conservatives of nearly any ilk, are biting and savagely witty. But even those who don't subscribe to the author's partisan ideology should be impressed by several thoughtful essays in this book - ruminations on his hometown near the Finger Lakes, a eulogy for a cancer-stricken friend, his fond memories as founder of the Boston comedy scene circa 1979, his introspective examination of how annual copious snowfall in Central New York state creates hearty skeptics, an encounter with a lost boy and a Good Samaritan. These essays and others show that the author is more than just a political animal. He's also a keen observer of the human condition (a hallmark trait of any fine satirist). Mainly, though, the book focuses on Crimmins' high-principled views, which are insightful, unapologetic, and often very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"Crimmins will have you laughing out loud as you get to know him and upstate New York. You will feel his pain, you'll laugh out loud, and you'll feel for the relationship of Barry and his dad. A must read, especially if you're a left winger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as a gift","review":"I purchased this Movie for my grandson and he loved it.

It's a scary movie, true. And the effects and design of the film are breathtaking.But this is an awful, awful movie. The plot is rediculous and frequently predictable. There are parts of the movie that I found absolutely sickening, and I have a strong stomach for gore. The ending is terrible, and also predictable.It's a mean-spirited, badly acted, predictable, poorly written, disgusting piece of garbage movie.But it is a scary horror movie.Hope I hammered my points home.

There are scenes that are almost inspired in their eery feel and imaginitive creepiness. But you can't make a movie with just this. You need a story and this movie just doesn't have one. Compare this movie to the Alien Movies where the special effects were also inspired and something to talk about but the special effects were the supporting cast to a great story. In this movie the special effects are the main star and it just doesn't make for a good movie. A good video game yes, but movie no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent Hill the movie","review":"I went to see this movie because it was the only \\"scary movie\\" showing at the time. I'm really into video games, however, I've never played any of the Silent Hill fourpiece. I found that this movie left me unentertained, confused, and overall angry at the usher. Granted that Silent Hill is chock full of suspense, I was never even close to the edge of my seat. I would've rather paid $8.50 to see Iron Eagle IV instead of this attempt at a film. Whomever produced/directed this movie should stick to video games or be shot in the kneecaps. It has some okay special effects, and the plot alone had potential to be a video game-movie that for once didn't suck. But it didn't. If you are thinking about seeing Silent Hill with your boyfriend or girlfriend, just send me a money order for the cost of the tickets, and I'll travel to your home and slap both of you in the face. At least this way will be less humiliating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best horror game to movie adaptation","review":"Very faithful to the series even goes as far as using the music from the game by the same music producer. Original characters made for the movie that are similar to the characters in the game without having to be repetitive. Good plot overall and very terrifying moments where you can sympathize with the main characters and also has an ending that will leave you with an empty feeling in your stomach.Silent Hill the movie rocks and is til this day one of my fav horror movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"corney","review":"This was garbage a real waste of time, nothing shocking and thrilling about this movie just plain boring.

Unfortunately, the ending was too \\"blockblusterish and really did not fit the atmosphere of the early part of the film and was a big let down. The ending kept this movie from being a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter waste of time!","review":"I have to agree with the other opinions given by amazon customers.This movie was not worth taking the time and watching. The script was far from good from the very beginning. For one, I think that if I had a child having dreams about this \\"mysterious\\" place called Silent Hill and was sleep-walking to the edges of cliffs, that I'd take her for a ride to the local psychiatrist and have her take a look at things.The special effects were okay. I thought the image of the burnt girl was a little unrealistic considering that people don't turn BLACK when they burn, but they were the best part of the movie.I absolutely HATED the ending to it. I have to say it; the movie started out bad and ended up worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Awful Awful Awful Awful Awful Awful","review":"I wish that I could have given this movie less than 1 star, but the system wouldn't let me. This has to be the worst, plotless movie that I have EVER seen. I kept watching it, because I thought that it had to get better, but it kept getting worse. Let me repeat, there is NO plot whatsoever. I can't believe that a mainstream movie company actually greenlighted this script. Do NOT waste your money!!!p.s. Like 10 minutes of this mess of a movie would not have been enough, it is WAY too long, and lasts about 2 hours (which feels like 7 hours)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear Factor Zero, Entertainment Factor -1","review":"Okay, if you liked the games, then you'll probably like the movie, but for everyone else - don't waste your time.Falling ash, weird creatures, and an incoherent storyline don't make for good entertainment. It's sad, because there was great potential here for a movie that would appeal to everyone (gamers and horror fans alike).Too many questions aren't answered (what happened to Alessa? Did she die in the hospital? Did her tormentors in the parallel die in real life? No explanation of the religious beliefs, etc, and why won't the survivors of the town talk?) The ending is completely unsatisfying.Buy the games instead of the movie.

I'm glad I did -- it was very well done, and appropriately creepy, disturbing etc.It's undeniable in its eye-candy appeal. My only criticism is that it could have been shorter, but then again, that would have detracted from the deliberately \\"videogame\\" feel of the whole thing.I never thought I'd be writing a positive review of a film based on a game, but there you go.

Man, what an image!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adaptation","review":"If you enjoyed playing Silent Hill back in the day, you WILL enjoy this movie. It's been almost a decade since I played they game, but this movie brought back some fun memories. Like the game it's based on, it's atmospheric, gory, and tense. I avoided it because of the bad critical reviews, but I don't think they approached this one from the right angle. This is a superior adaptation of a video game. If you haven't played the game, the Ring-like plot may seem hakneyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a copy of this on dvd - this does not feature all the stuff that the DVD has, would not buy!","review":"If you want this movie for the first time, then go for it -- this review has no reflection on the movie itself.I have the DVD movie and it's pretty clean on the DVD. The DVD even has a bonus disk that gives you all the commentary, interviews, making of, origins, etc. This blu-ray package does not.Seller is false advertising here.

I have never been so divided by opinions. On the one hand the movie has the darkest most ghoulish touch I've ever seen. It's as if man's mind was split open and evil were permitted to drip across the screen. The visuals are too striking to do them justice with mere words.On the other hand, the plot and acting were so poorly thrown together you'd think it was a dress rehearsal and they were making it up as they went.The soundtrack is a bonus as it encompasses a lot of what makes the series shine. Sadly, it is used around THIS cast of characters who aren't fit to be in Silent Hill to begin with.My advice; if you are a Silent Hill fan, it's a must see for the sheer backdrops of creation. If you aren't a fan, this movie will likely make sure you never become one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Atmosperic Creeper","review":"Why, oh why do people insist on writing reviews that tell the whole friggin movie? There, I've vented. I don't know anything about the video game, but I enjoyed this film. Radha Mitchell gives a convicingly intense performance.

It started out well, and had that cute little girl actress who was in both Smallville and Supernatural, but as another reviewer said, \\"the plot was tangled beyond repair,\\" and I think that's a good way to describe it.

That is, if we're referring to cardboard cutouts of actual humans.The demon creatures are terrifying. If you're under age 7 and have never seen a horror movie before.Not scary. Not suspenseful.

Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror-ble!!!!","review":"Once again, as an avid horror movie fan, I have to say that I've been dupped again by Hollywood and the complete garbage that they pump out in this modern era.First of all, there is a complete lack of explaination of what is going on in the begining of the film. I'm not sure if this script was written by a 10 year old or what, but the dialouge may be amongst the worst I have ever seen.It appears that this movie is taken from a video game (which it is) considering that the effects look nothing more than just that - a high budget video game.Not scary, not well written at all, not suspensefull, not even worth renting at your local video store. It was so bad that I wanted to throw it into the garbage when I was done.If you kids (assuming from your five and four star reviews you gave, you're all under 16?) want to watch a solid horror movie or two, try The Burning, The Prowler, Maniac, or the recenty release and remake of the Hills Have Eyes.

The LOOK of the picture is intriguing, with some relatively strong horror effects. However, there are too many scenes of people just walking around, not really doing anything. To put it another way, when the lead character sees the monsters, she usually just screams and runs away. She rarely does anything to combat them. And there were too many things in the plot that made no sense. The Silent Hill movie just never really grabbed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot....what plot?!?","review":"Disjointed, seemingly never-ending flow of images that make no sense and get boring about half-way.

When she and the police officer are there it is the creepy hell that the movie is about, but when the Father and the other officer are there it's just a regular abandoned town.Towards the end the mother is at home and she can't see her husband (well she acts as if she can see him, but we don't) and he can't see her.

I purchased this disc because the 1080p trailer available on the PS3 online store looked interesting and was very sharp. The transfer on this disc is inferior to the downloadable PS3 trailer. I disagree with the other reviewer who stated that the transfer was sharp and who disparages the negative reviewers for having inferior tv's.I have a 67\\" DLP 1080p television that is ISF calibrated. The other blu-rays discs I've watched (Underworld Evolution, Devil Wears Prada; even the single-layer Talledega Nights freebie that came with the PS3 - which has a worse transfer than the retail double-layer unrated version) exhibited much better sharpness and clarity. The transfer on this disc is closer to a good upscaled standard DVD than a good Blu-ray or HD-DVD (which I also own).I give this movie a one-star because its the transfer is not worth the premium paid over the standard DVD version of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid movie","review":"I got this movie because my bf wanted to go see the new one that just came out.

So, they tap into past successes and make a mess of them... or... they tap into video games and bring them to the screen.All I have to say is that on paper the idea of this movie may have had some merit up until the point where the mother finally reaches the town. After that it becomes Mad Max versus The Hills Have Eyes.If you are a true horror movie fan, as I am, you may find yourself snoring through this one. It actually does not make sense once you get into the town and meet the creatures and people who live there.If I could, I would have given this a half a star. Don't waste your time or money... if you really want to see it wait until it's released on television, which should be soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE FILM... BAD BLU-RAY EDITION...","review":"This film has such great visuals...It is such a shame this Blu-ray version, who should be great, is in fact so mediocre I could swear I was watching a standard DVD.Some people say it is the codec they're using... I don't know... but the image here is fuzzy and full of artifacts. I don't know what's still going on... these blu-ray releases keep coming out far below what they should.Such a shame. I regret to say, HD-DVD still has no competition.The film is great.Its blu-ray edition is not.And no extras??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"SILENCE NOT SO GOLDEN","review":"Not being a fan of the video game that inspired this movie, I must admit I found it visually stunning but ultimately confusing and empty. From reading other reviews, some of the enormous plot holes make sense, but if a movie isn't honest enough to let all viewers know what's going on, then has it achieved its goal as entertainment?The sets, atmosphere and effects are marvelous, but the performances are lacking, with the exception of Alice Krige as the nutty spiritual leader. But once again, we have yet another movie in which a demonic little girl wants to possess another innocent little girl. Been there, done that, and frankly I wish writers would come up with something a little more inventive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faithful Adaptation?","review":"Yes this movie is certainly better than any other video game film ever made, but its really not that great anyway. I really wasnt expecting much though, so i wasnt surprised when they completely destroyed the plot and tried to explain everything to the dumb american audiences who can only understand sarcasm and irony, half of the time at that. Bottom line they took away what made silent hill so great, the unexplained, the surreal, and the atmosphere. But hey if you like movies like Saving Silverman and Donnie Darko than you'll no dought love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 black holes","review":"Why did I give this movie three black holes?

Husband likes playing the games better then watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid,","review":"Sadly, a film of this genre is often simply an excuse to engage in special-effects excess, and, in terms of any positive content, very little else. Fortunately, this title brings much more to the table. Yes, there are special effects in Silent Hill, but they are actually quite understated, and they never become self-indulgent or otherwise upstage the cast. The mood and feel of the video game is present, but the film's story is entirely accessible to everyone, game-player or not. The performances are generally solid throughout, with little to nit-pick about. Clearly, this sort of film isn't everyone's cup of tea, but most horror film fans should be very pleased. This is a tight little gem of a horror movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshingly Original Horror Movie That Stays True To Its Origin...","review":"as a fan of the game series, I was very sceptical when I heard that this movie was being made. As a huge Resident Evil fan, I was very dissapointed with the movie as an adaption, so I was very cautious, not expecting much...Silent Hill brings a new meaning to the word CREEPY. Its marvelous atmosphere helps sell the horror, and the monsters, while most not in the games, are true to the nature of the creatures from the video game franchise. The story deviates slightly overall from the game's but for the most part the themes are identical. Many of the characters in the movie are true to their video game counterparts...Overall I reccomend this movie as not only an entertaining horror movie, but as one of the best game to film adaptions I have seen so far..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Bizarre...","review":"I had no idea this movie was based on a video game. It is absolutely the most bizarre and visually disturbing movie I have watched since Jacob's Ladder. I will probably check out the video game after seeing this.I gave it 4 stars because of the barely there plot. It seemed like the movie was just hell bent on cramming in as much SFX as possible. The scene with the nurses towards the end of the film was really spooky. I would never be able to pass through them."},{"rating":"1","title":"In My Restless Dreams I See That Town....Silent Hill.","review":"Ok, A lot of good in this film...and a lot of bad. Its important to know Im a huge fan of the video game series so thats how Im reviewing this movie. The film starts off REAL strong. Lot of good ideas/scenes/acting. But the last 30 maybe 40 minutes of the film killed it for me. Without giving away anything story wise, lets just say the last 40 minutes not Silent Hill style at all. Feels like your watching two different films all together.Now, with that being said its seems every silent hill fan is different. Some LOVE this film. I am really confused why if they are a fan of the video game series. Long story short, I own the film and watch it from time to time. Its a good stand alone film but not as a silent hill film."},{"rating":"2","title":"its ok","review":"this is a great movie to watch on your psp. tho i dont think its as good as resident evil 4 the action fact. but it is pretty scary but not pee your panties scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great visuals... but where are the screenwriters?","review":"This film is one long beautiful piece of Art Director's delight. Every frame is a visual feast.But that is all.The script is incomprehensible and makes no sense whatsoever. The first half of the film is just the mother running after an irritating little girl who won't stop. The second half is impossible to understand... But it has to do with witches, a molested child, a crazy cult, freak monsters and a group of nurses who should be on that Madonna video \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" (that was what they reminded me of) LOL.This is the example of a film that follows so close a game structure that it ends up being just a hollow and uninteresting game narrative without the game parts... like if someone had sewed together all the exposition parts of the game.Dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD will not become worn out...","review":"This DVD will not become worn out - as least not at my house. The plot was tangled nearly beyond repair and it did not give me the thrills that I desire from a \\"scary\\" movie. Admittedly, I am not a blood and guts fan but I expect a good story line that does not challenge my ability to put the pieces together. And disgust does not replace a good old-fashioned shriek of fright. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"True fans of the game will end up disappointed","review":"The movie starts out pretty good, and I must say that the music and the visuals are incredible in this movie. However, WHY did they change the cult mythology that was essential to the silent hill game? Instead of a pseudo-satanic cult trying to give life to a demon, the movie has a wacked out fundamentalist christian cult that wanted to cleanse evil. That made NO sense, and it really detracted from what would otherwise have been an acceptable adaptation of a frightening video game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very sad movie but very scary....","review":"This movie has a very sad storyline but it is necessary for the plot and folds into it well. It's not fit for the little ones as it has some very gory, graphic, and scary scenes so make sure you put your babies to bed before watching this. It has all the right elements for being a cult classic and has really good acting. It's good to have for the library collection of best horror movies ever as it will scare the you know what out of you in a couple of places. The ending is bittersweet and sorta sad but I'm not going to spoil it for you. I'd recommend watching this movie if you like to blend the weird with the macabre. Alice Krige gives a spectacular performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"silent hill","review":"I have seen many horror movies and this one scared me so bad I fell out of my seat. Some parts are kind of confusing but it was scary. The ending is surprising and one of the parts I did not like."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game Movie","review":"Let's just say it wasn't the best movie but I liked it. The creatures were what made the movie for me! They were so weird and creepy that it made Resident Evil and DOOM look like rag dolls! I've never played Silent Hill and I heard if you have the movie will suck, but the movie makes me want to buy the original! Anyway people are complaining that the FX look fake. Well I did some research and found out that most of the creatures were people in costume! HA! And besides stop complaining about how real it's suppose to look! You can't make everything look too real! Do we play video games to complain about the graphics? No! We do it to have fun, that's what a movie is for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Expected","review":"Going into this movie I was expecting an edge of your seat thriller from my experience with the game, to my disappointment I found myself nodding off from boredom after 30 minutes. This movie could have been far more interesting and entertaining by foregoing the two realities which I don't remember being in the game. The ending also turned me off completely, it was one of those ungratifying ones that leave you feeling like you wasted two hours. The story was interesting at points but it took far to long to develop the plot almost felt like it was trying to fill time to make it longer. Rent it first for you may regret doing that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric B-movie, Vivid Imagery, No Need For Plot","review":"I saw this film without knowing it was a video game adaptation.Truly atmospheric little cult gem here. What it lacks in plot, it makes up for in other departments. It's more of a \\"Nightmare Drama\\" than a horror film.List of what works well, in order of success: (1) atmosphere/mood/tone, (2) imagery. What's sufficient: acting, music. If you're looking for anything else, look elsewhere.You will find it useful to have no expectations, and a few minor suspensions-of-disbelief for the initial set-up to work.It's NOT a Romero-level masterpiece, not a landmark/zeitgeist-nailing/cultural-defining moment, but an enjoyable ride nonetheless.Compares on many levels to the 1962 version of \\"Carnival of Souls.\\" If that film is now considered a masterpiece by some, at least a masterpiece of atmosphere, then \\"Silent Hill\\" is another masterpiece in that same tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh nice Horror Movie check it out it worth the buy for a good price on here :) i just love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I am a guy who loves horror movies, the more scary or disturbing the better.

I thought this movie was the pits. Truly the pits. I am shocked there have been any positive reviews. It was not scary, not in the least. The storyline didn't flow and there were large holes and things that just didn't make sense. I heard audible sighs throughout the theater during the whole movie....and yes, some were coming from me. Pass on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring...","review":"This has to be the worst, most boring horror film I have seen in years.

Don't bother with this, if you want to see a few good horror flicks check out The Devil's Rejects or The Hills Have Eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"There really isn't much to say about this movie. It's basically 2 hours of a woman being attacked by strange monsters while she looks for her daughter. The story is extremely weak, and makes very little sense. The acting is cheesy. The only positive thing I can say about the movie is that it was nice to look at. Just gets old real fast. I really can't recommend this movie, although some may be dazzled to amusement."},{"rating":"1","title":"The triumph of evil","review":"I went to see this movie because I was intrigued by the creepy creatures shown in the previews and the mystery of what had happened to the town. What I got was a sick, demonic revenge fantasy, with several scenes of disgusting and disturbing violence that I find difficult to get out of my mind. Although some of the creatures are truly unique, creepy, and well rendered, and the use of sound and music to affect mood are pretty good, everything else about the movie is just horrible. A grotesque caricature of religious fundamentalism, scenes of horrible violence, and a conclusion that offers not even the slightest shred of redemption for any of the characters, just the total triumph of evil, hatred, violence, and death. Reprehensible trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent Hill, shouldn't be seen or heard","review":"Possibly the most incoherent and plot-less movie I've ever watched. Actually, in my opinion, worse than Plan Nine from Outer Space. From beginning to end, it makes little or no sense and for that reason I simply can't give it more than one star. The acting is fair, but the script is so poor that it can't compensate. The special effects are good, but again, without a sensible plot and set up, they're pointless, they're just an exhibition of effects. There are so many superior ghost/horror stories out there, don't spend your money or time on this one. I wish I could get my two hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I rented the DVD and didn't waste my money","review":"I was really excited about this movie, as I've played the Silent Hill game and loved it. It's really sad when the video game had more plot than the movie did.It might have been better if they'd done the plot to Silent Hill 2 where a man comes to Silent Hill because his dead wife is sending him messages to meet her in Silent Hill. That would make more sense than the thin plot of this movie.While the sets were exactly as in Silent Hill, you really need more than that to make a good movie. You need a real story. And this one doesn't really have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I guess you have to be a \\"fan\\" of the video game to appreciate the garbage movie this was. Drab and depressing movie with a terrible ending you could see a mile away. Honestly, this has to be the stupidest movie I've ever seen and would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"F'ing awesome","review":"I was a bit disappointed when I heard they were making this movie, considering I'm a bit of a gamer and have played the original Silent Hill, and perhaps everyone else noticed but movie adaptions of video games aren't always spectacular(Take Resident Evil for example) but of course I decided I would stick it out and see if it was worth it.It was, granted they changed the lead to a woman(which was better suited due to the motherly nature of the male lead in SH1)and of course they added a more descriptive back ground to Silent Hill, but they were not changes so drastic that it ruined the film, in fact this is one of the best films adapted from a video game that I have seen recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything was okay but...","review":"With the shipping and how everything looks like was god.

So I had to switch to a different brand, which I'm not very pleased with. Also the gel (I didn't try to use it with foam though) cools too quickly after I put it on my face, so it doesn't do the job of warming up my skin at all.I consider it pretty much a waste of my money.In addition, I saw this product in a local discount store for half the price the other day.

The older model of which we had for 5 years (probably made in the USA) was manufactured correctly & lasted until the heating element gave up the Ghost after 1,825 uses. The newer model (probably made in CHINA) looks cheaper made and not able to clasp on the lip of the shave cream due to the part that clasps is too small & wrong angle & poor quality.

The problems with this thing is:1) The gel does not get warm enough even at its highest setting.2) It cools off to room temp as soon as you get it to your face.If you do not want clutter on your counter then you have to put it away after each use.3) It recommends that you unplug it after and between uses.4) Very hard to clean.This would work great if you could dispense it from the can right onto your face.

Whether you are self-publishing, or need to communicate intelligently with your publisher, this book will be of great use.Its strengths are in explaining the editorial, production and design process. It is less strong in explaining marketing. It contains a glossary which is very good, and directions which will help you continue to educate yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and Well Written","review":"This is a wonderful book...written in the first person by a teenager in the '70's, the book details the experiences of the young man and his family and friends. The protagonist moves quickly from one experience to the next, so the book is a quick read. The book also provides some thoughtprovoking life lessons without being \\"preachy.\\" Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome To Fred","review":"It is not the type of book I enjoy.

Might be good for someone who is looking for answers to God vs science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Story goes 70's Pastor's Kid","review":"This book is very funny. I found myself chuckling out loud. It was a nice change of pace from the heavy stuff that I normally like to read.It reminded me a lot of \\"A Christmas Story\\" except that it wasn't about Christmas, an elementary school boy, or the 1940's.The story is about a socially awkward 12 year old boy who moves to Fred, Texas after living in Chicago in the 1970's. He shows up to Fred wearing his polyester bell bottoms where the social normal was Levi's and Cowboy boots.It's very endearing. The Character development was very good as well.A note of interest:The first 69% is the book itself69%-78% is the first four chapters of the next book in the series78%-100% is a book club study guide followed by all the other stuff that you put at the end of a book.The author assured me that the first 69% is 260 pages, so I am bumping it from 3 star to five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Chose it because it was free.Read 5 chapters.It was so boring.kept thinkingit would get better but it just couldn't hold my interest"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read!","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. While journeying with the main character through adolescent questioning of life and God, there are a lot of interesting and funny twists and turns along the way. It again brings home the point that no matter what we have been taught or what beliefs we have been handed by our parents, there comes a point in time where each one of us must decide for himself what he accepts as truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"welcome to fred","review":"I really didn't like this book, it just didn't hold my attention and I didn't like the people in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....","review":"I thought from the reviews that I would love this book.

Funny insightful and well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book","review":"I kept waiting for it to get more interesting. I think that I was about halfway through the book when I quit. I rarely quit reading a book once I start, but this one was really dull. The story went nowhere. I believe that the author was trying to make it a growing up tale of a boy/girl who moved around a lot. There were moments that were engaging (the lady who lived in a cardboard box), but overall not worth the time spent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to a funny endearing coming of age novel.","review":"I absolutely loved this book. The characters are well drawn. The plot is believable and heart warming. I couldn't put it down. I cant wait to read the sequels. Mark is a \\"PK\\", preacher's kid, who moves around from church to church with his family as his father goes where he is called to preach. From a decent sized city in Texas where they originate, to Ohio, where Mark has a series of adventures with his friend M, an African American kid his age, who tries to get himWelcome to Fredto read books about his heroes of the day, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. The novel takes place in the late 60s and early 70s. When Mark's family moves to a small East Texas town called Fred, with its provincial ideas, he feels his life is over.

I enjoyed it enough to finish it and would be interested in reading more about the main character. It just didn't make a strong impression on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I usually don't care for stories written in the first person or those about teenagers but this is a wonderful read. It's a funny and interesting view of a young man coming of age and questioning life. Written in the first person, the reader experiences the angst of being a teenager, the joy of first love, the anxiety of trying to fit in and the reassurance of having doubts resolved. The central character is believable and sympathetic and the story holds the reader's interest. I found myself laughing and crying with this one! And I'm many years past my terns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy reading","review":"Well written. Kept my attention. Good southern story, funny but folksy. I will read the next book as well. Reminds me of younger years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks, Fred! Welcome to Brad Whittington -","review":"Thanks, Fred! If you hadn't been the kind of small Texas town you were, we would never have had the chance to read about Mark Cloud. His struggle to master the footwork of a Texas two-step while staying connected to his rock-and-roll soul is classic! Although every state has its small towns, most non-Texans don't realize just how much the small-town attitude is intensified by the extreme distance between any two locations on the Texas map. Mark Cloud falls face-first into that enormous empty space and manages to survive growing up there with most of his own special view of life intact (but not unchanged). Everyone who's ever been required to sit in the \\"misfit seat\\" will feel right at home with Mark's struggles. Which were certainly Brad's struggles, too - he's obviously \\"writing what he knows.\\" Can't wait to see what Mr. Whittington has on his computer for the next book. Until then, take a trip to Fred - it's worth your time to visit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get far","review":"I would not say that I hated this book. I did not give chance enough to hate it.

When I found a chapter devoted to LWP in Perl Power, I was thrilled and immediately bought the book.What I didn't expect was the bonus of someone finally providing a good explanation of Perl 5 and object-oriented perl. That section ALSO would have been worth the price of the book.Even the first chapter had all sorts of insights and explanations I found invaluable. I've been using perl off and on for about 3 years, mostly writing quick utilities, and I'll credit this book with wanting to make me use perl more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book for CGI programming","review":"I bought this book based on the 5-star reviews - never do THAT again......long on abstract examples that don't mirror the real world, short on logical explanations for the common man(woman)..

The plot is filled with holes, and the script leaves itself open to many improvized jokes. Billy, the lead singer for a metal band, takes his lyrics a little bit too seriously and out of nowhere kills 2 people after a recording session. He gets executed for his crimes, claiming innocence throughout the entire trial. 2 years later, the band is reformed with Billys girlfriend as the lead singer, and they set up a big tour. Billy then decides to return from the grave to kill her. I dont wanna give away the 'suprise' ending, but lets just say its 'shocking.' The best part of the movie is the music, which is actually pretty damn good, done by the band Sorcery. I found their website: sorcery.web.com check them out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good history, but has some technical issues","review":"This book was published around 1891. It is a pretty good treatment on the folks who helped bring us the telegraph.I did find some inaccuracies though. For instance, the author wrote that the speed of light is 288,000 miles per second. This is, of course, false - it is 288,000 kilometers per second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible domestic violence","review":"I was shocked by the domestic violence in this book. I've read dozens if not hundreds of Regencies, and I have never been so upset by a plot. The book is well-written, and the characters are well-developed. I got emotionally involved, so when \\"happily-ever-after\\" came just a few chapters after the violence, I was still seething on behalf of April. I read Regencies for fun and escape, not for real world brutality."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh.","review":"This was the most jarring reading experience, a perfectly fine, well-written book until a most appalling scene of abuse that would require the most fervent, monumental grovel ever of the hero to the heroine if he had any hope of redemption... but we are denied even that. Steer clear, gentle reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the *#%$#%??!","review":"I have read a few of Ms. Mack's books and thoroughly enjoyed them. Her characters have an unusual depth for series romances and her stories are well told and believable--until this one. It started out as good as her other novels but I was shocked and angered by the violence committed against April by her husband. Even more disturbing was the unrealistic way she forgave him and lived happily ever after. I completely disagree with the five star rating give by one callous reader. This book has no place in good storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unanswered Questions","review":"I would sure like to order this product . . . .

This made it stable enough to transfer data out of the drive. However, this is simply not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for Western Digital Instead","review":"I bought this external hard drive recently to back up videos I regularly transfer from my DVR (TiVo). It never worked very well. It had a lot of trouble connecting or being detected by my computer. It usually took about three or four tries to get the FreeAgent and my relatively new HP computer to communicate.The Seagate finished off my patience and my willingness to ever own Seagate materials again after the drive effectively died and would not allow ANY computer I own to see it. It seemed like the drive had been contacted by a major magnet, but there is none like that anywhere in my house. I lost over 300 hours of videos and files I use for my job.I replaced this drive with a Western Digital My Book Essential Edition external hard drive. It works flawlessly and is ALWAYS detected by my computer as soon as it is connected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seagate 320GB Hard Drive","review":"I got this baby for 79.99, so there was really no losing, but I am very satisfied. I've only had it for a month or so, but it's been really reliable so far. Also, it comes with a 5year limited warranty, which I found to be one of the longest warranties among the many hard drives I considered purchasing. It's not very speedy, as far as transfering, but it does alright considering it's not firewire. So, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seagate External Hard Drive","review":"Seagate ST303204FDA1E1-RK FreeAgent Desktop 320 GB USB External Hard DriveTerrific -- Plugged it in and good to go.

I had a crash last year that nearly cost me all of my data and after that I decided to do multiple things to protect my work. I bought this and also a RW DVD to have data stored on site with this drive and on disk off site. I was very pleased with this drive. I've had it almost 6 months now. It was easy to set up and support was very good, well, after I reached someone who I could understand. The only thing I have had any concern over is turning the drive on and off. I rub, hold, pray, press and wait each time. It is just a mystery to me - think it could be because I am blonde?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product so far...","review":"It's true that about 20GB of space is taken up right out of the box, which is kind of ridiculous, but if I really needed more space, I would have bought the 500 or 750GB. The hard drive is easily accessible and transfers data quickly via USB2. The unit is very quiet and took no time at all to set up. So far I've been happy with the Seagate320GB and am glad that I chose it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This thing will not work with Vista Backup, Windows Live OneCare Backup or Migo Backup and, who knows what else it won't work with. The Seagate site has a host of backup software it won't work with. It will backup with Seagate software but today my other computer crashed and I thought, no problem, I'll just restore to this computer. I downloaded the software, hooked up the FreeAgent and was amazed that a Restore feature does not show up on a computer other than the one originally backed up. Clever, Seagate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For The 1st Time Self Learner","review":"I'm not a student in college. I'm just someone at home with an interest in learning Logic. This was the first book that I've read on the subject and I can say that it was very difficult for me to understand it. Even though I've tried and retried many times. For someone just starting out, and wanting to learn on there own I wouldn't recommend this book. A much better book is \\"Crimes Against Logic\\" by Whyte."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Survey...Almost Too Good","review":"Foir the most part, Priest's introduction to the field of logic is clear, short and intriguing. He starts out almost every chapter with a logical puzzle or paradox and proceeds to attempt to explain it, showcasing different logical tools along the way. On the whole, this is a good strategy.But at the end of the book, you're left feeling a bit dissatisfied because so many of the puzzles/paradoxes are left unresolved and so much ground has been covered in so little space. I felt that it had too much breadth and not enough depth, despite the fact that this is a very short introduction (I've read a couple others and not all of them suffer this fate). But I've given the book 4 stars because it is interesting, lively and clear, and is perhaps a better introduction than most on the topic of logic, despite its occasional drawback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me . . .","review":"To put things in context, while I view myself as a logical person, I find formal logic difficult to follow. (On the other hand, someone who is wired for formal logic may find this book a breeze.)I got this book to help me brush up for my logic final exam at university. Unfortunately, it didn't clarify anything for me, and in fact my text book explains things in a much simplier way. So, even with my prior knowledge (having studied university-level philosophy in the past, just having studied formal logic for a term and reading a text book on the subject), I still thought this book was confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This book is certainly not for a beginner nor is it an introduction to logic in my opinion. It contains complicated mathematical symbols and doesn't explain them in depth nor can such a small book. It goes over concepts that can be an entire book in themselves. They should have stuck with the basics but they try to teach too much and attempt to cram it all in such a small book and I think it fails in that regard. I just cannot recommend this book to any beginner. It does go over some fallacious arguments for god and does a good job of showing how most are special pleading but doesn't really explain it in any meaningful way to the beginner. there are much better books out there. I give it one star for some of the arguments they do cover but that is all it really has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and confusing","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone. It's difficult to follow for the simple reason that Priest doesn't bother to explain anything. And for that reason, this book is not for a beginner.He also uses symbolic logic throughout the text without any explanations about symbolic logic. The whole book is irritating an difficult to follow.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"About the only positive statement I can make about this book is that it has a snappy, small format and a stylish design. Mr. Priest seems to be in a great hurry to end the book; as he brushes and jumps from one topic to another without giving any serious time to explain anything. Most of the concepts presented are quite elementary and anyone with a college degree would be aware of most of what is said.So to sum it up; this is not a text to read if you're attempting to understand logic; and you wont learn anything new if you have read another introductory book on Logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who would have thought logic is so boring?","review":"OK, to be fair, my low rating isn't because this book is bad per say. And I don't mean to discredit or take away from the author, because he surely knows what he's talking about. But I was convinced I would be very interested to learn about logic. I got a few chapters into this book and realized I wasn't. I really, really wasn't. In fact, I find the whole topic dull and even a little silly.So maybe in that sense this is a great book, because as an introduction it showed me I should not be reading about this stuff in the first place. So I'm a little torn, because I would like to rate it higher but I just can't highly rate a book I got no enjoyment out of.So if the author reads this, please don't hate me--it's really not your fault. I'd probably give two stars to the greatest book about accounting, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I didn't find this book to be a helpful introduction to Logic.
