Chicka Chicka Boom Boom is such a classic. It has helped me teach both my boys the alphabet. It's a very fun book. Both my boys LOVE it! It also comes with a CD where the story is narrated twice (once without a chime and the next time with a chime to turn the pages). It also has a list of songs that are played. My oldest son has memorized all the songs. They are very fun and upbeat. Our whole family loves this book and the CD. I used to use this book when I was a teacher, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Book for All","review":"I disliked reading when I was younger, but I LOVED this book! I read it over and over again. I just couldn't get enough of it. Now I'm 25 can still recite some of my favorite lines from this book and can't wait to share it with my baby-to-be-born in 2011.This book is bright and colorful, full of rhythm and rhyme, and worth buying for any child. Even if he/she doesn't normally care for books. I give \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\\" FIVE STARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"so entertaiing","review":"My grand daughter, age 2 loves this book.

This book is so much fun, and so perfect for very young children. As the letters chase each other up and down the tree, the inevitable happens...they all fall down! And then what happens? They start all over again.Your kids will delight, as mine did, in the rapid pace, rhythmic wording (you just can't help swaying along with the words) and bright, bold, simple illustrations. And you will rejoice that they know their alphabet in no time flat. A wonderful, wonderful book, timeless and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite books to read! I honestly am not sure how much educational value it has since you have to kind of read it fast for it to be fun and by reading it fast, it is hard for children to learn the alphabet from. Not out of the question to learn from this book, though.But other than that, I thoroughly enjoy reading this book and would recommend it to anyone with kids for a good time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even adults never tire of this one!!!","review":"I work in an elementary school with children of all ages and do a ton of babysitting.

It's one book/CD even an adult won't get tired of listening to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK...I actually used the book to get my son to crawl=","review":"My now 21 month old LOVES this book. I've been reading it to him from day one. He actually began crawling when I would place the book just out of his reach. Then I would place the book further away and he would crawl and get it...so cute. Now at 21 months it still remains his favorite book. Everyday he brings it to me and he tries to read with me. After reading it we say our ABCs in the back..which he LOVES.A true must have in your childs book collection. It contains bright colors and is truly a catchy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"love at first reading!","review":"At first when I viewed this book, without reading, I was not intrigued. BUT, at first reading, my son and I are in love with this one! Am ordering an extra copy for his daycare, for the other children to fall in love( they'll be asking their parents too, for this great book). This rhyming/sing-song story is great, funny to see both of us parents read this story differently--I'm the one who is more animated when I read it. I'm sure all kids will love it....great way for them to get introduced to the lower case alphabet! LOVE IT!

You almost have to sing it when reading to your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good learning tool","review":"This book was given to us soon after the birth of our daughter. She's almost two now and loves the rhythm of this book. She \\"reads\\" along with us, interjecting when she knows what's next, and we love it! It has catchy repetitive phrases: \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom!\\", and she LOVES saying BOOM BOOM! I think it helps with letter recognition (especially lower-case, which is more rarely seen in children's learning tools), and I think it helps develop memory skills. Nice to know there's a book we enjoy reading as much as she enjoys \\"reading\\" it with us! Highly recommended for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice catchy poem to teach the ABC's","review":"\\"Skit skat doodle doot, flip flop flee...\\" this book is a favorite of my daughters even though their reading proficiency is well beyond this book now.

My 18 month old daughter gets an absolute kick out of it! She says the BOOM, BOOM! part when we get to it. While I read the part \\"up the coconut tree\\", I walk my fingers up the tree. It really seems to get and keep her attention. Every parent should own this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive","review":"Thought there was more, way too expensive for such a short book. No paper, no ink...really? Probably need to reconsider"},{"rating":"2","title":"CHICKA CHICKA BOOM BOOM","review":"I bought this for my one year old granddaughter.

My son learned his alphabet because of this book and we read it many many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughter Loves It!","review":"This book has become one of my daughter's favorite bedtime stories. I had read and heard great things about it, but was still somewhat hesitant about ordering it because I wondered if it was too simple for her active little mind. Needless to say, I was wrong. It's a great book with wonderful, vibrant illustrations. A definite must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't capture my 18 month old","review":"This book didn't interest my 18 month old who loves rhyming books. Perhaps when he gets a little but older??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Joy for Children and Adults","review":"Some books you read over and over again for the message. This book you read over and over again because it is just plain fun. Too often we forget that learning should be fun. This book helps everyone remember the joy of simple, fun rhymes. Not only will your kids want to read it again and again, you'll enjoy reading it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story albiet Sloppy Editing","review":"My daughter, Xyzika, loves this book, and that is worth a ton of gold to me and I read this book five times a week. It is colorful, pretty, and mostly snappy.BUT ... YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS ...In the version I have, which must be in the 50th printing by now having been purchased new in 2006, on the last page of the story, the word I'll is spelt I\\"ll .OH MY GOD!!! I couldn't believe a typo like that in a world-famous, award-winning book.You can read 500-page novels your whole life and not see that, and it couldn't be caught in a 500-word children's rhyme? Two authors, editors, numerous chances to fix it, and it\\"s still there? Even Microsoft Word's spell checker catches that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T GET IT...","review":"OK. So lately almost every home I've been into with a child under 5 has had this book in their collection and for the life of me I CAN'T understand its popularity. Was it listed on some \\"must have kids books 2012\\" book list??? It's okay but it's basically the same picture over and over again with very slight variation. I notice the kids turning away with boredom by the second page. Who wants to look at the same page over and over again? Yes its rhyme is catchy enough but unfortunately the pictures are not and for the age group this book is aimed at both are important. I wouldn't waste your money or your time. If you are however strongly considering a purchase- take it out of the library first and see if it holds your kid's interest and attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Don't waste your money. This book had great hype, but it's awful! I wish I had returned it sooner, but I got stuck with it because I was ill following chemo and couldn't get to the post office within 30 days in order to return it~ I bought it as a gift for my grandson, but will probably donate it instead~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Ending","review":"This book sent our 18 month old into a crying fit because it ends sadly. After all the letters try to climb the tree, they all fall out and the book ends. Bummer. When you're 18 months, falling isn't fun - it hurts. We had to get rid of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it!","review":"The book starts out ok, one letter at a time. The second half of the alphabet is sort of rushed up the tree. And what is a chicka chika boom boom anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes my son laugh EVERY time!","review":"I had flipped through this at the book store after reading great reviews and just didn't get it. After receiving it as a hand-me-down treasure from friends and reading it with my son, I discovered the great rhythm (very fun to read)and truly enjoyed it. He fell in love with it at 2 1/2 years old, so I'd say it's actually appropriate for a younger age than stated (I think it was 4-8). Fun for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My sons love it","review":"My six year old and my three year old sons absolutely love this book. My three year old has to read the alphabet listed on the inside cover. They request this often as their bedtime story. My six year old is detailed and wants to make sure he sees all the battered letters that fell out of the tree. The ending is a good lesson in not letting setbacks get you down, but to try, try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Own!","review":"LOVE this book! I mean, how fun is it to say:Skit skat skoodle doot, Flip Flop Flee?!I'll NEVER get tired of the coconut tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite!","review":"This was one of my very favorite books when I was a child, and now that I have my own child I read it to her all the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I bought this book for my oldest but must have misplaced it. I ordered another book for my youngest and it is loved by her too. Great book about letters and colors. I don't know what it is about this book but kids sure do love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childrens Classic Board Book","review":"This is an all around classic board book for children.

The next generation will love it as much as the first, I am certain."},{"rating":"1","title":"i just dont get it, either!","review":"i am quite amazed to see such rave reviews about this book. it starts off well in a nice sing-song rhythmic way and then suddenly it is so incredibly boring, just runs out of steam. and those cut-out like illustrations, sigh... i'm sorry but i've seen way more imagination from little children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better ABC books exist","review":"This book is reminiscent of the earlier Dr. Seuss ABC book. Both use rhythm, story line, and nonsense words to teach alphabet letters. But Dr. Seuss has an imaginative vignette for each letter and the rhymes are much better. This is one of those books which I expected to like but didn't. As a result, I find it hard to be enthusiastic when reading it to my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michelle","review":"As a favorite book of a friend, we received this book as a gift. \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\\" starts off well with nice rhymes and good rhythm, but deteriorates into little more than the reciting of the last half of the alphabet, which was very disappointing. I would skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, one minor quibble about \\"book/CD\\" edition","review":"Parents who do not like this book do not understand that although it uses the letters as characters, it is not an \\"ABC book.\\" Rather it should be seen as a rhythmic exercise to keep children excited about reading.Now, for the quibble: \\"Sung by Ray Charles\\" sounds like fun to me, but he doesn't sing at all. Rather, he reads the book twice on the CD and then we are treated to two versions by children and one sung by the author. \\"Performed by\\" Ray maybe, but not sung. The CD is HORRIBLE. If you want to supplement with a CD at all, treat yourself to the scholastic video of this story. The music is wonderful and guaranteed to get kids singing along."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Want Boom-Boom!\\"","review":"We started off with the board book version \\"Chicka Chicka ABC\\", which my son loved as a baby. Now that he's 2 and loves to sit through longer books, I wanted him to have the full version (Chicka Chicka Boom Boom). I also wanted the CD, which I had heard parts of previously and knew it was good.He absolutely loves the book. He'll bring it to me and say \\"Want Boom-Boom\\", and asks for it if he can't find it. He also enjoys the CD, which has several audio versions of the book plus a few extras.I love them too! :) It's a great book for getting a different take on learning ABCs, but it's also great for experimenting with rhythm, and just plain ol' having fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and FUN book to read aloud","review":"The rhyming, the story line and pictures are very engaging in this book.When I received this for my baby shower, my mom and I read this together and laughed out loud at how cute it was. I also have a cd to it and we like to listen to it in the car as well.It's also educational, but don't tell your child/ren that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom","review":"I love Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. I have ordered a second copy with a cassette tape. I plan to start my school out using the theme Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. It is wonderful for teaching letters to children and can be used in many other activities. The illustrations are beautifully done. The children in my classroom last enjoyed this book and requested it often. It is just a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to letters.","review":"Bought for my granddaughter.

So I finally decided to buy it and it continues to be afavorite. They also love to listen to the CD that comes with it, andenjoy the many different versions of the book they hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to learn the alphabet","review":"I bought this book as a supplement to a video book so I could make out the words to the song and teach the kids. Just wish there were more verses to the song since the kids ask for it so often!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solving Insomnia","review":"This CD helped to solve my insomnia problem. There seems to be a problem with the production. Some parts seem softer then others, so it is difficult to hear them without the other parts being too loud. Other then that, I really enjoyed the music and it helped me go to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Box Kit in a book","review":"I was hoping that this book actually offered more explanation on the design and application of mechatronics. It is basically a book of science fair projects for 12-18 year olds. It offers very little (if any) actual instruction on the components or the reasons why they are used.

I am going to have to find a good, basic book on electronic components and design before I can venture into this entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEchatronics for the Evil Genius","review":"Not a bad piece.

Equal time is not afforded to bibilical authorities, historians and other experts. Although, ultimately the outcome refutes Dan Brown's claims, it does so with too much time given to non-authoritative \\"experts\\" and a disgruntled former Opus Dei member.Recommend Tony Robinsons, \\"The Real DaVinci Code\\" It does a much better job of balancing the views of true experts with those that are busy getting rich from perpetuating myths, legends and distortions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cover-up?","review":"The content of the DVD \\"National Geographic - Is It Real? Da Vinci's Code\\" appears to be very badly researched. Assumptions made by National Geographic are presented to the viewer as facts. Conclusions drawn are in general not supported with plausible evidence. The views projected are bias and I wouldn't be surprised if the Catholic Church was the main sponsor of this movie. All in all a highly disappointing DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very biased- A HUGE disappointment","review":"When I purchased this DVD, I was hoping to get the complete picture- an unbiased presentation. From scratch I could sense what was to come. Bad presentation coupled with one sided propaganda forms the crux of this DVD. It is not well researched and very important issues have been completely omitted. What little was discussed appeared to be very tainted.I definitely did not expect National Geographic to come up with this kind of a DVD. I will definitely think TEN times before I purchase anything from them. Maybe they should just stick to wildlife/geography/ecology and leave history/religion/spirituality alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mexican Camping?","review":"There is not much useful in this book. Traveling widely in Mexico and checking out many of the suggested stops, few still exist. Just try calling them. One of the few that was still in operation had an overflowing septic tank and was intolerable.Alas, dry camping with permission is the order of the day. Luckily Mexicans are nice about it. US style RV or tent camping sites are rare as hen's teeth. Since the right to bear arms does not exist in Mexico, security can be a real issue if you make a bad decision. Maybe the best advice, if you do not caravan, would be to drive a decrepit, ratty, small RV so as not to attract the wrong sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"review is of lousy kindle sample","review":"never got to body of work. whole sample wasted on intro boring details of how survey was planned and executed and pages of apologies for limitatioms of study. sure made me want to click BUY and dive right in Not.

I like them and do feel a bit calmer after taking them. I like the fact that they do not contain a bunch of fillers and are just a natural vitamin. They are rather large but do not make me feel ill after taking them like some vitamins do. I usually have one in the am and one in the pm with something to eat. I just went through my first bottle of 100 and I just ordered the 250 size.

I need to see all ingredients not just B12 and/or just the front cover. I need this to make sure I am not taking too much of one vitamin or supplement. I already take Twinlab Tri-Boron Plus and I need the B vitamins to add to it.

I threw the rest away and will find an easiler to swallow B supplement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repeat customer","review":"I have used Twin Lab Stress Tabs for a long time. We take 1 morning & night.

Within just 2 days of taking these I really noticed a difference in my energy levels.I had previously tried the generic CVS b-complex and I would rate this 100x better than that product.Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Illustrations","review":"No match for an aggravated bunny,Irving and Muktuk, bad and cowardly polar bears, are forced to be good...temporarily. This peculiar story also features a quite good polar bear who lives in an apartment and commutes to the zoo. That really seems odd at first reading, but probably no more so than \\"Put Me in the Zoo\\" by Robert Lopshire, a customer pleasing book. Ink and marker illustrations illuminate this title which should provide storytime laughter. A good purchase for public and school libraries as well as for Pinkwater fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant but Inconsistent","review":"I would almost skip the first section of the book and get to the plot which really starts in section 2. This book has some great philosophy and is both funny and provocative. My favorite thought is that you need to have both your mental process fully engaged AND your heart fully engaged to be a player in life. One or the other is not enough. True to his other books he throws in some mystical and magical bits, and embroiders the book with[physical] content. His genius is still there and the entertainment value is still high."},{"rating":"1","title":"racial stereotyping is not funny","review":"My issue is not with anything Tom Robbins wrote, but with narrator Barret Whitener: a white male who opts to read all the dialogue from Japanese characters in a bad, generic \\"Asian\\" accent. It's unbearable to listen to. In addition, Whitener can't even pronounce the simplest of Japanese words, like \\"sake.\\" How many more years must transpire before an Asian person can have a voice without being mocked?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An arrow in the bullseye of a tired target...","review":"Robbins earlier works are much better and as he continues with his retreaded themes his efforts are becoming increasingly bathetic.Sadly we must acknowledge that even the most dexterous writers and thinkers in our times are, in most cases, one thought wonders.Robbins is only feeding us shadows now; as he has for a number of years.Some will be able to fill in his metaphysical blanks but others who cannot are waitng patiently for a book that will never come. Such are the vagaries and irony of fame and fortune: In the periods of life that we should become the most vicious we actually become the most docile."},{"rating":"1","title":"lite Robbin's snack till his next Big Thing","review":"Not Tom's best by a long shot (I've read'm all), though I liked it better than Fierce Invalids. This is due more to a prurient self-interest in Japanese mythology, South East Asia, hot Asian women, sex and sake than it is to anything like character and plot. The novel doesn't end, but rather poops out. As a platform for Tom's philosophical whimsy, it offers little he hasn't already said, though I agree with him whole-heartedly. If you're already a fan, read it for Tom's characteristic bubbling prose. Newcomers should start with Skinny Legs, Jitterbug, or Still Life and go from there. Frankly, Tom lost his edge with Frog Pajamas and has been sliding down the slippery slope ever since."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Effort","review":"Tom Robbins usually commands and holds my attention with a masterful use of the language and tremendous sense of humor. This book seems to have beeen written in a hurry, and lacks the qualities that make him stand out as an author.It was unsatisfying on most levels; but, thankfully, it was short.I can reccomend ALL of his other works; but not this one.Try one of his others if you are a novice Robbins fan. This might put you off him, and that would be a mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robbins worst (so far)","review":"I can't believe I read this whole book. The first chapter was engaging, funny and had some promise. And then the book just turned into a soapbox. All these ridiculous speeches and crap about \\"Lao\\" vs \\"Laotian\\", US foreign policy, Americans, whatever - you name it - and a really ambiguous plot that had us guessing at what the fate was of more than one of the protagonists. Maybe I lack imagination but reading this book made me question why I thought any of his other books were funny or interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun romp for Robbins' fans","review":"This is an easy read that goes quickly. It covers themes of Vietnam war, but not really. It kinda reveals that all we did there is not finished. I know it is easy to forget the past -- heck we've already jumped into another Vietnam type war in the same generation. This is not about the war, nor foreigners really. It is about Americans who adapted in an entertaining way to the crazy world the leaders built for them. Expect the usual Robbins zaniness. A fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom's Tanuki Trip Tires","review":"Used to find Tom Robbins so exhilarating and sassy that I had my phone listed in his name, in honor. After reading this, I'd be unlisted.

This book was tough to get through but did start to pick up 2/3 of the way through. I read it with a dictionary in hand and learned a few new vocabs. The mix between fantasy (Tanukis and Kitsune) and real lifeallegories didn't seem to jive so well. None of the characters were really well developed.

There are no great characters in this book which makes it easy to put down.As with others I eagerly awaited the release of this book after enjoying his last book \\"Fierce Invalids ...\\".

He has had a few \\"missteps\\" along the way but none quite as horrible as Villa Incognito. This was, perhaps, his most forced prose of any book, marked by a patchwork of characters that never developed, blended together to create that magaical environment only he can achieve at his best. Usually, I cannot put down a Robbins Novel, but it actually took me a week to read this one. I guess it is a must read for Robbins fans and they will probably say, \\"maybe next time.\\" This should not be the introduction for the first time Robbines reader, stick to the titles I mentioned above for a feel of what TR can really do.

It must be repeated a hundred times, and it just wasn't amusing. The reader, Barrett Whitener, tries to do the best he can, but his poorly contrived Japanese accent (which sounds more like a German accent), just doesn't cut it.

Granted, I do not think this book has all of the qualities I have come to expect; it did not make me laugh as much or impress me with language---but who's to say all of his books should be exactly alike? I think it was still a very good story and I loved the way all of the characters tied into one another-although I do admit I was afraid I would loose track of who was who in the beginning, but it turned out to be a very satisfying read-one which beckoned to me to continue reading it through the day, which in my view, is always a great sign."},{"rating":"2","title":"short, but ever so sweet","review":"Though this isn't my favorite T.R. book (Fierce Invalids still hordes all the poker chips), it still offers the literary lunacy and lessons in philosophy and religion Robbins' readers seek. The author's style of character creation and description--not only tossing in the eccentric, but also giving the mundane a nice makeover--makes a clean cut in the reader's memory. Vietnam. MIAs. Drugs. Carneys. And let's not forget the Tanuki. Even the lyrics to the song \\"Meet Me Incognito\\" are dazzling--I imagine a backdrop of pentatonic guitar, winds, and the proper combination of percussion to create the most powerful of pla-bongas.

You've been writing the same stuff since Roadside Attraction. At least, in the past, you've appeared to make an effort. But Villa, Tom, Tom, Tom! It's like you never even intended to finish the book. Being outrageous is not the same as being original. Take some time off, reflect on what you've become (yourself thirty years ago), and try again. In the meantime, I recommend to you dear offended review reader, to try some of the newer crop of \\"outrageous\\" authors out there.

I have read all of his previous books and generally liked all of them. However, this book was painful to read and overall really bad (there is no other way to put it - it is a stinker). If you want to read something from Robbins, try one of his earlier books, like Jitterbug Perfume. Even some of his more recent books, like Fierce Invalids or Frog Pajamas are worth reading. Just avoid this one or you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Robbins So Far","review":"This is Tom Robbins' worst book yet. I have read all of his books and this one isn't even complete. There are unexplored characters and no real plot to follow. Usually the plot of his books start to reveal itself late in the book, which makes me believe that this book was never really finished.Throw this book away, its trash. Pick up any of his other books and you will be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I'd have to call this Robbins's weakest book.First of all, it was too short. Instead of letting events run their course, he chose to end things rather abruptly and tack on a couple of half-baked epilogues.Secondly, the characters lacked depth. This was partly due to the length of the book. There wasn't time to develop any of them fully, and consequently I didn't get to know them well enough to care about them.Thirdly, the writing wasn't as colorful as it has been in his previous books. There were only a couple of passages that made me chuckle out loud, and very few creative turns of phrase. Most seemed forced.And finally, his other books have always left me with some new perspectives on life. This one was fluff.Rated in general, this book gets 2 stars. Rated against other Tom Robbins books, it gets one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted Book","review":"Very sorry he even attempted this tragic demise of his style and talent.

This forced me to spend hours of frustration trying to decipher Voelz' bizarre rules and notes. Those were hours I could have used to learn the language, or better yet, spend with my wife and kids.

Voelz uses a scholarly vocabulary sure to confuse anyone who attempts to use his book. He manages to insult the reader's intelligence at every turn of the page by repeating the most basic points and over-simplfying the obvious, and yet, he still manages to make most of the greek language as confusing as possible. If you are trying to learn Greek on your own I would suggest Mounce's 'Basic's of Biblical Greek' which comes with a CD rom that will help you with basic pronounication.

It could be better, though. I have learned from this program, but it is not the only source that I rely on. Two native speakers recite the language--a man and a woman. The man's voice is not well suited to language learning because he has a deep voice and does not speak clearly. The woman's voice is fine, though--it is higher and clear. The sounds are the essential part of the language, and it would have been better had both speakers not spoken so fast. A facet of this program that is helpful is that the target phrases are spoken twice. The book that comes with the two cassettes contains a section that consists of three pages of basic Dutch grammar. This Language/30 product does not provide the basics of the language, but I still use it and consider it to have some merit. It has given me an idea of what the Dutch language is like. Actually, I rate it 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and expressive","review":"I bought the album after seeing Signorello perform live in Blues Alley jazz club in DC.

It is flimsy, and tilts in such a manner that about half of the grass collected falls back onto the grass. With a rake and this catcher one might be able to get 75% of the clippings, but it is not a very good product. Also, the snap on mechanism that connects the catcher to the mower is always slipping off, which makes keeping the clippings in the catcher that much more difficult.

That way you won't have to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as everyone says . . .","review":"Despite the negative reviews of this, I bought it for my 20\\" Scott push mower. I assumed that the problem was that the grass clippings just weren't well directed into the catcher. I have a heavy duty canvas sewing setup, and I thought I might modify the catcher to avoid the issue. But that isn't really the issue at all. The grass clippings simply don't propel back far enough to get into the catcher. Nothing I can do about that by modifying the catcher. So I used it twice and stopped. Leaving the grass clippings on the lawn is actually good for it, but it means that the dogs (and people) track some of them into the house. I try to minimize that problem by mowing the lawn more frequently to keep them as short as possible, so that the clippings drop down deep into te lawn.

However, the mower cannot be pushed with the handle raised even slightly or the clippings will spill forward out of the catcher. Also, on every path or so it's necessary to reach down behind the blades and sweep the grass toward the back of the catcher: otherwise there isn't enough room for the next batch.I guess this thing will have to do, as I have yet to locate a better device.

Also, the mower is more difficult to manuever in a small space and is even harder if the person is short (5'5\\" or less).I also bought a Toro 51599 Blower/Vacuum/Mulcher when I bought this catcher, and I highly recommend using your $25.00 towards the Toro instead.

It seems that many of the reviewers that had fit problems were trying to use the bag on a mower other than the ALMC brand.That all said, the engineering and design of the product could only be described as LAZY. The clip designed to attach the bag to the mower is the most critical part of the product and it looks like the designers spent 10 seconds thinking about it. Its poor design allows the bag to be bounced off the clip very easily. What frustrates me is that I was able to design and fabricate a fix for the problem in about 15 minutes using nothing more than a drill, a pliers, and about 3/16\\" of spring steel wire.

Well no.Not sure what brand to recommend, seems like most people use push mowers without catchers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit - measure carefully","review":"Even though it is the ONLY reel-mower grass catcher that they sell at the American Lawn website, it does NOT universally fit all \\"American Lawn\\" reel mowers. Very frustrating. The instructions use technical language and graphics, not end-user friendly. We tore apart the grass catcher trying to make it fit, and I'm still hoping we are able to make it work somehow, in the meantime, I am still raking. I saved a couple bucks buying the catcher at Amazon instead of the American Lawn website."},{"rating":"1","title":"It only fits 14\\" & 16\\" mowers!","review":"American Lawn Mower Company Reel Mower Grass Catcher #1ST-SPI experienced the same fit issues I see in many of these reviews. Luckily mine came with an instruction sheet and after trying without satisfaction to attach the catcher to the mower I noticed it says it is for 14\\" and 16\\" mowers. I talked to Amazon & hopefully they will change their text to reveal this. Since I have not used the item they have agreed to issue a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Idea","review":"If only I knew then what I know now. The mower is a wonder of design, but this \\"grass catcher\\" simply does not work. A very, very mechanically-gifted neighbor performed the assembly, and afterwards took it off the mower with the comment, \\"This is just a really bad idea.\\" The device may be compatible with another mower, but not with the Scott's push mower that I just reviewed. To add insult to injury, no invoice was in the box, so I'm not sure how to return it. $25+ down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars if it were available.","review":"Useless. Total waste of money. Uncontrollable. Gets jammed and twisted at every bump and turn. Forget about going in reverse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well with my American Lawn Mower","review":"This fits well and doesn't come off easily despite what some reviews have said. It doesn't catch all the grass, but it definitely makes a big difference. If you're cutting grass that has grown too tall it catches less of it ( you have to mow more frequently to properly mow with reel mowers anyways). Overall I am happy with the grass catcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Alternative","review":"I bought this because I needed to compost my grass clippings and there are no alternatives. Fairly easy to install,you'll have to empty it every couple of passes, as it holds very little. You need to remember to lift the handle when you back up or the catcher will fall off. A little practice and you can make do. Certainly not the best product, butagain, there's really no alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grass catcher has it's place, but will slow you down.","review":"I found the grass catcher easy to install and it works pretty much as expected. I was surprised by the tendency to flip the clippings to the left, but it is easy enough to stop and push the pile back and make room for another pass. This will slow you down with your mowing, but if you have an area that you don't want to leave clippings that get tracked into your house it is worth the effort. Don't expect power mower performance in sucking up everything on the lawn because it is only going to catch the fresh clippings flipping off the blades and some of that will fall out. But for all you reel mower lovers out there this is a useful addition to your mower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn\\"t work while mowing, too flimsy.","review":"It attaches at the bottom with a plastic grip that takes too much effort to attach, similar to a plastic bag, you need to peal it on and off. The worst part, it is too flimsy to hold grass while pushing. The bottom bows, and the grass is forced back onto the reels. You can see in their advertisement picture the slight bow already, it bows halfway up the catcher, pretty bad. Waste of money, wasted of shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"1ST-SP Reel Mower Grass Catcher","review":"Where do I start? What, I don't believe about 100-negative reviews? This catcher WILL NOT WORK ON A SCOTTS 20\\" MOWER!!!!! It's at least two inches too narrow, and the hardware provided has no place for attachment to the mower. Scotts probably does not market a catcher because the mower was designed to be sold without one. Now I even hate the mower.

He backs up his facts with relevant references, and there is an extensive bibliography for each chapter. Kopel's focus on historical and cultural factors in other countries is very thorough, relatively non-biased, and an interesting approach to the subject. However, he still has raw data and statistics to back up his claims. It is extremely well written, and an insightful book I would reccomend for anyone who wants an objective comparison of America's gun laws to other countries, free from the political rhetoric and mythos that one usually associates with said topic. My only complaint is that some of the information is outdated, given that the book was written in 1992. But all in all, it's an extremely well-written and well-researched book I would reccomend highly to anyone who interested in the politics and culture of guns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholastic Common Sense","review":"In reading the book with an open mind, it becomes quite apparent that history and culture goes hand in hand when dealing with the issue of gun control. What may work in other countries probably would not work in the United States and visa-versa due to those two issues. Clearly the United States is a country where Americans have a love affair with their car and firearms and Americans will refuse to part with either of the two. Kopels solution to gun related crimes makes sense, since guns aren't going away because of its proliferation, then issue concealed carry licenses to Americans since the Second Amendment is clear that Americans have the right to keep and bear arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZX7 pod filters","review":"Did not fit. outlet of filters does not match carb dimensions at all.

Not so much. As much as it would have you beleive it's geared towards runners and roughness, it's horrible. It has a serious problem with the headphone port, in that only after a month of owning it, the headphone port caused static and shorting out constantly. I would have to like bend my headphone jack back and forth continuously throughout my workout to get a clear sound. Been through 4 headphone sets because of it. Also, the rubber sole and hand grip mechanism are trash. It fell apart. The shorting out is so bad now that I can't even listen to an entire song and it constantly skips. Not good if you want to excercise with this. I guess I'm going to have to upgrade to a mp3 flashdrive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sammy Davis Jr. in musical GOLDEN BOY","review":"This 1964 show has a very fine score by Charles Strouse and Lee Adams...a much darker score than is usual for this team. The original Capitol Lp was withdrawn and re-released with some of the tracks re-recorded by Sammy Davis who was in poor voice when the original album sessions were held. Also the re-release has \\"The Fight\\" (essentially a dance number) instead of the actual show finale used on the first release. It is the 2nd album that has served for all 3 CD releases. (Apparently the master tapes for the originals are long gone.)The re-recorded songs are: \\"Night Song\\", \\"Stick Around\\", \\"I Want To Be With you\\", and \\"Can't You See it.\\"Even with the re-recorded tracks this album is well worth having. One of the best tracks, however, is Billie Daniel's song \\"While the City Sleeps.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Time for a revival?","review":"This is a terrific musical. One of Charles Stouse's best scores, if not THE best ( far more interesting than \\"Annie\\", for which he is more famous). Sammy Davis Jr. sounds better than I ever heard him. I guess I'd forgotten how good he was. A \\"must\\" for any fan of American musical theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong answers are not helpful","review":"Like the other review said, this book is full of spelling and grammar mistakes as well as wrong answers. It would say that E was the correct answer and then go on to say why B was the correct answer. Other times, the answers were just flat out wrong. I had a friend who took the Kaplan review course in which they gave her a large review book full of study material. I studied that and it helped A LOT. If you can get your hands on the review book from the course, I would definitely recommend that, but as for this OAT book, I'd pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Zydeco CD!!!","review":"Sean Ardoin's first solo CD continues to creatively push Zydeco music while holding on to important elements of the culture. For those people who want to put Zydeco music in a box and want the music to sound like older Zydeco Musicians, this may not be the CD for you. However, if you love the music and are open to hearing the Zydeco Nation's new emerging artist, this CD is a must have! \\"Lil' Lawman Girl,\\" \\"Got My Jelly Workin',\\" \\"Long Time,\\" and \\"2 Fingers,\\" are hot hot Zydeco songs and still pack a dance floor in Southwest Louisiana and Texas when played!I have all of Sean's CD's, but this self titled CD has some sentimental value to me because you can see Sean's creative base begin to really define the \\"Zydekool sound.\\" Sean definitely is on the cutting edge when it comes to Zydeco and Southern Soul Music, you'll listen to this CD over and over and find something new! And by the way, you'll be dancing while you do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Although the liner notes claimed that the Ardoin Brother are \\"not fighting,\\" the fact that they went their separate ways would suggest that something happened between them. Based on this new CD from older brother Sean, I wish they would get back together, for this thing is a real disappointment. The songs are generally about how cool the band is, and the overpowering midbass energy of the mix plays havoc with both the sound and the musical impression. If you want to hear zydeco music that sounds like rap music gone bad, this is the CD for you. Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview with nice colour pics","review":"This is a good intro & overview book with the basics on M&P; technology and some recipies inside. Illustrations on the glossy paper are fine.What it lacks is the details about raw materials to be and not to be used, it absolutely misses even the briefest chemistry info.I would recommend it to soapmaking enthusiasts for home experiments, but not even for the small business.

This is not altogether a bad thing. It's also a symptom of society's compassion for the underclass and for the pathological. A kid with a rotten upbringing gets cut some slack for turning out greedy, and an energetic kid gets credit simply for being energetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly dissapointed","review":"I was extremely dissapointed in this book. Perhaps its age shows, but by the last thirty years' standards, Sammy Glick would be a choir boy today in Hollywood. The writing style and technique are excellent, but the story is, at best, weak. Today, Sammy Glick would get run over, instead of running. There are no sympathetic characters in this book, and as for an insiders view of Hollywood, it just isn't there. Again, maybe it's a time frame problem, but if you are looking for any clue about today's Hollywood, this ain't it. Boring. And the Reagan bashing at the end is laughable, especially from someone writing from Quoge."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing!","review":"I'd read so much about this book, I figured it had to be half-way decent. But it's just awful. The language is dated, (Hemingway said, \\"All slang grows stale,\\" and he's right!) and the writing is BAD. It's lousy writing! The pace is hyperkinetic, and not in some appealing Kerouac way. And the Reagan-bashing afterword written by Shulberg in 1989 is just bizarre, especially considering that Elia Kazan and Budd Shulberg wrote ON THE WATERFRONT as a metaphor for justifying their own naming names for the blacklist during the McCarthy-ish communist witch hunts. Shulberg pandered to right-wing extremism as much as a person can. Maybe that's WHY he wrote the Reagan-bashing afterword, as an absolution for his past sins. But it's too little, too late. Aside from that, the book is just lousy technically and aesthetically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closet Psychology","review":"Reading this book I'm really enjoying the 'why' we make fashion mistakes and looking a the cause of the problem.

There is no getting around it - clothes are an emotional purchase.

He takes forever to get to the point. His characters are bland and I don't care anymore about his love interest with Robin, which takes up half of the book. He needs to get on with his life. The mystery part and conclusion take up the last 5 chapters and even that is no mystery and not even exciting. I just wanted the book to end and it seemed like it never would. The book just kept driving around Hollywood and stopping at bars and street signs. I feel like I could drive in Hollywood according to J. Kellerman's directions.

And boring. And the plots are getting more and more preposterous."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best In Ten Years","review":"A COLD HEART is the best Alex Delaware novel in the last ten years. This time Alex and his cop pal Milo are tracking down a serial killer who stalks and kills young promising artists. The mystery is fair, the subplots are necessary to the action, the transitions of different characters are cleaner, and Alex is demonstrating some long-needed maturity.The ending is abrupt, but not overly so. Kellerman has been this curt at the end before. All of the exposition necessary is there -- no plot threads are left hanging.The major criticism I have is with the detective character Eric Stein. He's an Army vet who has joined LAPD, and he's a poster boy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, but somehow LAPD can't see it, his partner Petra Conner can't see it, Vietnam vet Milo can't see it, even Dr. Delaware the trained shrink can't see it. Your heo is a psychologist, you figure he ought to recognize classic symptoms when presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass it By","review":"The usual Kellerman appeal is absent--this book feels very tired.

Maybe I'm a traditionalist, but I totally resent the first-person/third-person switch--especially to this extent. It gives off the odor of a trashy, lazy effort.This story came to a screeching halt every time it switched into third. I liked Petra Connor in Billy Straight, but her partner was disgusting. I realize that was the point, but I nearly didn't care enough to finish the book. The plot moved very slowly, very standard stuff.Much as I like the series, I think I'll borrow the next one from the library before buying outright. I'd like to see Kellerman recapture the depth and emotion of Silent Partner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Point in Series","review":"As it is published, I purchase, save, and reread each Kellerman.It's fiction; it's his vision/talent/genius. But the serial murder schtick was carried too far. The plot became cluttered. The writing is always stimulating; Alex and Milo are engrossing characters. But why write out Robin? Allison's positive reinforcement to Alex must comfort him but she's too much a clone; I find her boring. Robin was an interesting and worthy partner with Alex and Milo.

My favorite part was when Rosiland, the horse, broke the record as the fastest horse in the country. the time Rosiland did it in was remarkable. Also Rosiland having colts that are almost as fast as their mother was amazing. Just knowing with practice they will be as fast or just as fast as Rosiland. Pony Boy was the young man in the book that was determined to work Rosiland to be a winner. With the work he did, it was no wonder that she was the fastest horse in Kentucky. If I had the determinationwith my horse, I would make sure he would be #1. If you love horses and mostly buggy horses, then this is the book you need to read.

It is therefore physically impossible for it to properly display an undistorted picture. The workarounds suggested by other reviewers will work, but should not be necessary.In addition, the picture quality is quite poor even apart from the aspect ratio problem, and there are no brightness or contrast controls. Also, the stand only provides for landscape display.I should add that I downloaded the firmware update from the company's website.

The user's manual offers no trouble-shooting tips, nor does the web site. I did discover on the web site that the only format supported is \\"landscape,\\" which means normal photos are going to be stretched at the sides. Unless you crop all of your pictures to fit the size of the frame, they will be stretched. Even without the stretching, the quality is still poor. I've discovered that when a frame says \\"sports a high resolution\\" but does not tell you what the resolution actually is, you probably aren't going to get very good picture quality.

The characters are so convincing, and the whole movie has a definitive feel of homegrown horror. I can't ever remember an entire picture being filmed in the rain, or one that explores the fanatical mind of a 12 year old on a horror movie high. This film has everything you want from a decent monster movie like the feeling that you're there, and you already know all the actors in the film because they are like real-life people who you already know. There's the typical high school kids who become victims,but before they do, they transmit the delicious feeling of blowing off class and hanging with friends on a grey rainy day.

Nothing in the film offended me - it just didn't amuse me, and it seemed amateurish - the editing, the acting, and the overacting of Winters. I just looked up the Bosley Crowther review from the N.Y. Times of 1965. You can find it on the \\"Rotten Tomatoes\\" website. He liked the satire in the first part of the film, but thought that Winters was just too unsubtle, and he wrote that the things the writers added to the Waugh book resulted at the end of the film in - Bosley Crowther's words - \\"witless inanity.\\" I just saw the film on Turner Classic Movies, and am glad I didn't buy it. I just thought it was unclever & unfunny. But lots of people love it, so what do I know? :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Loved One","review":"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.

The movie was quite true to the novel and I now own the video. Why it has not been made into a DVD is beyond my comprehension considering the black humor and nearly all-star cast. It is a classic for all times. While sections of the movie are rather depressing the entire story holds up very well and is darned funny. In essence, it is a satire on American burial customs and is worthy of a larger audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie buffs, this one's for you","review":"A movie way before it's time. A satire on the cemetery business in Southern California with Jonathon Winters playing two roles, Rod Steiger as the gay mortician Mr. Joyboy (who dotes on his morbidly obese mother) and you have Liberace selling coffins. There are cameos galore. Black & white, made in the mid-60's, this is a literate, black humor filled art house classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thre Loved One","review":"Video arrived in the designated time.

Yes, Steiger should have done more comedy--he's incredible in this movie.I write this with the hope that someone out there is adding up the votes for a DVD release. I'll also add that the long out of print \\"Catalogue of Cool\\" dubbed 1962 \\" The Last Good Year.\\" After that...well, we lost a lot of our wit, charm, whimsy, humanity, and creativity to Viet Nam, Watergate, and all the other dreariness--from Reaganism to Political Correctness--that led up to this uniquely ugly moment in history. There were a lot of sharp films made in the late Fifties to early Sixties that had qualities sadly lacking since--check out Wilder's \\"One, Two, Three\\" or \\"Inherit the Wind.\\" One reviewer notes that \\"The Loved One\\" is black comedy without the nihilism.

Instead they went to all that trouble of putting out good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fresh Horse Manure","review":"Once again Garth Brooks proves that his fans are the least musically educated, or just plain least educated, or any popular artist - and that includes Madonna's fans. This CD is garth-bage. I use mine now as a coaster. After hearing the songs \\"The Old Stuff\\" and \\"Cowboys And Angels\\" it's no wonder the Bay City Rollers have moved over to leave a seat for Garth Brooks in music history right next to them. I find it amazing that anyone could write \\"It's Midnight Cinderella,\\" look it over and think, Yeah That's Good and then put it on a CD for God sake. Of course, after hearing this CD I am convinced that Garth doesn't need fresh horses, he needs fresh ideas or even a little talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"the song i want isn't on here!!!","review":"It says online that the song, \\"To Make You Feel My Love\\" is on this CD.

That is the sole reason I bought this album so that I would own Brook's original as appose to other artists versions of the song.

I am a christian, and I really did not like the comparison made here.I would avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"jonemac says; Original and good","review":"This film breathes new life into the run of the mill, six foot under, usual undead plots. I really enjoyed it. The budget for the movie was certainly low and it shows, but the originality is awesome. I have been burned out on zombie movies for a few years; I mean how many times can you watch mindless, brain sucking zombies be blown up, ripped apart and mutilated? But, for some reason I thought I would give this one a shot. I was totally surprised and my hat is off to the writers, actors and director. Great job, thanks for not doing the same old zombie plot repeated 100 or more times, even continued in some of the recent higher budget zombie shredder fests. I think I will even buy this one. I gave it five stars for originality and because I felt the budget needed to be taken into consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"i want to be a comedy, action film but end up being a camp film","review":"Granted i haven't seen anything by this production company, but its lack of focus though out this film is painful.

That's what best describes this so-called movie. I sat through the entire movie just hoping it would redeem itself...never happened. This script relied on profanity for humor...didn't work. There was no storyline to speak of & the aliens were not what we normally envision. Do yourself a big favor, don't buy this farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add this to the list of \\"crappy zombie movies\\" list","review":"I rented this from Hollywood Video years ago and can still remember how bad it is. For some reason the ratio of good zombie movies to bad is heavily weighted to the bad side and one thing is for sure, Undead gets added to the bad/awful zombie movies. This movie tried being funny at times too but it failed at that too. If you're a huge zombie movie fan like i am and feel the need to watch every zombie movie just so you know you've seen it, i'm giving you some good advice...DON'T waste your time or money on this crappy movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen!!!!","review":"This movie was awful. I am not going to go indepth with why I think so, but if I could return it for the $5.99 I paid for it and get paid for the time it took me to watch it...I would ask to get reimbursed. I love \\"zombie\\" movies with all my heart, but mixing zombies with sci-fi did not do it for me. This movie was also NOWHERE near Peter Jackson's \\"Braindead/Dead Alive\\"...do not listen to the critic on the cover!!! Honestly I would not even recommend the rental of this movie, your time is probably more pretty valuable than the dollar to rent this \\"film\\". I guess I will have to stick to the classics and next time I will Netflix a movie before I make a blind purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T EVEN WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!!!!!!!","review":"I love zombie movies, and have tolerated a few that were certified \\"B\\" movies, but this one is an absolute F movie. It's awful, terrible, and reeks worst than the stench of the zombies that are in the film. Terrible movie score that won't go away, it plays throughout the duration of this silly movie. I think it's a comedy, but the trailer is very misleading---you're led to believe that it's a drama/horror film. The acting is weak and the special effects are horrible. PLEASE SPARE YOURSELF, it's not worth the rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest neo-zombie film","review":"Not as slapstick hilarious as Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, nor as charmingly inventive as Shaun of the Dead, Undead is probably the weakest of the neo-zombie films which includes 28 Days Later, the Dawn of the Dead remake and Romero's Land of the Dead. Undead looks great, but simply isn't.This film has some excellent cinematography. The use of shades and lights is very well executed. But that's the only reason I gave this film 2 stars. Everything else is lame. The effects fall short, the characters weak even for a zombie film, the action sequences lacking and the gore is not enough. The only thing going for this film is the acid rain, the fact that the zombies have an extraterrestial origin as opposed to a chemical or voodoo one, and Mungo McKay's character.A big yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spierig Brother's Rock !","review":"If you think the Spierig Brother's didn't purposely confuse you then your an idiot! None of the character's in this film had any idea what was going on so why should you? \\"unDEAD\\" is truly one of the most entertaining Zombie/sci-fi films that i have ever seen. Crazy has come to town for a visit & i stress the word CRAZY! Everyone compares this to Peter Jackson's \\"DEAD-ALIVE\\" or Sam Raimi's \\"EVIL DEAD\\" but I have to say this nutty film has all the gore from those films but it truly reminds me more of Tobe Hooper's crazy sci-fi/zombie classic \\"LIFEFORCE\\" with it's apocalyptic chaos & it's pure originality. The end of the world wouldn't be something you could understand! It would be crazy confusion! \\"unDEAD\\" is a chaotic laugh-fest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Clever!","review":"Who knew that something totally new could be done with a zombie movie? I have to admit that I'm a huge Zombie movie fan from \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" to \\"Return of the Living Dead\\" to \\"Zombi 5: The Killing Birds\\" to \\"The Dead Next Door\\". I have seen nearly all of them. With all the redundancy among them, I would have said that everything zombie has been done. Well, I would have been wrong. This is traditional zombie fun with a great twist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ed Wood's and Sam Raimi's brain child","review":"If Wood was alive today and teamed up with Raimi to direct a movie this is very much what you would see. Undead is a \\"classic\\" scifi- horror flick, by \\"classic\\" I mean it bring to life the 1950 gen of corniness but still holding on to the evil deadish gore and knee jerk scares. Anyone who likes either Ed Wood or Sam Raimi movies can find a place on their shelves for this little guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undead Should've Stayed Dead","review":"This was suppose to be the film that would've resurrected zombie films if it was released in America many years ago. This film would've put zombie films six feet deeper into the ground. All I can say is thank God for 28 Days Later and Dawn Of The Dead resurrecting zombie films.Undead is one of the worst films ever made. The film has very cool visuals for a film that only cost $100,000-$500,000, but the visuals couldn't save this crapfest. A boring film about meteors that films from the sky, landing in a small town, turning people into zombies. It truly gets worse when the dumb aliens from out of nowhere come into town.I can see why this wasn't release in the USA, it's a boring piece of garbage. Undead is dead...what a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub Par Zombie Stuff","review":"Fans of the Zombie genre will be entertained for the most part (or at least the first half). The film has a bit of style and the effects are good most of the time, but there's mot much here that we haven't seen before. I mean, we're running out of ways to kill zombies folks!Anyhow, the film makers at least try to up the ante by tacking the sci-fi/aliens twist into the story, but it's just not that interesting. And speaking of not that interesting, the characters are not fleshed out at all, and you never end of caring for any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"very misleading","review":"the cover is pretty good the story if you read the back don't say much. all the reveiws is misleading, as you watch this film it is pretty damn good in the first half but as you get further in the film it starts to go in a very horrible direction. basically the aliens were totatlly uncalled for. but it just went in a different direction from every other zombie film where they're saying the aliens were the cause of the zombie infestation. thats the only difference other than that dont waste your money just watch a romero film. you'll be a little more satisfied"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a mess","review":"It seems impossible for anyone to make a decent zombie movie anymore and this is an example. This film is a mess, poor acting, silly convuluted story, dumb characters and no real thrills or chills. Also it borders on campy satire one minute and then tries to be serious horror the next. The mix of zombies, aliens, acid rain etc. is just stupid. Do not waste your time. After I watched this piece of trash I was so put off that I had to watch George Romero's original \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" just to get the taste out of my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meteorites, Aliens and Zombies... oh my!","review":"My friends bought me this movie not that long ago, and when we popped it in our dvd player, I loved it, my friend loved it, and my other friend shook his head and went in the other room. I am a huge fan of zombie films, if theres undead, and gore, I am pleased with the mindless entertainment. I wasn't expecting a riveting plot, or oscar worthy acting, but it was good. Hey... it was at least better than the Dawn of the Dead remake...Just watch it with some popcorn, some soda or beer, and laugh your butts off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought!","review":"I liked this movie. I didn't know if I would. But it was cool. Good violence, cool action. A little strange, but that's ok. I liked the matrix styled moves. Good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I'm having a turd of a day.\\"","review":"Like a strange mixture of MARS ATTACKS! and RESIDENT EVIL II, UNDEAD is too silly, smug and disjointed to be enjoyed by the serious horror fan.The first five minutes are the best with a quick character introduction and also getting right into the meteor shower that turns the living humans into flesh eating zombies. After the zombies show up is when things start getting sillier and sillier. Example: the main guy is being attacked, in his home, by zombies from the front and the back so he lowers his head then raises his pistols and shoots in two directions at once like he was Christian Bale in EQUILIBRIUM and if that's not bad enough he then jumps in the air, flips upside down, jams his spurs (!?) into the wall above the doorway and literally swings back and forth shooting zombies.If that and lots of CGI effects sounds cool to you then by all means check it out, but I have no desire to ever see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is Going On?","review":"This movie had one of the most confusing and baffling storyline I have ever seen. The whole movie is an chinese riddle wrapped in a enigma. Besides a ridiculous plot, this movie did have potential to be a good zombie flick. It had really good special effects and some real clever death scenes. The zombie make-up and effects were top notch. Overall, I liked the zombies and the gore, but the plot and storyline derailed this movie before it ever got started. Even after the movie was over I was still comfused over what I did and watched for the last 2 hours. If your like me and love zombies and gore, its worth waisting 2 hours of your time. If you like well-written plots and storylines don't even come within 15 feet of this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID!!!","review":"This was terrible, awful, no good, no fun, TOTALLY STUPID TRASH!!!!!!

(if stupidier is a real word.)Watch out if you want to buy this one. Aliens and undead zombies don't mix in this combo. Somethings don't make a whole lot of sense, and lots of questions go unanswered. The only thing going for this movie was the Special F/X, because the story line Sucked!!! Rent before you buy! You come out cheaper!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombies - Aliens - And Gore!","review":"I have to say this movie was not to bad. It reminds me of peter Jackson Bad taste. It's somewhere on that level. It has meteors bombing this small Australian Town and turning them in to zombies. Then the aliens enter the picture and chaos has just taken over. They put a wall trapping all the people and they begin picking the towns people off one by one. I would tell you more but that would give away the plot. The gore and zombie action it pretty dam good for the budget they had to work with. Do not expect Land of the Dead but it better than most of the low budget zombie movies out their. I give 3 stars but just on effort alone I gave it four. I say check it out you will be surprised"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea.","review":"Was okay, I guess.

None of those 6 people got killed by the zombies, except for the big dude with the hat on at the ending. At first people turned into zombies by meteors, after that everyone who tuened into zombies turned back into regular people, but then all of the sudden, an infection spread and turned people into zombies again. Stuuuupid! We don't see how the big guy looks without his hat. Not even scary, just stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarbage!","review":"This movie was the biggest disappointment... Where to start.I thought this was supposed to be a good zombie flick in the tradition of the Romero Trilogy, or at least along the lines of 28 Days Later, Resident Evil, etc..No such thing! This is a ridiculous spoof of a movie, with an incredibly stupid alien (yes, little green men)plot. The effects are totally ridiculous with some CGI that look as if they were put together using a Commodore 64.

Hot chick, big hillbilly hero---wait...big hillbilly hero? Yeah...it didn't work out so well.Expect this one to start off fun----get really really sluggish in the middle----and then finish off pretty strong.Not such a bad film considering it was probably low-budget...but it was the middle of the film that gets it such a bad rating.

I thought this would be the perfect book my summer reading. I looked forward to learning about the sorrid history of Binion's WSOP and how to survive the tournament. I gave up about halfway through. The author is a journalist and you can tell. He can't sustain a train of thought for more than 5 pages. How did his editor let him get away with this?What I really hated was the Bad Jim/Good Jim. The multiple page soliquy on whether or not to receive a lap dance served absolutely no purpose. His inner ramblings only made me dislike the author more. I was hoping he would be eliminated from the tournament and his wife would leave him for losing thousands of dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky at Cards, Unlucky at Writing . . .","review":"The author was blessed with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tell an insider's story of the World Series of Poker, all set against the background of a sex and drug-laced murder and trial. Rather than being content simply to tell that story and to try to tell it well, Mr. McManus meanders through pointless and uninteresting self-analysis (\\"Good Jim\\" v. \\"Bad Jim\\" -- my gosh . . .), self-important asides, and just plain lazy writing. An editor would have been useful.Save the cost of the book and bet the money in Vegas instead. Even if you lose, your money's been better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissistic Gonzo Lite","review":"I bought this book hoping for the atmospherics of the World Series of Poker plus insightful coverage of Ted's Binion's murder & the subsequent trial. That stuff can be found, but for the most part the book is a cut-rate Hunter S. Thompson knock-off primarily focussed on the author's fascination with himself. Do you want to learn detailed minutia about 4 or 5 prior generations of McManus's? It's there. Are you interested in all the intimate details of the author's tawdry behavior in casino lounges? It's there. If you caught the guy on one of the episodes of the WSP on ESPN, you already know more about this pompous lunkhead than you need to (the \\"You called with a jack high?\\" episode -- yup, he's the one). I recommend instead Alvarez's \\"The Biggest Game in Town.\\" Somewhat outdated, but at least that guy can write."},{"rating":"1","title":"An article (or two) trying hard to be a book","review":"Jim McManus' experiences playing in the WSP as a long-shot were riveting and would have made a wonderful magazine article. His coverage of the Binion trial, as well, would have made a good article. But instead of taking the prudent course and publishing them thus, McManus ties the two together on the premise of a number of absurd, overwritten parallels between poker and murder, interweaving pages upon pages *upon pages* of irrelevant subtext about his own life, self-destructive tendencies, family history, and wonderful, wonderful (am I sick yet of hearing about how wonderful she is?) and forbearing wife, Jennifer.Mc Manus' editor should have been demoted for allowing the number of divergent, run-on pages (chapters, even) that detracted from the two interesting main storylines. All wrapped together as the book is, it doesn't make for good reading unless you know which 60% to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Time","review":"Title says it all...you have to wait till 5th street to even find something interesting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much murder, not enough poker...","review":"As another reviewer said in his 1-star review of this book, the sections on poker are excellent but they are buried inside of seemingly endless chapters on Ted Binion's murder, the author's grandparents, and all kinds of other nonsense. While those subjects could possibly be fascinating, McManus isn't nearly good enough as a writer to make them interesting. So what we're left with is a highly-compelling description of the 2000 WSOP for about 1/3rd of the book and then 2/3rds garbage.Best avoided if you're looking for a poker book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What disappointed me most about this book was the writing, which I would consider mediocre at best.

I wouldn't have guessed it by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I truly don't understand the fuss made about this pretentious and very awkwardly written book.

McManus tries too hard at times, and ends up writing too much about the unimportant. One thing that surprised me is that half of the book is about the death of Ted Binion and the whole scandal surrounding it. McManus makes the book too personal at times. It's almost like a journal, and although he might care about his own hourly activities, we don't. We also don't care about his family and his children. A good editor could have made this book much better. How sad. Better stick with the poker McManus, because you're not much of a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I had hoped for much more. The author has A LOT of first-rate, first-hand material to draw on, but gets bogged down early in IMAGINING the Binion murder (the writing is ridiculously inane at times) There is also too much \\"textbook\\" filler and clutter about the great game of Texas Hold Em that one will enjoy far more in A. Alvarez's classic (Alvarez's writing is better than McManus's by a factor of five). But the Good Jim/Bad Jim stuff is fun, and will make you laugh. I also enjoyed the author's narrative from the final table at the WSOP, though at times it inexplicably bogged down. This book could have used a strong, rock-em-sock-em editor. It is hardly the classic some people here think it is. And that's a big disappointment because the author had the \\"nuts,\\" as they say in Hold Em, to write that classic. He just failed to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Words .....Bor - Ring","review":"This book is so boring in the beginning that I haven't even been able to finish it to get to parts that other reviewers say are exciting.

I read it because I am a fan of poker and a long time follower of the World Series of Poker. Others have written about their own poker adventures, but Mr. McManus takes us beyond just poker. He writes of Benny Binion and the murder of his son, Ted. He shares with us intimate stories about his family and his own past. He delves into the history of poker and some of its more famous players. This book is far beyond just a \\"poker adventure\\" book. The stories are very informative, insightful, entertaining and at times touchingly personal. You do not have to be a fan of poker to enjoy this book. If you have ever thought of what it would be like to follow one of your dreams, then you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively Boring!","review":"I was so excited to read this book after all the glowing reviews. I had previously enjoyed Big Deal and the two Michael Konik gambling story collections and I was ready to add this one to my list of classics. Not even close!

I actually ordered some of the computer simulation games the author mentions to learn more about the game itself.The author did alot of great research but some of it is a bit long-winded.

McManus' account of his World Series of Poker experience is incredible. He took a big gamble himself by putting up most of his book advance to try to qualify for the Main Event. It really made a great story.I also enjoyed the story of Ted Binion's murder. McManus goes into great detail about the case and trial. There was a lot of controversy surrounding the case and McManus did a great job of sifting through it all. He also had quite a few great interviews related to the case that really helped get a lot of good inside information.

However, the anchor is a necessary evil for being able to hold your position in current and get some good fishing in. We both got these anchors at the same time and have used them in various bodies of water over the last month.So far, this anchor has never let us down. Even when the current has been quite strong, it has never budged.

Woo also wrote the introduction. Along with Mike Avon Oeming's art, that's about all that's worth a look.The story seems to be patterned after kung-fu movies, but the creators seem to forget that the fun of a kung-fu flick is NOT the dopey plot, or the deep meditations of the tortured characters, but the KUNG-FU. Seeing 2 VERY short action sequences in print is not a thrill....The characters are all forgettable, and I didn't feel for any of them in the slightest. My sole enjoyment in this waste of money came from the numerous self-congratulatory essays from the various people involved with the book.

I don't know if this is actually an advantage, but if you compare, this mower has more blades than most of the others out there.

The ground in our back yard is a little uneven, so I think all the bumping and jostling while pushing got to it. It cut the bluegrass in our back yard alright, but we have what I think is really beefy bermuda grass in our front yard, and this was reallllly hard to cut with the mower. We barely could get it done the first time through, then as the blade got more and more dull (we're talking like, after 3-4 mowings, not years here) it just wouldn't do it.I really wanted to like it, and I like the idea of the reel mowers, but the blade on a normal mower is so much easier to sharpen... we ended up bringing it to goodwill and getting a corded lawn mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for me, a complete lawn mower novice","review":"I have a lawn thats too small and odd-shaped to cut with a gas powered mower.

Because I have really thick zoysia, it tends to clog the mower. I thought buying a smaller 16 inch mower with more cutting edges would work better. In reality, the mower does a better job at cutting the grass, and the large rollers in the rear make the cut look even better. The problem I have is that when pushing the mower the handles fold down causing weakness. Too much of this causes the handles to finally break. The handle needs to be a loop in order to withstand the constant pushing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bent Reel Mower","review":"Fast delivery, easy assembly. In order to get a clean cut on the grass it is frequently necessary to go over some spots a few times."},{"rating":"2","title":"bent reel mower # 1702-16","review":"IT is still winter here. But i have a small putting green and it works great for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent on St. Augustine, not so good for Bermudagrass.","review":"My lawn is a mix of St. Augustine and Bermudagrass, depending on the sun/shade of a given area. This mower breezes through the St. Augustine, but jams up constantly on bermudagrass. Even immediately after sharpening it, I find that I have to mow the bermudagrass sections 6\\" at a time and make 2-3 passes. Given a little extra time and some heave-ho, it gets the job done. The real downside to this back and forth is that the plastic brackets holding the rear roller failed. I replaced them with hollow square steel tubing, and haven't had any problems with that since.On the whole, I'm quite pleased, though a little surprised by the difficulty with this one specific grass.As an aside, I live 8 blocks from the gulf of mexico, and have had no problems with rust or corrosion of any kind from the salty air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Like another review said this is perfect for a small yard. It's not too heavy or too big to carry or store. It works perfectly & it was easy to assemble. The CON for this product is the box it came in. It came in a simple brown box and when I received the package the box was broken in almost all eight corners which means that pieces could have been lost & I could have been left with lawn mower missing parts. Luckily no pieces were lost & it's almost a month that I have been using this lawn mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice American-manufactured lawnmower","review":"I had read a nice review of the American Lawn Mower Company's list of reel mowers and I was convinced this was the right machine for me. I have a centipede lawn and this machine cuts better than any gas or electric mower I own. Neither of them is reliable either, while this machine should go the distance. I purchased the blade sharpening kit as well, so far haven't needed it (I have used it four times already since March). It is lighter than either the gas or electric mower I have, so it is no harder to push nor maneuver. You won't regret buying this from Amazon.com as I got free shipping and delivery was in 5 days. You have to assemble the mower, but that is relatively simple, although the instructions are poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuts great and is fun to use","review":"I was looking for a small light weight mower that didn't wear you out pulling the starter cord just to get it going,or one that didn't need a long cord to hassle with. This mower fits the bill. It was easy and quick to assemble. I took it for a run around the yard. It really cuts great. The only down side was that some of the long grass tended to wrap around the axle, I had to stop and unwind that. So far I haven't had to adjust the cutting height, that looks like it might be a challenge when the time comes. Over all, I rate this as one of the better purchases I've made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and Mostly Good","review":"I have enjoyed my reel mower on my new sod. As someone stated, it is most useful if the lawn is very flat. Mine is not (in spots) and, as a result, I've had to mow it repeatedly to get it trimmed evenly. Not just once or twice, sometimes three or four times. (That's why I give it only 4 stars!)That being said, I have enjoyed the peace and quiet of a manually powered mower. I've mowed after dark (with outside lights) and early in the morning. I don't feel guilty about mowing over the same area again as the only energy I'm using is my own.I'd recommend this for someone with a smaller, mostly level yard who doesn't mind the old saying, \\"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Which bermuda does it cut?","review":"I bought this mower for my bermuda lawn - skipping the 5 blade models for the 'bent grass' model. It's underperformed since day one. It's overly sensitive to the slightest bump or dip in the yard and constantly chokes on thicker (not taller) areas.One of the wheels also seems to catch from time-to-time, as if the gear inside the wheel isn't turning.I had one of the cheap 15\\" reels and loved it - cut turf in WA and CT and even St. Augustine's in Houston. I sold it in AZ (no lawn) and regret it. I've stopped telling people about the merits of reel mowers - in case this is the new quality of the mowers being made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lawn Reel Lawn Mower","review":"I found this to be great mower.

At times pieces of wood mulch from the garden beds will stop the blade but I just back up a bit a keep on going. What I like most is when I want to mow I grab the mower and start mowing. It does not get close to the sides of vertical surfaces so you do have a little more trimming to do. Overall I am very happy with the mower. Others reviews said the handle bends easily but I have not had a problem with that happening although I plan to stiffen it up a bit with a fabricated brace across the top of both handles."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price","review":"This is a great mower for a small lawn. There are many areas that must be passed over twice to get an even cut. It is not to heavy to push, it moves smoothly across the lawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed","review":"I resodded my yard from St Augustine to Empire Zoysia. I wanted to give a reel mower a chance but always presumed I would go back to a motored mower. I have been highly impressed and the yard looks great. One note, after every use I blow off any dry clippings and spray the blades down with WD40. This has drastically improved the ease of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating in a microscopic sort of way","review":"because of (historical) lack of interest,eva braun remains a woman of mystery to many people, still. after reading this book several times over the years,i have come to get a good idea of what eva braun was like as a person.eva was not a \\"scholar\\" by any means,but neither was she stupid. she was not complicated and enjoyed the good things in life. she was very loyal to her close friends and yes,she loved adolf hitler. she lived her life the way SHE wanted and loved who she wanted to love (period).i do believe the author,nerin gun,researched his subject and interviewed eva's friends and relatives(although i've read eva's kin later regretted talking to the author). the author is direct in his narrative-injecting small details which makes it all the more interesting. the photos are good,a few i have not seen before of: eva,family,and friends.i will say ,this is THE book written about eva braun that should be read FIRST before any of the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book - glad I saw it reviewed on AMAZON.","review":"A pleasure doing business with this bookseller. I received the book exceptionally fast and in great condition, as described. I changed the old plastic cover and put on a new one - dust jacket was in stellar condition - considering the book is 44 years old. I'm glad I read the reviews on all others of this subject, because I find readers very helpful when there are many choices and I'm wanting the one 'closest to the primary sources - interviews, documents and work by the author - not just using others books to quote. Outstanding book."},{"rating":"1","title":"opinions","review":"I just concluded reading Gun's book - Eva Braun. The information was very weak, uninformative. Primarily I think he wrote this in order to express his own personal feelings and spin on how he viewed the key players in Germany from 1929-45. He keeps citing his sources, which leads me to think he needs to constantly show us how much research he has done, this conveys no confidence in his work, and questions the authenticity of it. The book has no depth, all information is on the surface. Without his personal opinions, it could have been 50 pages. Don't waste time reading this one its not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Price","review":"Strong bulb for size; nice cord and connectors;also included: added ~ 8\\" connector for running fixtures in series.Clips are cheese, but can run thin wire through them (barely) and then tie / chain on your own.

Both these releases should have been stellar because McPhee, in the same breath as Rory Gallagher, John Mayall, and Peter Green is one of the kings of British blues rock, and paying homage to one of his heroes should be a pleasure, not a chore to listen to. Intead, Muddy Waters Songbook is even more uninspired than it's predecessor, and sounds like it was recorded on the budget of a teenage local band doing their first demo. The guitar sound is unbelievably weak, the entire band just sounds like they want to get it over with. Such a shame that a talent like TS McPhee has been reduced to putting out this type of junk. Don't waste your money on this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A RIP-OFF!","review":"I rate this toy a big fat 0. The description makes you believe this doll can stand and dance on her own.

First, all the doll does is spin and play music...that's when she's working. We are constantly...ever other minute...having to reset the doll because it is very tempermental. Sometimes the music won't play, sometimes she won't spin. Her arms get caught in her dress, her dress gets tangled. It is a very delicate doll. It did not keep my 5 year old's attention and is worth more trouble than it's worth. More a show piece that a toy to play with. We are very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney Dancing Cinderella","review":"I bought this doll for my daughter for Christmas. It was the only thing she asked for and wanted very badly.

We were able to return the doll to ... for a full refund, but my daughter is still very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LIKE this doll!","review":"We got this doll for our 4 year old Cinderella fan and have not been disappointed! I'm not sure I would have paid full price for it but at the discounted price, this doll was a VERY good buy! My 2 year old son even figured out how to make Cinderella \\"dance\\"! They all (ages 2,4,5) take turns picking her up, listening to the music and watching her spin. My daughter has even been sleeping with it so I know it is one of her favorites! We have had no problems with the doll and it is really a nice sized doll. I do recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we expected!","review":"That's what we get for not reading all of the reviews in advance of buying. Thank goodness we got her on sale! The doll only dances while the jewel is pressed and the tiara is lifted, which means my four year old has to hold her to dance with her, and possibly clock her brother in the head. Worse than that, the music stops playing after a very short time and the doll has to be \\"reset\\" by turning it off and on again via a switch on her back, behind a very tight velcro closure. My daughter can open the back and turn it off and on again but cannot close the back of the dress back up. I think even a die-hard Disney Princess fan will be disappointed with this doll within a day or two. She should at least have a base that she can dance in!!!

James Woods told them that if they cut it out, he would not accept the role because it is what every alcoholic needs to hear and identify with. I highly respect him for that and would like to say THANKS!!! The scene at the end were Bill is 12-stepping a newcomer is priceless.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as a whole and as I am 20 years sober this year, I am quite glad to find a better copy than my recorded one.Garner plays a great Doctor Bob and Woods an ambitious Bill W. The scenes at the hospital show how important the doctor there was to the creation of the group and that alcoholism was being recognized as something other than a \\"moral malady\\".If you are interested in how AA came to be and who was involved, this is a great video.

He sheds light on every day life in Pompeii including chapters on the layouts of homes, the importance of gardening in ancient Italy, religious life, political life, and sports.

The dialouge and the acting is very real and believable, you feel like you're a voyeur rather than a regular film viewer.However, like most indie films its not for everyone. The pace is slow, and there is no big 'whodunit' plot or a 'wacky car chase'. The plot is simple: two strangers are getting to know each other for one night only. The film is pure dialouge.i'll put it this way: if you liked \\"Magnolia\\", there is a good chance you'll like this film. They are both 'slice of life' films. However, Magnolia has alot more action than Before Sunrise.In other words, if you like dialouge films, don't sleep on 'Before Sunrise'.

The monologues are unbelievably vapid, and it never feels like the characters are listening to each other, just waiting for their turn to speak.The improvised moments have the forced falseness that almost always comes from filmed improvisation.There's no feeling here, no passion, no chemistry. The only emotional depth came when they said goodbye, but so little had passed between them up to that moment that I couldn't be moved.I did hope the movie was building to some sort of exciting climax where they shave off Ethan Hawke's annoying goatee, but no such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"Now that Before Sunset is out, there's renewed interest in Before Sunrise. This movie is so shallow, tedious and boring that it should be allowed to die in peace. Unless you are predisposed to fall in love with Ethan Hawke or Julie Delpy, you would be well advised to avoid it. As an infomercial by the Vienna Tourist Office, this is far more successful than as a movie.

I was so happy I did. The movie was extremely boring and pretentious about two self-absorbed people. The simple rule for a romantic movie to work is that the characters have to be likable and hopefully they have great chemistry. This movie lacks both. I watched the entire boring thing because of Vienna. But even Vienna cannot save this dreadful film. For a great romantic movie in a beautiful European city, why not try David Lean's \\"Summertime\\". Yes, it is about a chance encounter between two strangers. Yes, it has a lot of talking.

I found his character unappealing especially his line delivery. Maybe he was supposed to sound earnest and young but he sounds full of **it. BUT this could be true love or a real connection for these two people just like in real life, people don't have to have public approval to be compatible with one another. So basically, this movie and the dialogue and the entire movie is their conversation is ... none of my business. I really don't agree with the heavy sustained hype over the decades about this movie.

This movie is not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Looking but empty","review":"This is a movie that you expect to be poignant and \\"deep\\" but is actually sort of annoying.Maybe it has a couple of nice scenes , but the banter between the characters wasn't particulary clever or deep or anything ,just very basic and self absorbed, almost like a parody of how \\"intelligent \\" people must talk. Not a single thing in the movie made me give a damn about them being together, thera was no tension, no ache, no conflict of any sort.In the end is just good looking people talking and falling in love and trying to be smart and angsty and.....oh f off already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"I (almost) love this movie. While I agree with most of the reviewers who comment on its romantic nature,at the same time, I think most miss the point. For me, the beauty of the movie is the suggestion of the fact that romance, by its very nature, is ephemeral. Romance exists only as a concept, any attempt to ground it in reality must ultimately end in failure. The final scenes, which are a revisiting of the sites of earlier scenes, serve to underscore this. Kudos to the writer, Mr Linklater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk, talk, talk, but goes no where","review":"If you like 'day in the life' movies, it's good.

He did it, the viewers don't feel bored ( such a contrast to \\"Anne Frank\\" ). Needless to say, they are not intended for the children unless they sufficiently know about the ironies and humours of modern life.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been there, done that","review":"I couldn't believe this movie when it first came out. I had a nearly identical experience in Austria (same as the movie) in 1971. The only difference was the gal was an American. It made me wonder who had been following us around. Sadly, i let her get away from me when we got back to the states. Mea Culpa.I found it well done, and convincingly acted. The street scenes and infrastructure was as i remembered it.. Overall a top notch production - sadly ignored by the media and movie reviewers. Interaction between the two major characters was as i remember doing it.Even Hawke's line about: \\"In a few years you'll be married... you'll wonder how things would have worked out with someone else you'd met.. look at this as time travel..\\". I actually used that line myself. Incredible parallelism.

They should have made the girl just want him for a romantic roll in the hay.I guess all the rave reviews come from women so desperate for a good romantic movie, they are easily impressed.I too would like to see Hollywood do more in the romance arena, even some adaptations of favorite romance novels, but alas \\"BEFORE SUNRISE\\" is not one of these masterpieces.Good, OK, worth seeing, but not worth the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy to use as \\"sprinkler\\" hose","review":"Warning...I bought to use as a sprinkler hose for the side(s) of our house.

That is at the side where the hose is connected, towards and at the end of the unit..... maybe spraying 1' up and inches to the left and right. Unit might be ok for soaker hose when wrapped around plants, etc. but i bought it for what it is labeled for, SPRINKLER HOSE. UGH....

I would end up wasting a great deal of time untwisting it. I found that it is easiest way to get it untwisted was to turn the water on and just get soaking wet, but save time.

Swan is downright terrible and the company doesn't respond. This hose worked well for a couple of years before splitting on the sides. It's not used everyday. Maybe only 10 times a month during the summer and only at night for about an hour each time. The top side of the hose is very difficult to find and can only be set out during the day. The hose is very light and tends to keep twisting. Can take an hour to set up correctly.

It is also a story about honor, friendship, making decisions and their consequences. Filmed in 1945, the atmosphere of world war is present in the background.As for the DVD itself, let me describe the version I purchased: CineVisión by Image Entertainment. it has only one feature: PLAY. What is very upsetting is that the soundtrack is entirely dubbed! I was hoping on hearing the very young Ricardo Montalbán's voice in his native Spanish. This DVD is not remastered. Thus the overall 2 star rating. I would try my luck with a different better quality product hoping it is NOT dubbed.SPOILER: Though the drama unfolds somewhat predictably, I was not too happy with the part of the ending that honors the dishonorably discharged deceased cadet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great with Scotts 20-Inch Classic!","review":"I just sharpened the blades on myScotts 2000-20 20-Inch Classic Push Reel Lawn Moweryesterday evening.

This guide seems to cover the major tourist sites only (which is typically what I want to see on my first visit to a new country).Also, this appears to be a very popular book with tourists - there were many times when we could spot fellow tourists because they were carrying this same book, often in spanish, italian, or one of the other many languages that this guide is translated into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I have always liked DK's Eyewitness series of travel books, and \\"Japan\\" is consistent with their past quality.

Now there is a small control knob (Rotary commander) in-between the player and cassette adapter, so that you may stop, skip forward/backward, or pause play. Anyway, with no actual 'line out', you have to adjust both the car stereo volume/bass/treble and the volume on the the Sony portable player.

And Ms. Holmes turned in yet another terrific performance giving this movie its only redeeming quality. However, I went to this movie to see a thriller and a mystery, hoping for a few scares, but I came out of it sad. Sad that the main character has so many problems in her life and sad that I didn't go see The Ring instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am a big fan of Katie Holmes, but I can't deny that this movie is boring and disappointing. I was literally falling asleep in the movie theatre. In fact, I think I only focused in on half of the movie. I would not recommend this as a movie to watch over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless and Obvious","review":"There are so many things wrong with this film, I feel like ruining the ending for everyone just so they don't have to waste two hours of their life watching this drivel. I have no idea what the Oscar-winning Writer (can the academy take an award back?) was thinking here: part College-slice of life, part detective story, part alcoholism p.s.a, part love story. ALL DONE POORLY. Skip this mess. Not even Holmes, who's been impressive in \\"Wonderboys,\\" and even the \\"The Gift,\\" can make ANY of this film convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie Is Awful","review":"I fell asleep while watching this horrible movie. Benjamin Bratt is horrible in this movie. I hated his character. The movie could have been a lot better but it ends up being pointless and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was reasonably entertianing, but...","review":"...for a mystery/thriller, there was very little that was mysterious or thrilling. From the first 15 minutes of the film, the end was obvious. Call me crazy, but I like plot twists that I don't see coming a mile away.But hey, it could have been worse - it could have been Disturbing Behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"McGill Alumni pay close attention...","review":"The movie itself is pretty bad, but as a McGill graduate, I was pleasantly surprised when I was flipping channels and happenned upon scenes of Leacock, Upper Rez, Douglas Hall, the Royal Vic Hospital, and even the football field that our proud Redmen share with the Montreal Alouettes. Definitely worth checking out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What... the... HELL!?","review":"I saw this in the theaters and wanted to burn all the copies. The ending makes absolutley NO sense, and the story pretty much [stinks]. It was also OVER HYPED and the dvd [is bad].AVOID EYE CONTACT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"Yep, a good acting and a story begining well until you lose the plot and finally understand the illusion things easily. Then the end that messes up the whole plot with an unroginal twist if we can still call that \\"A twist\\". A pity! They could have made a very scary movie out from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...........","review":"I never, ever thought I'd say it...but Katie Holmes on screen about 98% of the time just didn't do enough to make this movie worth it. Decent premise, I suppose. Boyfriend missing, recovering alcoholic cop on the verge of a relapse. It just doesn't add up, and there's a supposed \\"twist\\" at the end can be guessed as soon as you learn the premise. Coulda been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough story to warrant a feature film","review":"First off, starting with the positives - 'Abandon,' on DVD contains an above average video transfer and a superb, well mixed Dolby 5.1 audio track. The score is moody and foreboding without being too over the top as well. The disc extras are somewhat light with your typical 'making of' featurette and 8 or so deleted scenes that are instantly forgettable.On the downside the storyline borders on meager. As a psychological crime thriller this film would've been better suited as a 22 minute episode of 'Alfred Hitchcok Presents' rather then the 98 minute feature it was stretched out to be. Couple this with the overall lackluster performances and you're left with a flick you could well do without unless you find yourself nursing a hangover one morning with nothing better to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abandoned sense of direction","review":"You know when you watch a movie half-way through and you get the general idea of what the movie was about, but you're not quite sure of all the details of the plot? That's the same feeling I got when I watched Abandon all the way through. The movie had a sense of direction equal to that of a chicken with its head cut off. The plot just kind of staggered around, didn't really go anywhere. There are points in the film where you can tell that suspense is trying to be created, but there isn't any real ground here to build suspense. You feel like you should be expecting something riveting to happen, but you're not sure what, and nothing really happens. Overall, there's some okay points in the film involving character development and preformance, but that's not enough to save this mostly uninteresting and inconclusive movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor attempt at a mystery","review":"I was disappointed at the end of this movie...disappointed I wasted 91 minutes of my life! I did give the films two stars: one for Benjamin Bratt and one for the cinematography that effectively brought out the dark atmosphere/overtone of the film. Aside from that, there in nothing else worth much in the film. The storyline is very predictable and the acting wasn't too hot.Rent this if you love Benjamin Bratt or are in the mood for \\"Mulholland Drive\\" type movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I'm not a person that is easily bored but I could not wait until this movie was over. The only reason I continued to watch it was just because I wanted to see the end (which, by the way) was pretty predictable. I didn't watch it at the theater and I didn't rent it either. It just happened to be on one day and that is why I even started watching it. Final verdict: If you're curious to watch it, just wait until it's on TV but don't spend money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughy enjoyed","review":"This is a good movie. Granted it is not the greatest psychological thriller that I have seen, it is not bad at all. Katie Holmes gives an incredible performance as well as Charlie Hunnam and Benjamin Bratt. The cinematography is well-done and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. The movie is not as predictable as others make it out to be. In fact it is not bad at all. \\"Abandon\\" may not win any awards or be the best movie ever made, but it is unique and well-done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abandon all hope!!","review":"I have rarely, if ever, turned off a movie. I did with this one. I don't know where to start with it. Suffice it to say, it lacks any serious plot - it stumbles around looking to create one, but it does not have one. I constantly got the feeling that someone edited out about an hour of the movie. I could go on for hours, but I won't. Just save yourself the trouble and leave this one alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abandon this movie!!!","review":"Not only is Abandon poorly written, but boring as well.Without Katie Holmes, \\"Abandon\\" would have been like \\"Hardvard Man\\" without Sarah Michelle Gellar, a long, boring Bore-Fest!Well, anyway, \\"Abandon\\" is about a success-driven college student Katie (played by Holmes(who else?!) And Katie's Boy firend Embry(??) has been missing for two years. And the the Dective(Bratt) and he is invetigating his disappearance. So, thats about it. There are also some jumper[scenes] in the movie.When the end finally came I was so glad. Not only because the movie I wasted $$$... and about two hours of my life was over, but also because the end was a shocker! So all in all , to be frank,this movie STUNK mayjorly!!P.S. I only gave this movie a star, because I couldn't leave without one. Otherwise, I would give this stinker a big fat ZERO!ZILCH! NADA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have abandoned this movie","review":"This movie is so slow. I was spacing out while watching it. The characters are so two dimentional. Katie Holmes is a beautiful actress but she cant act. The real saver of this movie is Zooey Deschanel whose beauty and outgoing character is the only good point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising Story, But, Oh, So F---ing Slow And Boring. ABANDON SHIP.","review":"Note: I did not finish watching this movie.I was drawn to this movie because of the plot and of course, Katie Holmes. But this movie is so f---ing slow and boring. I sat through 49 minutes of it before I finally decided I'd had enough. The pacing is extremely slow and the dialogue is so lame. ABANDON this movie. Boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Abondon It","review":"Good movie! Don't give up in the beginning. The pacing runs a little slow for a thriller but it's all worth it in the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abandon : The Worst Film I've Seen This Year","review":"After the great sling of thrillers like \\"Signs\\" and \\"The Ring\\" I thought going to see Abandon would be pretty well worth my money also. Well..I was wrong. The predictable storyline, if you can even figure out what the main plot is, the mediocre acting and the unoriginal ending, the whole movie is pretty much worth half of what you pay at a matinee showing. The only up points were the moments when you got startled, and the few times when you felt like it was suspensful.C-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this slip and slide is the best one yet.

If you want to have a fun and refreshing summer BUY THIS SLIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"My kids, 7 and 5, are having a blast on this slide. It was well worth the price. The base being inflated completely protects them from a hard belly landing. It seems very durable as well.Update: We've had this slide for well over a month and it held up until recently. There's a leak at the seam near the nozzle of the base portion. We will attempt to use a sealant to repair as the adhesive patch didn't work at all. The other chambers have held up great and the kids had been enjoying the slide all summer.Update 2: Fixed the hole with a seam sealer, worked great and held up fine until the yellow pool portion separated from the blue inflatable ring. There were about 5 kids, ages 5-8, using the slip n slide at the time. We will try to use the seam sealer to repair this opening as well, but it's pretty large. School starts next week so even if it's not fixable we got most of the summer out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the \\"Big Rig\\" rating.","review":"This guide is a little dated (3rd edition - 2005), but it's not hard to cross reference the campgrounds in this guide with a more recent (Trailer Life) guide, so that's not a major problem. The campground descriptions are spot on, but the feature we relied on most was the \\"Big Rigs\\" symbol. We pull a 32' 5th wheel, so we're not really huge, but knowing you can maneuver before you enter a campground is worth it's weight in Alaska gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"handy travel guide","review":"Helpful and easy to use.

I got rid of all of them except this one before I was a month in on a 2 1/2 month wonderful adventure. Their information made it easy for me to find lots of out-of-the-way places that I might never have found otherwise. Since you can boondock almost anywhere in AK, there is no way the book can include all those open spaces - but their information got me on the routes to find the spots. I also had thought of this as an \\"Alaskan adventure\\" but they got me thinking that Canada and the Yukon were as much of the adventure and not to rush through. Because of this guide, I purchased their Baja book which I wouldn't have wanted to be without in Baja and also their SW book - where I found a lot of places to visit that I might have missed when I traveled that way. I've become a big fan of the Church's books. Highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pages","review":"The book seems to be very well-written & valuable, but is missing pages 257-320 (Kenai Peninsula) & has repeated pages 129-192 instead.Check your copy carefully as soon as it arrives."},{"rating":"2","title":"as advertized","review":"got the job done --- ---- ---- ------ ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ---- -"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Milepost","review":"This book was invaluable during our two month long camping trip through Canada and Alaska.

Well-written and supplies much more than just the essential camping information--road info, fishing, you-name-it. Well done.

The silver is good and the little heart charm is a great starter. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants one. The only problem I see is that it's a bit short, so make sure you know your girlfriend/spouse/boyfriend etc's actual wrist size.

It is helpfully explained in basic English and numerous detailed illustrations that will not confuse the learner. Every aspect of the topic is completely covered in detail, with sections on machines and tools, pattern woods, pattern turning, and much more. Almost 50 projects are included and explained in detail that will further aid in the understanding of the project.

Gates never invented anything of significance in the software area or any other; he and his gang have bought, copied, or stolen virtually every software advance Microsoft has ever marketed. The only amazing thing about Gates and gang is their unfailing ability to produce and sell low-quality operating systems and software applications.

(Except dime store romances don't take themselves quite so seriously.)It is a really dumb book - to be blunt.

He got angry at Charlotte - called her all kinds of vile names, then promised it would not happen again, and even promised to trust her. Didn't happen. Alex did the very same thing a few months later - called her the same names and failed to trust Charlotte as he'd promised. There's no way this guy would ever keep his word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Potent Pleasures is a grave disappointment when compared to the well-written, historically accurate stories lovingly created by hard-working regency authors who know their stuff.

I hate it even more when she lost her virginity to the hero, who doesn't remember/doesn't realize it was her/was drunk off his head.

Sadly, Potent Pleasures failed to deliver. Was I the only one who thought the characters felt like ones you'd find on a television sitcom, and not a very good one at that? Shallow, self-absorbed, pathetic. I was so hoping to find a fabulous new talent in the genre I've loved since I was in school. I work full time and am a full time wife and mother.

I am not one to point out historical inaccuracies and I don't care too much about that whole aspect so nothing like that really bothered me. Pippa did seem a little vocally advanced for her tender years but whatever.I didn't get into the romance as much as everyone else here seemed to. I didn't really like the characters.

I found this to be a story with very real, desirable and fallible characters. No, the hero was not Prince Charming. Had he been, the story would be void of any depth. He brought to his relationship what we now call a lot of \\"baggage.\\" Yes, he was a jerk at times, but that is what made him real and I liked the story more because the characters were able to overcome their struggles. I highly recommend this one...worth the time and the money. If you only like books where the characters say, \\"Hmm, does he really love me?\\", then sex scenes, then I love you, then the end, then maybe you won't like this one. Otherwise, it's a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...but...","review":"The very idea that this great father, Alexander Foakes, could become so angry that he didn't consider or half-realize that he was abandoning his daughter for a couple weeks was appalling.I did find Alex to be sexy and handsome and all that, and the story will definitely hold the reader's interest, (the reason for 4 stars) but in addition to his faulty parenting, he was quite cruel to Charlotte."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEITHER POTENT NOR PLEASURES AT ALL","review":"This book is neither POTENT nor PLEASURES at all! This is so far, THE WORST regency romance with uttery anemic stupid unattractive hero heroin. The hero Alex is a lack-wit bully while the heroin Charlotte is a lack-wit ninny a passive victim. It seems the logic behind the story is ill-logical. The author treats the readers as if they are retarded. Furthermore there are too many uninteresting minor characters that cause too much distraction. Also there are lot of unnecessary details that put people to sleep. The melodramatic tragic events in this book are forced and unwanted because they are not that tragic at all. The story does not flow well and lots of the dialogs are dull dying small talks. The plots suck. The only lively character perhaps is Sophie.All mentioned above make this book a frustrating read. Had to put the book away. Too many well written books out there don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair - 2.5 Stars","review":"This book was okay. I don't think it was as howlingly bad as some other reviewers, nor would I give it a great review. I tend to lose interest very quickly when characters behave in a way that stretches the bounds of credibility. For example: The hero is so crazy about the heroine, and when she finally admits that she met him long ago, he doesn't press for details and just assumes it was his twin brother? Give me a break. No man is that incurious. However, some of the other characterizations are pretty good, as is the plot. I think this writer will improve with practice. All in all, it might be worth picking up at the library if there's nothing more interesting around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Romantic","review":"I have read the entire Pleasures Trilogy: Potent Pleasures, Midnight Pleasures and Enchanting Pleasures.

Unfortunately, this quote is completely misleading. After reading about five chapters of POTENT PLEASURES, I felt as if I had jumped into a dumpster and rubbed rotting vegetables all over myself. Yuck.There are twists and turns in the book, but they're completely nonsensical, and when a character isn't doing something that I reeeeeally do not need to know about, the book is just boring. The characters, meanwhile, are as flat as the paper they're printed on, not to mention as flimsily constructed, and were completely unlikable.In other words, I thought this was a very trashy (and not in a good, entertaining way, either) novel that I fervently wish I had never spent money on. Beware, because you may wish the same, should you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sappy! Too stupid!","review":"This book was silly, stupid, unbelievable and way too SAPPY for my taste. It was also very predictable. I thought the characters acted more like teenagers than adults. Don't waste your money.

I'll be more wary next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and fun!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The plot was unique, the characters were well drawn and the dialogue was witty. I laughed out loud in more than one place. It reminded me a little of Julia Quinn in style.

I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel now...it's supposed to be out in August."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I'm disappointed more with the publisher than the author for actually letting this go all through the supposed system of editors and copy editors and still emerge with so many inaccuracies and just plain shocking grammatical errors. There are dozens of good writers who have paid their dues in paperback who deserve to break out in hardcover. This is an embarassment to the genre and should be to the publisher too. Pajamas, for goodness sake. And yes, one more flying eyebrow and the book would have flown against the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"a tedious book with unlikeable and unreal characters in very contrived situations","review":"The plot is described in many places, so I won't go through it.After the n-th time the heroine thinks she should tell thehero he slept with her before marriage and has forgotten,you lose all patience. Distress after distress that a fewwords can avert.

But to my horror, I couldn't even get through the first few chapters without screaming with frustration from the dryness of it it all. I mean, the hero and heroine don't even get married until the fourteenth chapter or so. By then I didn't really care. because I couldn't even stand the heroine by then. (She is such a twit!) Maybe if the plot moved faster, I wouldn't have had to dwell on how stupid Charlotte and the rest of the characters were. There is no way that I will read the author's sequel \\"Midnight Pleasures\\". Why bother to waste another $6.50?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I must agree with other reviews giving this book one star although they got farther into the book than I did with regards to inaccurate information. I read to where she followed him into the garden and then I put the book down until I traded it at the second hand book store. Quit frankly I disliked the heroine - no morals. Maybe she got some latter, but it doesn't sound like it from other reviewers. I like romance in my romance novels not jumping into bed (or in this case, the garden) at the first meeting.

The writing style is lovely, lyrical, and I felt as if I were placed back in time. Charlotte is a wonderful heroine and Alex is a delicious hero.

The biggest weaknesses: Jimmy Rankin's lyrics, which while better than past efforts will never be candidates for a poetry anthology, and vocals that occasionally cross the line to \\"precious.\\" The best cuts, to my ear are \\"Eyes of Margaret\\" and \\"Blue Eyed Suzie\\" (both by John Morris) and Jimmy's \\"You'd Feel the Same Way Too.\\" What do we need to do to get this group some U.S. airplay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disbelief!","review":"I've not heretofor read any of Mr. Lehane's books, and this one was recommended by our librarian to read while awaiting for \\"Mystic River\\" to become available.

It had twists galore. I thought I knew what direction the story was going in and whammo I was wrong again. The ending was such a huge surprise. The prose were excellent. There was some humor amid a really serious subject, the criminally insane imprisoned on Shutter Island.. A REALLY good read. Finished it in two days."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful","review":"Why does anybody like this dreadful novel? I thought Mystic River was completely engaging, marvelously written, a crime novel that stepped well beyond the formulaic boundaries of its genre. Shutter Island reads like an acrostic. The writing is hurried and flat, the dialogue is stagey and improbable, the ending is silly and overwrought. I hope Lehane returns quickly to the territory he staked out so skilfully in Mystic River."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More From Lehane","review":"Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando. Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that). There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play. There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial. The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.It is not all grim however. The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally. I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was drawn to this book by the raves for Mystic River. Now I'm wondering whether I should bother reading that one. Shutter Island reminds me why I don't read thrillers, even by so-called \\"literary\\" authors like Lehane. This book is filled with cardboard characters, spouting cliched dialogue in implausible situations. I grew tired of Lehane stringing bits of action together with sentences in which one \\"and\\" followed the next to give the reader the impression that something really was happening. The twist at the end left me saying little more than, \\"Huh?\\" Unfortunately, I don't care enough about the characters to go back through the book and figure out how it all came together. If you're looking for something to occupy you on a long plane ride, this book will fit the bill, but if you're a serious reader aware of some of the fine contemporary literature that's available today, I'll bet you'll be angry at yourself for getting suckered into wasting a few hours on this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in new price setting","review":"I was all set to buy it. It was under $5 just a couple of days ago. This new model of publishers setting the price will now force me back to the library. $9.99 for a book that I can't resell or loan is stupid. An ebook should be way cheaper than a paperback. Good job in losing a sale. I'm I'm not the only one. I thank Apple for this price increase. Sorry amazon. Apple just cost you a sale, but I'm not going to buy it anywhere now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Really bad writing.

I'm reviewing Robert Hazelwood's review of Dennis Lehane's book. His is the best and funniest I've read by any of your customers - or by any of your editors for that matter. This is exactly how I felt about this book but Robert said it so much more cleverly than I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched and Uninspired","review":"While I can't be certain, I am fairly sure that Lehane is trying to write with the depth and imagination of Thomas Cook--both in Shutter Island and in his previous novel, Mystic River. Lehane can write coherently, but he really doesn't have anything to say. Mystic River was boring and Shutter Island \\"appears\\" to be somewhat exciting, but if you read carefully it is really quite dull. Just writing about a weird island where outrageously insane people are treated doesn't make a persuasive novel. I found the ending highly predictable. Lehane could have written this novel in one sentence: \\"There are crazy people in this world who are not amenable to medical treatment.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Did he write this as a patient on Shutter Island?","review":"This is really bad. I agree with all other onestar reviews.

I had never read one of his books before and he has won an \\"instant fan.\\" I was not able to put this book down except to sleep (which was a bit of a task in itself!. The other reviewers have done a nice job at describing a true psychological thriller that left me with my jaw open at the end of the book. The lead character is brilliantly painted and not with broad strokes. Plotting is excellent the story is utterly believable especially when thinking about it from the last page...back to the beginning.Pick up Shutter Island. Absolutely fantastic read.Kevin Hogan, Author of The 168 Hour Week: Living Life Your Way 24-7"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me up all Night!","review":"When I saw the preview for the movie coming out next year, I was intersted in reading the book. I picked it up at the library and started reading it that night. The next morning I was still thinking about what a creepy and horrifying story it was. The images that Lehane is able to produce using his words are so tangible, the images that nightmares are made of. I enjoyed this book very much, I did not give it 5 stars, though. I felt that the ending was a bit predictable, and seemed almost anti-climactic. I noticed a lot of people mentioning the dialogue being a bit stale and kind of cheesy, but if you understand the ending, you should be able to grasp that there is a reason why the dialogue sometimes plays like a bad cop movie. If you take the time to really read this book, and understand how everything fits together, I would think that you would enjoy it very much, as I did. I'm very curious to see how the book will be interpreted into the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"I plan to read more by Dennis Lehane. I didn't want to stop reading.

A great overall read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engrossing But Predictable Thriller","review":"US Marshal Teddy Daniels is sent to Shutter Island, home to the Ashecliff Hospital for the Criminally Insane, to investigate the possible escape of Rachel Solando, a patient who was committed for drowning her three children. None of the hospital staff seem very eager to help, and each clue brings more questions than answers to this baffling case. Who can Teddy trust? Is Ashecliff Hospital what it seems? Teddy is a sympathetic and complex tragic hero, one whom readers will root for until the very last page. While Shutter Island proves to be an engrossing psychological thriller, it unfortunately does not add anything new to the genre. The story's \\"twist\\" is one that has become so formulaic, some readers may figure out the truth long before the big reveal at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shutter Island","review":"I thought it was a great book. It started a little slow and I wasn't sure what was happening at some points in the book and had to go back and reread a little bit of it. But overall I loved it. It had a great plot about a marshal going to the island with a partner he just met in order to find a missing woman. As the story progresses you also start to find out about the marshals wife. The story jumps back and forth between the two different times, the island and time with his wife. The story has a twist end which can be figured out by about three quarters of the way through but still a really good story line and well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Dennis Lehane has had some critically acclaimed books that have been made into movies including this one starring Leonardo Di Caprio, Gone Baby Gone starring Ben Affleck & Morgan Freeman and Mystic River starring Sean Penn & Tim Robbins who both won Academy Awards for their roles in that movie. This is what seduced me into reading this book.I thought this book was a little predictable, but it was so well written that this didn't particularly bother me. Sometimes the journey is just as enjoyable as the destination.Even though it doesn't take an Einstein to guess the \\"twist\\" at the end, there are minor twists & explanations which still got me by surprise particularly in relation to the codes that make this book a cut above and ultimately a satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating discussion","review":"My book club selected this book for reading and discussion several months before the movie was released in theaters. It was not only the most popular book among the readers, but it also turned into one of the best discussions we have had. There was no point during the story in which the plot line lagged, and the end of the book lead to an interesting discussion on the readers' perceptions of what happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops King's The Shining","review":"Some books you read and you just can't quit forget them. I've been reading this genre of books for 30 plus years and I have to say that this is one of my favorite books EVER!!!! When I was younger, Stephen King would keep me up reading until the darkest hours of the morning. THIS is the first book in a long, long time that has had me so tense and excited that I couldn't put it down. In fact, I'm going to read it again, and probably again.I am now a Dennis Lehane fan!!! This is my first time with one of his creations. (saw the movie versions of Mystic River and Gone Baby, Gone) I wanted to read this book first before seeing the movie.

Agatha Christie made them better - and shorter - 50 years ago....I'd better focus on the classics next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointed Lehane fan","review":"Having loved Lehane's previous books, I was really looking forward to this one. What a disappointment! Whereas his Kenzie/Gennaro series pushed the boundaries of its genre, and Mystic River transcended it altogether, Shutter Island reads like a first draft. The situation is contrived, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is replete with cliches, and the writing is just plain clunky. I wanted to abandon the book long before the \\"surprise\\" ending, but having taken it on a plane with me I was stuck with it all the way to the bitter end. Don't make my mistake!

I have donated the audiobook to my local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nothing read, despite excellent writing","review":"This book is worth the read simply because of Lehanes writing - always competent and at times spectacular in his characterizations and economy of style. As for the substance of the book, it goes limp at the end, the author opting for the same ending done to death by earlier writers such as Fredric Brown, Kurt Vonnegut, and Ray Bradbury.This would have made a brilliant short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shutter Island by Dennis Lehane","review":"What a disappointment this book turned out to be. By trying to be too clever by half with a new slant, Lehane has missed the boat badly with this dull offering. Plastic characters, an unexciting hero and a really depressing arena,this book in no way captures any of the magic of Angie and Patrick. Stay with them, Dennis - this one was a bumme. You have lost me until they return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As I read this book, I kept checking to see if I had the wrong author. I do think it would be a great movie but one I figured out half way through. Maybe he is just tired but had to fulfill a book deal because this book does not stand up to the standards established in previous books. I really missed his complex characterizations. This book was like a good wax museum; pleasant to look at but not real. Maybe Lehane wants to make a lot of money on a movie deal. Can't say that I blame him. Think Russell Crowe for the lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgive me","review":"I had high hopes but I found this book contrived and it fell flat as a pancake at the end.

Instead he delivers an equally complex, troubling book, but one that is about as different from \\"Mystic River\\" as could be.\\"Shutter Island,\\" had me by the throat from the first chapter and never let go until the final haunting page. Part detective thriller, part horror story, the book moves at a breakneck pace, while serving up crackling dialogue and hairpin twists. \\"Mystic River\\" clearly wasn't a fluke, and if his hot streak continues, Lehane may yet emerge as one of the best crime writers of the new millennium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walked away dissatisfied","review":"Couldn't put it down, but when I got to the end, I wished I had not spent all that time reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Maybe it's me because I was expecting something better and read the book with the constant feeling of disappointment and waiting for it to GET better or get SOMETHING. Dennis Lehane is a popular writer, a friend of a friend, and I was really looking forward to reading his book. I'm not really good at reading books that delve into other people's minds. I don't pick up well on subtleties. I felt as though a lot had happened to these characters before Lehane even started to tell us about them and we were somehow supposed to have ESP. There isn't much action except walking around a lot and talking even more. I found the book dull and boring and even flipping to the end to find out what happened made no sense. I wondered why the book wasn't on the bestseller list, and when I sent it to our library for their booksale, I knew why."},{"rating":"1","title":"More heavy handedness from Lehane.","review":"More heavy handedness from Lehane. It is both predictable and unoriginal. Rings untrue. A violent mental patient left to wander unobstructed, injuring guards, injuring patients as part of his treatment. Come on? Follows the pattern of every schizo book or movie ever in print. Remember Fight Club. Setting it on an Island in the 50s does not make it fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great setting poor plot","review":"Picked up the book in an airport bookshop. The setting is certainly great for this type of paranoia-driven novel. A lunatic asylum set on an island rendered inaccessible by a storm. Yet the setting resembles somewhat an Agatha Christie story which I once read, the inaccessible island, the seemingly lunatic murderer...., the paranoia does not develope but is predictable (the evil psychiatrist, is he a lunatic or a doctore) etc. etc. The characters are dimensionless and who has not guessed the end by the middle of the book - has truly deserved the poor writing and poor plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, disappointing and banal","review":"The \\"surprise\\" ending doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out. You keep hoping that the author won't really go there, but he does. Don't make an investment in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN I HAVE MY MONEY BACK!","review":"Can't help it, I feel cheated. I'd never read Lehane, but a friend of mine saw the movie and said it was so great. I had my KindleKindle Wireless Reading Device (6\\" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)at the table and she wanted to see the fast download, so--I asked for Shutter Island. There it was, a sample in just seconds. I thought, what the heck, I may as well read it. The start was strong. I downloaded the book. Big mistake. The farther along I got, the more cheated I felt. Hey, the convenient hurricane? Page by page things got worse until finally the insult of the last chapter. A real author cop out, but maybe it was a good thing. I won't waste my time on Lehane again, and I sure wouldn't go to the movie version."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crazy story!!!","review":"I really disliked this book, and it was a plot that has been told over a dozen times. What a waste of money and time!!Basically this is about Andrew, an ex military, ex US Marshall who lost his wife, and is having difficulty coping with reality, so the institution that he is placed at puts on this elaborate scheme to restore his mind.Lots of boring twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I've been a big fan of Lehane's since the very beginning, but I have to say that this book was extremely dissapointing. I've endorsed his work to many friends and family over the years and, unfortunately, could not for this subpar effort. I've haven't NOT finished a novel since I can remember, but almost did with this one. Another small peeve of mine: he's got to get off of the overused superfluous metaphor kick. He's too good of a talent for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lehane's weakest novel","review":"This is easily Lehanes' weakest novel, and I've read them all. I'm not one who needs Angie and Patrick to return, so that's not my beef. I missed the maturity, character development, humor, hard hitting, well developed issues, plotting and incredible dialogue of Mystic River.This book develops Teddy's character thoroughly, but no one else. The rest of the cast is cardboard.The plot is implausible time and time again, the writing mundane and too concise. Particularly in the first half.The social or interpersonal issues raised are not of the scope of Mystic or covered with any degree of similar depth.I saw Lehane speak at a bookstore in California, and he was attentive, articulate, funny and very impressive. I hope the money hasn't affected his writing motivation, because it appears he churned this one out without much thought or depth.Bring back the best mystery writer of this century, Dennis. Take your time and do it right, as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, nope, nope!","review":"As someone who has read and loved every other single piece of Dennis Lehane's work - almost fanatically - this book is a huge disappointment and hopefully not a harbinger of things to come. The plot is transparent, cliched, and the characters can neither be liked nor hated, nor anything in between - there is no complexity to this novel at all - I saw the end coming a mile away and could barely rouse the energy to finish it. At the end, I didn't care what was real or what wasn't, nor did I spend any time imgaining what could have happened next - I was just glad it was over and even considered putting back onto Amazon marketplace for sale which is nearly unheard of for me. I hope Lehane isn't letting his publishers pressure him to produce too much too fast - he has built an amazing reputation; a few stumbles along the way like Shutter Island are OK - I just hope they don't become the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of book","review":"The story kept me for a while, then my mind would wander and I would lose track of the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring beginning to any book I've ever read","review":"The beginning of this book is profoundly boring. It's simply the worst opening chapter I've ever read, bar none. The setting is drab, and even the characters are bleak. The entire chapter is about a dead father who was disappointed in our main character, a dead wife and vomiting from seasickness. Total score! I've read 4 chapters and already figured out most of the plot. A creepy doctor is running a prison for the criminally insane on a remote island. Gee, what could they possibly be doing there? Playing scrabble? Also, both marshals have serious mental issues before they arrive, so what possibly could go wrong? If you've ever seen a Boris Karloff movie, you can figure it out as well. Nothing fresh or exciting here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sixth Sense II: Shutter Island","review":"Great Writing, lazy ending. Lehane is a better writer than this. If this is your first Lehane read, please give him another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"why the 4-star average?","review":"After reading this wonderful novel, I have to wonder how anyone could give it less than a five-star rating. Lehane does characters better than any writer I've come across in years, knows how to build suspense that has you holding the book in a white-knuckle grip, keeps tricks up his sleeve that you never see coming and by God, he knows how to lay down the prose. There are many writers out there whose books I love to read, but when it comes to Lehane, I'm always waiting for the next one. Read \\"Shutter Island\\" and I'll bet you'll feel the same way.Heck, read any Lehane and see if you aren't eager for more. Go ahead. I dare you."},{"rating":"1","title":"time & setting details somewhat off.","review":"This is the second Lehane I read, it was ok and a fast read but it seemed again that little details are wrong. For instance I don't believe people generally bought coffee at newstands in 1950's. The idea of people walking around drinking coffee is kind of new. I went to college in boston & worked in town in the late 60's and that wasn't typical then even (I'm addicted to coffee so I'd remember). Also he made it seem like those harbor islands are remote and inaccessible. There are little islands all over the place and not too far away from each other. I also wasn't surprised. I will read Mystic River before I see the movie however."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author Writes For Himself","review":"Lehane is a very very good writer. He uses his talent to construct a novel like July 4th fireworks that are beautiful and exciting. At the conclusion, however, the reader is left with ashes and an empty sky. I don't always need a happy ending but I also do not like hopeless ones or endings that are depressing. One is left with the impression that the author was very clever, leads one down a garden path, and then ultimately leaves one gutted.

However, the \\"suprise ending\\" was actually the logical one to me - I saw it coming about 30 pages into the book. I spent the entire book hoping that the ending would actually be a suprise, and, nope, it wasn't.This book is well-written, but the language can not even COMPARE to mystic river. That book is in a different league than this one - I honestly feel like \\"Shutter Island\\" could have been written by a lot of artists in the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help !!

I must say it is an amazing read. I found myself staying up late into the night fully enthralled in the book. The plot gives nothing away to what truly is a shocking ending. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read a book that will have you on the edge of your seat until you finish the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shutter Island","review":"This book is kind of a mystery/horror story. I read it a while ago but can't really remember the details. This is basically about a guy (who is a FBI agent) who visits a nuthouse (on a maximum security island because these guys are dangerously nutty) to find the whereabouts an escaped patient. While on the island he finds out about some very shocking practices of the staff at the island which draws him deeper into the case. The book takes a few turns with a very shocking ending. If you like happy endings this book is not for you. This book (to me) kind of parallels the plot of the movie the Wickerman although this book takes the plot to a deeper level. What's cool about this book though is how the ending can be interpreted in different ways depending how you analyzed the story.To me Lehane is the master of misdirection. His endings always screws up your initial predictions based off the way he feeds information to you as the book progresses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me \\"Shudder\\"","review":"After having thoroughly enjoyed Lehane's previous PI series and Mystic River I regret having stayed up so late last night to finish Shutter Island. I feel cheated by the grade school type ending and am glad that I borrowed the book from the library rather than waste my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lehane stubs his toes here","review":"I have read all of Lehane's books. This one is a stinker. It gives an appearance of being convoluted and twists simply for the thrill of it - and not done well. Most of it is beyond being plausible and you get the impression the writer is just filling in the space.A bit outlandish and not very good. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something a little different from his P.I. series","review":"It kept me interested, was a little slow at times, but overall a good book.

The print is so bad its a struggle to even try to read it. I'm sure the story line is good but when the print is so light or even missing in spots its hard to tell.

I passed it on to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible On Every Level","review":"This book was so bad I could not finish it. The characters are boring, the story is boring, the plot is boring. There is absolutely no incentive to care about the story and keep reading it. About two thirds through I stopped wasting my time and wished I had my money back. The dialogue is lifeless, The story line is numb. I am amazed at the good reviews listed on Amazon because I found this book to be unsuspensful, uninteresting and unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The story was a little confusing, I constantly had to reread the prologue to try to figure out what exactly was happening and who the characters were. The story was suspenseful and interesting but the ending was a complete cop out. I would never buy another book by this author. Its just like any other psychological thriller, confusing and unsolvable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle of the road","review":"This book was film noir detective story for the first half. Two US Marshals are sent to a remote island mental hospital/prison for the insane to investigate a missing patient who seems to have vanished from a locked cell/room.The story makes much of the evils of American society in the 1950s, the mandatory little digs at racism and the like that any modern author must include aren't as jarring because of the dark detective doing a tough job at a remote hospital setting the author successfully paints for the first 1/3 of the book.The story slowly changes into a gothic horror and gets worse and worse in writing. By the end of the book, the 'shock ending' is pretty plain and expected. I felt let down that I kept reading when things got dark in the book. The ending was also just too neat and---I want to say smug but that may not be exactly it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great and riveting read....","review":"Lehane has crafted a novel that is very dificult to put down. The setting alone, an insane asylum on an isolated island run by an ex-OSS doctor and an ex-Nazi, grabs you by the throat. The way Lehane let's his story unfold doesn't let you go until you finish the last chapter. The story of Teddy Daniels will stay with you long after you put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing read, even after seeing the movie...(NO spoilers)","review":"It was actually quite enjoyable reading the book after the seeing the movie because I caught a lot of things along the way I perhaps wouldn't have otherwise. I thought it was going to be a waste of time since I knew how it ends, but I was wrong. Generally, there's nothing worse for me than reading a mystery when you know the ending. However, even after being familiar with the story, it was still a page turner because it is so well written. If you're ambivalent about reading this because you saw the movie, don't be. Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"i really like this book, although i never finished it, but my husband liked hearing me read it aloud, and the writing style is very intense, you can really picture it all in your head. i like it alot and hope i get to finish it someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ. Audbiobook","review":"You can read the plot on other reviews.The book, as always, is much better than the movie.Catches you from the beginning and keeps you intrigued the whole way through.And that is saying a lot as so many other books really drag at times.Read this before you consider other books that aren't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Lehane novel, couldn't put it down","review":"Great story, fairly quick read, enjoyed the plot twists. I liked that it kept me guessing but doesn't string you along to the point where it becomes obnoxious (e.g. \\"Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\", where you feel like it should be done but there are still 200 pages left). Still a couple of questions unanswered and a couple of seemingly pointless scenes (or maybe they provide a context I missed), hence my 4 instead of 5. I appreciated the ending because I felt like it was the only one that would be appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric and menacing","review":"This book had a great start. Very atmospheric and really draws you into the menacing atmosphere of this mental institution in the 1950s. But it loses its way and meanders a bit in the middle and so these parts were hard to keep up with.Finally, though the mystery kicks in again and grabbed me and the closing 100 pages were back to the dazzling Lehane form I know and love so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shutter island","review":"Really enjoyed the movie but hadn't realize it was a book. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and didn't feel like watching the movie first spoiled it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It should have been called \\"Shudder Island.\\"","review":"This was my first Lehane book, I finished it in a matter of hours and I was glued to my chair. I thought it was interesting to read the book that the movie was based off of. I feel I will be purchasing more of his books in the very near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mystery thriller with lots of surprises","review":"This great novel by Dennis Lehane starts out as a locked room mystery, but quickly shifts to something more. There are lots of twists throughout the story. If I hadn't seen the movie trailer before reading the book, I probably wouldn't have expected the ending (I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer gives pretty much everything away). I highly recommend the book. I also recommend you skip the movie/movie trailer before you read it, so as not to spoil the surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending.","review":"As others have said, the ending is a mystery story cliche, and not done half as well as other such stories. The most disappointing part of that, however, was the fact that up to the ending, the writing was quite good and the story was engaging, but I can't forgive the author for that ending. I won't read any other Dennis Lehane books as a result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I'm a big Dennis LeHane fan. I started with \\"Mystic River\\", read all the Patrick Kenzie books and they are all great reads. \\"Shutter Island\\" however is somewhat of a departure. It's still about Cops & criminals but it's set in the 1940's and has a twist I never saw coming. Martin Sorcesse is curently making a movie out of it. I can't wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone Twist","review":"You know at the beginning it's going to have that kind of twist. But I kept reading thinking no maybe I'll be really surprised. I would have been impressed if Sixth Sense, A Beautiful Mind, Secret Window, and countless of other books and movies didn't have the same twist. The twist is overdone and I was disappointed. Boo the review all you want but it's true. It is an overdone story and way to predictable. I want to read something with a new never done twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice plot, but cliches abound","review":"This book has a great plot, which was later copied ad infinitum by numerous conspiracy theory stories. However, probably because of the times this book was written in, cliches abound. Specially, the repetition of the protagonist's devotion to his wife could have been injected in a much more realistic fashion. There are substantial passages in the book which border on ennui, which is sad given the fast paced intent of the author. In short, I am no fan of Lehane's writing - a similar theme would have been much better handled by Jonathan Kellerman, for example, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"So glad I read this. I read that some people figured out the ending halfway through, but I was totally surprised. So glad I read this and can't imagine the movie even comes close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average novel","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author. I have seen the movie Mystic River and really enjoyed it so I thought I'd give this novel a shot. I enjoy good classic western literature (Steinbeck) as well as entertaining/page turning novels (Dan Brown). This book is neither of those, by a long shot. In summary, the book promises a complex plot including government conspiracy and sinister medical experimentation, but this is merely a thin facade disguising a cheap plot twist mechanism that we have all seen a million times, which in the end leaves you feeling completely cheated. Someone else has said that the book reads like something Lehane wrote entirely over a long weekend. I couldn't agree more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with cliche ending","review":"I had heard great things about this book. I love noir and detective fiction so it sounded like it was right up my alley.While reading the book I was engrossed and enjoying myself. As a mental health professional, I found his \\"mental patient\\" dialogue unrealistic but generally short.Fast pacing and unusual characters kept me turning pages.When I got to the ending though I was just like \\"What?\\"I feel he took the biggest cop out possible of a writer with the ending. No respect for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?????!!!!!","review":"This book started out great and grew more and more confusing toward the end. When I finished it, I sadly had to admit I didn't know the truth about the events that had or had not taken place. The book left me confused and disappointed. I doubt at this point I will see the movie. If you want an enjoyable read with an ending that gives you closure, forget this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing read","review":"This was my first Lehane novel.

No more Dennis Lehane for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Absurd To Be Worthwhile!","review":"You may not want to print this as it's a put-down of Duhane. He should have his head examined for such a disgraceful novel, especial after writing MYSTIC RIVER, a superb piece of fiction. He says he writes to please himself. If so, he should either get his brain unaddled or quit fiction writing and only teach how NOT to write a very bad novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plod, not a scary thrill ride","review":"I was disappointed by this book. A rave Wash. Post review hooked me: this would be a book about a fateful voyage to an insane-asylum island, where grim events would occur and long-buried secrets unearthed. Wow!And that's partially the plot on paper. But the actual book was a plod, became for me like a Zork text adventure: go to rooms, see people, solve a puzzle, go to the sea cliff, come back from the sea cliff... Where's the horror? And when the grand design of the plot was revealed, my reaction wasn't Wow! It was Huh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal and weak","review":"This was the first book I have read from Lehane and I was sorely disappointed. The story itself was borrowed from William Peter Blatty's book \\"The Ninth Configuration\\" (also a movie). The similarities of the story line are so striking that it makes Shutter Island a poor replication of Blatty's ideas. Completely unoriginal and, for those who have read Blatty's book, predictable about a third of the way through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing -","review":"wherefore all the rave reviews for this book, which is neither literary nor a thriller? After 90 pages or so, I grew increasingly impatient with Lehane's failure to engage me with either his characters, his setting, or his story, and found his fabrication and solution of Rachel Solando's 'code' totally laughable. So I skipped to the end to see what all the buzz was about, and am thankful I wasted no additional time reading the intervening 200 pages. This might be material for a passable direct-to-video movie, but as a follow-up to Mystic River, it's a step backward. I usually maintain that a book worth reading is a book worth owning, but when the chintzy-quality paperback edition came out, I decided to borrow the hardcover from my library and am glad I didn't waste my money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Man is an Island???","review":"That this book comes from the same pen as the charming and throughly enjoyable series starring Pat and the Gang is amazing...I found Shutter Island to be pretentious, boring, confusing; there were few, if any redeeming qualities.

She was barefoot, the windows were barred, they were on an island -- I get it! I use to NEVER give up on a book without trudging through - but these days, I'm starting to do just that more and more.

I read this book two years ago and as result of this, I read several other novels by the author. First, I never saw the surprise ending coming.

Two law enforcement officiers arrive on Shutter island (which houses a psychiatric hospital in order to investigate a missing patient. A storm prevents them from returning to the mainland. That's as far as I'll go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Shutter Island, Dennis Lehane's latest and greatest, tells the intriguing tale involving a terrible storm on an island that houses expirmental psychiatric patients. It is the storm that sets off a number of twists, turns, and unexpected pleasures.This book is very different from Mystic River, which is a good thing. Mystic River is just about as perfect as can be written, so Lehane had to go in another direction.I couldn't set this book down and it was an awesome read. I highly recommend Shutter Island."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fear on this Island","review":"This was my first time reading Dennis Lehane, although I'd seen movie versions of his books that I really liked a lot. What drew me in to reading the book was its setting (and the fact that Martin Scorsese is directing the movie of the book!). Investigating a supernatural disappearance at an isolated mental institution in the 1950's is an easy set-up for good storytelling. And it is for the most part. Lehane's writing kept me going, and I was able to breeze through the novel in a few days. But the \\"twist\\" ending didn't even try. It's probably exactly what you think it is, and it's such a letdown. I just wish the ending had tried harder 'cuz I was on board for most of this page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rambling","review":"a stark departure from his bread-and-butter, this Lehane novel is not half as intriguing as his kenzie/gennaro outings. the action is explosive, but rare, and the humor is nonexistent. it dwells way too much on describing the surroundings, but the twist at the end is very well done and incisively portrayed. worth reading once."},{"rating":"1","title":"I saw the ending coming a mile away","review":"I'm shocked. \\"Mystic River\\" was such a good book that I was looking forward to my next Dennis Lehane novel.But \\"Shutter Island\\" telegraphs its punches to the nth degree, and I figured out what the conclusion had to be when I was a third of the way through the book.I'm not totally turned off of Lehane's novels, but I sure hope that \\"Shutter Island\\" is the only deviation in his repertoire."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most predictable unpredictable ending ever","review":"Took a while to get going, but the middle was wonderfully written, suspenseful and mysterious in that wonderful dream-like way. Then the whole experience unravels into disbelief. The author, Dennis Lehane, broke character and scene far too often to provide clues and red herrings--so proud of his big reveal--which was anything but. After so much potential, I hate to say it left me bored, eager to get to the last page just so I could put it away. There are many amazing psychological thrillers out there--but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to remember!","review":"Some books leave you with memories that will last forever, and this one certainly does just that!

Most readers would be surprised at the ending if they haven't seen the screen adaptation. It was still a great read and a page turner even with the knowledge I had. I only wish I had read it first!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark Thriller","review":"This is a dark book. Besides being a mystery, it is a psychological and spiritual thriller. Why spiritual? Because for the second straight book, Lehane portrays a world that is scarred by Evil. Yes, we're dealing with diminished capacity in some cases, but what do think those references to Auschwitz are about? Why is the warden in the story? Can one be insane and evil? Lehane does an excellent job creating a sense of foreboding that keeps you glued to the pages. He draws on King Lear (going mad during a storm), film (the Wicker Man), and recent tragedies (Andrea Yates' killing of her children) to tell the story of Shutter Island. I read this book in two nights because I had to find out what fate awaits our protagonist, Teddy Daniels. Shutter Island is a horror story that goes to the depths of our being."},{"rating":"1","title":"not his best work","review":"I am a huge fan of Lehane's novels, having spent the past few months reading his entire body of work. But while his other novels push the edge of crime fiction to the boarders of literature, Stutter Island fell flat half way through the book.Perhaps having read his other novels, I am learning how he thinks, so the \\"surprise\\" ending was as obvious as an elephant walking down the street in a tux, drinking lemonade. Parts of the novel are hard to follow, but the worst sin of all is the lack of a single character I could honestly care about. If this is your first Lehane novel, do not give up hope, his other books are great and you will be well rewarded to read them all.Every author stumbles from time to time, and Lehane will return to form and deliver more great works in the future, he has all the talent needed to do so. But Stutter Island is one trip you might want to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite dissapointed","review":"I had never read a Dennis Lehane book until this one. I saw Mystic River, and thinking the book was probably much better than the film, I went to the bookstore to look it up. I saw this new novel there and decided to give it a try. I found the book to be a very pedestrian \\"page turner.\\" I didn't believe the dialogue or the situations. It seemed to be predictably confusing, and all the way to the end I was hoping I wouldn't get the anticipated \\"Shocking twist ending.\\" It's a gimmick that's overused. And in fact, something similar was written by William Peter Blatty; \\"Twinkle Twinkle Killer Kane.\\" Which he made into the film \\"The 9th Configuration.\\"It felt like the author took the easy way out to conclude the book, instead of figuring out a way to make all the convoluted goings on pay off in a less predictable way.I won't judge the rest of Lehane's work based on this one, but I wish I had read something else of his first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"Coming after Mystic River, this is a big disappointment.

Others have done w better look into the paranoid psychotic character. A touch more research would have suited the effort - there are masters out there that the suthor could have learned from.The setting could have saved this book, setting as personality, but the author did not go down that route - there are islands in Boston harbor that have interesting histories, but one gets the feeling the author never visited a single one.Maybe the publisher was demanding a book, and time had run short, so something had to be churned out."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a dark and stormy night...","review":"U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule are assigned to find an escaped prisoner on a remote island facility for the criminally insane.

The patients of Ashercliff hospital are criminally insane, locked down for their own safety and for the staff. As they investigate the details of Rachael's escape, Dennis and Chuck find disturbing signs of sinister practices going on behind fenced and guarded facilities on the island.There is never a dull moment, and no escape, once they learn the secrets of Ashercliff. The surprises never quit, all the way to the final pages. I began, thinking we had a literary novel, but ended up reclassifying Shutter Island as a first-rate thriller. If you haven't already seen the movie, read the book first. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I was fascinated by this book from the moment I picked it up. It was unlike anything I had read recently and kept me rivoted until the end. Ah, the end....totally unexpected, and I am usually really good at getting the subtleties and twists that make up the plots of mysteries. This one left me stunned."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrilling and terrifying","review":"A chilling and creepy read. Such a rich wealth of dialog and twists and turns. The characters and scenery seem to come alive off the pages. Truly a thrill to read. Hard to put the book down. Loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best by a long shot","review":"It's hard to figure out why Lehane has strayed from his Kenzie-Gennaro series -- some really fine reads there and engaging characters. Mystic River was a departure and much more of a main stream kind of novel with a lot of depth of character. Shutter Island just does not engage. I didn't care about Teddy Daniels, the main character, enough to care what happened to him. The novel has so many twists and turns, there's no focus. By the time I got to the end, it was more a relief than a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but just okay","review":"I'm a little baffled by all of the adoring reviews this book has received. Yes, \\"Shutter Island\\" has a twist ending, but you can see it coming from a mile away (particularly if you grew up watching endless reruns of \\"Twilight Zone,\\" \\"Thriller,\\" and \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents,\\" as I did). To make matters worse, it isn't a particularly well thought-out twist; there are loose ends left dangling everywhere.I was also thrown off by Lehane's numerous anachronisms. The book is supposed to be set in 1954, but there are references to items made of plastic, contemporary phrases like \\"anger management issues,\\" a discussion of the hospital's \\"electronic security system,\\" etc. Silly me -- I thought these were CLUES that the story wasn't really taking place in 1954 at all! Turns out Lehane is just lazy.\\"Shutter Island\\" is an enjoyable pool or airport read, but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shutter Island","review":"Excellent book! It is definitely better than the movie adaptation! Full of twists, turns, and brings a new level of understanding to Teddy Daniels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a little Gothic Noir...","review":"SHUTTER ISLAND has all the traits of an old school Gothic novel; stormy weather, mysterious characters, the action located on an enormous estate (In this case an island asylum for the criminally insane), and a doomed love affair. Lehane pulls out all stops as his as the surreal atmosphere starts to skew the reader's perception of reality and generally succeeds in creating a feeling of uneasiness in the reader as the nature of the island's mysteries start to become clear. I thought the central mystery was not particularly difficult to figure out but I thought the way Lehane goes about revealing the truth of the island's mysteries deserves some praise as even when I had a basic idea of where the story was going I felt he pulled it off with style. The emotional component and the utter tragedy involved make it an effective blend of 50's style noir and Gothic romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I loved Dennis Lehane's other work.That said, this book left me feeling like I'd wasted my time. Stories that trick the reader all the way through don't do anything for me. Just my opinion. If you really want to read something powerful, try his \\"Gone, Baby, Gone\\". It's ending is honest and deeply affecting. By the end of Shutter Island, I was just irritated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great dark mystery","review":"Teddy and Chuck, two US Marshalls are assigned on a case involving a missing mental patient/inmate from a mental institution on Shutter Island. On their way to the island, Teddy gets seasick, and the reader is already sensing that something is wrong with Teddy. And true enough. While searching for the missing patient, we learn that Teddy has some almost disabling migraines and that he is trying to deal with the horrors of World Was 2, where he was involved as a code-breaker. Teddy and Chuck suspects that there is more going on at Shutter Island than what just meets the eye, and this novel is masterly written. The ending is very surprising, and the author has managed to give the whole story and overall dark feeling, which just makes the story more intense. There are many things and happenings to think about in this book, and my guess is, that this is one of those books that will be better second time you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"\\"Shutter Island\\" was most of the time enjoyable. This book was often confusing at times. I had to read parts over again to try to understand it. By time I reached the end of the book, my main goal was to finish, not to find out what happens. But I must say, the book did have a very spooky and thrilling ending. And there were parts in this book that were exhilirating and very entertaining. If you are a person that loves mysteries. This is the perfect book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lehane Presents a Stunning Psychological Thriller","review":"Shutter Island grips you from the start, and keeps you reading long after bedtime! As you turn the pages, you begin to wonder what the heck is going on on this island, and the more you read, the better it gets. However, be prepared for an ending that will rock your world! I have not read a book of this quality in a while, Lehane has really created a Psychological Thriller that keeps you guessing until the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment after MYSTIC RIVER","review":"I listened to this novel set in Massachusetts read by Tom Stechshulte and he was absolutely the wrong person to read this book. He turned every African-American character into some trash-talking ignoramus from the South.The novel itself has suspense and if I had read it instead of listening, might feel more positive toward it. The ending was so farfetched that I just had to laugh.I need another story like MYSTIC RIVER to make me believe in Dennis LeHane again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"I don't want to give the ending away but it feels like I've heard this story about a hundred times. Nothing new in the mental patient/asylum game. Didn't care for the way it was written. Too much dialog, hard to keep the characters straight...eventually didn't care. Last few chapters were the most well written. I wonder if they came first? Did Lehane start at the end of the story and fill it in in reverse?I didn't find it suspenseful at all.Maybe the movie might be better w/ Scorcese directing. Leo DiCaprio never seems to make a bad movie so maybe I'll give it a chance... but only when it comes to DVD. Or cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"psycological horror","review":"What a great book! There were times when I had to put the book down because the suspense was too much. Intelligently written and unpredictable plot; what more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Shutter Island","review":"I had not seen this movie prior to reading the book and I highly suggest you do the same. It will give you such a greater insight and understanding of the characters and their background. This book is a real pager turner. Normally I just read when I'm bored or when I'm lying in bed trying to get sleepy. With this book I found myself addicted, reading it every opportunity I got at work or whereever.The characters are so real and you felt like you were right there witnessing the whole thing. Typically I can figure how a book is going to end, but with this book I was completely fooled. Lehane did an awesome job telling a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating , a must read","review":"I opted to read the book rather than go see the movie. This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is believable. I was hooked from early in book. Read Kindle edition so cannot say by what page, but certainly within the first 20 pages. My wife and I have a hundred page rule, if by then we are not into the book I will not waste my time. It is dark and always left me disturbed. That is good the author kept me literally on the island. I think this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ending drove me crazy","review":"I was pleased to read a really good book and not be disappointed by Dennis. However, I'm following all the clues and thinking I know what's going on and voilla!!!! What happened and who do I know that read it and can confirm it??? I guess I shouldn't have believed everything I read according to the last page.Good read - enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact. Compact. and Compact","review":"I believe this lens has discontinued for now. I just purchased this lens despite of many negative reviews from photozone or dpreview. The reason is this lens is super compact. I need a everyday lens for my A55. Even 28mm on APC-S body is 42mm lens. That is my favorite focal length always. This is not good for wide very good for standard lens(especially on crop bodies)hidden hood is another interesting idea since minolta. Actually, I am not a big fan of new sony lens looking even 35F18, 30M20, 50F18, 85F28 etc... 50mm 1.4 and 28mm 2.8 has something more traditional looking & feeling. I love that part too.Anyway, picture quality is not good as Carl Zeiss lenses but it is worth. Compact and A priority works are all good for me. sometimes it makes better picture than 50mm1.4.

The cover art may be a little misleading. Its not really Native American. Native American influenced, maybe, but its completely original and uniquely Fitzgerald, and at the same time its something else. Something deeper. Almost primordial. This music is some of the most emotionally charged pseudo-ethnic drumming I think I've ever heard. I love it.

I searched for a maker that had a removable water container as well as a thermal carafe. This was the only one I found at the time. The rubber gasket that allows you to brew directly into the carafe is practically falling apart after a few short months. The carafe does keep the coffee nice and warm, but the coffee itself isn't the greatest. I plan on spending a little more money to get one that brews a good tasting cup of coffee next time. There is something about this one that doesn't produce a good tasting cup. No matter what type of beans I use, it generally comes out tasting the same. I'm sticking with my French press until I find a suitable replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"an absorbing portrayal of interior thought.","review":"I found Albert Cohen's magnum opus \\"Belle due Seigneur\\" a very personal, idiosyncratic display of the workings of the internal dialogue. If nothing else, Mr. Cohen has caught the stuttering, semi-incoherent lilt of the person talking to themselves. His pacing is that of a daytime soap opera, and the internal chatter makes it very compelling and oddly reminiscent of Dune (Herbert Marshall).Criticisms would include a cynical tone so profound that it becomes limiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, hard to forget this one!","review":"Albert Cohen's masterpiece is intimidating both for its size and chapter-long sentences. But, please, do not be discouraged. This is one of the most insightful novels I have read. It delves into the bureacratic labyrinth of international institutions, mocks their functionaries, and is a haunting critique of European virtues on the eve of the Second World War. (Particularly funny for those familar with the World Bank, UN, or government anywhere).But, most importantly, it portrays the relationship between men and women in a profound yet comic way. The book's difficulty is quite worth the struggle, especially when you reach the chapter where Solal seduces his beloved. A chapter that is hard for me to forget, for it shows just how stupid and cruel we are.This is not for the lazy readers, but if you have any guts, read this one. Its worth the while."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Bore","review":"I have suffered less squeezed into a airplance seat on a cross-atlantic flight then when reading this 1000 page book about two insufferable upper class dimwits.

Lunchtime wasn't spent in the quad, but in the library. It was there I stumbled across this little treasure. At an age when I wasn't embarrassed to read a paperback fantasy novel (I still read them, I just don't let anyone see me anymore) I discovered this little treasure. Coulson's world is tenderly created, believable, visually evocative. It was how you imagined the age of chivalry before your view of the Middle Ages was dashed forever by Western Civ 101. The characters are human and obviously beloved by the author. I suggest it to anyone who remembers the joy of just reading, like you used to do in a summer book club at the library. By the way, I shared the book with this cute girl in high school and...well, my social life pretty much started after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story well written.","review":"This is truly a wonderful book. The writing and the story pull you in from the first paragraph and don't let you go until the last. I remember, years ago, sitting up in a tree.

The rest of the tape has background music with soft tones and a strong rhythmic beat which are great for keeping up the pace but I would have loved some faster paced hymns with inspiring lyrics so much!Also, the sound on my DVD is not consistent.

And if you just want to do the moves you know in a different order and see some different ladies in different outfits then buy this video. I own three videos of Leslie's now, and they are all basically the same workout. I now just turn the volume down after I know the routines and listen to Christian CDS while working out. I love Leslie's advice, but only the for the first week or so of having a new video. I thought this one might be different with Christian music in the background, but really it is not. I have a 2007 video (3 mile and 4 mile Walk) that I feel is better quality than this one. So if you already have a Leslie video, I suggest spending the money you plan on spending on this DVD to buy a new great Christian CD, turn your old video down and listen to your CD and see if it is not like a whole new experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Leslie!","review":"Depending on your fitness level, this is a moderate to easy walk.

This DVD has similar moves and workouts, but the music, with the exception of \\"Here I am Lord\\" is not discernably Christian music, which is why I bought the DVD to start with; it's some bad take on Disco music. \\"Here I Am Lord\\" is not music that fits in very well with the workout either. At he beginning of the DVD when the song is used, there is no beat to work out to. In short, if you need a different workout DVD this DVD weuld be OK but do not buy it if you are interested in working out to Christian music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cult Classic?","review":"The top of the box for this DVD states that this is a cult classic.\\"Cult classic\\". Maybe, we need to examine just what exactly a \\"cult classic\\" is.

Cult classics are often too extreme or weird for the mainstream but are usually well made and have original and entertaining premises. But maybe I'm wrong because \\"Female Slaves Revenge\\" does not fit my critera for a cult classic. Its an extremely bad movie, its not entertaining, its poorly made, poorly acted and the plot is disjointed. Nobody likes this movie not even a guy who enjoys cult classics like myself.

Her real talent appears to be in wearing expensive clothes, which might lead to some sort of viable career after her legal practice expires.I read that the coauthors of this volume are in fact a well-known forensic pathologist and his wife, who is an attorney. Considering this, the book's mystery becomes less to do with its plot and more with why the lawyer protagonist is such a ditz when she obviously is not supposed to be seen as such.I did find things about autopsies and other forensic esoterica that were interesting, although the characters are not quite believable. But weak character development is a common problem with most of the vast number of crime novels flooding the market these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"After reading the high praise given this book (in particular, the front jacket blurb by Patricia Cornwell), I expected an exciting and compelling read.

Bringing his vast knowledge and experience to this book, Baden has created a very believable character in Dr. Jack Rosen and pulls a story together that will entertain with each page.While Baden walks us through the business of death and getting to the truth through the dead, he also takes us on an investigation with twist and turns that keep the reader guessing.There is one part that I did not like about this book and that was the ending. It seemed that while Baden and his wife were great story tellers and walking us through the crime and the investigation, there were only 5 pages spent on pulling the crime together and the explanation.

Not!","review":"When I purchased Turbo Tax software basic, I had tried Turbo Tax before in the previous of tax years. When I first started out, I could definitely tell the difference from doing the job by hand. I received more money back from my return than I would have done so by hand using my state's 1040EZ form. The program went well the first couple of years. Suddenly, this previous year, after a purchase from Wal-Mart I began to have problems:* Trying to install the software was a major hassle. The security code that came with the software purchase did not work and after weeks worth of e-mailings I finally got to install the software completely.* After the installation and performing all of the work and calculations, I STILL did not receive the kind of deducted refund expected from the bank (after paying bank charges and tax fees) which had taken over half of my refund.Turbo Tax Basic an excellent software...asta la vista, baby!

While the Basic edition lacks some of the features of the the upmarket products, I still managed to do what I needed to do, which included several mutual fund sales this year.Unlike some of the other users who have had negative experiences, I have run into no examples of spyware and the program installed flawlessly.

Having Angie randomly spout theory about science... which so conveniently happens to tie to the mystery? I appreciated the attempt to actually have Angie to the rescue instead of Paavo, as usual, but it was so ridiculous that this book made me wonder how much Pence thinks readers can suspend our disbelief and just swallow all this craziness. She again tries to draw out some other characters but they are shallow and forgettable. And Pence must realize it- the next book is A Cook In Time which is when she begins adding a couple of Angie's recipes at the end of the book to try to make up for how full of holes her stores are starting to become.

Last weekend while camping, it struck a light anywhere match and the head broke off and landed on my finger. The match instantly stuck to my skin until all of the phosphor was burnt leaving a small second to third degree burn. I looked and my finger and got excited because this was the time to put this to the test. I have to say that it passed with flying colors. I put on a small amount and let it absorb/evaporate, then repeated once dry. After 3 treatments the pain was gone and there was no blister, even though the skin was damaged.

About 10 minutes later the pain had disappeared.Keep several of these packets in your car first kits, beside the stove in the kitchen, with your camping gear or anywhere where overexposure to the sun is possible.Of course the best thing would be to apply the proper sunscreen before you get burned.

Only problem is that it is too bright for my small yard. Lights it up like a full moon with a gray purplish hue.But it does zap the bugs. I see plenty of mosquitoes are killed and moths and a few yellow jackets. Lots of spiders are taking up residence in and on the zapper and they catch bugs too. Unfortunately good bugs are attracted and killed as well.One other point, the zapping is rather loud. On smaller bugs it's just a quick PZZT! On large bugs, say a good sized moth, the zapping can go on for a few seconds (PZZT PZZZZZZZZZT ZZZZAAP) with a bit of fire then a puff of smoke. Ouch! Somewhat entertaining, but I wish there was a way to dim this light a bit.The cord is very short at about a foot.

Like other reviews stated, it's a good idea to remove the bulbs and spray the grid with pam; so I did that. I put the bulbs back in (which was no easy task in itself), affixed the bulb retainers and hung the unit outside. It was up maybe 2 hours (not in the sun)and not even plugged in, when one of the bulbs exploded out the bottom of the unit, peeling back part of the bottom plastic grid. Now I have to buy new bulbs and try this again. I would have packed it right back up and seen about returning it, but I already knocked the box down and put in recycling. I may retape the box back up and return it anyway, now that I think of it! This makes me very unhappy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowtron Electric insect killer -for 1 acre","review":"I recently purchased the Flowtron insect killer for 1 acre, and it does not lessen the mosquito population in my yard at all!

I ordered this using my amazon prime and as soon as it came in i ran outside, swatting mosquitoes the whole way, and plugged this into an extension cord (the zappers attached cord is VERY short). It was plugged in @ 6:30 PM and by the next morning the thing was filled with dead mosquitoes. The unit was definitely NOT clog resistant/proof, but was very effective at killing mosquitoes. The unit doesn't discriminate between different bugs, but i found that in the first night of operation there were more misquotes stuck in the grid than any other. I just used an air compressor to blow out the old bugs and set the unit back up. It as been 3 days now and the unit is still going strong. I would recommend this to other users, the only reason i am not giving it 5 stars is because it does feel kinda flimsy and the grid clogged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still \\"bugged\\"","review":"After having read several favorable reviews about the Flowtron BK-40D I made the purchase.

Following the instructions in the box, I called the manufacturer, who was very helpful, called me back right away, and send out a replacement bulb for the one that was defective. Even after replacing the bulb, however, the unit didn't \\"zap\\"--suggesting that there was an additional problem with the transformer powering the electric coil. At this point I shipped it back to amazon, who refunded my purchase and shipping costs. The woman at the manufacturer was surprised that amazon shipped the product in its flimsy shelf box and without further packaging, which may explain why it was defective when it arrived.

This zapper is working great, and that's all thanks to its intelligent design.Some bug zappers have super small entry holes, and then wimpy little electrodes inside. This zapper is designed to let bugs fly in easily, and it has vertical electrodes that zap bugs. This zapper works really well...in fact the other night it was zapping like crazy because it was hot and the bugs were out. We live in an urban area near a plant nursery, so we'd always have bugs coming in the back door. Now this zapper kills them and attracts them away from our backdoor. Great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will last about a week","review":"BUYER BEWARE: It appears Flowtron currently has quality issues with the starter bulb that starts the fluorescent tube in the most recent units. Bought three of these from two different sources in March 2011, one source being Amazon. Within one week, one unit from Amazon and one from another source had quit working, leaving only one of three working after a week. The bulb simply stops lighting and that causes the grid to not energize too, rendering the zapper useless. The third went in about 4 more weeks so after a month and a half, my small sample of three has a 100% failure rate. Flowtron sent me some starter bulbs (a $2.50 part) and that DID fix the problem. I'm hoping that the fix will last as replacing the starter bulbs on a new unit is a nuisance and some people might not be comfortable with the repair. When these work though, they attract/kill more bugs (and many mosquitoes) than any other electronic insect killer I've used. And I've tried three different brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get such great reviews????","review":"That's what I want to know. Does it zap bugs, well yes. However if you're buying this to reduce the bug population in your yard, that it will NOT do. I gave it two stars because it did kill things, but mosquitoes were not one of them. It also caused our red ant problem to get worst as they were getting a free lunch with the dead bugs falling from the trap. All in all it mostly kill ladybugs, moths, gnats, and flying ants. In the 3 days I had it set-up it may have kill 3 mosquitoes (that I could identify). That was with the scent lure attached. No flies or other biting bugs. Our backyard still belongs to them. It may help to know that I live in south Louisiana, and the humid conditions could have reduced this items' effectiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"After using this product for 6 months one of the light bulbs stopped working.

Before it broke, we found it difficult to install, mainly for the reasons noted in other reviews: it has to be plugged into an outdoor power outlet strategically located to make it effective in killing bugs where humans are, but not exposed to the elements, which would obviously cause it to short out. This seems like a design flaw that can somehow be improved upon, but in the mean time, we are returning it for the limited reimbursement offered by Amazon, because it simply does not so much as turn on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great, but breaks frequently","review":"As long as it is working, the bugs zap constantly.

A competitive line by Stinger is totally useless,and \\"non zapper\\" types are also useless. Mosquito-magnets using a CO2 based trap are a pain to maintain, but also work well.However the Flowtron has two shortcomings: 1) the bulbs do not last long,are relatively expensive (with shipping costs etc...it costs nearly half the price of a new unit to replace);2)the manufacturing quality and workmanship is primitive, in other words it is a piece of junk which works very well. I purchase several of them every year. Hoping for a new product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bug killer of it's type - it really works","review":"This is my second unit. My first one I bought almost 20 years ago. It lasted a long time and finally gave up the ghost. This new model is very similar, with a few refinements in the bulb design and the cage.We set ours on a outdoor Christmas Tree timer. It comes on at dusk and turns off 4 hours later. On a warm night, you can hear bugs crackling every few seconds. It's a non-stop orchestra of bugs that will not be landing on me or my kids and taking blood samples.75 watts for 4 hours is a reasonable price to pay for this satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"After reading other reviews, I ordered this zapper for our yard. Our property is approximately 2 acres and we have a small pond so there have always been a lot of bugs. Summers are hard on our outside dogs because of the great numbers of flies and mosquitoes. I put this bug zapper on a shepherd's hook in the yard near the house about halfway between the pond and the dog kennel and plugged it into a dusk/dawn timer. TA DA - NO BUGS!!! All summer long, the thing goes crazy at dusk and the few hours after. When it gets full, we simply blow it clean with the air compressor. The dogs are happy and we're able to enjoy sitting on our deck in the evenings. I haven't even had any problems with bugs while mowing the entire yard.

I took it back and got another brand, same problem except it wouldn't zap them enough to kill them. I took it back and ordered the flowtron from Amazon.

The unit that Amazon sells does not have this feature.After learning this I felt a bit cheated to be honest by Amazon. They did not have the \\"BEST\\" deal.

I was reading about the science behind these types of insect killers (UV plus octonel), and the articles I read said that they would work well to kill other insects, but not mosquitos. This has exactly been the case with mine. It will kill a lot of flying insects, but won't touch mosquitos. I've tried suspending it right above water, put it at different heights and locations in the yard, and mosquitos won't go near it. I put a sheet under this thing to see what it will kill and it will kill plenty of flying critters, but not mosquitos. The problem is the other flying insects don't bother me and some of them may actually kill mosquitos as well.

I just retired my Mosquito Magnet as it is temperamental and expensive to keep running. The Flowtron 80D is very simple, hang it up, put in the attractant and turn it on... done. Replace the attractant every 30 days and you have a very effective mosquito killer. It does attract and kill other flying insects but I can live with the collateral damage.

While these expensive units seem like the ideal solution reading reviews on these killing machines changed my mind. First off, while they are very effective when new,they don't stay that way and don't seem to hold up, and for $500 a pop they should have a long life. But that is only the beginning, with the high cost of propane today combined with an intensive maintance factor I settled on the Flowtron. It is extreemly effective and so far the only negative is the hundreds of dead insects that have to be cleaned every day.

For a variety of reasons, I did not unpack it until about a week ago, 8/1/09. I hooked it up and hoped it would attract the biting flies that are bothering my dogs. IT DIDN'T ATTRACT ANYTHING. Not one tiny little gnat.I called the company and was told I could send it in and they would look at it, but first I would have to find the sales receipt. So, in addition to what this piece of junk cost me, I was now going to have to spend another whopping amount on postage to return it to them to have them tell me what? It needed a new light, at an additional cost to me or there was nothing wrong with it.I am off to purchase those bags you fill with water which DO attract the flies and you toss them out. A lot cheaper.

This type of device has been proven to kill the wrong bugs!! It does not attract mosquitos or black flies or gnats or no-see-ums. Only the bugs that eat them.

Just identify the many fried beneficial insects vs. the nasty ones.Oh, they are good for indoors, of course, when you want to kill anything that flies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowtron Insect Killer","review":"Poor product. It will kill insects after it is really dark outside but it's totally ineffective in the daytime. I owned one (another brand) in the 70's that was excellent. The difference in the two was that my other one had one black light and one flourescent light. It was a softer light that seemed to attract more bugs, both in the daytime and at night. This is definitely an item to buy in a store so you can easily return it. Even the bait didn't help. I live in a subdivision that sprays for mosquitoes so we don't have many. The money would have been better spent on citronella candles. Makes a great night light though! It lights up my entire den through the windows. No more stumbling through the dark to get to the kitchen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"reduce mosquitoes","review":"Product is excellent in reducing mosquitoes and other flying insects.

While my porch was consistently being invaded by an army of a few dozen small black house flies, this device could not convince a single one of them to enter its electric cage of destruction. Perhaps the attractant in it is not suitable for house flies, but if that is so the product should clearly state that in its description. The UV light itself also doesn't appear to do any good. I caught a couple of moths later at night, but those guys fly into anything remotely luminescent, so no points for that.For indoors, I had a similar experience withFly Web Fly Trap, which also didn't catch a single one of these flies. Summer is coming to an end, so nature will take care of the flies soon enough, but if you live in or around Boise and think either of these products can help you rid of the flies, think again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Awesome here in CT!!!","review":"Our property is approx. 3/4 acres and we have a watershed pond about 80 to 100 feet in back of the house.

It works great! My wife can go out on the back deck and doesn't complain about \\"gettin' Bit\\" anymore. I bought the 1 acre version and YES I am also using the Octenol bait attraction that comes with it. We only turn it on for a few hours at during dawn and dusk.

The next day, the light did not come on when I plugged it in. I live in southeast USA where we have a lot of bugs so after reading all the great reviews, I decided to order one. When it did work, it did not kill a bunch of bugs like the reviews said. I saw a fly get zapped a few times and then escaped. I'm so disappointed and still have bug problems.We called the number the included - they said to go back to Amazon and check their policies. My husband had to call twice since they did not return his phone call. This has been an absolute disappointment so far and we'll never buy another one of this brand. In fact, I'll go through a store next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bug Z apper Zaps Bugs","review":"We received the Flowtron 8K from Amazon as scheduled. It was to be replacing another of a different brand that didn't work very well as the slats on the sides of the previous one were too close together and the larger flying insects like moths couldn't get between them to get zapped. This Flowtron 8K works just fine. We have a 31foot long patio. Only problem we have had is that the noise made when insect were zapped, frighten the dogs, as they didn't know of course what the odd noise was all about. We had to move it further away from the patio doors as well as turn it off for a day or two, and then it no longer bothered them.PLEASE, leave name off the review, and use just my nickname, Zany Old Lady in Colorado"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kills the mosquitos!!!!","review":"I have a Stinger that works fine, but like other reviews have stated, i have to clean the bugs out of the Stinger on a daily basis. Not very much fun. This year in Omaha, due to flooding, we are overrun with mosquitos. I decided to buy this Flowtron based upon reviews and I am so delighted I got this. I have both the Flowtron and the Stinger running on my property. Wow! The Flowtron attracts a lot more Mosquitos than the Stinger. The Flowtron requires less frequent cleaning and cleans much easier than the Stinger. The only negative I have for the Flowtron is it does not have a \\"night time\\" sensor. The only way to turn it off is to unplug it. I purchased a wireless outdoors remote to turn this on and off as needed. An extra $20.00 at wal-mart. That is the only reason I gave this 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for mosquitoes","review":"If you intend to kill mosquitoes... this is not the item you are looking for.

Anjelica Huston is simply outstanding as \\"The Grand High Witch.\\" She is the perfect actress to portray the dark, albeit laughable, character.Luke (Jasen Fisher) is a young boy living with his grandmother, Helga (Mai Zetterling). Helga regales Luke with stories of witches, dangerous creatures who seek to harm children.I particularly liked the lack of Americanization in this film, as opposed to a similar counterpart, the adaptation of \`\`Matilda.\\" The film stays true to the book for the majority. Unfortunately, the happy ending, which was loathed by Roald Dahl himself, detracts from the seemingly perfect adaptation.In any event, 'The Witches' is sure to be a hit among kids (and adults as well).

This movie has *everything* --Special effects, humour, excitement, joy, sadness, and yes, a superlative performance by Angelica Houston. So why did Warner Bros. decide to \\"sneak\\" this film into theatres and then quickly let it die, with little marketing? Who knows! It deserves so much more. Parents will appreciate the slightly twisted (if not cruel) humour, while children will delight in the cuteness of it all. I just can't say enough about Angelica Houston's performance. She's actually even *funnier* in this film with full makeup on. Anyone can spend 4 hours a day getting into full makeup and look good, but she actually transcends the appliances and TRULY becomes the Grand High Witch. \\"...child....is a mouse!\\" Jasen Fisher is also a delight as Luke (a Chicago accent in Europe though...but hey, he's a cute kid).

It will ruin it all for you.If you like bad movies, like cheesy B-scale horror, also avoid this movie as it's not campy, it's just stupid. It's aimed at children, but even children find it hard to stomach.The witches: stereotypical, ugly, fake, obvious bald-caps. Women \\"transform\\" into ugly witches.

I don't know why some of the other reviewers said it was dull! I have read MANY autobiographies of the early astronauts and would rate it up there with the best of them. It is facinating to see how the first American in orbit also got a chance to ride in the shuttle almost 40 years later! One part of the book I wish he went into more detail about was his experience of the actual shuttle flight. It seemed the shuttle part of the book was a bit shorter than I would have liked. I still think no book can beat \\"Carrying the Fire\\" by Michael Collins though, so I would give this book 4 stars. If you have interest in aviation and space travel, I would recommend this on your bookshelf. ...now if he would just come to Seattle for a book signing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Remarkable Life But....","review":"Not such a remarkable autobiography. John Glenn has lead one of the most interesting lives of the 20th century so why is his book so dull? Perhaps it's because he has never had a crises of faith, never had a fight with his wife, never had a disagreement with his parents, never questioned the values of his childhood.How very odd. Glenn has done more with his life than any ten people I know and yet I find myself wondering if he has ever suffered any adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, very well written memoir","review":"I have read over 50 autobiographies/memoirs in the last several years and I have to say that this is one of the best that I have read, very well researched and organized. Anyone who is interested in the space program will find this book fascinating. On the other hand, the personal life of John Glenn, like his 50+ years marriage to his wife, is a love story (He met his wife in a playpen when they were toddlers). His courage and perseverance certainly contributed to his success. Two more autobiographies that I have read that share the same vision and determination to success are Georg Solti - A Memoir (world reowned conductor) and Salvatore Ferragamo - Shoemaker of dreams (Italian shoe designer). Both of these I considered them very well written and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I Was There","review":"Awesome book. i enjoyed this to the point i couldn't put it down..The book is very inspiring and makes you proud to be an American.

The driver provides access to all the printer's features on these platforms and is very straight forward.I considered the HP 1200 and Brother 1450. I normally purchase HP printers but was disappointed in how flimsy the HP appeared. While I wouldn't mind Postscript which comes with the HP, it isn't essential and not worth the additional $$.

It is what we old folks used to use 20 or 30 years ago - a solid, dependable unit with enough features for a home audio setup. It has a phono input for those of us who still own turntables, and it also has inputs for a CD player and 2 tape decks (or one tape deck and a graphic equalizer in my case). The remote is a nice feature (we didn't have those things in the old days) and 50 watts per channel is more than enough power to drive most speakers.I bought this receiver to replace a 20+ year old Onkyo TX 25 and am very happy with my purchase.

Sotti's playing in the album is deep and shows a great deal of technique, soul and knowledge of the jazz leanguage. In the recording Sotti is in the company of such jazz legends as Al Foster, Randy Brecker and John Patitucci and, even if he is from a youger generation, he sounds perfectly confortable. My favorite material in the cd are the original compositions After A Prayer and Heretic Blues.I consider Fabrizio Sotti one of the best guitarist of the new generation and I can't wait for a new cd from him.

It is very difficult to put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in the series; great characters and exciting suspense","review":"This was the best book in the series; it had the most intelligent and likeable characters by far, and the suspense was riveting. As in the other books, the romance is lacking, but at least it played less of a role in this one so it wasn't as obvious. The suspense was also the best in this one; it's a really great and intriguing premise, very reminiscent of the Diane Lane movieUntraceable. In fact, I almost wonder ifUntraceablewas based on this book. Just the best in the series by far; the mystery was great and the most 'real' since they were connected with the victim, the characters were wonderful (Dillon is just awesome!), the police work was extensive and well-done. I just really recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book. Could not put it down. Right up there with her other books.","review":"AS good as her other books.

I found what happened to Lucy absolutely horrifying and was unable to put the story completely out of my mind and even had nightmares. I do read other novels about serial killers, but this was just too awful. I do not read books to have nightmares about them, so I just will not read anymore of her novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoning In the Evil","review":"I am in complete disagreement with most of the other reviewers. I really enjoyed the Prey/Hunt/Kill series, and the other 2 books in this series, but Brennan didn't deliver with this book. Her stories are scary, and show the brutality of rape & murder, without gratutious gore. She normally doesn't sugar coat the pain and violence involved in rape, but brings it to light, and then developes the rest of the story line. Her characters are strong, pretty well-developed & survivors. I am not sure if it is because the victim is a minor in this book, that she sort of glossed over the crimes committed against Lucy, but it wasn't well developed, nor were the two main characters brought as fully to life. Overall, the series worked, and I am glad I read it, but this was not a strong finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a page turner!!!","review":"Just like all of her books, this one was great!

Maybe it's because we'd gotten to know the Kincaid family over the past two books, and I was a bit surprised to see the brutality leveled at so many of them. Regardless though, it made me very disturbed.This series was my first try with Allison Brennan. However, while the books were well-written, they were way too graphic and violent for my tastes. A good story can still be told without that level of violence, or such graphic storytelling.I don't think I'll be checking out anything more of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading title","review":"This book provides you with an inside look at the authors of well received memoirs.

I spent a few hundred dollars in upgrades with very little (if any) performance gain. In addition, my Intel print servers, which I purchased less than a year ago, do not and will never support XP. (FYI- do not buy Intel products if you require long term support.) So I need to purchase new print servers. After the upgrade I was rewarded with more blue screens (fatal errors) then I have ever seen with all of the previous versions of Windows combined. And this is for a standard off the rack HP machine.

First, it won't recgonize your utility and antivirius software, making you buy a new one, then you have to buy an ethernet card for your cable modem, then you have to reinstall most of your programs to compete with the compatibility issues.Overall Windows XP is a good product, but it is either too advanced for the average user, or the average user is too far (5-6) months behind the times to find it useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nightmare","review":"If the operating software you're currently using is reasonably stable, don't bother buying the upgrade.

I've called Microsoft tech support, spent hours on hold (a toll call) and been cut off twice. The installation is caught in some kind of an infinite loop, and my machine is now useless.

Outside of this, there is little advantage to this new OS. There are, however, a number of drawbacks. First, XP takes up massive amounts of space on your hard drive. Similarly, you'll need to max out your RAM to make your system run properly. Secondly, it seems to be tailored to people who know almost nothing about computers, to the detriment of people who do get them. Finally, XP not only scams you out of the $... for the upgrade, but also to force you to buy new software that is no longer compatible with XP (and believe me, more of your software is incompatible than you'd think).

A big negative is the loss of 640X480 screen resolution, which is a great help to visually impaired users in Windows 98. There is a built-in screen magnifier. No points there: 98 has that as well.

Since I installed the Windows XP upgrade, all this has gone away. It has not frozen up once, and the clock is still accurate after 2 days of running and many hours on-line.

It sounds surprisingly well recorded for what was essentially taped live to cassette.

I find its popularity to be deeply troubling. There is apparently something in the current business culture that makes people not want to think. They just want to feel good. The story presents \\"facts\\", but no sources. It presents inspiration, but no critical thought, and it doesn't prepare the reader for the real challenges that they will face in life or in business. Rather then presenting Vision from the appropriate management perspective, it presents it from a marketing perspective. This is how we want the public to feel about Vision. - Even from the viewpoint of \`inspiration' it fails, because it's fictional. ANYONE can succeed in fiction.

This is no exception, and the animation and art direction in general aren't particularly good either.

While it wasn't what I expected, I can relate to Sasha's wanting to be beautiful, but what I found annoying is her need for every man to find her desirable. Does she really need to know if her therapist finds her attractive? She expected a perfect life, because of her looks, but her life wasn't any different then a realistic one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but depressing","review":"My \\"stars\\" are for overall enjoyability. If I were rating on technical/artistic merit alone, I'd probably rate it higher. It's well written, and it's a different kind of writing than a lot of what is out there these days. It's also a unique perspective -- really about a woman born before her time. She's a fairly sympathetic character, despite being breathtakingly selfish and self-absorbed.My overall low rating is because of the way the book ends. It simply...ends. It doesn't wrap anything up. I don't need a book to have a happily-ever-after, rainbows-and-unicorns ending, but this was abrupt. And depressing. And therefore not the entertainment I'm looking for when I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"We only wish it felt dated.","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I was suprised to read the other reviews, as they suggest that the women's movement has corrected all the injustices described in the book. Unfortunately the situations the author speaks of are almost as real today as they were then. While women have more financial options than in the past, those who think these situations won't resonate with 'the pretty girls' of today are living in a dream world. Plus, it's a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got through it...barely.","review":"The author's writing skills lacked in developing how the main character's desire to be independent came about other than to infer she didn't want to be dependent on a man like her mother and friends. Taking up with undesirable men and living in dangerous situations just to get by for a time didn't make for an interesting story and were more disgusting than entertaining. She eventually \\"settled\\" for marriage and children... true for many womens lives, but certainly not a cathartic journey for the reader. Needed more feeling and insight into her psyche as to how and why she made the decisions she made which seemed to go against everything she set out to accomplish after high school. It didn't feel like the usual \\"love conquers all\\"; felt like she gave up on her goals.

It has a decent, although cliche, storyline and the voice-over actors don't sound like cartoon characters.

Of course every character in here extremely overacts. Absolutely there isn't much of a plot at all. It's a typical revenge tale. A young girls brother gets killed by a gang. She gets pissed. She gets her arm chopped off by said gang. She gets more pissed. She gets a gun. She kills them. Sorry to spoil it for you. Not much to it I know. But who cares? It's fun!

I, for one, wish to thank him for his study of human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Remember Mama","review":"Based on a hit play adapted from Kathryn Forbes's autobiographical story collection, this precious, poignant film is suffused by an aura of nostalgia. Narrated in flashback by younger daughter Katrin (Bel Geddes), \\"Mama\\" is a heartwarming step back to a time when happiness and hardship mixed in equal measure. The Oscar-nominated Dunne is terrific as the domestic dynamo, and Bel Geddes--destined to become a matriarch herself on TV's \\"Dallas\\"--lends a warm, innocent presence. The pride and joy of this \\"Mama\\" also lies in a sterling supporting cast, especially Homolka as an ornery uncle and Hardwicke's quote-spouting freeloader. Compassionate and colorful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Remember Mama","review":"Bought this for my sister for a Christmas gift. She has always loved this movie. It came in great condition and quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"mama not remembered","review":"I first saw this remarkable film on the big screen and found it quite unforgettable with the warmth of the family surrounded by the centerpiece of a mama who was there for everyone. I was glad to purchase the VHS tape when it came out and found the tape transfer quite equal to the theater presentation. I thought the film presentation would be even better on DVD; HOWEVER in the DVD VERSION MAMA AND HER FAMILY AND SAN FRANCISCO ARE LOST IN MUDDY IMAGES that comes between the viewer and the story. What a great disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"TV with meaning & lessons","review":"I remember watching this show when I was very young. It always had a message on life.

My mother and I often watch it together. The only problem is that she wants to watch the whole thing while I want to skip the part about the graduation present. I really didn't like Christine in this movie, and at times, I wanted to shake her, she seems so mean-spirited! Aside from that, this movie is wonderful. I also recommend the book I Remember Mama (which puts Christine in a better light!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hilarious, Touching Family Movie","review":"Our whole family (ages 1-44) watched this movie together and every one of us (except the 1 yr old) laughed and cried throughout the whole thing. Dunne is an amazing actress for her day and plays \\"Mama\\" beautifully. Uncle Chris is a brilliant character that adds much color to this black-and-white film. The family- Mama's husband and children- are delightful to watch mature and grow up. The aunts are a load of fun! From beginning to end, this movie grabs your attention-and you will most certainly laugh! I also suggest reading the book \\"Mama's Bank Account\\" before or after watching the film. What a great movie! WONDERFUL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember watching it with My Mama...","review":"This film brought back childhood memories. No, I didnt live during the times depicted in the film...nor did my mother. It was the memories of watching the film with my mother when I was growing up. Its a overlooked classic.

Heartwarming and believable.","review":"I've watched this movie since I've been a child and I'm well into my 40's now, and it is still my favorite movie. Set in San Francisco, it tells the story of a very close-knit family from Norway. It is told from one of the children's perspectives as an adult. It is touching, heartwarming and just makes you feel good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality recording","review":"From the description, the movie sounds like one that I would love, but the audio quality is so bad that even with the volume turned literally as high as it would go, I still could not make out much of the dialogue! I don't normally have any trouble hearing or understanding, so it's not a problem with my hearing. Picture quality is not very good either, but that would not prevent me from understanding what is happening in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Those Perfect Movies","review":"Even though my family was English and French, I recognised each and every person portraid in this movie. I first saw I Remember Mama on the late movie back in the 50's when I was a kid and that era was still close enought to the time line of the story, that buildings and clothes were familier to me ( my great aunts dressed exactly like the women in the movie ). I don't know if younger viewers will enjoy it as much, but for me this is one of those perfect movies. I recently had occasion to to play I Remember Mama for my 88 year old father, who had never seen it.... he wept and asked to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Don't Make 'em Like This Any More","review":"If you haven't seen \\"I Remember Mama\\", where have you been? Probably the same place I was until a few weeks ago when I viewed this excellent movie. No wonder it was made into a TV show after it was released. The characters are memorable. The acting is great. The plot is interesting. I loved the scenes of 1910 San Francisco. It's just fun to be in amongst the old shops with all the early authentic advertising fixtures in place- a very nostalgic trip. To catch a glimpse of how life was for immigrants almost a hundred years ago in the city and to be cleanly entertained- what a treat! I don't think it would be possible to make a movie this charming today. If you can't guess yet, I HIGHLY recommend \\"I Remember Mama\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sweet---In The Top 5 \\"Favorite San Francisco Movies\\"","review":"Hate to be a nag...but can we get this one on DVD?GREAT cast.

It clearly shows that billions of people in the world today live under a form of tyranny that is absolutely, postively EVIL.One of my favorite quotes from the book:\\"The basic tenet of the Communist Party is to take away all private property so as to eliminate the 'exploitative class.' Private property is the basis of all social rights , and often carries national culture. People who are robbed of private property also lose a free mind and spirit. They may further lose the freedom to acquire social and political rights.\\"So there you have it folks, under the Chinese communist party, you have no \\"rights\\" because ultimately you don't own anything.Everyone interested in liberty should read these commentaries and carefully think about exactly what the USA will look like when we lose all our rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read Book to understand Chinese People","review":"Out of all the books I have read about China and communism, none of them compare to this book when it comes to truly understanding Chinese people. It is hard to imagine for most Westerners what it must be like to live under communist rule for over 50 years. After reading this book I now can understand Chinese people in much greater depth. This is one of the most powerful books I have ever read. I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about China and Chinese people, especially if you are thinking about doing business in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little less detail, please","review":"I have to admit I have not yet finished this book. Without realizing it I purchased the book from a seller in Alaska and I didn't receive it for three weeks!One of the reasons I bought this particular biography was the good reviews I read on the Amazon site and the book did not disappoint. I did get a little tired of all the detail because I don't need to know everything; I just want to know the most significant events. If, however, you are a reader who wants to know all the details of anyone who ever had a relationship with Sylvia Plath, then this book will thrill you! The author's endless presentation of details is truly impressive. The book is well written and well researched but a little dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This was incredibly boring.

There are pop-ups and pull-outs throughout the book. At the end of the story there is a board game. It is our favoirite part.

It is organized in an anatomically topical manner with chapters covering all major divisions of the peripheral nervous system. Each chapter reviews the anatomy of that division (eg, brachial plexus, median nerve, etc), the clinical phenomenology and pathology of characteristic nerve injuries, diagnosis, clinical electrophysiology, and management. It is written clearly and organized well with good illustrations. This book is my chosen reference when dealing with focal peripheral nerve problems.

It claims to be an 800-page summary of research on polygraphy, when in fact it is a 70-page supplement to a previously issued 800-page volume. Worse, the supplement does not consist of independent text, but only of update paragraphs, sentences, and graphs keyed to the 800-page volume. Since each update lacks the context of the original volume, it's useless unless you own the 800-page book. Be warned.As of 07/30/11, the Amazon description has been updated to clarify that this is the 2002 supplement, but it's still important to know that it's keyed to the original text and can't be read without said original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Teacher Resource!","review":"This book is full of information that can be used by both teachers and also as a beginning resource book for preschoolers and kindergarteners. The easy layout allows you to show the child a title or question and then read them the answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Artie","review":"I have only written a few reviews and it takes something really special before I feel compelled to sit down to type. Well,this CD has brought me to the keyboard. I was vaguely familiar with Artie Traum in that I knew that he had some instructional material out for the guitar. I was unaware of his recordings until I listened to them on Amazon. I love what I bought, South of Lafayette and Thief of Time. Well, I guess that I will have to buy more now that I am hooked and a definite fan. I hope that Mr Traum occasionally reads these reviews because I want him to know that he can add yet another fan to his list which I can only imagine is extensive. Thank you Artie for your music,it is great. I keep playing Memorial Day 1959 over and over. I also feel like I will have to give your instructional material a second look.Bob Potvin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for a soft summer night","review":"Artie's cds are the most-requested, as friends hang out on soft summer nights and this one pulled me through a long, cold winter. His vocals are smooth & easy. Payne's soprano sax, Cashdollar's slide guitar & Sebastian's harmonica just ooze southern spirt into the whole. If you weren't a Traum fan before, you will be forever after."},{"rating":"2","title":"South of Lafayette","review":"Given Artie Traum's recent series of wonderful instrumental albums, it's natural to forget how sophisticated his vocal and lyric-writing skills are. South of Lafayette is one of those magical albums that blend terrific playing, sensitive lyrics and compelling vocals. Whether you purchase music for its overall sound, or - like me - you listen for every lick and lyric in the headphones, this is a must-have CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing civil war novel.......should be in print","review":"picked up this gem of a novel in a used bookstore and was totally lown away ...this book is every bit as good as any short civil war novel ever written....noel gerson wrote in areview best civil war novel since andersonville ...book should defintely be in print ....the battle scenes and plot are very well detailed....pick it up you wont be disappointed...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a book from a reputable publisher","review":"Books published by reputable pubishing houses are copy edited and technically reviewed.

Let me see...for one...it's not a book, just a collection of descriptions and snapshots... using bigger than usual font, inconsistent color, layout, and it's speadout to give the impression that there's more to it than meet the eyes.

Don't waste your time, or money, on this book. After trying unsuccessfully to install MS Project Server 2002 in a variety of ways, having collected reams of notes from many sources and sites, I was looking for a book that would guide me through this process and account for at least some of the varients in installation schemes. What I found in this book were verbatim extracts of precisely the things I had already downloaded. No additional instructions, no insights into different installation options, ... worthless! Unfortunately, this seems to be a problem with MS Project Server - there is little collected information, certainly nothing succinct, for either installation or administration of this product. At the time, this was the only book available that specifically addressed the Server portion of MS Project. Too bad it falls woefully short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I've seen enough negative reviews on this book that it should have been enough for me, but I bought the book anyway. Most of what's covered in the book is available on the install CD, or at MS's Knowledge Base. I had trouble with all of the configuration and communication between PWA, Sharepoint, and IIS - how to set these up, what to do to make them communicate, what some of the basic error messages mean and how to resolve them. None of that was in the book. Everything else the book covers is either self-explanatory (in the software), or on the CD. This book is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Project Server Installation","review":"I waited what seemed forever before this book finally arrived, so perhaps my expectations had been building too long. I had already installed MSPS myself (with assistance from the online help), and wanted a book to guide me through final configuration and usage. Since I had installed MSPS and was already using the product, I had already done a good deal of trying things to see how they worked, and really wanted a book to tell me what to do with all of these spiffy features.This book is not exactly what I had expected, although it did give instructions for setting up the OLAP cube and some user rights settings that needed to be modified.The editor could have done a better job in reviewing the text, as it contains numerous grammar errors.I will probably look for another book to help me in using Project 2002 professional WITH MSPS so that I can use them both with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This is a definate return to sender.

I will remedied this (sort of) by shoving the pieces back together, but they are apt to come apart easily.I do NOT RECOMMEND this tripod, even for the price.

This seemed better in the pictures and had a good price, but when it arrived it was a total deception. It seems that is build with very bad materials, like if it will break no matter what you do.The caps at the end of the legs of the tripod just come off every time. Also there is no way the camera can be totally horizontal because the place where you put the camera has an inclination that doesn't allows it, no matter how creative you are adjusting all the hingers in the tripod. You cannot put your camera totally vertical either because the hinger doesn't allows you to.I returned it for a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Shouldn't Have Expected Too Much","review":"Because it was really cheap, I shouldn't have expected it to last very long, and it didn't.

This tripod can be used at many heights and it adjusts very easily. And it comes with built in level so one can make sure their shots are level and true and it all can be adjusted with a handle that allows it to be moved right and left to up and down without moving the tripod itself.

The best part about this order was the free bag it came with...other than that, annoyingly terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent tripod for stills","review":"I bought this tripod to use for both still photograpy as well as for my video camera. It works fine for photograpy, but is rather poor for videography. The adjustments are adequate and you can set it to many different angles and positions, however the motion smoothness is terrible. If you are looking for a tripod to set up, press record and forget it, this should do the trick, but do not plan on panning with this tripod. The motion is extremely jerky and you can actually hear a noticable clicking sound when turning from side to side.I would have to believe there are better options out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item does not match description, poorly put together.","review":"I know this is a cheap item so my expectations are aligned with the price. However whatever the price, the item should match the description. The description says \\"59\\" full size professional tripod for any camera or camcorder\\" however at maximum height the tripod is only 51 inches tall. That may not seem like much but it's the difference between recording at head height or chest height.The over all build quality isn't great but it's cheap so I can live with that.

But what i got definatley wasn't what I expected. It feels cheap and not very stable. When you put the camera (or atleast with mine) on it with the swivel stick facing you, the camera is always tilted, so the only way i can have it is with the swivel stick going to the side. If you are only shooting videos in your bedroom or outside, this tripod is fine, but don't expect to take it hiking and get the quality you think you should get out of it. But for what i do, which is film outside or inside, its ok...not the best but probaly not the worst.

My camera luckily fell onto my bag laying underneath, but I was furious. The tripod was barely used when this happened, and I had taken good care of it.If you're an amateur photographer who doesn't care about what happens to their camera, then a cheap thing like this will work for you. otherwise, it's better to invest money into something that is actually going to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong.","review":"I purchased this tripod based-on written description and price, as well as the photo of said tripod.

For $8.51 I expect a properly edited e-book, after all, they somehow manage to sell paperbacks for ~7.99 that are edited.

This one arrived first, and I settled in last night to read and was disappointed by the painfully slow pace. Every possible detail is included which makes for a very dull read. I found myself skimming whole chapters to get to the point, which doesn't really arrive until the end chapters.It does illustrate though how reading and writing styles have changed over the years. This type of writing used to be the standard, when people didn't mind a wandering narrative. I sometimes don't myself if what I'm reading is interesting, but this just didn't engage me.I'm hoping that Mere Christianity is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A disappointment, though not without interest. Lewis's purpose is to tell the story of his conversion from atheism to Christianity. But there is little here to challenge or even interest the open-minded atheist. It seems to me that Lewis converted largely for emotional reasons, apparently because he believed in some kind of Hegelian Absolute. The last two chapters are so vague and poetic (or perhaps poetically motivated...?) as to be very tough to read when trying to find out why he believes and what relevance his conversion might have to me. I never really got clear answers to these questions. Lewis is always readable, but this was disappointing on intellectual grounds (which is true of all his apologetics)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive item condition","review":"The item i ordered was said to be in \\"good\\" condition, but describing the item i received as \\"acceptable\\" would be very generous.

There's even a spot where there is an unprintable character that didn't get fixed. The whole book needs to be proofread and corrected after the scan from the original. This book should be much cheeper if there was little to no cost in it's production. (Since it's pretty obvious no actual editor reviewed the book after it was scanned). Avoid it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwile book","review":"This book is a fantastic read. I greatly enjoyed Lewis's thought provoking journey to the Christian faith. Not only does it include autobiographical information, it brings the reader to examine himself in a way that only cs lewis can. If you are interested in CS Lewis and his life, or simply wish to be challenged- read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised Indeed","review":"Wanting to know more about C.S. Lewis I thought this would be a good book to read. It did tell me much about the man, but several times while reading it, I thought about in what ways would these things he is telling relate to his conversion from atheism to Christianity. However, in classic Lewis style, the ending makes all that came before it worth every minute of my time. To the casual C.S. Lewis reader this book may seem long. I wouldn't recommend it as the first book to read by Lewis, but to someone who is truly fascinated by him and wants to know more about this man, I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Meh","review":"This is essentially Lewis' autobiography only up to the point of a small time after his conversion to Christ. I really wish he would have talked about his Narnia series at least a little bit and more than just a small paragraph on his friendship with Tolkien. As far as Lewis' story goes I can't really fault him on telling his life story, who can? The events that happened, happened. It seems though that Lewis attempts to be building up in certain areas of a general life lesson he wants to pass on but he doesn't quite seem to get there. Even when dealing with his conversion to Christ, it really only takes up the last three chapters and the book seems to abruptly end; something that I've seen Lewis do in other works. Overall, it's an ok biography but really for only someone who absolutely wants to know about Lewis' life before Christ. Pretty boring and slow paced for me. Overall grade - D+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating peak into C. S. Lewis's soul","review":"One of the greatest Christian apologists ever, you may know, had been in his youth an atheist. This is the story of his journey from faithful, believing child to (paradoxically) myth-worshipping atheist adolescent, to unabashed Christian. If you have any interest in the man himself, Surprised By Joy is autobiographical and describes a lot of details that really seem secondary to his conversion. Very fun and interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gore-geous","review":"David Hartman is the perfect example of someone who knows what scares people and then illustrates it in a way that will bring a smile to your face.

I hope Cornwell's next offerings are back up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many holes in plot/is Scarpetta God,too?","review":"As a scuba diver, I was eagerly awaiting this book. I had read Cornwell actually took up diving to research it. But there were just too many inacuracies to make it enjoyable. Why was she at a cottage with her dive gear - and no buddy? Who said the body that was found in the water had been diving? etc. Also, with all the politics and the government involved, I found it hard to believe a medical examiner would have been allowed to almost run the show. Still, I always do enjoy a Kay Scarpetta novel but this was the most disappointing one yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm rapidly losing interest in Kay Scarpetta.","review":"Scarpetta seems to have become an action-adventure character. I liked her better when she was just a medical examiner for the city of Richmond and not a pseudo FBI agent. The story line of Lucy's heroics as T.H.E. FBI girl-wonder of computers is far-fetched and getting tiresome. Let's get out of the FBI biz and dump Benton, please! Marino's great and the complex relationship with Lucy is fine. But the hands-on crime fighting is just getting downright stupid. I thought the story began well enough, but once Kay and Lucy donned their masks and capes and headed for the Batmobile, I became bored. The ending was rushed, but to be honest, considering my boredom at that point, not rushed enough"},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel has 'no mystery', 'no suspense' and 'no solving' involved","review":"The Editorial review states that Dr. Key Scarpetta is back to solve the mystery of the death of a reporter. After suffering through the book, though there are two murders of note in the book, I did not see any 'solving' of the murders by Dr. Key Scarpetta. She just had to be \\"present' and the 'solving' took care of itself.This is the first book that I have read of Patricia Cornwell and will definitely be the last. This is definitely a formulaic book written for hard core fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superwoman","review":"This was the last Kay Scarpetta mystery I've read. Scarpetta as superwoman and the outlandish, totally implausible ending were the reasons I stopped reading Cornwell's books. After this one, I decided that, with Kay Scarpetta around, who needs a department of law enforcement, or even a criminal justice system? She can singlehandedly gather any evidence at any crimescene, process it, and catch, try, and convict the perpetrators (I may be wrong, but I believe she also has a law degree to go with her medical degree.) Then, at midnight, after a full day of crimefighting, she can whip up a full, multi-course Italian meal from scratch - probably with homemade pasta and produce from her own garden! The early books were great, but, as I said, I won't read another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom was the cause of death","review":"This book started out with a lot of promise, but ended with little fulfillment. We aimlessly wander through a series of improbable events, with no proof of their connection (only a bunch of postulations offered by Scarpetta, Marino and their FBI pals). In the end, we don't really know who committed the murder that kicked the whole thing off, which was very dissappointing to me. I think Patricia Cornwell must have felt compelled by her editor to put out a book, whether or not she really had one that year."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great, as usual.","review":"I ordered this book shortly before Christmas and didn't expect it to be delivered until after New Years, but it arrived on the 28th, and I can't believe how great the condition is for a used book!

I will definitely be buying more of this author's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trudging thru","review":"I read a few of the Scarpetta books before I realized they are in a series so I decided to read them in order. Some parts of the books when she gets technical are a little painful but easy to skim by but this whole book is painful. I am trudging thru for the background plot of the series not for the plot of this book. I am 3/4 of the way thru and I am hoping it comes to a speedy end."},{"rating":"1","title":"ending too abrupt, doesn't relate to rest of book","review":"About 90% of this book is good. But the ending fails to tie together any of the loose ends (and they are numerous) of the book and Dr. Scarpetta is barely helped by any of the knowledge she gained in the previous 300 pages. The interaction between her and the \\"bad guys\\" at the end is straight from an action movie where plot does not matter. No discussions, no negotiations, just a straight, self-contained deception that could have come out of any 2-star action movie. Numerous characters are left hanging after the beginning and you wonder what happened to them because, although they are mentioned, you never find out what happened to them and they don't appear in the rest of the story. Thoroughly disappointing. A 4-star story idea brought down two notches by a bad ending and general sloppiness.

For some odd reason I always thought she was a romance novelist...must be the name.Well, the book is truly dissappointing. The first half or so is allright - standard fare mystery writing. The second half and especially the ending is so unconvincing and utterly boring - I almost did not have the strength to finish the book. The most annoying part of the book is Dr. Scarpetta's constant bragging about her \\"luxurious Mercedes\\" and status as the district medical examiner or whatever she is.This is definitely the last Cornwell novel I read and I would recommend any mystery fan to keep his or her hands off this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty darn dreary","review":"I hated this book. The plot was ridiculous, Dr. Scarpetta isjust SO self righteous, and her overprotectiveness of Lucy nauseating.The kid's in the FBI now for crying out loud.I've read many of PC's books, and what has really bothered me lately is that her writing has also gotten increasingly clumsy, as if she's just going through the motions. Case in point, this paragraph about Scarpetta and Wesley, \\"We made love because we could not help ourselves. That was our only excuse, and would hold up in no court I knew. Separation had been very hard, so we were hungry with each other all night.\\" CORNY. Sound like something out of a highschool creative writing class.

I thought the story began well enough, but it went down hill fast. The plot was completely implausible & ridiculous.Dr Scarpetta is involved w/ a global nuclear disaster involving foreign powers. I just find it hard to believe the chief medical examiner from Virginia would be involved (& basically runs the show) when there is a nuclear crisis looming.Lucy is nauseating as ever & wish she'd die. Having to hear Scarpetta brag endlessly about her Mercedes got beyond old.The only positive thing in this bk. is Marino. This book should only be read for die hard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cause of Death","review":"Avoid at all costs! I would love to never have to read another page of conversation between Lucy and Kay. It drove me crazy and was endlessly irritating. I also have a hard time believing in a main character who committed affairs with married men. How am i ever supposed to believe what she says after that? Marino was cool and funny too. He is the only character worth anything in the story. The first half of the book was great and built up nicely. But the second half of the book was horrible and it has one of the worst endings in the history of books. It left me laughing it was so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"I tried to force myself to the end of this book, but I couldn't. I enjoy mysteries, but there is no mystery here. I figured out what was going on in the first half of the book, and the prose was so bad that there was no reason to finish. Cornwell could use a class in creative writing or a good editor. Her style is amaturish and grating. Her over use of adverbs, tinny dialogue, and sloppy construction were annoying to read. If a character was about to disclose something important, Cornwell made sure you knew by telling you how important what they were saying was in the dialogue tag--like the reader is an idiot. I am amazed anything this bad made it into print."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I was very dissapointed in this book. I generally feel that Cornwell writes resonably well with a plot that provides enough twists and turns to keep things interesting for a entertaining read. There was no tense build-up to a surprising or exciting ending, which is what I want in a crime novel. Her writing is generally not bad, but her editor must have been asleep for this one. I don't require perfect writing from the authors I read, but in this book, there were enough instances of awkward sentences and bad grammar that it became distracting. In addition, her characters are becoming thin and tiresome. Elizabeth George is an example of a mystery writer whose characters actually grow from book to book and when I pick up a new book of hers, I'm interested in what will become of the characters next. Ms. Cornwell's characters have become way too predictable and one-dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring..","review":"This was my first (and last) book by Patricia Cornwell.

I must agree with other reviewers, there's no plot and it's truly predictable.And to quote another reviewer:\\"I like to be challenged by a story, not to be fed a pointless story because she had to write 'x' many books to fulfill a publisher's contract.

When the characters start talking about computers it gets especially bad. It is clear that the author has no understanding of what she is talking about.

However, this book left me disappointed and frustrated by it's too quick ending and lack of development of some of the characters.

This is the first time Scarpetta has been after terrorists and I didn't buy it or enjoy it. I don't read murder mysteries to read about terrorism.4. The traits of the great characters: Lucy, Marino, Wesley and Scarpetta herself seemed stifled and boring. There was no life to it.Overall, this is the worst book of the series so far and I actually found myself skipping pages just to get through it, which is normally a big no-no to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast start, then fizzled","review":"I agree with many of the other reviews - it showed promise in the beginning. I read the first 2/3's of the book in a day. I enjoyed the initial action and mystery. By the end, however, the book had fizzled to the point that I hard to force myself to finish it. Dr. Scarpetta is a thoroughly unbelievable character - she's an \\"expert\\" on everything from medicine to firearms to scuba diving to nuclear power plants! I'm a big Clive Cussler fan, and my wife bought this for me because of the scuba diver on the cover. Don't let that fool you - the diving aspect is a very minor part to the book (although it was one of the more exciting, at least for me). Bottom line- I wouldn't waste my time with this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"Sorry Ms. Cornwell but this is not one of your better efforts. In fact, it reads like a first novel - too much insipid dialogue. Little more to say. I give it 2 because I finished it - barely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, but not up to the author's usual standard.","review":"Unfortunately, Cornwell missed the mark with this book. Her readers expected another gripping murder mystery and were instead given a story from another genre. Kay Scarpetta does best when she is enveloped in a body, or a number of bodies, in the morgue and tries to unravel clues that lead us to the murderer. Along the way, we like it if the murderer gets a little too close! Although I still found the book a good read, I hope she returns to the type of story that originally drew me to buy and read every one of her novels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow - definately not her best.","review":"I've read all of her books thus far and was looking forward to another of the same high quality, engulfing storytelling.This book did not get started until the last hundred or so pages. Her first was much better - although I expected more I'm still a fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as Patricia Cornwell's previous books.","review":"I was eagerly waiting for the release of \\"Cause Of Death\\". I am captivated by Patricia Cornwell's writing, however this book was no match for her previous. I think she did a wonderful job on \\"From Potter's Field\\" and that book held my attention, and gave me chills all the way through. I can usually finish a Cornwell book in a weekend, this one took me a couple of weeks. Not an easy book to get into. I look forward to reading more of her books, and can't wait until she writes another"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and unreal","review":"This book is very disappointing and unreal. The characters are hollow, and the plot is totally unbelievable. There is a Branch Davidian cult taking over the world, the invasion of a nuclear power plant and then if that's not enough Middle Eastern terrorists, and they call in Scarpetta to solve this? Come on. Also, Generals in the Navy? (there are no Generals in the Navy). Then of course Lucy is back, who seems to get more arrogant and unlikable in each book. As in previous books she's still angry and always sulking and in a bad mood. This is my 7th Scarpetta novel, and it might be my last. The characters are becoming irritating and tiresome, especially Lucy, (get rid of her or give her a better attitude). I also found myself getting fed up with Scarpetta's attitude toward Wesley. In real life he wouldn't put up with her. She's always TIRED and/or upset/angry. She needs a vacation! I got the feeling this was thrown together in a hurry without a lot of thought!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Duped, again","review":"My review of this Patricia Cornwell/Kay Scarpetta book \\"Cause of Death\\" doesn'thave to do with the author or the story but with the publishers who designed adifferent cover for an old book. It's a ploy I see frequently and find veryannoying. Unfortunately I got caught, for the umpteenth time. They reprint thesame book a few years later, with a new cover, and people buy it - again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never write about things you don't understand!","review":"I've yet to see a movie or read any fiction involving a nuclear power plant that was anything but silly. Writers: just don't go there if you don't know what you're talking about! Now, the forensic stuff in Patricia Cornwell's books is fascinating. She knows that field very well, but the power plant thing was an idea best forgotten. It shot the whole climax into total silliness for me. Granted, I have the advantage of having worked in a nuclear plant for 16 years and not everyone has that. The plot probably worked ok for most people, but for me, it was a serious blow to credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype?","review":"I don't know why everyone thinks that Patricia Cornwell is such a HOT writer! I find her books to be very poorly written with many inaccuracies. In this book Kay orders a \\"Palligrini water with Lemon\\" and then two pages later she calls the bartender back over to forget the \\"Chardonnay\\" and orders something stronger. What's that about? Doesn't anyone edit or proofread her books before they go to print? With the pre-publication money in her pocket; I guess they don't need to. Sloppy, slopply, sloppy. I think she would feel like she owes it to her fans and readers who keep putting up with this stuff just for a possible interesting story and plot line. Even if most of them are borrowed from the newspapers. This will be the last of her books that I will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was her Editor thinking?","review":"Or does she not have one any longer? What happened to theCornwell of Body of Evidence, Postmortem and (my favorite) All ThatRemains? I stopped reading the Cause of Death around page 200. I just could not put myself through any more torture of unlikeable characters (not one likeable character!) and tedious writing style. If I were Putnam I'd be ashamed to admit how many zeros were on Ms. Cornwell's check for this book! I won't read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"I plodded through","review":"I have to agree with the Booklist review of this book, and with CarriDiva. This amazing Wonder Woman of a medical examiner. With an even more amazing niece, who has accomplished so much in her long life of 23 years, it sounds like she has practically redesigned the FBI with her innovative creations. I could see all caps every time she referred to MY MERCEDES, I was so glad when she traded it.Anyway, I plodded through the book. That is the best I can say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Ain't Called Fiction for Nothing!","review":"So we're all supposed to believe that an ME from Virginia is singlehandedly (more or less) bringing down an entire global conspiracy? I'd love to write more, but I just received an Instant Message from Slobodan Milosovic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a good book but in my opinion not her best! It is a bit unrealistic when Dr Kay Scarpetta finds herself in the middle of a nuclear disaster. This I thought was totally unlike the style that Cornwell usually uses. All I can say is carry on writing more wonderful, exciting books. ( these books have inspired me to become a forensic pathologist.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did a pod take over Ms. Cornwell? Who wrote this book?","review":"I'm reading all the books (in order) and can hardly believe this is written by the same author. The characters are familiar; Lucy is still annoying, Marino is still the only \\"real\\" person, and Benton is as stiff as ever (what is the attraction?)This is a book I'm reading just to \\"get to the end of it.\\" The story line is week, the plot is silly, and Dr. Scarpetta's involvement is just plain implausible. I mean, really? The FBI and international intelligence community is sharing information with the Chief Medical Examiner from Virginia when there is a nuclear crisis looming? Don't other CME's get jealous? What was Ms. Cornwell thinking?I miss the forensic detective work and the writing of her previous novels that kept me on the edge. Resurrect Temple Gault for goodness sake! That would be a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh, sigh, ugh","review":"Well, I love listening to books on CD during my commute. Frankly, I can't decide after 4 of the 10 CDs included in this package whether I should continue to listen or not. The reader's voice -- C.J. Critt -- is really irritating. Her inflection on certain words doesn't work and the voices she uses for some of the characters are so off-putting. After being almost halfway through, I really would like to know what happened to this AP reporter/scuba diver, but I'm not sure I can handle sitting through 6 more CDs. The whole story seems amateurish, and I agree with another reviewer who said that the know-it-all aspect of the protagonist is tedious. Let's just say I wouldn't recommend it. This is the first book I've picked up from Cornwell, and I probably won't pick up any others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cause of Death? Complete and Utter BOREDOM","review":"To quote from the book...\\"Don't talk to me in riddles,I'm not in the mood.\\" With many tedious abbreviations like the following it's easy to see why - FEMA,HRT,MCV,RV,IV,SEALS,UVA,CD-ROM,DOS,FBI,ERF,CRT,CNN,CAIN,BC,CPTL ETC. This is definitly the final PC book I shall read.PLEDGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cause of Death: Weak ending.","review":"Good beginning, a lot of distracting characterizations in the middle, and Cornwell's affliction for bad endings caused the death of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Cornwell!!","review":"It seems Patricia Cornwell might be writing her books with Hollywood in mind -how else to explain the silly, 'boys own' chase through the nuclear reactor? It starts off well enough with the usual Scarpetta/Marino ambience but becomes a completely different book by three quarter time (hello Wilbur Smith). Even though I've read every other Scarpetta novel, I couldn't even be bothered to read the last chapter. I feel like I've lost something interesting in my life that aint gonna come back"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time for Kay Skarpetta to grow up","review":"Once again, Dr. Kay Scarpetta in knee-deep in the poop. This time it's a far right militia group out to take over a nuclear power plant. This reviewer has read all of Ms. Cornwell's novels and I find that I am growing weary of Dr. Scarpetta's bellyaching and worrying about things in general and her niece in particular. It seems that somewhere along the way, Ms. Cornwell's character has stopped being a very strong woman and is beginning to turn into a self-pitying dishrag. When I read her first novel, \\"A Time for Remembering,\\" I couldn't wait for the next. Now, I'm not so sure I want to waste some very hard earned money for the novel following this, although I did buy \\"Hornet's Nest,\\" something I pray I'm not sorry for.In conclusion, unless you are a die-hard fan of Patricia Cornwell's, I'd suggest you pass this novel for something else, say Sue Grafton's \\"M is for Malice.\\"Ross G. Homer"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cornwell book is a byproduct of the author's own angst.","review":"This latest in the list of Patricia Cornwell's forensic pathologythriller series was a major disappointment. I feel that itwas used as a vehicle for this author to explore herown confusion over sexual identity -- and projectingit onto Lucy. The author shouldget back to the basics that made her novels eagerlyanticipated -- the cutting edge psychological thrillerwith the strong female protagonist! Give up the romance(or get her married off to the lover now that wifeyis out of the picture)and the finding of self and the good guy reformed Marino.I want her back --- come back Kay.Maybe a new character now that Kay has wimped out aftersaving us all from nuclear immolation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable second half,ME involved in more than \\"Quincy\\"","review":"I had read her last book and was going to read all her books when Cause of Death came out. This book was terrible compared to the last book. Who was it that killed the people who died, who cares about her neice's life style. Did that add anything to the book. How is a medical examiner allowed to get into all the things she gets involved in.I would not now go back and spend the time or money to read her past stories. This book was a big dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"below par","review":"OK, sweet little Lucy is gay, mom is sick and Dr. Kay's sister hates her.

I find it to be very helpful for learning to use Inventor from scratch. I was having no luck at all with the tutorial that came on the software CD. This book has taken me to the intermediate level.I wish there were fewer typos. I wish there were fewer instances of pick sequences being out of order, (work plane referenced to a surface and an axis). I wish the index did not expect the reader to know the Autodesk vernacular. All the above make using the book dificult, but they do not make it useless. I am able to use the software now as a result of studying this book.It is not a reference, it is a tutorial, and should be studied in sequence. Each chapter expects the student to know and be able to use the information in the previous chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just disappointing, but totally disappointing","review":"I regret wasting money on this book.

Just for your information, Yuuto is on the cover.I greatly enjoyed this book, mainly because Kamui gets a spine. It's very encouraging, and it makes me think of how far he's come. I don't want to give anything away, but let's just say that Fuuma's at it again... with a particularly vulnerable Dragon of Heaven as his target. At the end of the book is the back story for Kakyou. It's pretty sad, but how Kakyou became an invalid is finally explained.In conclusion, don't miss this volume!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite jazz artist!","review":"I've loved Dave Koz since I saw him in perform in Richard Marx's band. I bought his first 2 CDs but when this came out I thought that this was better by far.I like Dave over other sax artists because he tends to have a more upbeat style while mixing in some mellow tunes. My favorite tracks are \\"I'm Ready\\", \\"That's the Way I Feel About You\\", which features him on vocals, and \\"Flat Feet\\". In fact, with the latter, I can see him having fun with that song. I even e-mailed him about it, asking about why he titled it that and he graciously replied saying he has flat feet, which he inherited from his dad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love that smooth sax!","review":"I really enjoy the music of Dave Koz, and this is a great CD. It's got a smattering of big 12 piece band numbers mixed in with healthy dose of tuneful soft melodies. Don't forget, this is an ECD. Use your PC to view pictures of Dave Koz in the studio and as a kid. Other games to play: Try to guess who's singing backup on \\"Let Me Count the Ways\\" without looking at the liner notes. Try to sing along when Dave works the bridge on \\"Wake Up Call.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Texas Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed the book as it took you through each of the family member's lives.

I challenge anyone to find a contemporary band that can enter the ring with these guys. And the vocalist, Navasha Daya. Wow!!! She is awesome. I have friends in London, Tokyo, Belgium, South Africa, Australia, even in Iceland that all agree, Navasha Daya has one of the most soulful voices of our time. I love this lates album Black Is..

That incident is only the very beginning of the book, and the rest of it (512 pages!) is an intriguing tale of family betrayals, revenge, adventure and best of all a complex love between two very different but fascinating people. Not your average bodice ripper, despite the cover picture, but an engrossing western tale spiced with lots of action and a sensual love story.

The acting was forced and seemedexxaggerated to the point of just wishing someone would shoot the characters and put them out of their misery, including JoeyTribbiani. The writing also seemed to be re-hashing Sitcom situations from Writing 101. That's a shame. They took a character, which could have sustained a run and overdid him, overdid it all and yet left the viewer feeling somewhat under - impressed and definitely NOT entertained.

But... its not one of those quality products of Warner bros. Apparently they have switched to use slim cases instead of fix glass cases to reduce production cost. and one of the surprises which I saw for the first time on a Warner DVD, it has no English subtitles, only Spanish & French which make it less usable for huge amount of american people and most of international users.I Saw an import version with 3 discs. each disc in american release has average of 5 GBs of data but a dual layer DVD has a capacity of 8. so, they could produce 3 discs instead of 4 and spent the extra money to make a standard case.

The authors explain and illustrate very clearly the choices that winemakers make in response to, and to complement, what nature gives them: The Grape. Four stars because of the exclusive focus on \\"great\\" wines (far too expensive for you and I), which as Johnson freely admits, are as much a product of mystique, fame, and rarity as of winemaking practice. Also, the authors' constant fawning over everything French at the expense of the rest of the world lessens the book's value to someone interested in winemaking in California.

A reading of the previous book WOULD be helpful for a full enjoyment of this volume, but is not absolutely necessary. Like the first book, this one is jam-packed with fast-moving action and bizarre adventure. It is surprisingly well written; sometimes even elegantly written. Just note the description of the seedy East End in Chapter 11 and you may want to upgrade your assessment of Rohmer as a wordsmith. Anyway, this particular installment of Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie's war against the evil genius Fu Manchu includes kidnappings, wire-jacket torture, poisonous cats, snake murders, albino peacocks, killer apes, quicksand, a haunted house, rat torture, mummy attacks and on and on.

Go buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brown Sugar to the Ears","review":"Having first heard of D'Angelo from his Voodoo album, I was not exactly a fan of his since the music was very advanced and raw sounding. Hoping that perhaps his previous effort was all that people say it is, I gave it a go.And was I in for a treat. From the opening track onward, this album is often considered one of the earliest Neo Soul albums, and yet it does not appear to be evolving; rather it is fully formed! Both D'Angelo (with Voodoo) and the other great of the genre Maxwell (with Embrya) have distinctive ideas of how this music should develope. Until a new sound is developed from these 'directions in music', we will just have to be happy with the work of these two stars and hope that the work put out by other artists will be as great as Brown Sugar.Favourite Tracks: Brown Sugar and Me And Those Dreaming Eyes of Mine. Highly recommended for R & B fans who have just been converted to the work of the Neo Soul Movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Walker For Big Babies!!!","review":"I bought this walker for my 6 month old that is now 8 months and it's been a life saver. He is a big baby so this walker is perfect. He hasn't pulled any of the gadgets off...yet. My husband said the assembly was easy but took a few minutes. Raising the Jeep to the different levels is easy but also took a few minutes. The only draw backs for us is it is a BIG jeep and it takes up a lot of room in my small kitchen(doesn't roll on the rug)and I call it \\"The Toe Crusher\\". Watch out when your little one(or not so little one)gets good at this. The space between the floor and the bottom of it is just perfect for toe and foot crushing. The pain is evil but I got used to dodging it. To see the happiness on my son's face is priceless! He lights up with excitement when he's walking like a big boy!!!

My mother purchased a Step and Play Piano that she keeps at her home for my son and he absolutely loves that.

I ordered this online could not find this in any of the stores where I live. Fast and easy ordering I got this less than a week.

The loose concept is held together about as tightly as conceivable, every song or instrumental leading brilliantly into the next, all at least good, and the sum far exceeding the parts. It is here that guitarist Latimer assumes the mantle of leadership unchallenged, thanks to keening guitar solos that seem to awe in their own stark beauty. Judicious use of Alan Parsons' alumnus Chris Rainbow adds to the accessibility of the recording. From start to finish, this is a masterpiece.

Sure, if you're an old fart and haven't seen this film before, you'll find it to be lack (it certainly lacked a budget at the time).

Regardless of print quality, this low-budget schlockfest deserves recognition as one of the all-time worst movies.

The Martians don't even look like Martians,they look like Gumby rejects. The Robot looks like it was made by a drunk 4-year-old. The effects are soo bad,it makes the effects in Superman 4 look like the effects in The Dark Knight. The acting is third-rate. The worst part is the laughing Santa scene.

Toner goes forever--changed it one time so far. Never jammed, never a problem. It's fast too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats Toner, Breaks after a few thousand pages","review":"Buyer alert: this printer eats toner like there is no tomorrow, 2500 pages is not much from a laser cartridge, but in real life it never even comes close to this (officially rated) output. If you print half of the official rating before having to plunk down another $70 for a new cartridge, count yourself lucky.To add insult to injury, the feed roller is made of low grade rubber which deteriorates to such a degree after 3-4000 pages that it will jam the paper every single time, thus making the printer completely useless. For most users this occurs after the warranty is up, so you get to choose between a service call costing about the same amount as the printer's new price, or just buying another printer. I know the next one will not be a Samsung..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I THINK I GOT A LEMON!!!!!!!!","review":"I read all of the great reviews, purchased the printer in April, printed about 30 pages so far and all of the lights are blinking and it won't print. I tried everything: reinstalled the driver, put paper in both paper paths, new toner, printed from different applications, unplugged USB cable and power cord and NOTHING! Amazon said it is too late for them to do anything so I contacted Samsung and I am waiting, not so patiently, to hear from them. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on my imac","review":"I am sure this is a good printer - but not for an imac. i purchased this printer and have spent 2 days on the phone with Samsung technical support - they have sent us 3 different drivers for macs, none of which worked. in fact, the first driver corrupted my OS system and i had to do a clean install to repair the damage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid colored text printing","review":"I bought this printer based on all the rave reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I must send it back as I print many documents which have text that is near black but not exact black. To the human eye and on screen, the text appears black. But, in realtiy, the text isn't pure black. When I print this on the ML1210, the letters and graphics appear very dithered, worse than a dot matrix printer. At 300 dpi it's not even readble. Compare this with HP and Panasonic lasers in which the documents print just fine. They also print fine on my HP deskjet printer.If you are going to only be printing pure black (RGB 0 0 0) text or graphics then this printer will do you well, otherwise, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer, just needs some maintenance","review":"I have had the same problem after printing around 4000 pages, the rubber paper feed stopped working. After a Google search, I was able to solve the problem on my own. (...)All in all, the printer just needs a cleaning after awhile and now my paper feed works perfectly. Printer is great for text but could be better on graphics. For the price I originally paid, it is a great printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snappy little printer","review":"Great output, amazing price. The only \\"warning\\" is that it uses your computer's processing power to run the printer, which means that some printouts will slow down most computers for a short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot of bang for the buck!","review":"Very nice laser printer for the money. Easy setup, brain-dead operation..My only gripe is paper loading. It's very picking on the quantity and positioning of the paper when loading. Took about 3 tries before I was able to print the first test sheet. Quality of print is nice and crisp. The box even had an extra toner/drum included. Great bargain,,,sorry HP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Save Paper + Save Toner = Save Money","review":"This printer is a steal. I just replaced a $1200 HP Laser with the ML 1210. The ML 1210 is smaller, faster, has more memory, has better paper handling and produces better output. This printer has 8MB and a 66Mhz processor so graphic intensive applications are a snap. This printer is also sharable with no problem. The real nice features are the ability to print multiple pages on one sheet of paper and a toner save mode. The output I am producing with toner save is better than that produced by my HP. If you're still not convinced, this printer comes with TWO toner cartridges. At this price, I'm buying another one before someone at Samsung wakes up and starts charging $300 for this package."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so printer until it stopped being able to load paper","review":"I am burying this Samsung ML-1210 printer today, after failing to resuscitate it. It seems that it is unable to load paper. I checked the online faqs, followed the instructions, but, alas, to no avail. My previous laser printer was an HP and it cost 5 times as much and lasted only about twice as long.This Samsung lasted under 3 years. The price was right, but the toner was expensive and not available from other sources. The paper feeder has been the weakest link. No wonder they don't warranty these things past 12 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"My pick for home laser printer","review":"I've been using the ML1210 for quite some time, some 700 sheets later no problems to report yet (that's 700 sheets on the toner cartridge that came with it). I keep the toner saver on all the time or a quick press of a clearly lit button turns it off as needed. For 10pt or larger text hard to tell the difference. It hadles thick rough paper, good copier, and labels all well. Though the bypass feed for envelopes does tend to make them go sideways a bit. If you MUST constantly swap paper and envelopes it not the best pick. If USB connected and printing out simple documents it really does keep up with 10-12 pages a minute. The lights on front are clear, setup is a breeze. One nice point, a new catridge give a NEW drum and toner. It's a rock bottom price printer I'd recommend if you just need laser printing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing buy!","review":"I'm so happy with this printer! =)I found it ... when I was searching all over for the Lexmark E210 (which for the record is not as good and costs the same amount.)- The Lexmark has 4MB of RAM, the Samsung has 8MB.- The Lexmark has (?) print processor, the Samsung has a 66mhz RISC!- The Samsung has a rebate which finished yesterday... but I just made it =)Anyway, this printer is great!! Buy it, you will not be sorry.Way to go Samsung! You make great printers and awesome LCD Flat Panels... you have come a long way since my friend's VCR and TV broke at the same time in 1989... hehe :) Good show!Let this be a lesson to people to not \\"stereo-type\\" companies for their past mistakes ;)Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent output, excellent value","review":"I received the ML1210 from my wife for Christmas and couldn't be more pleased with it. The setup was simple and the output is excellent. I love the speed and my wife loves the fact that it prints on labels and cardstock without any problems. One note -- if you plan to connect using USB and need instructions, look for them at the end of the electronic manual (they're a little hard to find). I would highly recommend this printer to anyone looking for a laser printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsung Laser Printer - Great quality for the price!","review":"I just received my Samsung ML-1210 laser printer and I am VERY impressed with the overall quality. It was simple to set up, although I had a problem getting it to work with a USB hookup. The parallel hookup works fine. I love that it's so compact and can sit on my bookshelf, very quiet and prints out quickly. I will keep my inkjet printer for graphics, but for text, this laser printer can't be beat for the value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Printer Rocks!","review":"I had a laser printer for about 5 years and had so many problems with it. Finally I was sick of dealing with messy toner cartridges, paper jams, etc., so I asked my brother to find me a good deal on a good qualitity printer. I'm in grad school, so I don't have a lot of money and I need a printer that can handle high quantity. He found this Samsung printer on Amazon and felt it was a good deal. I am SOOOO happy with it! It was easy as cake to set up (and it usually takes me HOURS to figure these kinds of things out), it prints beautifully, and it's fast.

It might be somewhat useful if they updated it. After using Skipper Bob's Anchorages book, and his Marina guide, (which combined, cost less than the Moeller book) I would say these are the bible of ICW travel. They provide mile by mile anchorage info and rankings, and marina info such as types of fuel, price, slip prices, etc. VERY USEFUL and up to date info.

For instance, the Ring of Thoth starts on disc 7 track 6 - but I had to find that for myself.How hard could it have been to create a track listing?I found the Scottish accent affected by the reader to be inconsistent and somewhat annoying.

The film takes itself too seriously and scatter-brained character of Ms. Christie doesn't help. I get the feeling that the director thought with beauty of Julie Christie who needs a storyline.

The quality of the artwork is noticeably better than it was in the original series, and the DVD includes a good selection of extras. Overall, Bender's Game is a worthy addition to the series.

I only watched this one once so far and it wasn't my favorite of the three. There was no hint at a possible end to Fry's love for Leela. The whole plot was very far fetched.

I am sitting around enjoying this movie then they decide to dump all the characters into a Lord of the Rings spoof with a paper thin explanation. Last time I checked, this was a Science Fiction series. The worst part is the first 20 minutes of the show is probably some of the best pacing and writing out of the 3 DVD releases so far. If you watched the first 20 minutes of this movie then skipped to the last 5 minutes to complete the storyline; it would probably be one of the best episodes of Futurama. Instead, we are stuck with a Lord of the Rings parody that no one asked for or wanted to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray is awsome, movie is terrible","review":"I've been a long-time fan of futurama.

It has quite a few funny bits, and the great small and easy-to-miss anecdotes and gags that I've come to expect from Futurama are there as well. But the movie as a whole is just.. boring.. not very funny.. not even original in any way..I've come to expect more. At most - rent this thing and see I was right. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big time Futurama fan","review":"I love the Futurama series, and this is the first of the new movies that really felt like the Futurama that I know and love. This is by far the best of the three, and I recommend it highly to any fans that have been disappointed by the first two movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd Time's the Charm","review":"Well, the first 2 movies were pretty bad. Movie 1 decided to throw all cannon out the window and make previous episode connections meaningless. Movie 2 was a very long drawn out episode that left me confused and empty on the laughter.However, this 3rd movie felt more like the show. The caracters were familiar in their personalities again and answered a few questions I had from the series. I don't play D & D, but I got the cultural references just fine. Let's just hope that the 4th movie only improves what the 3rd one has tried to fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bender's Game is Mega-Lame","review":"I like that it is high-def, but the movie it's self was really lame. There wasn't any of the sparkle of any of the other Futurama straight to dvd movies. It felt like them mentioning imagination was enough to not have any in the movie. If you like Dungeons and Dragons a lot, you might like it more. Maybe I missed some of the inside jokes or something.I wouldn't recommend this over the other dvd movies, but as a Futurama fan, I had to get it to see for myself"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am tired of terrible cases!","review":"Movie is ok for Futurama(3 stars). But Case is very very thin cardboard and the disc just slides into a cardboard slot. I am tired of paying good money for movies and no good place to stored it. If I just wanted to watch it I would have put it on netflix. I like to collect my favorite movies/shows I want a nice case for spending 15+ dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought the first Futurama movie was excellent and the second was pretty good so I went ahead and bought the third before renting it. I regret that. It just wasn't funny. At all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the bunch so far","review":"This is the best of the bunch so far. The first movie looked like Futurama but it had no soul (and no balance). The second movie had its moments but it just sort of melted away (unmemorable). This third installment... Wow! Extremely funny during the first watch, and plenty good for many subsequent viewings. This movie is as good as the TV series episodes, but more refined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precious","review":"Futurama: Bender's Big Score was perfect in every since.Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs fell completely short.Futurama: Bender's Game was very good, but not 5 star worthy. I was expecting an Orson Scott Card spoof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink-O-Rama","review":"This is a poor excuse for a Futurama movie, it does not do justice to the series and is just poor writing. Its a huge waste of time. If you recieve this as a gift because you have all the others, or you are obsessive about collecting all the stuff FOX puts out (even with lame packaging that scratches the disc) then buy it. Its a non sensical hodge podge of ideas that dont make much sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great... the Best of the Futurama Movies","review":"I felt this was the funniest and most visually spectacular of the three movies so far. The grandeur of the animation in the fantasy world gives it an extremely cinematic feel. While there is some subtle backstory that will be appreciated by long-time Futurama fans, it's nothing that would derail a first-time viewer. What surprised me most, though, is how timely it felt (for an animated movie). The plot is set in motion by a \\"dark matter fuel\\" shortage that gives the story a relevant feel despite the fantastical setting. Long live Futurama!"},{"rating":"1","title":"barely passable","review":"Well, this was my least-favourite of all the \\"Futurama\\" DVD movies and I don't want to write a lot. There was nothing memorable and don't recall laughing much at all. It wasn't interesting to me. However, I suppose that can partially be due to my totally not-caring for or even trying \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\", reading \\"Lord Of the Rings\\", or seeing any movies based on that book. This movie would more-likely be enjoyed by fans of those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good futurama film","review":"I love futurama and this was a good film. It wasn't my favorit of the 4 films but I am glad I bought it. My brother and I have watched it over and over and there are some halarious things happening in this film. I didn't give it the full 5 stars because they way the story is written makes it seem like 2 films and I had to watch it twice before I fully got how that all goes together.Anyway, love it, need more, get it, and have a slurm party watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much wincing","review":"what a huge shame. i actually didn't really rate the first movie that highly but quite enjoyed the second. this latest one, however, has about 20 minutes of great material followed by what seems like endless boredom and bad, family guy style, 'running the joke in to the ground' jokes.hopefully the 4th installment isnt like this because this one, apart from the start is just plain BAD"},{"rating":"2","title":"great new band","review":"This is a great new band with a distinctive sound and great musicians. The vocalist uses clean/hardcore/death vocals in alot of the songs. This clean vocals sound alot like mudvayne's clean vocals and a piercing scream much less raspy than others. Great blend of heavy and soft songs along with mixes of both types of styles. A great debut from this god hating underground band."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music by a great band","review":"pretty cool listening to Tony, Geezer, Bill and Ozzy talk about writing their songs and what was going on with them at the time. this album was recorded the same way other touring bands did. write and learn the songs then go into the studio and record them. not run up huge recording studio fees writing the songs while sitting on their ass or sleeping at the paino while the meters running. Sabbath is the real deal. NO OTHER BAND WILL CHANGE THE SOUND OR ROCK LIKE BLACK SABBATH DID. just can't be done"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Read","review":"This was a really great attempt on the author's part with good research and fluent writing but I had to struggle to keep reading. I really tried to get into this book but it was really a boring read with a predictable ending. I understand this was supposed to be a light romantic read but it just wasn't for me. However, the author did a good job of making the reader feel like they were actually in the middle of the war, with specific details included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun vacation read","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It took me back to Nancy Drew and other mysteries of my adolesence. It was enjoyable by the pool on my recent vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"low visibility","review":"Because I didn't quite believe other reviews about the inability to see the clock face at certain angles (I have a dresser next to my bed, instead of a traditional night table), I figured I'd try this clock-radio that seemed to have all the features I wanted. I have returned it, since it was impossible to see the time from my bed. Next time I'll know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good If You Can't See The Time","review":"The search for the perfect (even adequate) bedside alarm clark is harder than you might think. It seems that the manufacturers' emphasis on features has displaced any concern for basic functionality. But we like cool stuff too! Despite the mixed reviews on this product, we purchased it because it looks good, has many nice features, and appeared to be easy to set. We hoped that the negative comments regarding viewing angle were hypercritical, while acknowledging that they were very funny.Unfotunately (indeed, almost sadly, given the amount of time we have now spent on this quest), the man from Eugene is right on. You cannot read the time while laying down in bed. I don't sleep standing up and I don't want to put the clock on the floor, so back it goes. My wife has threatened to go to her parents' attic to find one with the little pieces of plactic that fall over. I am considering this option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't read the display!","review":"You have to stare at the display from a certain angle to read it; for example, you can't read the time when you're lying down in bed. The backlight is annoying too, why not illuminate the numbers instead of the blank space behind them? I just bought a new clock because I was sick of having to sit up in bed and let my eyes focus for 30 seconds just to read the time. This clock sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw & Basic","review":"Interpritation... isn't that what Music is? Same with Opinions.This Collection is full and ambient. Things do change with time, as EC has. Peter Green's Mr.J was precise, yet raw. John Hammond's was enlightening, yet masked. Clapton's touch is that of a mortal playing a Legends work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhhh, Eric....","review":"Every so often I'd hear a great blue-sy tune on the radio or tv, only to find out it's Clapton. I kept telling myself to check out his music, and I finally did so. This CD is a keeper. I think all that he's had to contend with in his life, has made this cd sound..so...righteous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sessions for Robert J","review":"After the too slick and uninspiring 'Me and Mr Johnson' this album is what we were actually after. EC playing Johnson tracks with a bit of passion and verve. He performs each song to perfection and the live recording suits these songs much better than the flat, over-produced 'Me and Mr Johnson'. If I had the choice of these album I'd go for this one every time and I rarely listen to the former album now. The fact that this comes with a 'making of' DVD only adds to the package and it is great to see EC and his band perform these songs live and trace some of Johnson's history. A much better album and more what we expected from an EC Robert Johnson album.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton at his best","review":"I've been disappointed in Clapton's material like Pilgrim and Reptile as too pop and uninspiring. But when he goes back to where his heart lies, he shines. This DVD/CD set is great. The DVD blew me away. It's so intimate, so personal, you feel as though you're in the room when the band is playing. The sounds is great. Clapton shows his passion for the blues and gives us a fascinating portrait of a musician working at his craft. This is the work that every Clapton fan waits for and why he's one of the greatest. Put it up there with Layla, Cradle to the Grave and Unplugged."},{"rating":"2","title":"its clapton","review":"short but great album. great if you really love Clapton's blues. if you like blues you will surely love this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes the present is better than the past !","review":"I thought that Eric Claptons interpretation of Robert Johnson's blues was sensational. The DVD provided an insight to Clapton's deep interest in blues and the artists that influenced his early attraction to this form of music. The numbers demand the most inricate guitar play and the artists accompanying Clapton on guitar are from the top draw. The session filmed in the building in America where Robert Johnson originally recorded the same numbers was particularly evocative and in some ways quite eerie.Every generation will have its own view on the most appropriate blues interpretation but for me Clapton has somehow captured a special feeling and earthiness that exceeds even that generated in Johsons original numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best blues albums of all time","review":"Eric Clapton and his fellow musicians manage to capture the spirit of Robert Johnson, despite their being a band and Johnson normally playing solo.The arrangements are first class, in other words!The CD would only be half its value without the DVD - having watched that now seveveral times, I enjoy listening to the CD on its own even more.My one critique is that the sequence of songs played on the CD does not match those on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is wrong with this guy?!!","review":"Will someone just tell him no in the studio and force him to put on a Gibson, plug it into a Marshall for him, and make him do something worth buying. Eric, you're not Robert Johnson and you won't ever be. You were cool many years ago at being you. This guy needs to work with a producer that will make him do something that resembles a rock n' roll album and quit letting him make these pointless records.If this gets a young person to check out Robert Johnson then that's great because we all need to get there at some point, but he's been milking this stuff for way too long. I was introduced to so many cool things by reading interviews of what infuenced him and what he liked playing, but c'mon.You can have Clapton covered by buying Cream, Blind Faith, and the Timepieces album which is a greatest hits collection of his 70's stuff. Ignore these stupid attempts to get grammys and milk old blues tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can they play this good?","review":"This is simply FABULOUS!I am partial to the sessions where the band is playing......session II (particularly) simply blows me away!!!! The grooves these guys get into are gut wrenching! Steve Gadd is one of my favorite drummers ever! This guy has SO much technique and yet when the music dictates 'groove' he is the best there is! Never overstated.Billy Preston is a joy to watch and hear.Eric himself is a master!SIMPLY FANTASTIC! DON'T MISS IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Eric At his Best","review":"Truly Outstanding Music and thru his own interpretations. Blues is about a feeling,combined with sadness and joy.

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where 80s radio has failed on two stations (decade injustice).

Linkous I would compare to Neil Young more than any other artist, both with his alternative country sensibilities and range of emotion and eccentricities. This album remains his quintessential work. Musically, the Sparklehorse experience may be summarized by simply listening to but a few notes of \\"Spirit Ditch.\\" The paradoxes that permeate the Sparklehorse worldview are all present in full force here as well. As Linkous observes, it is indeed both a sad and at the same time, a beautiful world. Which may be just another way of saying, for however lonely you may be in this life, \\"the parasites will love you when you're dead, la la la la la.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An intoxocating (if not creaky) journey.

The sides were too steep - the only birds I saw at it never ventured to drink or bathe (and there were many birds at the nearby feeder, so it wasn't a matter of them finding it or not), rather they seemed challenged by the depth and the slick surface (even when not filled up much. I added a few rocks to make it more shallow and easier footing, but the cheap construction couldn't handle the added weight. Save your money and invest in something better and not plastic.

Another complaint is the ringer rings for a set amount of time (like 10 seconds?), and you can't get it to stop until it's wants to! Very irritating when the baby falls asleep and I try to turn the timer off, but it has to sit there and alarm (for what seems like forever when holding a sleeping baby!) and wake him up! But I give it 2 stars because it feels substantial, not cheap, and it's way better than the Polder one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable suspense novel","review":"I'm so glad that the works of Patricia Highsmith have been reissued (I particularly love her Ripley series). This book is similar in many ways to the Ripley books - male protagonist who is an amoral American living in the European countryside and married to a European. Sydney is an unsuccessful American mystery writer, who finds himself unhappy in his marriage. His wife, Alicia, is a bit critical of Sydney and he finds his imagination plotting her murder. The suspense comes from guessing whether he will end up killing her and whether he will get away with it. The plot twists are rather clever, although very little of what happens is particularly believable and the ending is a let-down. Despite these flaws, Highsmith's writing style is so smooth and enjoyable that I found myself liking this book a great deal. Highly recommmended for suspense book lovers and fans of the Ripley series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another strange Highsmith brew","review":"There is something tantalyzing about reading a book that could only be a book; a story that hides behind the fact that you can only know what you are told, never what you see. Is the story-teller of this novel (the original title was, I believe, \\"The Storyteller\\") telling us the bizarre and awful things he is doing or is he working out the plotline of a new fiction? Curious characters and situations, and some very odd behavior that stretches your reader's patience. But we do not go to Highsmith to meet conventional people with conventional behavior; we ask her to introduce us to the perverse and psychologically messy people we hope we never meet outside of her pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-stopping suspense, depressing ending","review":"Another magnificent plot from the ever-brilliant Highsmith: a writer daydreams about killing his wife, even acts it out to the point of pretending to bury her wrapped up in an old carpet (and his neighbor sees him do it); then when the wife disappears, he becomes the prime suspect. A fine meditation on the effect of guilt -- and the guilt that comes from intention rather than action. Several great plot twists and a heart-stopping climax -- but I found the ending very disturbing, morally (naturally, I can't be too specific; don't want to spoil it). Like most of Highsmith's work, it's beautifully written, tough to put down, and extremely thought-provoking. Highsmith collectors beware: this book was also published as a Crime Club selection under the title \\"The Story-Teller.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a talented Mr. Ripley","review":"A dated story with the flavor of role playing. A nice, light read with a nice twist. The suspect wants to be a murderer, the victim is not a victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing","review":"Shortly put, this is one of the worst--if not THE worst-- books Patricia Highsmith ever wrote. I loved the Ripliad, and have read some of her short stories. I know she can be a teriffic writer, and her style unsurpassed, so I was amazed as I got more deeply into this one. It starts out well, but the last third of the book so totally strains credulity that it was spoiled for me. Sydney's actions are not believable, and later he could have cleared himself in a minute; his motives for not doing so are never clear. All in all, not worth the time it took to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better as a song than an album","review":"Abba had a great single called \\"Waterloo\\" that they had to build an album around when they were just starting their career. That they they were only marginally successful shouldn't be much of a surprise. This album features the greatest variety of styles you'll hear from this band. While \\"Sitting is the Palmtree\\" has a passable reggae beat, \\"King Kong Song\\" is an absolutely ridiculous stab at heavy metal. The band hadn't yet fully developed their pop songwriting skills, which would become so dominant later on. A curiosity for fans, but not for the casual listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"patchy","review":"It's ok- hasta manana is brilliant. But 'suzy hang around' has some very off ey singing.

I may not be a Christian but I do know enough about Christianity and Catholic restrictions to appreciate and enjoy this engrossing and moving story.Vito is such an appealing character that I wish such a person does exist. Maybe he does. His selfless desire to help others and his struggle to find the right balance between his religion and who he really is and to know what God truly wants from him is one absorbing and stirring read.Ultimately this story is about the celebration of life and love and Vito's final decision just reflects that. I look forward to more from this talented writer. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous story, worth your money!","review":"I'm still in the middle of reading this book, and I must say, I've never been so touched by a work of fiction before. I've read lots of great fiction, but this one actually speaks to me. I'm a Protestant Christian guy who has wrestled with sexuality all my life. And I also once considered full-time Christian vocation. Even though I don't understand all the innerworkings of the Catholic church, I certainly understand the inner turmoil that Vito endures throughout the story. This is one book I'll definitely refer to my friends. I'm sure that my gay Christian friends will also relate. Those who are not Christian or gay might have a hard time with it, but if they're open-minded about it, they might gain insight into my personal struggles by reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Autobiography of Salvatore??","review":"This book contained three themes that interest me greatly....gay, Italian, and Christian religion. So it was a MUST that I read it. Plus it ended up being a love story too! I could have figured out how it would end, after all, it is a book for gay men-it had to be pro gay positive. At least Salvatore didn't bash the Catholic church. I really think that this is an autobiography of Salvatore Sapienza because the information about the author so closely parallels the story in the book. While not directly writing an autobiography, he was probably able to switch things around a bit and make the story juicier for the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Michigan Author's First Novel","review":"Sal Sapienza'a debut novel, Seventy times Seven, takes readers into the conflicted world of a young brother in the Catholic church. The story is one of balance as young Vito comes to terms with his sexuality, constantly at odds with church dogma and certain church elders.Readers feel what Vito feels, especially after his arrival for a summer in California, the turning point that keeps the pages flipping. It's an engaging, understandable, and satisfying read for people no matter what section of the Bible they're fond of quoting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"I'm not sure that everyone will identify with this book, but after devoting much of my life to ministry and and struggling with the views of the church on homosexuality, I really did identify with the brother! It is a sad reality that gays who wish to worship God often are forced to hide a large part of who and what they are, or in my case, turn your back on the church and worship God privately. Thanks for a great read and for helping explain the so-call \\"good vs evil\\" that many of us who enter ministry face."},{"rating":"2","title":"A First","review":"Seventy Times Seven was my first order and read of a gay novel. I could not have selected a better first book. Am looking forward to more reads from the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL READ!","review":"Seventy Times Seven is a wonderful read. One encounters spiritual conflict and self doubt, sexual tension and love in the context of a gay Brother who has yet to take his final vows in the Catholic Church. Vito, the conflicted Brother is a fully formed character. The author does not bash the Catholic Church, but rather addresses its shortfalls -- all in the context of Vito's self doubt as to his true calling and his search for how to do God's work.As a younger Brother, Vito has difficulty relating to older gay writers -- a potentially interesting insight into the author himself. The book is balanced in the telling of its story. Characters are believable and by-in-large not one dimensional. The ending one might predict, but I read this novel believing Vito's choice of finding his place doing God's work could go either way -- in secular life or as a Brother in the ChurchI enjoyed this novel greatly and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN READ","review":"Saw alot of myself in this booK, couldn't put it down. Very insightful. when's the next one coming?"},{"rating":"2","title":"70 x 7 good","review":"While any gay Catholic will enjoy the familiar and rough terrain of this novel, even readers outside the faith will understand the harsh chasm between one's faith and homosexuality.Brother Victor Fortunato, a 27-year-old gay man who teaches religion at a high school, tries to straddle a celibate but openly gay lifestyle with his vows. He identifies himself as fully Catholic and fully gay, but this isn't a reconciliation. When he volunteers in SF for the summer at an AIDS service center, he contemplates his upcoming final vows. He gets advice from others on the direction for his life, and the true driving force for that direction turns out to be Gabe, a newly-divorced man who is volunteering at the same center.The authenticity that runs throughout this story is apparent, so it is no surprise to me that the author, Salvatore Sapienza, was a Marist brother. This book has the drama, humor and deep insight that make a novel wonderful. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Interesting Study At Best","review":"I love Christopher Marlowe, and I am happy that this play did not discourage me from reading his \\"Dido Queen of Carthage,\\" \\"Faustus,\\" \\"Edward II,\\" or \\"Massacre At Paris.\\" In my opinion, \\"1 Tamburlaine\\" and \\"2 Tamburlaine\\" are interesting studies at best. I feel that too much of Marlowe's genious takes a back seat to bad humour. Furthermore, Tamburlaine himself lacks the malignant charm of Faustus. He also does not play on our sympathy like Edward II. Nor does he have chilling passages like Guise. The only possible reason I would give for reading this is that it was Marlowe's first effort. Also, the bad humour allows us to see the mentally disturbed side of Marlowe. My best advice to anyone who reads this is don't let this discourage you from reading his great works like \\"Dido Queen of Carthage,\\" \\"Faustus,\\" \\"Massacre At Paris,\\" or \\"Edwatd II.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice and song author to remember","review":"This album is brilliant.

My Canon 60D with Tamron 17-50 lens attached fit snugly in the bottom compartment (be aware - a bigger camera would not have fit), along with my Sigma 70-300 lens, a flash, and extra battery with charger. My Macbook had plenty of room in the back pocket. The top front compartment fit my iPad, over-the-ear headphones, a small travel pouch, and pockets for various additional small accessories. It fit under the airplane seat with everything listed above. It is well constructed and comfortable to carry and suited my needs perfectly for this trip.If you have a professional camera, this bag would likely not work for you. However, if you've got a mid-range camera and lot to carry, I highly recommend this bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for what it is","review":"I have had this bag for a year now and I still use it regularly. I can take my laptop with me to school and still have my camera with a couple of smaller lenses with me in case I happen across something I want to shoot. If you are using this bag as a general use bag and you want a laptop and some food or a change of clothes it is nice. If you have bigger lenses you will run out of space really quickly. The nicest feature of who low profile it is, a few times I have pulled my camera out and friends I was with were amazed that I always have my camera, they thought my bag was a regular backpack.I have taken this bag hiking a couple of times and it was comfortable all day (although if I would have put a laptop in the bag it would have been too heavy.)

The pockets are well-constructed and designed to allow storage of the computer, its associated gear, and a small manual or two. Prior to obtaining this item, I had the standard off-the-shoulder pack which caused wear on my shoulders, necessitating constant switching. This backpack allows a much more convenient carrying style. It is also easier to remove the computer for airline security inspections.My only concern is that some of the pockets should be removable for uses other than carrying a computer or for personalization of the packing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does it's job and them some","review":"I originally bought this bag for a friend.

Her main concern was having to carrying a fairly large cam bag, as well as a laptop bag when traveling.The bag proved to be such a great solution to the two bag issue, I ordered it for myself. In my case, this bag solves my 3 bag needs. Not only is there a space for my cam/laptop, there is a generous sized compartment (big enough to carry contents of you pocketbook). If you're a knitter, you'll find that the lens compartments are great storage for notions/yarn.As a knitter, you're always looking for the best way to carry all of your normal crap, AND you're knitting. Well the CompuDayPack is definitely something to consider.My only complaint is that the main compartment only has one zipper. So if you're not holding the bag fully upright, there's a chance that you stuff will come spilling out."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets the job done.","review":"My digital rebel barely fits with the kit lens in the main section.

This would be an excellent choice for fans of Bruce Hornsby's Appalachian-rock, or alt-country greats like Steve Earle or Ryan Adams.My only complaint (and the reason this album doesn't get 5 stars) is that it overstays its welcome. Nothing after \\"Shredding\\" is as good as what comes before, and the disc would have been much better by simply ending it with that song.

I, too, noticed that it's a close out item and that no returns will be honored.....therefore I think I'll go to my local Wal Mart and buy another brand bulb and if necessary spend a few dollars more and get another brand bug zapper....one that I can trust!! I bought the Flowtron one only 1 year ago....had to replace the bulb approximately 8 months later....what a waste of money! I gave it two stars because while it did work...it did a good job.

They were very easy and quick to install. However, the glass mirrors vibrate so badly that the image in the mirror is blurry. In fact, it is so blurry from the vibration of driving down the road that you can't see a clear image of the trailer that you are pulling. I returned these mirrors to Amazon because they are completely useless. Doesn't the manufacturer test these before they place them on the market? Shame on them.

I was partially correct, it was inexpensive. They look good and the mounting to the factory mirrors is rock solid. The problem is in the CIPA mirror itself. The mount for the actual mirror in the housing is not very good and allows the mirror to vibrate so bad driving down the road that you can barely see anything. Even at idle in my diesel truck there is a little vibration, I can tap on the inside of my door and these things just bounce around with no movement from the factory mirrors. The only thing these mirrors are good for is backing, so if that's all you need they will work, other than that don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD","review":"Had to tape the things on to keep them with me.

For me this is refreshing and interesting. Waters crafted the beginning and middle of the novel very painstakingly--I appreciated the craft but at times I wanted a little more variation in pace. She actually takes you into the musty constrained world of a slightly hysterical spinster--and makes it interesting because she unearths the passion underneath the surface.The ending felt a little rushed--but this might be because it was jarring and sudden for the protagonist and Waters brought me into her world.All in all a worthwhile read that takes you to another time and place!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I've read tons of books over the years, but the only time I ever read anything that had to do with homosexuality was always over done and unrealistic.

Not sure what to think -- except it is one strange tale! The lesbian overtones were terribly subtle. In fact, it is possible that if you did not know in advance about that fact you would not suspect. I thought the story dragged a bit but I perservered as I was simply too curious about the ending. I won't give it away - but let's just say that it was just a tad predictable - and then again, perhaps not. This book left me a bit puzzled and a little disappointed as well. I give it four stars for being well written - 3.5 would have been my overall rating. Not high up on my list of favorites but I guess it was interesting enough. Would I read another from this author? Probably - because of her other book \\"Tipping the Velvet\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly creepy","review":"Another brilliant book by Sarah Waters.

Lots of commas and fog. The novel does get pretty Gothic and while there is stuff of interest throughout (enough to keep me going) I did almost put it aside. Murky atmospheres oppress me - which is interesting in that this novel is about varieties of oppression. Something told me to keep going and it was well worth it. I have to say the last 50 pages are magnificent! I won't say more because I don't want to ruin it. TRULY great ending, which is a rare thing.Most interesting to me is that I recognized the name of another terrific gay author hidden in the writing.

To do so seems an act of devastating tedium.This is one of those. From early on -- and I am not one of those who thinks of Sarah Waters as a lesbian writer; I haven't read her enough -- the lesbian theme was clear, and the direction the plot would take was fairly clear. It only remained to work out just exactly how the denouement would look. It looked just as I thought it would.The only virtue of this novel was its depiction of late 19th century English prisons -- and I have no way of gauging how accurate that is.I consider this a huge waste of time -- but it was on my Kindle, and I had some hours to kill in a waiting room.I bought it because I liked The Little Stranger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story spooky ending","review":"Read Tipping The Velvet, loved it so I picked up the next book and what do I find. Geeze. Can you say spooky. The ending gave me interesting dreams for about a week. But heck. The book was good so I forgive it. Just don't read the book in a haunted house or alone in the woods.Just warning ya.Basic plot. (from memory lost book) Young woman fast on her way to becoming a loony spinster takes a volunteer job at the local women's prison (oh takes place in Britian when people still road in horse drawn buggies) and becomes fasinated by one of the women in the all star unit.

Soon they are plotting the girl's escape.There's more to it but that's the basic plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS an erotic novel!","review":"I notice one of the reviewers here said this is not an erotic novel. In fact, it's more erotic than a novel that actually involves graphic sexual actions or thoughts. What a fabulous storyteller is Sarah Waters.

I get lost in her wor(l)ds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again a triumph for Ms. Waters","review":"Ater finishing Affinity, I can hardly wait for her next book.

But unlike \\"Velvet\\" \\"Affinity\\" seemed to limp and drag. One reviewer has suggested that the slowness was neccessary for the build up to the final denoument.I was disappointed that Waters let so much ride on the final chapter,it reminded me more of a short story which had been stretched to breaking point than a novel.I can't help wondering whether this was Waters' first novel only published after her second work's success. It certainly lacked the dimension and character development so wonderful in \\"Tipping The Velvet.\\" While I agree that a novel written by a lesbian does not have to be a lesbian novel I found Waters' coyness with the subject irritating. After waiting so long to read this book I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My summer read (2006)","review":"This story is so very intriguing that I felt like I was right there in Millbank prison with Selina Dawes. Sarah Waters' description of how horrid a Victorian 'gaol' actually was is chilling and yet when you really think on it, it was probably even more terrible than that. I can only imagine what it was like to totally 'lose it' and be meanly shuffled off to 'the darks' bound in a Victorian version of the straight jacket. Also the supernatural factor of this story is amazing and one gets a taste of Peter Quick. What a great taste it is. This book is a MUST if you enjoyed The Alienist by Caleb Carr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually a half-star would be appropriate","review":"This is really a huge mess of an album. The cover bodes ill; Lou wearing more makeup than he has since \\"Transformer\\" days, apparently distracted from gazing into a mirror, and looking as though he'll glance back at the mirror any second and get lost in the mystery of his own gaze.That's pretty much what's happening here. Lou seems to be trying to pull off something here, but it's impossible to figure out what; the sped-up voices, the fake jazz inflections, the dreadful studio-musician glaze, the bad lyrics and unemotional singing, all add up to the nadir studio recording of Reed's Arista years.I am a big Lou Reed fan, but I am NOT willing to cut him this much slack. \\"Transformer\\" and \\"New York\\" stand in stark contrast to this as testimonials to what he's capable of when he's really trying. Unfortunately, through most of his Arista years, he wasn't trying very hard. It really shows here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is the single best work of rock jazz fusion ever and anyone who doesn't believe it hasn't suffered through Miles Davis' Jack Johnson. A wonderfully experimental masterpiece and an essential addition to any CD collection.Also really weird cover with Lou looking more like Chaney than Reed.Not much more to say, its not rock and roll and its not jazz and its not like anything much you've heard unless you've heard the early 70s Davis works....but it works and drills itself into your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your young boys to read GA Henty!","review":"Great author from the turn of the last century, tells stories of adventure.

The heat is timed for nine minutes, and after that time I still don't feel any warmth on my back (it isn't designed to warm the thighs). I bought this, expecting a warm massage, but it doesn't deliver on that expectation. The massage is at several specific points. As long as that is what you expect, it's fine. Don't expect the effect that you get from the ones that have moving rollers - the roller types cover a larger area, and are more to my liking.

But really, most of the time one could not even tell if the heat was on. I made multiple attempts to talk with someone from Comfort Products about my issues with the cushion. I never once got a call back - you can never reach an actual live person to talk with, only ultimately a leave a message option.

The various vibration points seem to be effective, but the hand-held controller is not very user friendly: it's just clumsy the way the buttons are set up. The size of the entire cushion is a bit on the small size and it really does not reach the neck and misses key parts of the back. Finally, and worse of all, is the small heat pad surface (only about 6x10 in) with the unexpected and very disappointing feature that the heating is pressure activated. While I would expect that meant that one has to sit against the pad to draw some localized heat, I could never feel any heat coming from the pad (with the controller asking for heat).

The watch is very slim and light and it is sleek and attractive. It has a leather band that is very comfortable and just fits my big wrist with one hole to spare. The second time I wore it I noticed some moisture under the glass that dissipated. I am worried that this may need repair or replacement. It has never been under water so this is a concern.It is battery operated so I can put it down and wear it on special occasions without having it lose time.

This is not a watch you wear at just any occassion. It is far too elegant to wear casually. It is more of a piece of jewelry than a time piece. But it is a good watch, and it is nice to flash around with and wear with the right clothes and go to the right function. For being this type of watch it is at a good price here as other watches costs thousands more to do the same job. I also like the size cause I have a small wrist.

It has gone through the washer and dryer a couple of times with the only result being that the crystal comes out cleaner than ever.It is an elegant function and rugged watch and has lasted longer than any watch I've ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick, clean, quality.","review":"That basically sums it up right there. This watch is really slick; it looks very professional and so clean. The face is amazingly well designed with minimalism in mind. I really enjoy looking at this watch. Most people recognize the design too and for the price, it's basically unbeatable.One of the nicer factors is at the price; you get a sapphire crystal, which is very nice to have. Sapphire being the second hardest material known to man, it doesn't scratch very easily, so there's always a clean, scratch free face that you don't have to worry about.The one thing that people may miss is that at the price, it is quartz, otherwise it would cost significantly more. They did not bother with the incorporation of a faint ticking noise even, which I am very used to. I know it does not have a second hand, but most analog clocks at least have some tick in them. That was the only thing that bothers me on rare occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't this out on DVD?","review":"This is an excellent film - just the right mix of humor, fun, drama, and intensity.

There is quite a bit of adjustment to the strength and character of the thumps, but I found the effect neither therapeutic nor relaxing, just curious.I could get the kneading to cover the upper part of my neck or the lower part by turning the control knob, but for someone taller or shorter, the coverage would be limited. The speed control for the kneading doesn't really change the speed that much. The neck kneading nodes are made of rather hard plastic, and in my case they seemed too narrow apart (and there is no adjustment for width), so after just a few minutes it was more painful than relaxing.

I had hoped this would put my mind at ease but it gives constant false alarms about explosive gas and, sometimes, carbon monoxide. These false alarms made me worry so I bought a special, hand-held gas sensor to check every gas connection I could find and all fittings check out just fine. Don't know what to think at this point but I can't trust this sensor. This was a waste of $70. In the future I'm going with separate gas, carbon monoxide and smoke detectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I have the Night hawk carbon monoxide and combustible gas detector which is very sensitive to any fumes even any room spray will make it go off...but this first alert carbon monoxide and gas detector is garbage...it has not gone off like the kiddie night hawk when I tested both of them by spraying Lysol room deodorizer..and on top of that it will suck your back up battery even though it plugged in the ac wall outlet...first alert company is a waste of money...buy kiddie. Brand instead.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Worked; can't send it back.","review":"Bought it ahead of time as a gift, but upon finally giving it, it doesn't work. Testing it with a Bic Lighter or a propane stove, it doesn't go off. I even had my Propane supplier test it; nothing. I bought two others (different brand) and they both went off when tested with a Bic Lighter.If you do end up with one of these, or any brand for that matter, I strongly recommend you test it before your life and the life of your love ones depends on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works as advertised","review":"We live in a park model home that uses propane. We are always concerned about possible propane leaks and this product gives us some assurance that we have no leaks. The only problem we have is that the unit is quite heavy and doesn't stay in the electrical outlet all the way. The manufacturer should add a grounding plug to give it a bit more stability. I used some Velcro tape to solve the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I had a gas leak in my dryer inlet valve for months. Kept smelling gas. Had the detector right there so thought it must be dirty clothes or something. Finally it got really bad so called the repair guy. He found multiple small leaks in the natural line and valve. We couldn't explain why the detector didn't go off so tested it by turning the gas on full blast into the room to check it. I was extremely angered that it didn't alarm. So much for the safety of my family. I tossed it in the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I have purchased this item twice, replacing the first because I thought it was defective. On both occasions, I would get the short low battery chirp a few weeks after purchase.I called customer service and the gentleman informed me that I should use Eveready batteries exclusively! He made this sound like it was perfectly normal?! Unacceptable! Can't use Duracell? Forget about trying to use a rechargable battery to save money.I've sent the second unit back to Amazon. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll go broke replacing the batteries","review":"This is the worst $50 I've ever spent. I HATE this alarm. Although it's plugged into the wall, you also _have_ to install a 9 volt battery. Most devices that have a battery back up don't drain the battery while the unit is plugged in. Not this alarm! I probably go through 3-4 9 volt batteries each winter. And if the battery starts to lose it's charge, or you dare to leave the battery out, the alarm beeps every few minutes.Another important thing to note about this alarm... although it can detect carbon monoxide and natural gas, you're supposed to mount the device at different heights depending on the gas you're trying to detect. In other words, it doesn't really serve it's dual purpose.Although I've already lost the $50, I'll be buying a different alarm for this season. I can't take dealing with its battery problems anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of false alarms","review":"I have received a lot of false alarms with this product. The first time the carbon monoxide alarm went off, I had the fire department out here within minutes thinking we had a big problem. They found nothing in the house.

I've moved the placement of the monitor several times as per the instructions, but it still gives a lot of false alarms."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Alarms","review":"Placed the product on the wall (they recommend placing higher for the Natural Gas detection) and randomly about once a day mid-evening the alarm goes off.

It works, but that is about all I can say for it.Tuning the channels is very difficult. You have to be very nimble to turn the knob just right to get your channel. The reception, even with the antenna cord, is not that great.All that aside the worst part is once you actually get a channel, the speaker is so terrible you can barely hear the station.I would definitely say save your money if you want an actual functioning shower radio. For cuteness it certainly is, but that doesn't do anything for the functionality of the item.I have not had much luck with the \\"cheap\\" shower radios and will be purchasing a more expensive one in the future to see if it helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart TOB-155 Toaster Oven","review":"Works as advertised...

That is where the TOB-155 really shines. The convection oven cooks or re-heats very quickly (almost as fast as a microwave) but cooks all sides evenly and provides a more natural flavor and texture. The flat membrane control panel isn't the most user friendly, but the features are great. We use it almost every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid product.

The first bagel came out evenly toasted and I was hooked. I'm used to having toasted items come out well done on one end and under toasted on the other. Not with this beauty though. Everything is evenly toasted and I love it! 4 stars because I would like to have the front panel illuminated so I can see the buttons in low light (I like to sneak an english muffin at midnight and hate turning on the kitchen light...too bright). Otherwise a fantastic purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep your toaster! Great for baking and pizza!","review":"Great toaster oven for baking casseroles and pizzas, etc! Takes a little too long to make toast so I kept my toaster out but pizza comes out perfect and evenly baked... not soggy...nice and crispy. I have baked meatloaf, baked potatoes and french fries since I bought it. All came out perfect. Great alternative to using the big oven for just my hubby and me. Top of oven gets hot so I use a trivet on top but it is a great place to warm buns or rolls while you are cooking. Instructions seem backwards to me as far as oven shelf position. Did anyone else think the booklet was turned around? All in all, very happy with my purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"bought as a gift","review":"My pop loves it. He's 91 and doesn't do alot of oven cooking and needed something small, and he likes this.

Fortunately for everyone involved, my wife won't let me in there. So here's what she has to say. She absolutely loves this toaster oven and has used it to prepare many different food items. Her only negative is that she feels that Cuisinart should've included a toaster oven cook book of some favorite recipes. Consumer Reports rated other units higher but CR readers responded to CR and stated that CR was wrong. As a food services educated and experienced lady, the master of our kitchen agrees. All I know is that it gets hot and makes toast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricy","review":"To get five stars it must last ten years Or more. We will see.

Goes great in my motorhome and while it has plenty of space inside, it does not take up too much room on the counter. It reaches the correct temperature quickly and the cook time is right on the nose. I especially like the 3 year warranty! However, I am assuming that I will not be needing it, as the product is high quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giant Little Oven","review":"Recently our toaster went bad after 8 years of heavy duty. So we were shopping for a quality one. We found many, but we really like the idea of toaster oven; my kids do not like microwave heated food. So we use our main oven even for small items like five chicken nuggets. We looked around for a convincing product. We read about Cuisinart TOB-155 and we decided to give it a shot. We purchased it and we found it wide with great design and we love the multifunction display. However, the oven not well insulated immediately at the handle, as many commented, it gets really hot and not suitable for kids to use it. So we bought a separate advanced KitchenAid toaster. We kept the toaster oven (TOB-155)and we are really happy with it. Now we can only use our main oven for big stuff. I hope that Cuisinart admends the product by putting more insulation for children safety. Other than that, it is well designed and well priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best toaster oven!","review":"Over the years I have had three toaster ovens. By far, this one is the best.The instructions say to put 1/4 cup water in the broiler pan when broiling, to help with splatter, and it works. I have used the broiler and baked in the oven, I haven't used the toast feature. The size is just right, the controls are touch, which I really like, the black and stainless finish looks very nice, and the rack and broiler pan are very heavy duty. The only way it could be better, if it was a \\"cool to the touch\\" oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice....","review":"The toaster heats up quickly and seems to maintain the right temp without it going on and off frequently. The controls are easy to understand. The clock is useless if like us we store the toaster in a cabinet. Don't need more clutter on the counter. Could use a little longer cord. We enjoy not having to heat our oven for a few rolls or a sandwich or two. All in all we are very satisifed with the toaster oven. And besides, the price was right !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish and functional","review":"The Cuisinart TOB-155 is both stylish and functional. It is also relatively compact in size when compared to other high-end toaster ovens. In particular, it cooks and toasts evenly--no more half burned and half raw toast! My only complaints are (1) it takes a long time to heat up, so that bread can require 5 minutes to toast, and (2) the glass door around the handle gets very hot and can burn if you're not careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toaster! Except major flaw","review":"This is a FANTASTIC toaster - best I've ever owned - except one simple design flaw. My old toaster had some sort of a guard lining the top of the door above the handle so when you pull it open, it wasn't super hot on the top of the door. This one has burned my husband, myself and my Mother in Law the first time each of us used it. Now we watch out for it, but the way you pull the handle invites you to burn yourself. HOWEVER, besides that 1 flaw, this is the best toaster I've ever owned!! Heats both sides, digital counts down until done silently, easy to clean with a pull out from the back that allows you to take the \\"bottom\\" and clean it in the sink AND can cook a 12 inch pizza in it perfectly - no need to warm the entire oven anymore! I'd still TOTALLy recommend it, but gave it 2 stars cause of burned knuckles. One more burn today. Might have to turn it. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"so far, so good","review":"I have had this product for about a month or so and so far I am completely satisfied. I especially like the feature that shows how long it will take to toast. This is very convenient when cooking something that will go with the toast, such as eggs.The only complaint that I have is that the broiler pan that is supplied is the only one that will fit, which means I can't use any that I already have. This is a very minor thing, it just means that I may have to wash the broiler pan by hand if I need it. Primitive but doable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so far, so good","review":"We have found recently that the average lifespan of a toaster oven is about 2 years. Our last one not only lasted barely two years, but it took a rocket scientist to understand and explain the various settings.

At one month of age, it is working very well and we are hopeful that it will continue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coating on pans peeled off !","review":"I never even got a chance to try the oven.As soon as I unpacked the unit I noticed the coating on the baking pan was peeling off.Why they coat or paint the pans to begin with I don't know.Anyway back in the box it went and by the way Cuisinarts customer service line was a waste of time,no help whatsoever and rude.I hope you have better luck with yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard! Beware!","review":"When the timer goes off, the oven does NOT shut off! If you are forgetful, it could be four hours before this unit shuts itself off.

Major consumer testing agency fails to note this safety flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is HUGE!","review":"I am sure this is a great oven. It is not, however, a great TOASTER oven. It is the size of a microwave! Unless you have a restaurant sized kitchen, I can't imagine wanting a toaster oven this large. Might be great for someone who lives alone, has lots of counter space, and wants to use it for all their cooking instead of a full-sized oven. But for us, it was just way, way too big for the space we have available. Aside from that, maybe it's great, but we will never know because we simply don't have room for it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible user interface.","review":"The buttons on the front of this toaster oven are very difficult to use. If you want to purchase, open the box, and start using it - don't buy this product. Each different function requires an exact sequence of buttons to press, and they are not organized in any helpful order. For example, certain buttons only work with Bake mode, others only with Toaster mode. The timer buttons are next to Start/Stop. But if you press Start/Stop - it won't change the timer. Instead it stops the baking/toasting and you have to start all over with the secret code of buttons again.As an engineer/designer, I would never let this product out of design phase. The first model would not have been built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Toaster oven ever!!!","review":"I have had maybe a half dozen toaster ovens in my lifetime, and this Cuisinart is by far the best one I have ever had. Not only does it look great, it is large enough to cook even small meals, and a pizza like they said, but it is easy both easy to use, and clean as well.The one problem I had with the toast just browning in stripes over the heat elements, was an easy fix. Just turn your oven rack upside down so the toast is higher and away from the elements and...nice even browning."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite appliance","review":"I purchased this toaster oven in January of 2011 and really love it. It's perfect for cooking for 1 or 2. My electric bill runs lower than when I used my full size oven. Just big enough for baked chicken and potatoes for two.

I use my oven almost every day and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toaster oven!","review":"The oven was smaller than I expected, which was good. It takes up very little space.

The beep indication may be confusing at first since the unit beeps first when the pre-heating temperature is reached. Then it will beep again continuously when the timer expires.I haven't used it enough to write a better review, but it certainly works. The bottom \\"crumb\\" tray does have to be removed from the back, which is a pain compared to models that offer the ability to remove the bottom \\"crumb\\" tray from the front. Just be aware that if the unit is up against the wall, you'll have to move it everytime you need to remove the crumb tray for cleaning.Other than that, it seems like an excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"We purchased the Cuisinart Toaster oven and have loved it from the start.

I love the digital buttons, settings are quick and clean-up is simple.Only negative I found is you can burn yourself easily if your not careful, (I did it twice) the outside get's very hot and I have learned to use a oven mitt when opening the oven door."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow toast, but nice oven","review":"It takes about 5 minutes for it to toast bread, but the toast is fine. For me that is not a problem because the rest of breakfast takes about 5 minutes too. As a oven and a broiler I love it. It heats up much quicker than my big oven, it seems to heat evenly and broils just fine. No longer do I use a big oven to make 4 pieces of garlic bread! It isn't the easiest to clean and the oven shelf does not pop out when you open the door so if that's important look elsewhere. It operates like a full sized oven and you just pull the shelf out. And like a real oven you will need hand protection. On the up side of having a door like that, you can pull the shelf out far enough to stir food or rearrange food that is cooking. I've had it a couple of months and I love it. The controls are easy to master, I like the sound level of the timer, I like the solid build of it. I have high hopes of keeping it around for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toaster oven I've owned","review":"I have owned several toaster ovens in the past, and this one is my favorite by far. I have owned it for a few years now, use it every day, and it still works great. It toasts in a reasonable amount of time and bakes and broils effectively. The only thing I don't like about it is that it does not turn itself off when the timer is set -- it just beeps and beeps and beeps until I turn it off. Other than that, I really like it.

However, there are far too many amazing character traits for my liking. I want to avoid spoilers, but a main character with a photographic memory, a missing wife and a penchant for psychics; car crashes as plot devices; and a few too many devious characters - all pile up to become over-whelming towards the end of the book.

Unfortunately it is poorly designed: during the first couple uses, the tower several times collapsed unexpectedly, but for a while now it has been stuck in the 'up' position which means the cover can't be used and the crayons can't be stored easily. My \\"child\\" is 17, an artist, and has struggled to operate this tower (as I have), so I can't imagine young children would be able to use it without a clever adult's help. Also, the cover is of very flimsy plastic rather than the rigid plastic I expected, and it just sits over the collapsed tower rather than attaching to the base. I would not buy this product again unless Crayola took it back to the drawing board and fixed its design flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this","review":"Crayola tower of crayons is the biggest selection of colors.

When I started P90X a couple of months ago, though, it became apparent to me that some of the cardio and pull-up exercises could cause my ankle to roll. After doing some research, I decided to give this product a try and I love it. While I am still careful, I no longer fear jumping, running, or making lateral cuts and have been able to do the full range of exercises in the P90X videos.I read that others felt a break-in period was necessary and I heeded their advice.

This is the most comforable of the highly effective braces I know of. There are others that are much more comfortable, but much less effective. This one prevents the unnatural side to side bending of the ankle, but doesn't limit the up and down flexing that you need for jumping.You don't have to strap them on very tight! They're not ice skates, they don't need to be tight to prevent injury. I've had the white ones before and they get a bit dingy over time, but these cool black ones always look good.In case it isn't clear, there is only one brace in the package.

As many have said the grammar and editing is a nightmare. At the beginning of the book I thought that the man was a secondary character. You know the type, the stupid sidekick. Oh wait, the idiot is the hero??? You have got to be kidding me. Then there was the ducks. Just because a women says ducks at the end of every sentence it does not mean that she is using a cockney accent. Overall the dialogue seemed very contrived. It seemed like the author was desperately trying to sound \\"English\\". So instead of the characters sounding normal they sound stilted and rather stupid.

Throughout the story, this young lady hides her innocence and has learnt well from the Madam of the bawdy house how to be business like and keep her dreams alive. It's great to read a good story without the bedding taking place first, and a lack of coarse language to relay the story.

Unfortunately, I found myself skimming in an attempt to get the story to move a bit faster, found the dialogue strained, and it took half the book for me to even care in the slightest about the male love interest.An even worse offense was the formatting. There were absolutely no paragraphs at all, which makes for very tiresome reading. Additionally, the book was filled with multiple typographical errors, so many that I actually had to stop the flow of reading on several occasions in an attempt to figure out what word was really supposed to appear in the book. A little proofreading would have solved this nicely.Unfortunately, I doubt very much if I will ever read another Kindle offering from this author.

It got to me in decent time and when I opened it it looked as offered. The chain itself is cheap but because of reading the reviews I was ready for that and ordered a different chain along with it. I am glad I did because the clasp to the original chain is so stiff and nearly impossible to open. With the new chain it looked wonderful but by the end of the first day most of the green had flaked off of the pentacle. I really wanted to keep that extra pop of color on it and thought that it might stand up to at least a couple months of wear before it started flaking instead of a day.

When I sent the company an email with my issues it took them a couple days to get back to me, actually after a week I sent the email again and then they finally got back to me. As much as I liked the design of it, I picked it because of the added color.

As he begins his downward spiral they all turn against him, except his supposedly low-life friends at his favorite gay bar.The film is very well made and very well acted. It is not about gay vs. straight, or upper class vs. lower class, or any group vs. any other group. Rather It is about the corrupting and often toxic allure of money. As such it is a very powerful work, but distinctly painful to watch. I don't mind sad or even tragic movies, but depressing movies I can do without."},{"rating":"2","title":"elton at his best","review":"this album is both refreshing and inspiring. it may disappoint those wanting a more rock oriented elton album, but it is edgy, soulful and gospel oriented with signature elton piano melodies and great background vocals by the band and atlanta choir. i love the first single, \\"answer in the sky\\" but there are many deserving tracks that need to be heard. the country oriented \\"turn the lights out when you leave\\" and great mid-tempo ballads \\"i stop and i breathe\\", \\"it's getting dark in here\\", \\" the weight of the world\\", \\"all that i'm allowed\\".it's hard to leave any out, no clunkers on the whole album. one fun concert song will be \\"they call her the cat\\". this album gets better every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album since made in england","review":"I like elton john when he dips into all different styles of music and he does that very well on this album. Taupin's lyrics are incredible, almost as if elton were talking. I don't think the single should be track 3, i think the single is track 8, \\"All that I'm allowed\\". I thought track 3 \\"Answer in the sky\\" is actually one of my least favorites. Track 1 is great, track 2 is good, track 3 not so good. track 4 is boring but well done. track 5 is fantastic and unique. track 6 is could be better. track so is ok. track 8 is and excellent song. And the rest of the album sounds alike. All in all it is much much better than west coast and big pic and probably as good or maybe even a little better then made in england but a little short of the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back Buckmaster","review":"I think it's more than a coincidence that most of Elton's best albums are the ones where Paul Buckmaster is in charge of the arrangements.

A real letdown after the excellent \\"Songs From The West Coast.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SACD","review":"There are lots of reviews of the album, I think it is great. What I like best is the SACD use, it is full multi-channel, the best use of 5.1 of any of the Elton John SACD titles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Peach Pit Trail","review":"One thing about Elton John you can always count on. He always does the opposite of what he says. Years ago it was \\"I'm Retiring from the Stage\\" then later \\"Songs from the West Coast will be my last, I have done enough albums\\". He should have stuck with THAT promise. \\"Peachtree Road\\" just never gets off the ground. Listening to this album is like being on an Air liner and Taxi-ing the whole trip. There just isn't ANYTHING fun or interesting in this collection of Slush from the Playing to the melodies and yes again it IS Overproduction that ruins it along with the Slower than Snail's Pace. \\"My Elusive Drug\\", \\"Weight of The World\\" and the rest are Dreary reminders that Elton hasn't made a Great Album since \\"The One\\". His voice this time around permanently etched in sound is sounding like it has Permanent Damage now too. Maybe it's a good thing to release this now. If this had been his first album released he would never have gotten a second chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans can never be objective...","review":"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...you won't find anything bad on this CD, but the problem is there isn't anything memorable either.

Sure, not every song makes the grade, but nearly all do. It won't overwhelm you, but that's the beauty of it. There are your outstanding cuts like \\"Weight of the World\\", and duds like \\"All That I'm Allowed\\". The latter cut puzzles me - what on earth made this eligble for a single ahead of at least a half-dozen other tracks? After all this time, the one track that amazes me is \\"It's Getting Dark In Here\\". Upon first hearing, it made little impact, but it sure grows on you. The soulfullness of the entire CD eventually breaks through if not spectacularly, certainly satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im a new fan so maybe im wrong","review":"I have only been a fan of Elton John for about a year or so and i only have Goodbye Yellowbrick Road and Dont shoot me I am only the piano player. Which in both i am very pleased. This album is a little awkward to me in Elton's position for it seems he switches a revolution of music genres to country. It is based on a place in Georgia which I am from, but it's odd how he captures the southern comfort. Im not a big fan of country but his is bittersweet something you can listen to. All in all the album is very good the opener is a good resolution song and Porch swing in Tupelo is just odd but in a good way. After they call her the cat the songs are just mediocore, but I mean after 40+ albums I am not exactly dissapointed.Highlights: Weight of the world, Porch Swing in Tupelo, Too many tears, they call her the cat"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ishtar of 2004","review":"Elton John's \\"Peachtree Road\\" has become the Ishtar of 2004, FLOPPING DISASTROUSLY in every corner of the world.

Elton is now speaking with his crisis management team to find out how can he recover from this flop. He can't!

Now, he's re-released it in a desperate attempt to get the sales he badly needs. Um, sorry, it flopped before and it will flop again! Who came up with the bright idea of re-issuing a flop album, anyway? More important, who's still interested in Elton John? It's 2005 not 1975 and in this day in age, Beyonce, Justin, Ciara, 50 Cent, Britney, and Ashlee are what people are listening to now. Plus, nobody wants to buy music from a crusty old man who said nasty things about George Michael and Madonna. I guarantee you that this album will TANK again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ELTON WE WANT TO LISTEN TO","review":"I must confess that I didn't listen to \\"Songs from the West Coast\\", because I prefer the 70's Elton than the late 90's one; but when I had the \\"Peachtree\\" album in my hands into the record shop, something took me right to buy it without listening it before. I wasn't wrong, the album is excellent, but it's not one of his best obviously. I think the main problem is about his voice. It reveals age and tireness, but we have to make clear that we are talking about a 2004 record and a 57 year old man that doesn't want his career to be finished!!! So buy it...you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"43 At 57?","review":"43 Albums at age 57 alone impresses the heck out of me!How a solo artist with almost 40 years of writing under his belt, can still have the creativity that \\"Peachtree Road\\" offers. By now I would expect to hear material as awful as \\"A Single Man\\", or \\"Leather Jackets\\".But \\"Peachtree Road\\" could have found itself a comfortable slot around the time of \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\", and the \\"Madman Across The Water\\" Albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I have been a fan for over thirty years. What happened? Whereare the infectious melodies,insightful lyrics (the lyrics are so bad, we don't get them written in the liner notes as usual)and piano licks. I can believe these songs took nine days to write. They all sound like the same song. What these songs needed was a real producer. Elton is a great talent, but like many other artists collaboration is the key. Hopefully, he will get back to what made him Captain Fantastic in the first place - Piano, Bass and Drums"},{"rating":"1","title":"Peachtree Road...Trash!","review":"First, let me say that I am huge fan of Elton John but I am also an honest, unbiased fan. With that said \\"Peachtree Road\\" is absolute trash. I was very disappointed with the 1rst release \\"Answer in The Sky\\" and was even more disappointed with my purchase. In an interview Elton said he was very happy with the results of the recording and even mentioned that his voice is better than ever on this recording...really?. I have all of Eltons recordings and have been to countless Elton concerts. Based on that I know that EJ is much more capable than what is demonstrated on this Half Assed effort that he calls \\"Peachtree Road\\". In a nut shell this collection is poor, boring and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has been reissued with bonus tracks","review":"Peachtree Road has been reissued with three bonus tracks.

I tried, lord knows I have, to give this album a chance but there isn't even one song that redeems this collection of sorry tunes. Next to the \\"Cat\\" song, the most horrible songs on the album are the two singles, \\"All that I'm Allowed\\" and \\"Answer in the Sky\\". I'm a huge Elton fan and have purchased every cd/album/single he's released, so after I spent my money on this trite collection, I feel I have the right to say \\"STOP MAKING MUSIC, IT ISN'T IN YOU ANYMORE!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sound makes me warm and fuzzy...","review":"A new album of ballads from Elton John? This is too good to be true. This new album from Elton John is a continuation of the great songwriting from his previous album \\"Songs from the West Coast\\". The lyrics are very reflective and mature and his singing is very emotional and heartfelt. Not every song on this album feels like a classic to me yet, but perhaps with more listenings, it will get better. For now, there are 5 standout songs that are \\"single\\" quality, although the rest are still better than, say, EJ's mid-80's output.The sound is very similar to the SACDs of his older albums, which I've started to review. The sound is a little richer, as you would expect, but a little more diffused. I think the older albums had a more distinct tone for each instrument whereas on this album there's more of a blend.I am thrilled that this was a day and date new release on SACD, and someone in the Elton John camp is clearly a fan of SACD, and that's great for SACD fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elton Yawn","review":"Songs From The West Coast was excellent.This one isn't.Maybe he tried too hard this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"We could've lost this one!","review":"So, you thought that the US really kicked butt during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm?

Until reading this book, I never knew -- and thank goodness, neither (apparently) did Saddam Hussein or his cronies know -- how tenuous the early US military presence in Saudi Arabia was.

However, Crane's novel is a moving piece with momentsof transcendence and rampant dark humor.Basically, it is the story of Maggie, an undeveloped character who takes the back-seat to her loud and abusive parents, her swaggering, self-confident brother Jimmie and his friend, the boastful Pete.The novel chronicles the injustices that surround Maggie, who is quiet and doesn't fight back. A chilling look at poor, urban life in the late 1800's, it is also a tale critical of society's judgmentality and questioning of morality. A more complex novel than it seems on first look, it is wonderful to take apart and examine the relationship between Maggie and Pete, Maggie and her mother, and Maggie and Jimmie.Most importantly, however, are the quiet moments of transcendence in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book wasnt very pleasurable","review":"I didn't like it, sad sad sad!

Now that I got my rant out of the way, let's review the album, shall we?I bought this not too long after it came out, which was when the band was playing Ozzfest around July. The vocals are amazing, ranging in both high and low pitches, and the blastbeats, too addicting. (too bad Zach was forced to leave the band...) \\"A Vulgar Picture\\", the first song I heard off this album, is more of a speedy song compared to many of the band's songs off \\"Unhallowed\\". Every song is amazing, including closer track \\"Miasma\\", which steers into the mode of bands like Dissection. Highly recommended for something original.

The villian was introduced late in the game and was a bit underdeveloped. A plot thread that was introduced at the last few pages would have made a better book that the plot Gardner presented. I did find it interesting that the story was tied to the Persian Gulf War. It was neat to learn what Bond was up to at that time. Gardner has done better with OO7.

It sits very far from the mower body so some grass comes flying out of the back. It also means all of the grass must be removed by hand, not too bad... especially coming from raking everything.Purchasing this bag requires either:1) You have the exact mower body this works with.or2) An engineer friend who can jerryrig this thing to you mower.Good luck...."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY, BAD...BAD...BAD....BAD","review":"Worst grass catcher manufacturer. BAD product design,bad company.I bought the grass catcher for my sears lawn mower and did not fit, even thu they stated it fits most mowers. then I returned the item thru fedEX and it was shipped and received and received confirmation that it was delivered. however a couple of weeks later, they stated the item was not received and they do not want to credit my account $40.90."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"This bagger was not at all correct; the only part that worked was the frame to attach to the mower, there was absolutely no frame work with it so is just dragged against the ground!! I tried on several occasions to reach the customer service line and could not get through. The time frame past on return so I just threw it away. DO NOT BUY THIS; it was cheaper to go buy a new mower with a new bagger!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as intended","review":"After purchasing this product as recommended by the MTD manufacturer's website we discovered first that none of the accompanying hardware was included in the packaging. After having located and acquiring the hardware at a local lawn mower repair shop, we determined the grass catcher could not be mounted on the lawn mower the manner is which the directions indicated. I had to take the lawn mower, grass catcher and hardware back to the local lawn mower repair shop who recommended mounting the hardware a completely different way than the instructions, which included having to drill new holes in the lawn mower deck. A really poor product, with a set of instructions that were totally off base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!!!!","review":"I had been very satisfied with my mower since I purchased it about two years ago. The only thing I didn't appreciate was when I waited too long to mow the grass I would always have to rake up the excess grass that didn't spread across the lawn evenly. I thought this product was going to be the solution . . . turns out I was very wrong. The product is way too difficult to attach to your lawn mower. The directions are vague at best and confusing. Even after I got it on, the bag would only fill up about half way and this occured in seconds. Now you have to take the bag off, empty it, and go through the hassle of getting it back on. I honestly only used it once for about 5 minutes and decided it was not worth my time. My advice is do not waste your money, spend the extra couple minutes raking the grass or just buy a mower with a built on attachment. Hopefully this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For My Needs","review":"Putting it together was simple, just follow the included instructions, it catches all the grass debris, good product and my lawns looks great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This bag is very easy to assemble and attaches to the lawnmower quickly.

The best advice would be to go buy a new mower that has a bag attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"As someone who reads a lot of mysteries, I'm used to suspending belief somewhat for the sake of the story. However, this book is so ridiculous and far-fetched, it's an insult to the reader. The series just keeps getting worse. Angie is very hard to relate to. How many of us have no jobs but can afford designer clothes and Ferarri Testarossas? Her bubble-headedness is supposed to be endearing, I'm sure; it just ends up being annoying. How long is this relationship between Angie and Paavo going to go nowhere? The charcters are not likable, and the plot is absolutely absurd.

Nothing worked. Tried again after an hour. Still nothing. Forced to conclude that the DS Lite charger is, in fact, defective.As for the product itself: the unit feels very hollow and light, and not in a good way.

I have no idea why. It seems like the connection is loose to the DS. If you wiggle it, the charge will take for a moment and then it doesn't take anymore. I have tried this on two DS lite systems and the same results in both, so I don't think it is the nintendo gaming console that's the problem.So I just ordered the nintendo-brand charger today.

A Disaster!","review":"I truly enjoy Bonnie Raitt, but I found only 3 of her live songs remarkable. She is a great joy to listen to in concert, but the ballads on this CD were played at unnaturally slow tempos. I do not exaggerate when I say it feels like five minutes have passed after hearing her sing one mournful word. The renditions of her songs are excessively dramatic; the songs sound as warped as though someone tampered with the recording and played it in sadistic slow mo. She is accompanied by equally renowned artists but the instruments drown out her small voice. Considering the retail price, I'm still uncertain whether that is a blessing or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live double album","review":"The way to hear an artist like Bonnie Raitt perform, is live, and if you can't see her perform live, then this album is the next best thing. Joined by a host of well known talent, including Bryan Adams and Jackson Browne, this is one of the best live albums I have. This is blues/rock at it's best. And the 16 page booklet is packed with photos of her live performance, including all the guest musicians and band. This is an album that any fan of Bonnie Raitt should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome versions of many great B.R. songs!","review":"Her version of, \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\", on this album gives me goose bumps. You can really hear the passion in her voice. Bruce Hornsby, Jackson Browne, Brian Adams, and others join her for some great songs. This is one album that stays in the car, always! The quality of the sound is great too. I happen to like live albums - they make you feel like you're there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackson Browne fans, take note!","review":"I purchased this CD after a fan at a Jackson Browne concert told me that the duet Bonnie recorded with Jackson Browne called \\"My Opening Farewell\\" was worth the price of the album.

The plot is obviously written by a self loathing writer who surrounds himself in darkness. Not one of his sordid tales has a glimmer of happiness. The acting is shady at best. Moral of the story seems to be gay men can't be happy and the world is dark.

At first I did not understand all the negative and mediocre reviews it got. When I reread them I noticed two things: Many of those reviews complained that it was too much like a filmed play and that so much dialog was hard to keep up with; and many of those same reviews contained numerous spelling and punctuation errors. Those two observations suggest that some of the people who do not like this movie may have trouble with the English language and would probably be happier watching an action movie or a physical comedy than a dialog-heavy character study like this.So I am writing this in case anyone who prefers character to action is considering watching Nine Lives: you may like it very much more than most of the reviews here would lead you to expect. I certainly did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"I didn't expect this movie to be anything more than a mediocre independent film at best and I actually rented it by accident. I was pleasantly surprised however that it delivered layered storytelling, good acting (for the most part), and a very good cinematic experience altogether. The movie's filming and editing was very professional as well. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring film that fails to make its point","review":"I wanted to like this film, with all the comparisons to Six Feet Under, Six Degrees of Separation, etc. Instead, what I got was a bunch of boring vignettes about boring people. The inter-relation between them seems forced as a plotline, and failed to really make any point. Most of the characters were quite unlikeable too, and you fail to connect with any of them enough to really care what they are going through. It does somewhat have a documentary feel, but a very boring one nevertheless. I struggled to even finish the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nomads Scratch Themselves","review":"Julbo makes some great products, some of which I also own, but the Nomad isn't one of them. In this case, Julbo's engineers designed sunglasses which actually scratch themselves, a flaw which is utterly inexcusable.When the temples are folded inward, as we always do when we put them in the case or our pockets, the temple tips make contact with the inside of the lenses, and as they move slightly up and down, you soon have a line of vertical scratches on the inside of both lenses.This design flaw aside, the Zebra lens is probably the most scratch prone lens that I have ever used.A terrible product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas much appreciated!","review":"Easy to install!

Though a devotee of Victorian ghost stories and novellas, this collection is one of the bottom of the victorian barrel as to horror & tales of terror. Some authors become unknown shortly after their demise, this is not necessarily a bad thing. For many especially during the 19th century were vailant authors that wrote to scratch out a living, but who for the most part were uninspired by the gothick muse. Many of the tales in this collection are of a melodramatic \\"penny dreadful\\" quality from that era. A memorable tale of terror should grab the reader within a few pages and hold them until the last word. Again, many of these stories made me feel like required college reading of minor Victorian authors. My conclusion...let these dead authors rest in peace, unless your are a student of 19th century literary minutiae."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not sure if any hand cream is ...","review":"I'm not sure if any hand cream is worth the price of this product.

I was under the impression that the instrumentals included on the cd were extended versions of past efforts, but I was mistaken. The instrumentals were just taken from their respective cds and plopped all on one disc. If you're reading this review, you're on the internet, and I'm sure that you have a cd burner.

What's so great about these guys is that they aren't afraid to experiment, and many of their albums are a combination of not only hip hop and punk, but instrumentals - the ones you'll hear on this album.My all-time favorite is the lounge hall sounding \\"Ricky's Theme\\". It has to be the most chilled out relaxing beat I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. Oh, on another note - this album does not include the instrumentals from 1998's Hello Nasty album.

I returned both DVD sets back to Amazon since season 4 would be useless without seasons 1-3.I have found in the past that usually if a series is glitchy and you get a second one to replace it right away, the next set is usually also glitchy.

Personally, I'd say get Heaven & Back if you want to complete your collection. Ideally, you could give it a listen first before you decide to purchase. I have tried hard to get into this but I have been unable to enjoy it as much as their other recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love It","review":"This is probably my favourite Call album, although they're all pretty good.

Low and behold abou the 5th time we used it, it stopped working for no apparent reason! The wife talked to her friend and discovered that she too had problems with the applicance. Needless to say, Don't buy this you're better off buyng a cheap $15 one that lasts forever.

Tracks here that hold their own are the catchy \\"Like A Girl\\" (Alex Lifeson of Rush guest guitarist), the sedate \\"Three Days Old\\", the somewhat trippy \\"Shortcut To Moncton\\", \\"Pisser\\" and \\"Songburst & Delirium\\". Line-up: Edwin-vocals, Jagori Tanna-guitar & backing vocals, Bruce Gordon-bass and Christian Tanna-drums. Now I need to check out their remaining CD's that I've barely heard of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good...","review":"Londonbeat's albums were good for 2 or 3 nice songs, surrounded by a lot of unoffensive filler. Sadly, they forgot the good songs on this one. For those just starting out, go with their greatest hits, then dig further if you find yourself wanting more.

This was an easy read and almost impossible to put down"},{"rating":"2","title":"Myron Is A Fun Guy And Gets The Job Done","review":"I've read Coben's three newest novels and liked them very much. So I decided to try his Myron Bolitar detective series. The first thing that struck me about Darkest Fear was the humor. Myron is a funny, wisecracking guy and he is immediately likable, as are the people he works with. In this outing, Myron hears from an old sweetheart who needs his help finding the bone marrow donor for her son who has inexplicably disappeared. This is just the tip of the iceberg. As the story unfolds, there are many twists and turns, each with a satisfying resolution. I look forward to more stories in this series. A very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Continuation of the Series","review":"First of all, I strongly suggest reading the Myron Bolitar series in order.I like Coben's stand-alone books better than the Myron Bolitar series, and I think the Bolitar series is very good - they appear to be more of Coben's alter ego with the wisecracks, who really drinks Yoo-Hoo, the former female wrestlers, etc. This book is what we have come to expect from Harlan Coben - a mystery that wrenches in your guts, the good guys unfortunately dies, and just when you think you have the whole thing figured out he cuts a hard left that rolls you over into a new direction. Coben is one of those authors who snares you pretty fast and has you thinking about the book even while you're not reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PRETTY GOOD READ","review":"This was as expected. A pretty good read for those of us who like these types of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the humor and twists","review":"Another good book by Harlan Coben.

He definitely keeps you guessing in this page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paramount ending","review":"Albeit the book digress of the main plot once and again it'll keep you interested in the story.

Read this book in 3 days and looking forward to reading more of Myron Bolitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing to fear in Coben's latest","review":"Again and again Coben seems to come up with an even better book than his last. Darkest Fear is no exception. Myron, Win, and the rest of the gang are all back, in a somewhat darker and more serious novel than previous entries in the series. Of course, the trademark Myron humor is still present though, striking a good balance between laughing one second, and being scared the next. Darkest Fear has the fast pace, numerous plot twists, and great characterization that Cobens fans have come to expect. Original, sophisticated,and hitting on many emotional levels, Darkest Fear shouldn't be missed by old and new fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"darkest fear reviewed","review":"The characters were fascinating.

With all the humor and toughness of Win, Esperanza, Big Cindy and the other Bolitar crazy characters, this book gets a bit more personal into Myron Bolitar's personal life. Ya can't help but love this character and the series. Fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Well, it happened again - another I couldn't put it down until I finished it book from Harlan Coben. This series is excellent. Myron Bolitar is quite a character. Win, Esperanza, Big Cyndi - all our extremely interesting people. Read all of these. It helps if you start with the first one and then follow through with the others. I recommend that for all series if you can find them. Again, what a bummer, now I have to wait a whole year for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing style","review":"If you like constant lame attempts at humor and clever similes just for the sake of showing off, then this author is for you.

What a stunning disappointment! I can't believe Coben wrote this. It has none of his plot twists, suspense, tension, characterization. Instead, Coben has given us sophomoric humor, a juvenile writing style, a plot that threatens to fall of its own weight before it unwinds, and a hugely forgettable lead character.

Then we get three pages raving about how good this book is- AND IT ISN'T! The cover informs us that the author has won the Edgar Award... well, you can bet it wasn't for this meandering plot. The book reads as if it is written for fans who already know and sympathize with the hero - but I didn't and I don't. This is sloppy writing. It takes way too long to get into the meat of the story and when you do, it is confusing and you don't give a hoot about any of the characters. In fact, I was wishing that the killer - who is almost absent in the book - would kill off the entire cast. Harlan Coben entertains himself, not the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, Not Great","review":"After hearing so much about Harlan Coben in the AOL forums I decided to try him.

Her discussion of objects showing how characters evolved as well as showing examples of each character adds a depth that can't be found in most books about language. In fact this book is more about culture than language although both are covered in detail. For example her discussion of the character for the word \\"Well\\" is interesting and it would be hard for the reader to not be able to remember this character quite clearly forever.My only complaint is that she doesn't provide any pinyin to help the reader pronounce the characters discussed. To learn how to pronounce the characters the reader has to go to a character dictionary and look them up by stroke count. That quibble aside, this is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good context","review":"Learned a great deal about chinese characters from this book. i would recommend it for anyone that wants to know the origins of certain characters. not really as helpful to teach the characters, but still a great read for students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts you in a good mood","review":"An energetic album.

At several points in his rule, if Nicholas had changed his methods, Imperial Russia may have survived and evolved into something like Great Britain. However, Nicholas made many mistakes and as a result lost both his life and that of his family. What the author does is state what Nicholas could have done in several instances and what was the likely outcome. In fact, before the beginning of WWI, the Menosheviks, Bolsheviks, and SRs were battling among themselves and were not credible as an opponent. However, Nicholas made stupid decisions (or let his wife make them) and this resulted in an autocracy that was no longer a ruling force for most Russians.This is a nice read about why Imperial Russia crashed and burned. Inept leadership was the factor that gave power to the Communists. Nicholas may have been a decent guy, but he was a horrible emperor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!!","review":"This album was a DUD!!!!

Great price, exceptional product!","review":"I'm not usually one to wax effusive over something for the lawn, as I'm just not into yardwork. But I was so impressed with these hose guides that I felt compelled to say something!They're extremely sturdy; the \\"spike\\" part, made of black plastic, is about 9\\" long, and strong enough to be pounded into relatively hard soil. The rounded \\"pivot\\" part, made of green plastic, rotates around the spike, so your hose won't experience any wear. It's in two parts -- an upper part and a lower part, which move independently -- another nice touch. Some thought went into these, and the quality shows.They look like they should cost several times the Amazon price.

As other reviewers have said, this is suitable for a first-time graduate student, and elementary calculus is just not enough. While there are a good bit of examples some of them I find, make no sense and have little to back up how he got the answers. They of course make no sense to me because there was no good explanation, just utterly confusing notations, and large numbers. While this book does cover much important topics in probability theory, what is the point of it all if nobody understands it. This book in short assumes too much, and should take the time to do more explanation rather than calculation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Probability Textbook I have ever seen","review":"I am a mathematics and statistics double major and this is by far the worst and most confusing textbook I have ever used in my whole career. There is an excessive amount of example problems and the way the textbook solves the problems is highly confusing. It doesn't fully explain how they got the answer, but just states it. It is confusing, long, boring, and unhelpful. If you are looking for a good probability book, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, appropriate for senior undergraduates or early graduate students.","review":"The book covers pretty much all the main topics in probability, at the end of every chapter there are 3 kinds of exercises: problems, theorical exercises and self test problems, at the end of the book it contains the answers to the problems and self-test exercises(just answers no procedures), it might be a good tool for students to check with the answer when finishing the exercises.The book requires a good foundation and background in calculus, so it may be an appropriate textbook for senior undergraduates or early graduate students."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the best guarantee that you will hate Statistics that money can buy.","review":"I would say that this book is poorly written, except that saying that it was written at all gives it too much credit. Almost no writing was done for this book; it's more accurate to say that the book was \\"compiled\\" out of a stack of example problems.The author seems to have taken the idea that, \\"Students don't ever really read textbooks\\" to heart and crafted a book that simply cannot be read. The best you can do is browse through it, looking for examples that match what you're trying to do and studying them. His sample solutions are detailed, but they make little attempt to teach the intuition behind why certain steps are chosen. Nor can that intuition be learned from the main text of the chapter, as there is wretchedly little of it.A horrible book; bad even by the low standards that math textbooks are generally held to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could there be too many examples?","review":"Maybe I'm too used to the theorem-proof structure of other mathematics textbooks. This one leaves me cold: too little is made of the exposition, while the author leans too much on the copious amounts of examples as a crutch. The examples, alas, aren't terribly good; the author pulls ideas from god only knows where, without explanation, often stopping me short in the middle of reading the answer to what should be a simple problem.I don't recommend this textbook. Sadly, I don't know of any better ones. The textbook recommended for the first actuarial exam - _Probability: The Science of Uncertainty_ - is a better book overall, but lacks the requisite depth for a really thorough treatment of the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, Useful and Relevant","review":"After 20 years in the computer industry, I'm finally able to describe what I do in one sentence! This is a book about the nature of architecture, the need for software architects. I found the detours through the history of architecture interesting, illuminating, and relevant. This book will not teach you to be a software architect, yet, how invaluable it is to understand the nature of this new profession, before we all run out and print new business cards. While the role of software architectect is similar in many ways to what we used to call a systems analyst, this new definition calls for vision and elegance in desgin, leading to more utility and quality in finished systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constructing Software=Constructing Houses, why not Cooking?","review":"I looked forward to get this book with such a promising title, but it turned out to be a philosophical essay dancing around the bad analog between constructing a building and constructing software. To me the only common denominator between these two is the fact, that some of the terminology (like terms design, architecture, construction) can be applied to both. Equally useful analogy would be cooking food or composing music. I doubt this book helps anybody understand \\"The Software Architect's Profession\\" better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaks to the essence of a Software Architect's profession...","review":"A quick yet enlightening read.This is a must read for any wanna-be software architect. It clearly points out that software architecture is not software engineering, or project management, and that the software development industry could accelerate its maturity greatly by applying the abstract principals of other architectural disciplines to software. That shouldn't be too hard, right? After all, we who develop software believe we own the corner on abstraction!This book will not teach you the Unified Modeling Language (UML), patterns of software abstraction, or how to write modular software, but it will help you think clearly and didactically about what software architecture needs to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"initially interesting but ultimately disappointing","review":"I liked this book, it was a quick and enjoyable read about the history of building architecture. Relatively little was said about software architecture, as I read it the book says the role of a software architect needs to be defined but does not attempt any sort of definition itself. This is not a criticism, the book has in its title that it is an introduction, and it makes for a good introduction. The writing style was amusing, I took a quick poll around the office to see who knew what a hair shirt is, including me only 2 out of 10 knew. I say ultimately disappointing because as I reached the end of the book and realized that the authors really weren't going to give any direct information about what software architects do, not even drawing clear distinctions between the designs they turn out vs. what an engineer turns out, I lost interest and thought it wasn't really worth the $."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not one of Chris DeBurgh's best albums.","review":"This album is not one of Chris DeBurgh's greatest albums.

She's ill-tempered, moronic, boy-crazy, and completely self-centred. I can't understand why Renninson didn't want to portray her as someone other girls could look up to. Georgia thinks she's ugly, which is understandable, because all girls think they're ugly most of the time. But not only does Georgia show her audience that she's not worthy of men, she shows that she's completely OBSESSED with men. She gets suicidal if something doesn't go her way!

Since Santino is an American folklorist, one would expect an outsider's view of Halloween. Instead, having lived in Northern Ireland for an extended period and formed working relationships with folklorists there, Santino offers a view of a cultural phenomenon that is both sympathetic and objective. His insights are worth considering. Perhaps the only drawback to this volume is its lack of historical perspective or comparison with other Celtic cultures. Despite this, the present volume is a welcome addition to the library of anyone interested in Halloween itself or Celtic cultural remains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT order these....severly underfilled!","review":"These pillows are the worst I have ever seen.

It's a very easy procedure, but it's best to know what you are doing first! :)I'm still building my hospice care supplies, and this was a nice addition to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every pet owner should have this.","review":"Disposable Skin Staple Remover is the best way to remove skin staples, i.e., quicker, more precise and less painful than trying to do so without the proper tool.If your dog decides to remove the staples on his/her own, they seldom come out without doing damage. In such cases, complete removal of the staple in question can help prevent further damage.In terms of normal staple removal (normally 10 to 14 days following surgery) while you should be able to determine that the staples are ready to be removed, if you are unsure, don't do it, see a vet."},{"rating":"1","title":"More a novel than a manual","review":"The title of this book is misleading.

I'm usually a hater of change, but the direction that PR went in this time was clearly a good one. The music has a much different sound I think, but in my opinion its still just as good. It seems to lean towards more main-stream music listeners because of the pop rock sound in some of its songs. If you're not a fan of that, I wouldn't suggest this album to you.

When I laid eyes on them, I couldnt believe what I saw. I didnt know if I should laugh or should I cringe. They changed their apperance to rip off Atreyu and Avenged Sevenfold, 2 bands with much more talent than Papa Roach could ever hope for. Their song they played was horrible; sounded like the typical numetal crap theyve been making over and over agian. I downloaded some songs too see if they got any better, and SURPRISE they didnt. Come on people, this band is a rip off of actually talented bands: their apperance is ripped off of Atreyu and A7X as I said, their music is just 2nd rate numetal and their CD cover is even ripped off of Killswitch Engage. Very sad is the only description I can think of to describe this."},{"rating":"2","title":"best from the the roach","review":"Great vocals on every song especially \\"Scars\\" I love that song and the title track is sweet too.

These guys sound like every other Nu Metal band out there. They use music to bitch about their everyday lives not being absolutely perfect. Anyone can do that. Suck it up; life ain't always easy!!!

They're all great songs, most of them I consider best songs, be sure to get this album, don't miss out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album","review":"This is a must buy album for anyone who loves rock music. Papa Roach has evolved and created such a sound on this CD that is pleasing to anyone with a set of working ears.

An album with a positive outlook and positive sounding instrumentals.A definite must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Like The Title","review":"I give this album two stars because I think the title suits it perfectly.

I wish I could grow to like it, but it's just not happening for me. The lyrics are very simplistic, boring and quite cheesy if you ask me, same with the guitar licks. I sorta like the song \\"Getting Away With Murder\\" because it has a pretty catchy guitar riff, but that's about it.I have tried and tried to let this album grow on me, but in the end I just skip most of the songs and take it out of my CD player.Sorry if this isn't helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"standard rock-radio garbage","review":"with this album papa roach do what they do best, just what everyone else is doing. when rap metal was big they were ripping off limp bizkit, and now when emo rock is gaining ground thats what they decide to start ripping off. the end result is boring, uninspired and predicable genaric rock, perfect for the average radio listener. anyone who likes their music to be original and inovative should stay far far away form this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There worst album yet!","review":"Contrary to what some ppl are saying i think this album is horrible. I dont hate the band infact i'm a big fan but this album was a huge dissapointment.They've changed there sound to the point were it sounds too punkish and is not heavy enough.The guitar riffs are hardly impressive and Jacoby's vocals sound flat and boring.This is easily the worst papa roach album ever with only two or three songs worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Korn instead","review":"My first experiance with this album came from seeing the video for Getting away with murder. The chorus sounded so familiar, I knew that I had heard it before... And then it hit me, that songs chorus has the exact same tone as Korn's Here to stay, just a lot weaker.This band has always had a bad rap for being just another bi-product of the wanna-be's influenced by Korn, but now they are just using their tone right out in the open.Overall, if you like this band, then you would love Korn, so spending your money on this is a big waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"their worst album","review":"this album is nothing in comparison to their others. when i heard a new papa roach cd was comin out i bought it right away. when i listened to it i was disgusted. i didnt like it at all. the title track \\"Getting Away With Murder\\" has lyrics that dont even make any sense and the bands skills musically have gone downhill. the guitar riffs on this cd arent even the slightest bit catchy. the lyrics are plain out senseless. this is the bands worst display of their musical talent. Infest and Love Hate Tradgety were excelent albums but this one just kills my eardrums each time i hear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"shOULD have quit after Infest","review":"This CD is not good by any means. It gets 2 stars because it has one catchy song, i think #4. If you enjoy Papa Roach-maybe you can suffer through this CD but I was a Papa Roach fan when the Infest album dropped. Infest had a great sound that Papa Roach never seemed to go back to. They are meddling with different styles right now and are unsuccessful in my opinion. Your average junk rock CD-save your money and buy Infest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing music...different than expected but very amazing","review":"This album pulled me in and kept me there the whole time. Possibly the best Roach yet. All the songs are well put together and anyone who listens should find it an enjoyable listen. Great all around from guitar to drums to bass to the amazing lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album from Papa Roach, devoid of the crappy rapping","review":"Man, let me tell you. I am not into these crappy nu-metal bands. I may not like Papa Roach that much but this album; I mean this album is the most mature of Papa Roach's career. Now their last album sucked and their debut was a bad start, but Papa Roach's newest album, Getting Away With Murder, is by far the best and most mature out of the three albums. Songs like Scars, Not Listening, and the title track certainly get my fancy. The rest are just above average to average. Jacoby finally decided to stop making use of the rapping that he did on the previous albums and he became much less annoying now. The guitars are above average and the drumming is alright.At least Papa Roach is the only nu-metal band that I like. The rest, such as Korn, Linkin Park, Slipknot, and all others like them, suck so much a**.Then again, I will just stick to my music that I consider has talent, like Megadeth, Motorhead, Death, and others like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't anybody realize that this CD sucks?","review":"This music is so generic it is almost unbelievable. Papa Roach had something going for them when they wrote songs like \\"Last Resort\\", but here they throw it all away in their quest to go mainstream. Did they just sit down one day and decide \\"Let's not be creative, let's just do what we think everyone will like. No more edgy songs talking about suicide, that's too dark. Why don't we sing 'my weakness is that I care too much'. Just put some throwaway lyrics onto sup-par guitar riffs and see what happens\\". Seriously, listen closely to this music, Papa Roach are not good musicians and are trying way too hard to get people to like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happened???","review":"Ok, Infest=great album, this is crap.

I would hear about two minutes and then skip to the next in the hope of something better, but alas, it was all the same.Go roll your 15$ up and smoke it. Its worth the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"brand new","review":"Papa roach has always put out good music all of it has a message that they want everyone to hear this album is by far their best it just shows how much talent the band really has every album just shows more and more talent musical evolution many bands strive for it but fall short Papa Roach pulls it off successfully with no questions asked this is a great cd lots of time was put it to it and it showspeacebuy this album you wont regret it&quot;I tear my heart open i sow my self shut and my weakness is that i cant do much and my scars remind me that the past is real i tear my heart open just to feel&quot;"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu Metal is dead...Papa Roach prove that","review":"Papa Roach exemplifies both the rise and fall of Nu-Metal...when they first came on the scene with Infest in 99 they were lauded by MTVers everywhere...good image, great music videos, catchy (if regurgitated riffs) and music that only Britney Spears and N'sync lovers would consider heavy. Well now in 2004, things have really changed...Nu Metal is dead...and in its place their are two camps competiting for attention...first is the emo-metal that you hear on about every alternative radio station...good stuff like Story of the Year, Three Days Grace, Talking Back Sunday, etc....the other is the resurrgence of Metalcore/Hardcore, think Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage, Chimaria, Hatebreed, etc...Simply put Papa Roach stick with the same ol formula and no one is listening anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Papa Roach's Worst CD","review":"Man, these guys went way downhill since lovehatetragedy.

In fact, when looking at the black power tribute picture I always kind of chuckled at the white guy, assuming he didn't know what was going on.I'm so glad I watched this cause it allowed me to understand who Peter was. And it's a shame he didn't have a better legacy than he did. I also feel absolutely horrible for John and Tom as their lives were in shambles after the Olympics. I couldn't imagine making such a critically significant statement, winning the gold and being shunned by your own country. I salute all three of these guys. They are heroes. One of the best documentaries ever.I'm actually going to get the tribute picture framed and put on my wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD FOR SNOWBIRDS","review":"The book is nice, with accurate information and reviews of the campgrounds with good information on how to find them.However, it's of no use for snowbirds and winter campers, due to a total lack of information on all-year camps and winter activities. Also, the book points usually just one campground in each location, not giving you room for alternatives.Anyway, if you plan a trip from March through October, it's a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Waste Your Money","review":"I found this book to be big waste of money. It is huge, but big print and with relatively very few campsites reviewed. If you want to take the same trip the author's took, maybe you can use it. but if you want a comprehensive list of campsites in each country with recommendations, this is NOT it. Maps are poor and infrequent and information is generally sparse. Check out Michelin guides for more comprehensive info."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS CD--","review":"DON'T BUY THIS CD--if you want to play it on your PC's CD-RW or CD-ROM drive. It is not compatible with Windows and will not play. Had I known this I would not have bought this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware: This New SACD Release is a Scheme","review":"This Rolling Stones CD is an SACD release, meaning it will play on your home stereo -- but NOT in your PC. Major record labels are pushing SACD as an \\"improvement\\" over standard CDs, because they're hoping it will become the new format of choice for music lovers -- music lovers that don't want to listen to music on their PCs, that is, and don't want to play music in an Ipod or a portable MP3 player, or burn backup copies of their CDs. Record labels have even hired \\"grassroots\\" marketers to post messages on boards like this one, hailing the achievements of SACD. Don't believe them. Do NOT buy any of the Rolling Stones remasters series releases if you're a user that likes to listen to music on a PC or turn your tracks into MP3s or make back-up copies of the music you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong songs listed!","review":"The second CD in this set which I ordered has the WRONG SONGS on it!I've never seen anything like this before, what gives?This is not my idea of convenient shopping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will ABKCO release the Stones Box?","review":"This compilation is a crappy release. Sure, the songs are awesome, but all, except \\"Midnight Rambler\\" are on the Singles 3CD set. This set was released just after the dawn of the CD era, and, as a result, includes album length CD's. All CD compilations, especially those by bands with incredible catalogs, should be at least 75 minutes long. Each disc here wastes 30 minutes. This compilation set should have been erased long ago. Give us a release that is up to Stones scratch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I orded,","review":"The ad was for a AUDIO CD, and I recieved a music book. Not happy. Good thing my boyfriend plays guitar saved me from having to send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot rocks indeed!","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer that too many people are talking about the new sound quality instead of the song quality.I have the \\"un-remastered version\\".I'm sure that the new CD's sound great,but the old ones sounded good too.The bottom line is this:This is a great greatest hits album.If you don't want to plunk down for all those seperate RS albums then get this CD.Even with \\"Forty Licks\\",there still isn't as comprehensive a collection as this covering 1971-the present.Yeah,most of \\"More Hot Rocks\\" could have fit on here,but what's here is plenty primo Stones.If they only could have been this consistent in the 70's,80's and 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The first disc is still the sound of a band of British gents trying to create American R&B and blues music. Get Off Of My Cloud or Ruby Tuesday don't make me think, \\"Wow. This is the world's greatest rock and roll band.\\" \\"These guys sure have a talent for writing excellent pop songs.\\" comes to my mind more. The second disc, however, is energetic, inspired, amazing blues rock. They experiment. They progress and, unlike the Beatles who became absurd, through it all they kept their blues and pop sensibilities. This was the Stones run for the throne. This kind of material gave them the title, \\"world's greatest rock and roll band.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the first taste","review":"I was and am too emersed in too many bands and artists to attempt to start collecting the Rolling Stones' essential albums. Their discography is way too big. Hot Rocks has all of the really essential songs you could want(at least the early ones). It goes with me on every trip. There isnt a bad song on here (shocking, yes, I know). In fact there isn't even a song that is just okay. This is two full discs of classic songs, perfect for someone who isn't wholly firmiliar with the Stones. It will make you want to buy more of their records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of all ORIGINAL hit recordings","review":"Not much that needs said... this is some of the best Rolling Stones from 1964 through 1971. All ORIGINAL hit recordings for a reasonable price. If you remember these songs, you already want them. If you don't remember these songs, get 'em, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early years greatest hits!","review":"I have always liked the Rolling Stones but had never bought an album, for some reason (even though I am of that era). Then I read Keith Richards book, Life. The book amused me so much that I had to get an early album. I chose Hot Rocks because it has a really great selection of their hits from the late 60's to early 70's. Love it, love it, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great Upgrade","review":"I'm not sure what DSD remasterd means this sounds Incredible- but the light that usally comes on when I play a SACD on my player doesnt come on when I play this. But the sound quailty is outstanding Worth every cent even though I alaready had the \\"regular\\" cd- which sounded pretty good itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolling Stones","review":"I had never really heard much of The Stones until I got this at age 17 in 1992. Up until that point I was a fan of The Beatles, but after hearing the songs on this 2 disc set I haven't listened to The Beatles hardly ever again. After hearing these songs I have gone on to buy every Stones cd and have tracked down a lot of their unreleased bootleg stuff as well. This is a great starter set for someone wanting the Stones early hits, but as all best of sets they still leave out some great songs. If you get this you will still need to at least get \\"Beggars Banquet\\", \\"Let It Bleed\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers\\" to cover the 64'-71'- era. Possibly pick up the two disc set \\"More Hot Rocks\\". Some of the better unreleased songs from this era are \\"Blood Red Wine\\", \\"Andrew's Blues\\", \\"C---sucker Blues\\" and \\"Hillside Blues\\" to name a few and can be found on Youtube. A few other from this era that can be found on various albums are \\"Jiving Sister Fanny\\", \\"I Don't Know Why\\", and \\"Memo From Turner\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice introduction","review":"Of course there are no weak songs here but if this is all you have you are missing out on at least 80 or 90% of the Stones best work. Lots of classic rock radio standards but you are missing out on their true brillance if you don't own atleast 10 of their albums. This is far from definitive but it is a nice way to get acquinted with some of their work and this is where I started."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rolling Stones Hot Rocks is the best that I have heard.","review":"I'd have to say that the Rolling Stones are the best rock singers that I have ever heard. Especally their hit, \\"Hot Rocks 1964-1971\\". I think that all of their hits are the cooliest. If I had to choose to them and maybe Green Day, I'd pick the Rolling stones. So I will conclude by saying that the Rolling Stones rock the house!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Head candy","review":"I used to have this double album back in the early 70's and have been looking for it for some time, love it!

That alone was worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great collection, horrible quality","review":"I have had the cassette version of this album for over 15 years and thought the cd version would sound better on my stereos. The cassette version's audio quality is better equalized and balanced than this remastered cd. I just recieved the cd version of this \\"remastered\\" album and after listening to it on my BOSE stereo system and my car stereo system, I can honestly say that this is the worst quality cd I have ever listened to. It was worse than listen to an AM station in a tunnel. Do yourself a favor and buy and older version, maybe before they \\"remastered\\" it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Starter Album","review":"If you're new to the Rolling Stones, or have limited income and can only \\"sample\\" this remarkable band, then this is the double album to buy. Disc one is especially strong and showcases the Stones at their lyrical and creative peak in the 60's. This compilation holds its own against the famous Beatles red Greatest Hits album, and the Stones early music is not as dated as the Beatles work in the period 1963-64.Disc one also priminently features the Stones greatest ballads, not a genre in which they have traditionally excelled. \\"Ruby Tuesday\\" and \\"Paint it Black\\" remain fresh-sounding and interesting both lyrically and musically.This will give the novice a good compass from which to gauge the Stones and you can branch from here. This represents some of the classic tracks laid down by anyone in the past forty years. No filler songs on this collection, it's magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stones!!!","review":"I bought this cd for my brother who has always been a Stones fan.

I realize it's a 'whatever' issue, as you could easily burn your own collection in any order you chose, but to an old 60's dog, this album(s) would have had a better flow with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Collection, great sound but...","review":"I owned this excellent package in vinyl the very first day it came out (wow!) 30 years ago. The music is, with no question, an exceptional bunch of songs in one place: no dispute there and therefore recommended as essential. I do disagree with ABCKO about their research for the best masters for this proyect: the lack of stereo Masters in Satisfaction, Mother's Little Helper, Off of my cloud is dissapointing. I do have these in my analog Hot Rocks CD I obtained while stationed in Germany in 1989. With less resolution, but in stereo, they do sound great.Aside from my misgivings for being a definitive project with full utilization of stereo with the SACD format, I would still recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remastering makes for a new experience","review":"Let's face it: early Stones albums (and the cds that were based on them) were pretty poorly engineered. This re-mastered recording (assuming you're using decent equipment) is an audible improvement. Bass lines have more oomph, yet are more musical. Back up vocals are more distinct. Everything sound less tinny. It's not like an entirely new recording, but they have done a remarkable job considering the material with which they had to work. Whether or not this the best early compilation I won't argue: it is what it is (and I think it's pretty good). If you want to hear the early recordings of the Stones sound better than they ever have, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most of the Stone's hits","review":"The Rolling Stones fall into a category similar to the Beatles and Beach Boys in that they have had so many hits and songs that they will never have a good greatest hits album because of the large number of songs they recorded. This includes most of the hits for the 1964-1971 hits of the Stones. If you are a huge Stones fan, you'll need another album in addition to this one to have complete \\"SATISFACTION\\" to have a more complete collection of the Stones hits. Every song on this album is a \\"Hot Rock\\" and the album is worth every penny especially for those who like only the Stones' songs from the 1960s and very early 70s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Echo doesn't help his voice","review":"kinda <bad> that they remixed and added unecessary effects to really brilliant songs.

Willie Whatts is the worst drummer ever, he never could drum as good as Lars Ulrich(Metallica drummer). They even have put up some of the even more lousiest and worst songs ever made like Brown Sugar, Satisfaction, Get Off My Cloud, and Sympathy For The Devil. Even a Green Day CD has better music than this!Ignore the previous 5 star reviewers below and avoid this lousy compilation.

They are not the world's greatest rock band and they never made anything good but Start Me Up and Shattered. Their new album is the most horrible CD I have ever heard. Stay far away from that CD. Get anything from the Stones that contains Start Me Up or Shattered insted."},{"rating":"2","title":"man","review":"whats up all you stones haters, why do you compare them to the beatles, while the beatles are awesome, you must learn to accept the stones for who they are and what they have brought into the world of rock, you are blind to the fact that they too are a very influencial band, it is true they will be remembered as addicts and womanizers, but i say you are nothing better than a hypocrite if you are blind to the fact that the rolling stones are one of the greatest, most recognized, and popular bands of this era, every band brings something new and different to the rock scene, many that have lasted as long as and are as successful as the stones have the talent and gift to to drastically and continually change rock for the better, of course beauty is in the ear of the beholder, but the stones live on and will continue to, your words will not cut them down, but rather fortify their power and influence as one of rocks greatest bands"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad disc","review":"Disc # 1 was scartched very disappointed,do not believe I would order again from this site,Disc # 2 was fine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot rocks cd is good stones music but the quality of the cd very poor.

I recommend it to all stones fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic compilation deserves better CD edition","review":"HOT ROCKS 1964-71 has everything the unitiated listener needs to experience the genius of the Stones. The only reasons for less than 5 stars are that the sound quality in transfer to CD from vinyl should have been better and the organ intro version of \\"Time Is On My Side\\" ( the LP version has the signature guitar lead intro that nearly defines the essence of the early Stones- Keith's and Brian's guitar interplay). For the casual Stones listener, perhaps this compilation is sufficient unless their more recent work is sought. Every track is superb and the second CD is a showcase of the band at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Compilation of the greatest band ever","review":"This is easily the best CD that i have ever bought. Not only does it have such classic songs as Satisfaction, Jumpin' Jack Flash, Sympathy for the Devil, and Brown Sugar; but it also has some other great songs that are highly underrate. Some of these would include Paint it Black, Get off of my Cloud, Brown Sugar, and Wild Horses. My favorite song has to be Sympathy for the Devil. No matter how many times you listen to that song, it never gets old. This CD is a must for anyone who has a remote interest in classic rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - but Skimpy","review":"When Hot Rocks was released in 1972 on vinyl, it was the definitive Stones compilation. However, 21 songs on two CDs seems a little skimpy, and Hot Rocks leaves out a number of hits, important album tracks, and entire portions of their musical history. Rolled Gold+, released in late 2007, provides a thorough summary of the Stones 60's music, 40 songs on 2 discs, including all 21 songs from Hot Rocks and 15 songs from More Hot Rocks. I would recommend passing on this album (and More Hot Rocks) in favour of the much more satisfying Rolled Gold+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Album Ever Made!","review":"Whether you're a diehard Stones fan (like myself), or someone unfamiliar with the greatest rock-n-roll band ever, this album is a must-have in any CD collection. The double album covers early hits such as \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Under My Thumb\\" up through classics on the \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile on Main Street\\" albums. From ballads to hard rockers this album has something for every taste. I started listening to this album on record when I was a child and The Rolling Stones became a part of me. Their creativity and charisma comes out in every song and I couldn't help but fall in love with their distinct sound and style. It's a shame if you don't already have this album, and a disgrace if you don't run out right now and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Stones package on the market","review":"I was looking for this when I picked up Forty Licks, looking back I think I should've gotten this instead but oh well. As opposed to Forty Licks, which had a bit of filler, every song here is classic. Personal favorites include Jumping Jack Flash, Sympathy for the Devil, Play with Fire, Paint It Black, Ruby Tuesday, Let's Spend the Night Together, Street Fighting Men, Gimme Shelter, You Can't Always Get What You Want, Wild Horses, Brown Sugar and virtually anything else. Every song here scores in the good-to-great range, the worst (Not like it's saying much) being As Tears Go By, Heart of Stone and Time Is on My Side.Every compilation has missing songs. In this case, Let It Bleed, Sway, No Expectations, the Last Time, Jigsaw Puzzle and Little Red Rooster have been cruly omitted. If you want the best Stones package there is, get this. But if you want an overview, Forty Licks. It just depends on who you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEEZY","review":"It looks like it was made in China! And yes it was!! Sorry to say but Kodak makes awful products. I'll stick with my canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like most doubles, this woulda made a great single disk","review":"Most RT albums have 6 or 7 good songs and 3 great ones. This double cd seems like two of those albums, even to having rather different production and bands. I liked the songs better when I mixed them all together on a comp tape.Cold Kisses and Woods of Darney are two of my favorite Thompson songs ever, and there's not a bad track here. This is very near the perfection of Pour Down like Silver, Daring Adventures and Mirror Blue."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can't appreciate this....","review":"Quite simply, this is unequalled! If you like truly great singer song writers such as Randy Newman or Elvis Costello, you'll soon realise you've come to the right CD. The poetic lyrics that say so much in such a sparse way, the emotive music, the stark vocals - it's all here. I'm talking mainly about the acoustic disc, but then 50% of this is so superior to 100% of any other. This isn't for the heavy guitar RT lovers. It's for people who recognise that the very BEST music is always going to be essentially emotional, and the impact of this never fades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will everybody quit harping on Mitchell Froom?","review":"I know Mitchell Froom is not overly popular, especially after this album, but RT keeps using him, OK? Get over it and move on.Now, that that is out of the way...the main thing I didn't like about this disc is the packaging. Two CD's at about 40 minutes each? C'mon, a little pruning and this would have fit on one disc.Musically, I loved the disc. The Ghost Of You Walks is a beautiful piece of music. She Steers By Lighting should be on a music soundtrack someplace. Razor Dance is the best song in its category - screwed up relationships. A couple songs are weaker than others, but mostly it is another convincing chapter in the RT book of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor overall","review":"Not bad music but not music worth spending the time listening to, just pretty mediocre in all respects - Heard much better on street corners - Did not care for even one song"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this one's a disaster","review":"RT is my hero, but I'm not blind to his failings. The last few albums have show a distressing trailing off, but this one is the pits. From spreading 78 minutes of music over two CDs (and charging for a double), to pointlessly putting on different versions of the same song, this CD shows no respect for the listener. The sound is horrible - Mitchell Froom's production has been getting worse and worse, and some of the songs are plain unpleasant. The are many wonderful albums in Thompson's canon - buy anything before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the CD?","review":"Shipping was fast and came in a timely manner. The book was in good shape. However, it advertises a CD, and it didn't come with one.

I mean, Sting's Spanish album is his own voice, but he's multilingual anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably Elvis' weakest CD","review":"This CD includes songs from two of Elvis' movies, 1967's Easy Come, Easy go and 1968's Speedway. A soundtrack album was released for Speedway but it was a commercial flop, peaking at 82 on the US album chart. An EP was released with songs from Easy Come, Easy Go, it was a hit in the UK, but failed to make a splash in the US. Only one song on this set made the US singles chart, Your Time Hasn't Come Yet Baby which only peaked at 72 on the chart. While Elvis' performances are good and there are a few ok songs on here, in general the material is so weak that there is not much he can do to salvage it. Elvis' management should have been fired for giving him material like this to record; what a waste of his talent. This may be the weakest Elvis CD currently available. Only recommended for avid Elvis fans who have to own everything he released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completists Only","review":"Some of the songs on \\"Easy Come, Easy Go\\" are decent, particularly the title track, but since it's available on the 2-Disc \\"Compact Command Performances\\" collection, along with the best two songs from \\"Speedway\\", this one falls very short of being essential. Especially with the huge amount of Elvis CD's out there..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis Done Did It Again","review":"These two soundtracks are fun in the car. The songs aren't amazing from either soundtrack, and \\"Yoga Is as Yoga Does\\" certainly slows down the entire disc with its cheesiness, but \\"Love Machine,\\" \\"Sing You Children,\\" and the title track for Easy Come Easy Go are solid 60s Elvis songs. I'm much more partial to the Speedway songs, especially Nancy Sinatra's \\"Your Groovy Self.\\" Of course, even this set has its awkward, regrettable tunes, such as \\"Western Union\\" and \\"There Ain't Nothing like a Song.\\" If you are a lukewarm Elvis fan, simply stick to his 50s, 70s and live albums. If you are an avid fan and don't want to spend a lot of money on the FTD versions, this collection is worth having for each song's overall energy and rock sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but, does not fit on crib!","review":"The mobile is very cute but, it doesn't fit on our crib...it is only designed to fit on a standard old-style crib. We have a sleigh style crib and there is no way that it will fit. It does have a desktop option but, it almost seems to heavy to use that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"My daughter has and uses this mobile. She loves it without question. When my niece was born I thought she would also benefit from this mobile. Alas I couldn't find it at any retail stores. I found it on Amazon from BabyAge. The seller was efficient and the product was received in a very timely manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talked to fischer price customer service a lot on this one!","review":"I got this initially as a gift and LOVED it. It sounds wonderful and is quite soothing, BUT, the first one soon crapped out after only 2 months of LIGHT use. (Not the batteries. Oh, and by the way, did you notice it takes 4 D batteries?!) FP did an exchange by mail which took almost a month, and the second one was also defective...or maybe I snapped the birds in wrong. Either way, it was a major pain. I returned the second one, FP sent me a check to cover the replacement cost as I didn't want another one. In the end, we ended up with a Tiny Love mobile that she loves-is easy to put together and only takes 2 AA batteries. Oh, breath of fresh air!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young infants...","review":"The mobile is cute, but lacks the features necessary to sooth a small infant to sleep. First of all, the light is very dim, does not cast shadows or even glow enough to see the birds. The music has two settings-loud and louder, and it doesn't play for very long. The birds randomly just quit moving, although the music is still playing. Also, the birds are up so high, that I don't think my infant could even see them. It just did not hold her attention at all, and frankly this product was not what I expected based on the advertisment of the product. I switched to the Ocean Wonders aquarium and it is an essemtial for soothing my baby to sleep. Plus, like the flutterby mobile, it can be purchased with a remote which is very useful! The flutterby mobile may be useful for older infants/toddlers, but I found it unhelpful in aiding my small infant to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I don't know how all of the other reviewers got this to work because it wouldn't work for me. I put it together exactly as the directions stated and it would not turn as it's supposed to. The music and light worked but there was absoloutely no motion, just the minute sound of the motor turning,which didn't spin the birds. Would have been great if it did work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work properly!","review":"From the first use, and after trying with brand new batteries, the remote never worked properly. If you pressed the start button on the base it the remote would work for about 10-15 minutes. After that you had to repress the start button on the base. This made it useless to us at night when we needed it because we would have to try to sneak into our daughter's room to restart it (HA!). I gave it 2 stars only because it's so cute and it holds our baby's attention when it actually works. I would definitely buy something else next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work","review":"I absolutely love the look of this mobile and bought it for my baby. I put it together and it did not work - no music, no movement, no lights. I took it back to the store and got another one, I figured it was just a fluke. But, again after I put it together it did not work!! I was so frustrated, I tried everything to get it to work, I tried different batteries, I took it apart and put it back together, I read other reviews and tried those suggestions, I called Fisher Price (they told me to exchange it again!), but nothing worked. I can understand one faulty mobile but to get another just proves that this particular mobile is of poor quality. I love Fisher Price, too bad they can't get their act together with this mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!","review":"I bought this for my infant daughter, & boy do I wish I read the reviews on it first! We've only had it a day & already the birds aren't working. It's really a piece of junk. If you own a newer crib don't buy it if you plan on attaching it to the side because it won't fit. It's designed to ONLY fit the older style cribs with a very thin rail along the top of the crib. The only positive things I can say about thisproduct is that the music is rather pleasant. Honestly save your money & buy another mobile."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's broken! Not good as a stand either.","review":"After I finally put it together... the mobile would not rotate! I read about this problem on another website's reviews and figured that the people didn't put it together correctly. Well, the music went on, the light went on, but the birdies stood still. I could hear them trying to move. Also, once you snap it all together, you are not able to disassemble so it's almost impossible to mail back. I also thought that the light would blink or have motion, but it just remains on. My infant loves blinking lights.Also, I was hoping to use this as something to stand over the changing table and playard. It is very top heavy, so if you touch it, it tips over easily. Also, the mobile hangs almost as low as the base of the stand, so it could never be a standing mobile. It would never be used just with the base.It's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for babies!","review":"I purchased this for my newborn grandson after the mobile my daughter bought broke.

I look forward to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted it to be better","review":"I love Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. I've read all of her books and for the most part loved them. I've been especially caught up in the entire Kiesha'ra series. The plights of the avian and serpiente is absolutely facinating and I've gotten too involved in it ;-)I was stoked when I saw Falcon Dance was coming out. I hopped on Amazon and bought it asap and started consuming it as soon as it arrived. But by the end I was slightly dissapointed. I think I might have liked the book more had it focused on Oliza (since I love both Danica and Zane and was upset at how little they appeared). I did like Nicias, but I didn't find him nearly as likeable as the others.The book itself is engaging and facinating and most of the characters are quite complex (I especially liked Darien). Though I have mixed feelings on this book, I did enjoy it and can't wait for the next 2 volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanderig","review":"I personally love Amelia's books, I think I actually own all of them, but I was kind of dissapointed by this sequel.

I wanted it for work and also for roadtrips with my family.The sound was good, it didn't skip when moved around. That was aboutall the positives I give this. The screen is not clear, a bit on the fuzzy side, the headphones that come with this are a joke, you can hear all sorts of background noise. The stop function promised to keep you place in the movie, but it never did. HOWEVER, the biggest problem was that you can hear the DVD spinning in the case while you are watching a movie.I really can't recommend this because it is an inferior product. Lot's of promises from the manufacturer but in all a disappointing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant chirping noise drove me crazy","review":"I have to agree with Georgie Girl - you can hear the DVD spinningwhile you are watching a movie.

The very first time I played a DVD I noticed a dead pixel on the screen. That just isn't acceptable to me. Straight out of the box, I believe there shouldn't be any problems. Other than the dead pixel, the picture was very good. I actually haven't seen any DVD players with a better picture and I've looked at Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, Insignia, Zenith, and Audiovox.The sound out of the speakers is pretty decent. However, if you wear headphones, you'll hear a chirping/squeaking noise from the spinning of the DVD. It is pretty annoying to be honest.Also, when you put the DVD in the player, you can feel how cheap the lid is. If you aren't careful, it seems as though you could easily snap the lid off."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY!","review":"I bought this to take on a long trip for my daughter to watch... would not work properly, but i figured i just had not operated it correctly! boy was i wrong-- it will only have a WHITE SCREEN show up and sometimes you can hear it but not see what is playing...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I used this item for about 3 weeks after my TV went out so as to watch movies.

Unfortunately, those wires then become \\"stretched, fray, and/or eventually break\\" -- as in my unit's scenario. The unit's TFT \\"swivel\\" screen allows for a 360-degree quasi-continuous rotation from unit's base (ie. where the power supply resides) electrically connected with a tiny-wire and a ribbon cable. When the stretched wires eventually fray and/or break, there is danger of both shorting out the unit's electrical (with the potential of causing a fire and/or a battery explosion.)Separately, I know that there is a recall on specific \\"battery serial ranges\\" for the batteries supplied for the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I purchased this portable DVD player because we were planning a trip and the car ride was going to be a long one.

My grandson has many books, and usually the only ones that immediately catch his interest are those with a lot of pictures of trucks. To my surprise he listened when we read about Ollie - again and again and continues to enjoy the book after a dozen readings. \\"See Ollie\\" he says when I ask him to choose a book. I wonder if he relates to the stubborn Ollie, since he is in those tough months that come with being a two year old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes my son laugh and smile","review":"My son is almost 2, he loves this book, he brings it to me to read to him quite often.All I have to do is to say \\"I won't come out\\" like Ollie does... and his mood picks right up.

Gossie and Gertie finally give up. Ollie decides shortly there after to come out and play!The book is small in size making it easy for toddlers to hold and turn the pages. Each page has only one sentence making this easy to read to little ones who have short attention spans. The pictures of various animals will be enjoyed by children of all ages.I would recommed this book to parents and caregivers of children ages birth to 3. The story is very simple and is one that kids will enjoy hearing over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived with ants in it!!!","review":"My elderly mom loves peanut brittle, so this was a little gift/treat for her.Sorry, but the packing of this product was so poor that thewhite bag with the cellophane window that the candy was inarrived in a box with no protective packing - no styrofoam, nonewspaper, nothing...so the box was punctured, the cellophanewas torn out of the white bag, and there were little tiny antseverywhere...inside, all over the candy.

And, there are just the right amount of colorful pictures to keep their interest piqued. So what if the plots are a little transparent. That actually increased the pleasure of my son who was so proud to have figured out the bad guy before the gang did! Keep those Scooby books coming.

Carl Weathers plays the washed up cop who's reputation gives him nothing but disrespect. That's a characteristic of a mortal. Even though he's trying to crack a case involving a naive wife (Sharon Stone) and a hot singer (Vanity) who can't act, he still punches people for no reason. Yes. \\"Praise the lord!\\" he yells and then punches some people out. Oh yeah, Mac and Billy from Lord Arnold Schwarzenegger's \\"Predator\\" make appearances.

This movie is not worth buying, I feel stupid for buying the movie now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action Jackson","review":"A maverick cop (Carl Weathers) is on the trail of a corrupt auto tycoon (Craig T.

I grew up on these types of movies and seeing them just bring back memories. Carl Weathers who played Apollo Creed in Rocky and Dillon in Predator, stars as Detroits toughest cop battling a psycho car dealer. Here are the best things about this flick:- the title track sung by the Pointer Sisters, gets you going- The bad guy played by Craig T.Nelson, brilliantly- Sharon Stone in her earlier days of acting.- Bill Duke,from Preadtor and Commando, as the Captain- Vanity , who is sexier than hell, plays the groupie.- great action sequences, including the car scene in the finale.- the 200lb Muslim guy who saves Jackson, says\\" Hello, Im Mr.ED\\"- The semminal line from this movie: \\"BBQ huh?...How do ya like your ribs?\\"This is just a great movie for action fans, if you are looking for action films without all the overdeveloped plots and artificial characters, this is one you will enjoy.

He likes to sit and watch, the clouds and the measure of his prose, the simple measure of man, in between heaven and earth. After \\"Un Samedi Soir sur la Terre\\" he moved to a new house in the same Southern country side, a house with a new attic. He said he had \\"exhausted\\" the old one and needed to find a new simple and poetic spot to compose his latest: \\"Hors Saison\\".

But I'm not sure. I remember running across this song on Napster one day, while searching for something else. I loved it, and borrowed the CD for the weekend. Francis Cabrel sings songs that are both beautiful and well written. (It makes me wonder what else us stereotypical non-importing Americans miss.) It was so good that I decided to buy the CD, even thought I could have downloaded most of it.I'm a beginning French student, and it's amazing how much I can pick up. I'll just get parts of songs stuck in my head, go around singing them all day, then smack myself in the forehead when I realize what I've been singing. It just clicks, which is a great feeling. The lyrics are easily understandable, he doesn't mumble or slur. This CD should be bought by anybody who likes artists similar in sound to Eric Clapton, or anybody interested in French."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cabrel brilliant and moving","review":"This is the album which made me a fan of Francis Cabrel. I first heard it in Grenoble a number of years ago. Cabrel doesn't tour in the U.S., and at the time, it wasn't possible to purchase his CDs here. Now it is possible (thanks to the likes of Amazon), so I searched for \\"Samedi Soir sur la Terre\\" (Saturday Night on Earth) and was delighted to find it. Listening to it again reconfirmed my appreciation of Cabrel's style and talent. His singing is clear and each word is understandable.

The Carson segments are wonderful, but there isn't enough of it (That may be understandable given the horrid selection of DVD's produced by Carson Entertainment---they probably wanted a truck of gold bricks for licensing).As far as the HBO specials here, they are quite simply NOT FUNNY. The most memorable thing with these is the unnecessary use of the F-word, which is peppered throughout. It's as if their scripts fell short of time, so they inserted a few dozen expletives for filler.If you must have some Rodney now, then this may curb that appetite for a couple of hours, but don't expect to get your money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIP: Rodney you always got Respect from Me","review":"Rodney Dangerfield is One of the Baddest Comedians ever.I dug His One Liners&Quick wit on any topic.He just had a cool pace&vibe about His flow&Presentation. this is long overdue.He will be Missed a great deal.

Bill phillips recommends his shakes as a meal replacement option for a mid snack, and most need a meal replacement powder called Myoplex, I would say that you don't need to go to the store and buy a box of this replacement meal powder because it is not cheap you would have to really look around to find a good price. Theres other ready to drink shakes from the body for life book and those you can find at walmart for a good price for a pack of 4 and these are good and you can use as a meal replacement.

However, the recipes have a lot of processed ingredients. In an effort to make the food \\"fast\\" so people will stick to the program, the foods are full of things you should not eat (like bottled salad dressing). Also, he does not include nutritional information with his recipes. I realize this is to make the program easier for people. However, I am a type 1 diabetic and many of the recipes appear to have a lot of sugars. He relies heavily on low fat flavored yogurt. In my experience, those yogurts either contains sugar substitutes or sugar to make it taste good. He should have just written a short book explaining his program and left the recipes to nutritionists and chefs. Any idiot can go to the store and get low fat bottled/canned/boxed ingredients and tie then together and lose weight. I was expecting real recipes with real food-not sugar substitutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This book said the same thing about healthy eating that my mom and grandma have said for years. I am not saying that it is incorrect or there is actually any more to eating healthy, but I was looking for something a little more in depth. The book does not do a real good job teaching you how to choose what to eat by your self; the whole second half of the book is recipes. If you are looking for recipes to follow then this is fine but it really does not teach you how to choose for your self what is best to eat.

My only problem with Bill's way-of-eating is that he is using some ingredients that are really unhealthy for you. In several of his recipes he says to use LF or FF Cool Whip. One of the first ingredients in Cool Whip is partially hydrogenated oil---something that NO ONE should be eating. He also uses a decent amount of fat free ingredients that are full of fillers (like fat free mayo) and artificial sweetners (Aspertame). I am suprised that someone as health conscious as Bill is would use a lot of these ingredients.I try to use only real, whole foods so I may have to adjust his recipes a bit. Overall, a great book and an easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!!","review":"I have bought many \\"diet\\" books over the years and this one makes the most sense.

There is ample room for me to write myself notes on the recipies I don't mind the product placement, it uses recognized brands that the average JOE-Sephine who doesn't know how to cook or shop feel comfortable to undertake this new adventure in cooking.

The best thing about it is the pictures. The most interesting thing is the line-up in the back of the book of people's body changes. Wow-if-they-can-do-that-maybe-I-can-too kind of inspiration. Of course this book doesn't tell one how to do that or even come close to it. If you want that information don't buy this book.It does give some good, practical advice about eating and if you are into the BFL program and don't know how to cook it may be a good purchase. Not much new here.The recipes are simple and easy to follow. Some pre-packaged food and if you like jalapenos and cilantro you'll find lots of recipes with those flavors.

This is the most boring, tedious historical novel I have ever read - and I have read many. The plot concept of showcasing characters from different social stratas and describing how they were involved/impacted by the Revolution should be interesting.

I found the 'feminist' angle of the French revolution very interesting and enligtening.Generally the idea of telling the inside story of those terrific and terrible times through the eyes of such a panel of narrators was very interesting and educating. After reading this book you really come to appreciate living in the end of the 20th century (being a woman - maybe some thanks is owed to the women French revolutionists).

This CD sounds almost identical or even better than Nirvana,Daves old band. Grohl took Kurt Kobians skills, sorry about the spelling, and brought them to another level.

I found out that Dave wrote and sang the song himself. This is just a sample of what was to come. \\"Foo Fighters\\" fulfilled every expectation I had of Dave Grohl and Pat Smear. The entire album is excellent from \\"This Is a Call\\" to \\"Exhausted.\\" I'm not one to compare one artist to another, so I'll just say that you will not be let down if you purchase this album.

Don't let someone tell you what the songs are about, and don't try to analyze them yourself. To each his own, if it speaks to you...it is what it is.

Of the three albums Dave and his cohorts have put out, this is by far their best. Do get the other two if you can (\\"The Colour And The Shape\\" and \\"There Is Nothing Left To Lose\\") for they are still good. It's just that their self-titled debut is very raw and more guitar-oriented than the other two. Plus, the production isn't as slick as the production on the other two. In other words, Dave and the boys just let it all hang out! Dave plays and screams out the passion in him in songs like \\"This Is A Call\\", \\"I'll Stick Around\\", and \\"Floaty\\". There are some quiet ones too, mind you (i.e., \\"For All The Cows\\"). But overall, this is a record that is meant to be played loud! \\"Foo Fighters\\" would pass as an excellent indie-rock record.

The checkers are nothing more than small, wooden disks. When making an opponents checker a king, there is nothing to keep the top checker from sliding off.

While this doesn't affect the playing much, it probably wouldn't be best used as a \\"display\\" board to be kept out and set up at all times (like many people do with their chess sets).If you are looking for something a little nicer than the basic cardboard and plastic checkers set, this is definitely a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"The price for Independence.","review":"It is said that you should never judge someone until you walk in their shoes.

Love the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"It's a shame this book is out of print, since its subject is very much alive and well, despite a change of scenery.Conspiracies are one thing; political sentiment and bias is one thing; but ultimately there are knowable facts, and the facts thereby suggest conclusions, but they also exclude other ideas definitively, and it may be that where a subject of secrecy is concerned, the latter is the most valuable contribution one can make. This book does the job admirably."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent semi-acoustic anthology of the best songs","review":"Discover the fine sensitivity of Fabio Concato listening at this very capturing collection.

The orchestral sections add some mood in a similar manner as with Art of War (Kind of that \\"Orcs are attacking!!\\" motif). Great production quality and creative, non-repetitive compositions make the album something to definitely pick-up, crank, and drive friggin' fast to.-And, yes.

We have subjected them to daily use and wash them by hand (no dishwasher, alas, in my kitchen). They have held up very well, no rust anywhere that I can see. The handles show a bit of wear but they're plastic, after all, and that should be expected. I'm buying another set now to replace the ones we've inadvertently tossed in the trash.The only caveat I would add is that some individual pieces are on the small side. The regular fork, knife and large spoon are fine. But the teaspoon and salad fork are somewhat smaller than you would expect. Great for households with young children, I guess! For the price, these can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply excellent & great deal!","review":"This set is simply awesome - the pieces are weighty and have a high quality fit and finish. Don't let the low price fool you - this flatware looks & feels much more up market. I have friends who have spent big money on their flatware who perfer my Oneida.

I never waste your time retelling the story, I will leave that to others. But let me say I don't usually watch a video more than 2 or 3 times. Mr Chips is at at least 7 and Gone with the wind only 3 and I cried every time. In many ways it is better than \\"Gone with the wind\\". Dare I say that. YES! It is about love in the victorian period that is slow, unselvish and patient and yes a man can cry, even a vet that is over 65!

On his way he will make several mistakes and learn from them. The movie has the feel of several stories running in series that all tie in to Chipping's life. He is also destined to meet the love of his life Katherine (Greer Garson) and see that the Danube is blue.I do not want to go into a detail as that is the fun in watching eh stories unfold however I think it is significant when Chipping and Katherine are alone on the top of the world and time stops finding them selves in eternity. He also gets an insight or different slant of his carrier.Goodbye, Mr. Chips"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed","review":"I waited for the DVD to arrive for quite some time with great anticipation and when it arrived it was not able to play due to scratches or some other problem.

In sum, a feel good movie with humor and a classic storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pacifism, 1939","review":"I'm surprised that most of the reviews don't mention the pacifist theme of the film. The film is well done and quite watchable on its own terms. But those terms are so tragically wrong -- pacifism in 1939 -- that it's tough to get past the unintended sadness and irony.

It didn't help that I watched both films back to back and could make the obvious comparisons. With the sequel, their first mistake was in trying to keep the same elements, same combinations, similar gimmicks. Their second mistake was in making Rusty positively chatty this time out (different voice, dopey chuckle, it didn't inspire terror it made me laugh). Their third mistake was adopting the torture aspect prevalent in most horror films these days, reducing Rusty to just another run of the mill serial killer.Whereas the first film was rife with tension born of uncertainty and escalating practical jokes, this sequel is just a hack job, literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"I rate it a ZERO","review":"Joy Ride was a good scary movie where no one got killed (except the man in the ice truck), the boys played a prank on Rusty Nail so he messed with them, okay fine, and we know he lived at the end. Part 2 the kids just borrowed the car no big deal, so Rusty Nail tortures them like the movie SAW. I didn't want to give it a poor rating because I don't like torture movies, but he lived at the end??? There's no way! This movie deserves a zero. He even killed a few people which was not what the first one was about. I had to fast forward when these boys were in the garage because whoever thinks up this stuff needs help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"Joy Ride 2 wasn't that bad, having said that it wasn't has good has the first one. It would have been better if they had the Original Rusty Nail in it. This one has alot more gore and murder in it. They left it open for a third movie but, theres only so much they can do with the story before it gets old. If you liked the first one you should at least see part 2. GRADE C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another poor, low-budget cash-in on the name of a good original.","review":"There were too many things wrong with this movie to make it worth while. Joy Ride 1 had most everything this movie had and more and was not such an insult your common sense or the laws of physics not to mention at least several scenes that were so rushed you'd think you hit the Fast FWD by accident.You're better watching the first one over again instead. The end was just barely acceptable and I won't spoil the very end , the producers screwed that up for you too. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 only because I rounded up from 1.5 and it just entertaining enough not to fall asleep.

Also there are 5 trips for WA, 2 for Oregon, and 1 for BC... very Washington centric.

The large went back as well because they were about 4 inches too long. I am not short; I am 5'6\\" and have pretty long legs (about 32\\" inseam) and I don't think I should have to shorten workout pants. I have two pair of Adidas workout pants and, including these, none are of a uniform length. Most likely this reflects different factories. These pants fit more like unisex pants than women's.

Some do, but it is not easy to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"who models these?","review":"I have no clue why the sizing is so off on these pants but I sent them back.

Then again, most things are not like they were a decade ago.Three stars for the downgrade on quality and the ugly color.Good pants, though, for lounging around the house and being lazy.UPDATE: October 2012: I do a regular wash and dry cycle on these pants. I've worn them for a while, they are my go to loungers. Sadly, they shrank in the wash -- lengthwise and widthwise along the waist and hips. Size up if you get a good deal on this.

It was the right choice for me. They fit great. Not too tight. I probably could have gotten into a small, but am certain a small would have been too tight for my liking in the butt and especially the waist (2\\" waistband is pretty thick). They have a generous length, which I like. I wear them just below my natural waist (an inch below my belly button) and the length is perfect with shoes on, but still fine with socks around the house.

I collect all movies that he is in. He just has a cameo in one scene and a few lines. The story in this movie is not for kids and does not make much sense. It is nothing like the Casper cartoons that I watched as a kid that I enjoyed. It has a good cast but their talents are wasted on an awful script. It goes to show you if Steven Spielberg is involved and you spend 50 million dollars on a movie people will come and see it whether it is good or not. Eric Idle of Monty Phython is in it who is normally very funny. They do not use his talents to their advantage in the movie. He doesn't get much in the way of funny scenes. Casper is portrayed pretty well, but he is put in situations that he would have never been in in any of the cartoons.

Songs that everyone knows like \\"Rock n' Roll Music\\", \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" and \\"Johnny B Goode\\" will get your head bobbing even today.

Seek out 'The Great Twenty Eight,' 'Rarities,' 'The Definitive Collection,' and if you want to hear what Chuck sounded like in the '60s, buy 'Golden Hits,' in which Chuck rerecords some of his classics, but with surprisingly great results. The recordings were made in 1967, and they sound surprisingly fresh.The two positives? The sound quality is superb. And all 11 songs on here are classics.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY HANDY!","review":"We've used this sort of product for years at our house. It's handy for all sorts of things. For one thing, we use it for tying trash bags, since the ties that come with them usually aren't long enough. We've also used this plastic-coated wire to cinch up garden plants, make holiday wreathes and control Christmas light cords. A piece of this wire even makes a quick key ring in a pinch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic","review":"Cheap piece of plastic S---. Use it for about 30 minutes hit a tall weed and broke the plastic arm right off where the blades connect. Lost a pin first thing.

My yard is small enough that I mow the grass with an electric mower and never have to change the outlet into which I have the mower connected, so there really isn't a lot of area that needs to be trimmed. After one use, the blades were worn down by at least 30%. On the second use, one blade broke off, unbalancing the product and causing it to essentially explode. One blade flew to my left, while the main assembly and the other blade would have flown directly at me, had they not been deflected by the elevated patio under which I was using it.This is a great concept, but horrible, and potentially dangerous, design execution.Although it's a pain, stick with the trimmer line."},{"rating":"2","title":"hi","review":"I just wanted to say that I just finished reading your book ( I wouldn't put it down lol) and I wanted to personally thank you for your words of insight. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Hot Hot","review":"What a better topic to write about then sex, money and power. This book is a classic and is based upon Christian, psychic and other philosophies and thoughts. Who ever heard of a Christian psychic. This new concept is going to be the wave of the future in the psychic field. That I can guarentee you. I'm a Christian myself and I must admit that I do contact psychics regularly. It's nice to know that Psychic Stephen Piperno is also a Christian that loves Jesus and is a full time practicing psychic. This guy is the real deal. Believe me, I have had a reading by him before and I know that he is correct almost always. He is excellent. I couldn't be more happier with the book. The book can teach you a few new things and it's definetely not boring. It's a cliff hanger and based on a true story. Stephen shares it all. If you ever thought about seeing a psychic or reading a psychic book, I suggest to try this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful book","review":"In life, you realize that sometimes its the good books that you read that help you move ahead. Well, I have found that Piperno's book caught my eye first of all with his captivating title as he covers 3 important topics that we all encounter in our life. I personally felt some of his comments hit the nail on the head with our current society, and his honest approach makes you feel its not a rose tinted approach like many psychic's out there try to use because they want to tell you what you want to hear. Honesty, and clarity in his writing is quite evident so I do recommend this book to everyone at whatever stage they are in their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Appealing","review":"I had to get a copy of this book because these are the exact areas that I have been dealing with. The thought of combining sex, money and power with a psychic book is truly genious. I like the fact that psychic Stephen uses a great blend of words when he writes. It's incredible to see this because he does his work with such honesty and sincerity. I also like the fact that the book was not boring at all and it was more knowledge each time that I read. I enjoyed it very much. Excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I am not a person of much words, but I must say that after reading his book, I had to come here and leave a written comment so that others can explore the reality that many of us face and how his wisdom and from a psychic perspective can help people grow and realize what are the important things we have to face. One of the things that I liked was that it was easy to understand, versus many books out there which leave you puzzled and dealing with such strong issues that the world faces nowadays is so IN KEY with this age and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe any of these reviews are genuine","review":"This book is horrible. Though the author endlessly preaches about giving himself to the Lord and of the angels rejoicing over this, what really annoyed me was the poor writing/editing. Terrible grammar abounds, and why is there no end-of-line hyphenation??After reading a few reviews (come on---everyone gave this 5 stars??), I can see the author has gotten people to bombard Amazon with excessive praise for his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"I have to agree with the person who said all the 5 star reviews are suspicious. I don't know how anyone could like this book?I would rather sit through a 10 hour sermon - at least then I wouldn't have to deal with the poor spelling, grammar, etc. It's LOSE, not LOOSE!!In addition, the title is a bit misleading. This book is a daft Christians point of view, not a psychic's. It's also disturbingly male-centric.I feel kinda bad for badmouthing a book like this, but I really don't want anyone to buy it based on all the good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutly Terrible Boring- Doesn't Make Sense","review":"I also think the prior reviews of the book are fake. The author writes a strange & unusual incoherent outlook on life etc...None of it seems to really make any sense or have a point. It's lots of preaching and God talks with himself which makes me wonder if he's not mentally disturbed and hearing voices in his head. He often mentions \\"God said to me\\" or \\"God told me\\" etc...and to be so infatuated with the bible from childhood seems like he's a bit off balance & obsessed with religion. No good advice in this book- just rambles. What part of him is Psychic & a Prophet - NONE! Where does he get this psychic & prophesy stuff? He's neither!! This also makes me think he's self glorified & rather disturbed. Strange reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Applauded","review":"I highly applaud this book because it's definetely an original to say the least. Solid, firm and to the point. No beating around the bush here or guessing games. The book is about sex, money and power from a psychics point of view for sure. Excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Felt","review":"Heart felt book. Piperno really puts his mind and heart into this book. He invites you into his heart and shares with you the lessons from his prophetic mentor and spirit guide. This book truly is life changing. I wish that I could have found this book earlier in my life. I probably would have far less problems now. Magnificant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats the odds","review":"In this book, psychic stephen piperno beats the odds and let's viewers see how easy it is to deal with your sexuality and inner psychic self. The way that he uses passion in all of his writing is extremely unique and interesting. I am happy to say that this psychic has helped me to understand my culture and surroundings. I think that stephen has a way with words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"I first learned about psychic Stephen Piperno's book from a well organized review from bookwire (owned by bowker). After reading the book review I decided to glance at it on this website and I fell in love with it. It's original and it really makes you think. This book has a lot of useful information and it has touched my life more than what I can see. Psychic Stephen is a true jem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond my expectations","review":"I was impressed by the professionalism of this book. Psychic Stephen Piperno is clearly not your average psychic. He touches on some preety critical areas here. As a matter of fact, I can't think of any other book that covers all of these areas. I'ts a diamond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Imagination","review":"Powerful and creative imagination when it comes to sex, money and power. The author takes his views and puts them all into easy to read chapters. This book is one of a kind and I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a book that has to do with sex or any of the other topics listed here. It helps you to truly control your sexual appetite and be true to God. This book was not what I expected and it has touched my life in various ways. I'm happy to say that Piperno is a kind and gentle psychic. He has a heart of gold and I appreciate this book. It's truly one of a kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I needed to hear","review":"Just what I needed to hear. I like the fact that this book explains sexual spirituality in such detail. It makes you see the fact that our spirituality has a lot to do with sex, money and power. We can all truly learn from this book and what it has to offer us as a whole society. The earth as a whole can benefit from reading this book to ensure the life that we all have hear is plentiful and good. The energy that comes out of this book is very high and direct. I love the Opportunity that we can all receive when learning new things. This book has new concepts and it's brought me back to my faith in Jesus Christ. Stephen Pipern is a great man of God and I would definetely recommend this book to anyone that is looking to learn how to heal your sexual broken spirit or to deal with money issus or even your spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Sincere Psychic Book","review":"This book has a tremendous amount of sincerity and honestly. The integrity level of this book is not only high, but necessary. When someone is teaching about sex, money and power, it must be taught with great care as every word will make a difference. I thought that this book was highly motivated by the spirit world and I suspect that many other people got the same general feelings. I truly enjoyed this book and I would say that it's now one of my favorits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh god, I didn't....Did I?","review":"Now when this musical medley happened to come into my position through the one they call Amazon, I was damn excited. I grabbed myself a big ole' bowl o' me favorite popper corn, and sat myself in front of my stereo system. My smile of anticipation soon turned to utter disgust when the Top Gun theme blew through my eardrums.

At best it was ok as a B movie. Some of the actors very good. The rest just ok. All in all this was a amaturish low budget movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadowheart","review":"Well, where do I start with this review? This movie had great scenery, but the acting was bad. It was more a made for T.V. movie. The plot started out great, with a Preacher, and sweet son, and then came the bad guy, who took over the town. By the middle of the movie it became more cheesy than anything good. I would say this would qualify for a Hallmark movie, my husband hated this movie and made rude comments about it being cheesy throughout the whole thing. I thought it was okay, there was no sex, and only one curse word that I could remember, yet there was some violence, not bad considering the normal violent movies. Although James did seek revenge in this movie, it was just deserved. I hated the bad guy too, and I guess that means he played his part well. If you want to view this movie, just rent it, not worth seeing over. This movie was kind of preachy, but that's okay, it's just that this movie was actually really cheesy, but worth at least one viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mess....","review":"I am writing to warn lovers of Westerns to avoid this movie. It is a dull, plodding, uninspiring Western that should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it...","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. It brought many tears to my eyes. I thought the acting was great (with the exception of the male Indian) & I liked the story. In a way it reminded me of some of my historical romance novels to an extent. I don't think this movie would appeal to too many men out there but I think most women would enjoy it. As another reviewer stated, my only real problem was that when we jumped ahead 15 years or so in the story most of the adults looked the exact same as they had at the beginning of the movie. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie & I would recommend it for women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am sorry but this movie is boring, pointless, and a waste of time. I have to agree with many other reviewers here ... 2 over 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does for Westerns What Christian Rock Does for Rock","review":"If you preferred \\"The Apple Dumpling Gang\\" to \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\", you just might sit through \\"Shadowheart\\" in its entirety.Otherwise, stilted acting, horrible makeup, an awful, treacly, by-the-numbers plot, and a screenplay which must consist of large quantities of capital letters to drive the morality play home will drive you to push Eject long before the final act.Just. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refreshingly Moderate Pace","review":"It seems like most movies are non-stop action or so boring you may fall asleep. Shadowheart falls nicely in the middle ground.Aside from the nice pace of development, Shadowheart lacked any \\"sizzle\\". The acting was unremarkable. The scenery was unremarkable. The plot was depressing.There really isn't much to say about this movie. The villain is totally disgusting and so you definitely want to see the hero get revenge or justice, but the ending is really nothing more than depressing. Sure it might have been cliche to have a \\"successful/cheerful\\" ending but it would have been a lot better than how this plot failed.Even though this is probably considered a \\"western romance\\" it really completely lacked romance. There are a couple of Native Americans that could have been great characters but the opportunity was completely lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"As a child, Bounty Hunter James Conner saw his father killed, and fled leaving his home and the love of his life. Returning years later after fighting in the Civil War, James is planning to wed his lost love and exact his own brand of justice on the evil land baron, Will Tunney. Returning to Legend, New Mexico and capturing the one who ruined his life doesn't prove as easy as he thought. While I was excited to get a movie thru the Vine Program, I was a little disappointed. \\"Shadowheart\\" wasn't as good as I had hoped. The cinematography wasn't that exciting, the music wasn't that good and it was kind of low budget. I am not even sure if it was worthy of being shown on the Lifetime channel. However, what merits the \\"2\\" rating, was the ending. Like traditional westerns, this ending wasn't flowery or pretty, but believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Terrible.","review":"Well I don't want to be mean for the sake of being mean, but this is a terrible movie. It is poorly acted, poorly written, and it's has a few scenes that the direction would make a high school drama club cringe. In addition the movie has vaguely Christian themes, but no substance. The only real enjoyment I got out of this was heckling it with my friends. There is a review on the cover that says it is the best western since \\"Tombstone\\"; That is a bold face lie. In addition it says that it has Daniel Baldwin on the cover. Now I'm not a Baldwin fan but it is always a sign of a bad movie when they list the biggest actor on the cover and he has maybe 5 lines and about 30 seconds on screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"As the old cliche goes, there's nothing like a good western....","review":"And this was nothing like a good western. There is a scene in the movie where the lead actor says that he has seen things so terrible that a good God couldn't have allowed them, the filming of this movie might have been one of them. Terrible acting combined with a predictable script, and a lousy score all combine to make this a c-grade movie. The one purpose this movie does serve is that for all of you western fans who have heard one to many times that John Wayne can't act, you could now loan this movie to them to prove he could. I will say however, that there is very little violence, no bad language, etc... so you could in theory show this to your children, though why they or you would want to see it is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"\\"The best western since Tombstone\\" huh? Not bloody likely. Shadowheart follows a revenge-driven man (Justin Ament) seeking vengeance upon the amoral Will (Angus MacFadyen) for the death of his father (William Sadler) years before. He returns to the town he grew up in and re-acquaints himself with a lost love (Marnie Alton). What really hurts Shadowheart more than anything is the ultra-cliche nature of it all. Everything featured in this film has been seen in plenty of westerns before it, and done much, much better as a result. The film is so predictable from beginning to end, and it way too long in running time to boot. Seriously, it doesn't take too long until it feels like torture getting through this film. The horrible acting and sloppy direction don't help matters here either. All in all, Shadowheart is by and far something worth avoiding. No matter how much you may love the western genre, do yourself a favor and avoid this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"It deserves a no star review.","review":"This was the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. The story is weak. The actors are flat. The first 5 minutes make you realize you are watching a movie that was not good enough to be \\"made for TV\\". I cannot say enough bad things about this film. It is indescribably awful.

You'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disapointment","review":"This beautifully shot movie has some great acting and beautiful scenery, but the mixed messages of revenge/retribution/stopping evil/forgiveness are never fully explored or explained.

My family was left looking at each other like...\\"What?\\" Great potential, but not realized."},{"rating":"1","title":"INEPTLY DIRECTED -- POORLY WRITTEN","review":"What a disappointment.This movie sets out to tell a story of \\"forgiveness and redemption\\" (according to the extras). It does neither. How sad to get into a story that's afraid, or does not know how, to resolve what has been set up. I love Westerns but this tedious, overlong, and way too talky dud is firing blanks.This film purports to be about spirituality. In fact, it has the trappings of a \\"Christian production.\\" But sadly, it is without a soul. Or commercial prospects. I'm glad I saw it for free. I wonder, just who is the intended audience? I can't imagine.There's a powerful story in the premise. But I guess no one involved in the production actually experienced forgiveness or redemption. Hollywood can do that to a person. I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor effort","review":"I could almost hear Don LaFontaine's voice over trailer in my head \\"Starring no-one, you've ever heard of\\" as I began this movie, but thought I would give it a chance, as I love the Western movie genre.Trouble is that it's been done infinitely better than this, and as good an idea of trying to revive the western (again) this is a dry, and boring flick.The script is actually not that bad, predictable but still OK, it just never gets going. Everyone seems to be spending so much time being laconic and \\"in character\\" they forget to actually act.Not too much else to say really.

I would definitely recommend this product to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent glimpse of life during the Civil War.","review":"With its well-written introduction, this marvelous book is a great way to read about one aspect of life during the American Civil War.These recipes are taken verbatim from a magazine that was fairly widely read by the ladies of the North and South. They are all dated with the year they were published, in some cases more than once. There's a glossary and notes to help you read the somewhat antique language. There's also a wonderful reference list, with lots of titles for the Civil War historian to look for.I wanted this book because I love being in the kitchen. I also wanted to improve my knowledge of history, as seen through the eyes of the wives, mothers and daughters. As a genealogist, this book enhances what little I know about my female Civil War ancestors. As an added bonus, many of these recipes sound recreateable in the modern kitchen!

It simply will NOT run.Intuit used to be a good company with good products and good customer service and tech support. But that was 10 years ago. Now? Lousy everything. I know more about their products than their tech support people. They seem to have been pulled off the street and given one hour of training.I may try Tax Cut but I'm bummed about the review below that says TT is better than Tax Cut.

I've already wasted 2.5 hours on this, the mirror site download would've taken over 6.5 hours.

You cannot update your state information after the initial review without manually editing the tax forms. If the field involves computations, you must do these manually after changing it. If you try to re-run the interview, it just brings you to the \\"finish\\" screen. I talked to four different people from TurboTax support about this. They say it's a known bug and they have no plans to fix it. If I wanted to manually edit to forms, I wouldn't have purchased this software! If you make changes to the federal, TurboTax state isn't necessarily updated. I received the following ridiculous suggestions from support: clear your cookies (I'm not using the web version); delete this file, but make sure you empty the recycling bin (what??); go to forms and click delete form (there is no delete option).

I told it to download one state but it downloaded another instead, and now wants me to pay $30 for the state I asked for in the first place. Customer service fixed that for me, thankfully. The program itself is easy to use, like all such programs, but in some combinations of filing status and income, makes huge errors in calculations.

The InstallShield Wizard closes when it gets to the \\"Searching for Installed components\\" screen. It does not generate error message. I get the chat support and the tech could not resolve it and tried to give me a pay support phone line, which costs $9.99 per incident? After more research, multiple problems with update and State download. Back to my problem, I found a work around from a user forum. Intuit has posted a work around. So Intuit knew about the problem and still ship the product to customers.

For some ridiculous reason, though, this year the company decided to not include support for ISOs and ESPP sales in TT Deluxe. They expect you to pay an extra 30 bucks to have them calculate those. I guess they figure that it's OK for them to rip you off if you benefitted from either of these. Ridiculous!!

None of the keys for installing the State version work on the Mac, according to Intuit. Replacement Mac CDs will not be available until \\"late January or February.\\" Obviously, this also thwarts the use of TurboTax Federal since state tax liability is deductible from federal taxes.

When I talked to some lady there and explained what my problem was and that I couldn't get it solved by using their 800 number, she in a very unfriendly and snotty manner told me there was nothing she could do and that I would have to use the 800 number.This company like many others makes it very difficult to get answers to problems with their product.No more Turbo Tax for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Indeed, multistate won't install on a Mac","review":"My conversations with Intuit tech support and cust. service confirm the \\"late January or February\\" target\\" for a Mac-installable multistate disc. Yet the company continues to shamelessly market the product without so much as a notice on its web site. They told me they plan to publish such a notice, but when? In my view Intuit is a) incompetent for delivering a product to market that can't be installed; and b) unethical for not pulling the product off the market, and even more so for stonewalling the problem. They have not learned the lessons of Tylenol or Watergate.I didn't use TurboTax last year because the 02 product was so problematic. Now the only competitor for the Mac has vanished, leaving this dodgy product and company the only game in town. Shameful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Purchased the Deluxe version that had a rebate and claimed to have the state included. Based on previous experience with TurboTax I knew it meant a download... not a problem.Then the problems hit. First TurboTax did not recognize my DSL connection. The only help from TurboTax was to download the update file and manually install. OK, just a bump in the road.Then I go to download the state tax and it wants a creditcard. Why? No mention in the hardcopy documentation, nothing on the outside of the box. Finally found the info buried in the help menu. Pay for the download then get a rebate. Wait a minute wasn't this included. Purchasing state and submitting rebates is very confusing (I've used the product for almost 10 years). Still unsure if rebate will be paid, tried to call support 20 minute wait no answer. Tried online support via messaging given the brush off twice.

Even with some of the most expensive software, information is not properly transferred to the state return, especially in WI where everything is behind, inbetween and many cases, manual adjustments need to be made. If you have children in college or are trying to maximize your deductions through self-employment or retirement contributions, or strategize double itemizing, you need a professional or a long time to read IRS and state Pubs. There is no magic box, but you can find a reasonable tax preparer without all of the fancy overhead such as the ones trying to sell you a guarantee that they did their work properly. Yikes! In the long run it is better to really have PEOPLE than the sea monkeys in a box. Worst part is the IRS/states are so far behind, you won't even know if you messed up until about two years later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"turbotax sucks","review":"Whatever you do, don't get this tax program. It took me forever to do my taxes on it. When I was finally done with my taxes, turbotax found an error and wanted me to download to fix the errors so I tried and that was a mistake. It wouldn't download anything! The program kept telling me it could not find anything to download! What really made me upset about turbotax is the electronic file. Turbotax charges you 14.95 for each tax form you want to send electronically and an additional 19.95 if you want to direct deposit! For all the money I paid for this crappy program I am to get ripped off an additional fifty bucks!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked nicely on a Mac","review":"TurboTax Deluxe 2004 worked easily for me. I did my taxes on a Mac (OS X, Jaguar 10.2.8) following the whole process -- 1) installed software on computer, 2) downloaded updates and free state download, 3) prepared fed and state tax forms, and lastly 4) e-filed the completed returns. All went smoothly without a hitch. I subscribe to the automatic renewal plan. I prefer this method rather than having to go buy the boxes of software and clip out the proof of purchases for rebates each year. Thus, each year around Christmas time, I get the annual Turbotax CD by postal mail. Then when it is superbowl time, I remember to bring out the CD and do my taxes. I like to keep the process simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother with this software","review":"Last year I had problems with downloading the state forms.

Nasty experience this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"why is everyone complaining?","review":"I have never had a problem in any year with Turbotax. I will admit that they are continuously changing the interface, and sometimes not for the better. And I don't like being asked several times to buy their products, especially It's Deductible for non-money charitable contributions. But why is everyone complaining about sending in rebates? Was there ever a time when you did NOT have to send in for a rebate? At least this year they let you go online and fill in information which then print out a completed form for you. You still got State for free, a $10 rebate for TT, and a free electronic filing if you bought the Deluxe version. What do you people want, for pete's sake. The software does what it is supposed to do for a reasonable price. Go ahead, try the other software. You will find like I did that TT is the best there is, even if it is not perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hiddens That Make the Sofware Useless","review":"We have used TurboTax previously without too many problems, although updating the product has always been an issue. In previous years, the issue has been the amount of time and retries it's taken to update the software. This time, we were nearly through with our return this year, when we got to a screen where we were asked if we'd like to update the software. We said, \\"Yes,\\" and proceeded to lose all the information that we'd just worked so hard to input. I contacted Intuit and was told that in order for the software to update properly, you have to turn off your firewall, turn off your virus checker, and not be connected through a router. That does not sound reasonable; it sounds scary. There must be another product out there which is comparable to TurboTax, but which actually works the way it should without expecting you to expose your computer to risk the way Intuit apparently requires you to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Automatic Updating Turns Program to Junk","review":"Intuit releases the program full of bugs and omissions and periodically releases updates to fix this. O.K. Not ideal, but TaxCut does the same thing.However, this year, TurboTax not infrequently has a problem in the updates. The TT website suggests that you uninstall *everything* and try reinstalling from the CD and then updating again from scratch. Did that. However, an uninstall doesn't really clean out everything and it still can't update. At this point, I just can't reliably use the program and I can't get the updates that are necessary to make the program work. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turbo Tax 2004 - Not what it use to be","review":"If you were like me and were expecting your normal Turbo Tax upgrade, will get ready for a surprise!The engineers in an attempt to make it look like a web application, have screwed the whole thing up.

You are just better off paying someone to do your taxes or if you have a really simple one, just do it yourself. Also, there are so many places online that are free. The deluxe version is complete BS, it doesn't give you anything extra, you still have to download your files just like with the cheaper versions. The customer service for this company is TERRIBLE. I was charged three times on my debit card for e-filing. It took me three different phones calls, during my work hours, and being on hold for 20-30 minutes to get it straight. (All this while talking to a rude person who barely understands me and I can barely understand him). Plus, the extra $60 they had charged me erroneously caused other transactions to bounce and I was charged insufficient funds charges from my bank. That was another phone call during my lunch to fix something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last year for TurboTax","review":"As a 7+ year TT user, I've got to say that 2004 will be my last year.

This was previously included in Deluxe, but no warning was given that they made this change (fewer features for the same price). Plus I'm tired of the terrible support and the annual rebate game they force me to play to get my $10 or $30 back.

It was hidden.So far, Intuit's support system has been useless about curing the defect.I have written to the Federal Trade Commission about what I think was deceptive marketing. Being what it is, the FTC will probably do nothing.

I highly recommend buying this book as well as all the other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any Poppleton for first readers","review":"My little niece is having reading issues and Sylvan recommended this series of books. She really likes the little pig and friends and likes reading about them. I got them and read them prior so when she reads over the phone to me I can help her sounding out the big words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Familiar fright fare","review":"A typical horror film, albeit done with skill. The first half is pretty much just a sequence of fright scenes. Then it switches to a psychological story with supernatural elements which I found much more interesting. The finale, however, is predictable and not very scary.The lovely Ha Ji Won is the star and she's joined by some beautiful actresses that are equally put upon. But it's gonna be 5-year-old Eun Seo-woo who's gonna make the deepest impression on you. I promise. She has about a dozen scenes scattered thru out the movie with her stunningly acted climactic scene coming shortly before the film's climax. I'll bet she'll amaze you even if the story or the other actors don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucktacular","review":"Not only was this movie not even the least bit frightening, the plot was convoluted, boring, and well...it just plain sucked. Take it from a horror movie aficionado and skip this one, or at the very least rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring not frightening","review":"Another telephone horror flick. Only this movie did not produce a single thrill.I had to fight to stay awake during this one. Also, most of the plot seemed to be borrowed from some other movie.Don't waste your time or your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be careful before reading other reviews.","review":"I looked through the reviews below and many of them are chock full of spoilers. Perhaps it's best that you just watch this movie without finding anything out about it first as it's the sort of movie that is far more enjoyable if you go in without knowing too much about it.As for my commentary, this is not really a horror, but more like a mystery and dark drama involving a ghost. It's not really scary, and I don't think it's really meant to be. It has a very mysterious style, but the plot is what this is about.If you thought the plot of The Ring was great, but don't need the horror aspect so much, then you will love this one. It's a very similar style, in which a person must investigate the ghost that haunts her and the plot turns in many directions as it unfolds to gradually explain the meaning of the haunting. I thought this movie was absolutely brilliant, but if you go in just looking for a good scare, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy little girl","review":"The crazy little girl is very, very, scary in this movie. A woman works to uncover peoples secrets and reveal them to the world. When her life is threatened she keeps her guard up. She starts receiving weird phone calls. Her niece also starts to act strange. It's a lovely tail of jealousy and murder. This one is a little complicated but a good thriller all the same"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie, decide for yourself!","review":"this movie is the reason i got into asian horror in the first place. It is more of a 'suspense/psychological thriller' than anything else. it THANKfully lacks gore and slasher-film elements and relies entirely on the story to freak you out. It would be considered more of a ghost-story than 'horror' by what I can only deem to be 'hard-core asian/j-horror officionados', as it would appear from other reviews that some people find it too tame. I quite prefer the asian suspense thriller films in place of the gross-out slasher-flicks anyways, so this film appealed to me. --While it does get moderately predictable at the end, it is still quite a fun journey, with exceptional acting, great film quality, and you won't be sorry you've spent some time watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest hits, gene watson","review":"Grew up listening to gene, his best songs are on this cd. Paper Rosie, Farewell Party, Where Love Begins, and many more. recommend this highly.You want be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Gene Watson - 18 Greatest Hits","review":"Here again we are also Fans of Gene Watson and havemany of his tapes and Records - now collecting his CD'sLove his voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gene Watson","review":"I grew up listening to country music and in my opinion, Gene Watson is one of the best and one of the most underrated country singers. I got to see him in person last summer and he was great. Amazon.com has a great selection"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE CD FOR A GENE WATSON FAN!","review":"LOST MY ORIGINAL 18 GREATEST HITS CD, SO HAD TO REORDER A 2ND COPY. CD HAS A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF HARD TO FIND SONGS INCLUDING TWO OF MY FAVORITES: PAPER ROSIE AND THE OLD MAN AND HIS HORN. THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS COLLECTION OF HITS AND FEEL THAT IT WELL WORTH SPENDING THE MONEY TO REPLACE MY LOST ORIGINAL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"remastered masterpiece","review":"\\"My mommy told me, If I were goody, she would buy me a rubber dolly\\". I consider this cd the rubber dolly of Iggy records. As reflected in the opening statement, maturity is not a concern. Some people claim the content of this record even steps over the \\"Iggy\\" standards. So what. This cd shows Iggy at his finest as only he could pull it off. This is one of the few solo efforts by Iggy which holds my attention through every song especially \\"I'm a Conservative\\" (although the two additional songs are less than spectacular). For those who are into Iggy will enjoy this cd. For those who aren't, they will ask us to grow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough Yumminess to Make it Worth Your Money","review":"There are some songs I skip often enough but there are enough classics on here to make the album more than worth your money. If this were your first Iggy album, you'd still be hooked on him. You should know this is not one of his \\"serious\\" or \\"hard\\" albums. It's mostly fun & silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this CD sucks!","review":"Soldier is a terrible, boring confused mess. Try BEAT EM UP, RAW POWER, FUN HOUSE, or SKULL RING for Iggy at his best.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin' as a conservative","review":"This is a great album. It is sincere and loud. Everytime I listen to it, I go green with envy about not being a conservative...This is a strange album, as there is no lead guitar. But bass and vox take center-stage in an admirable way. It's full of force, intelligence and sarcastic wittiness.This is a fulfilling album. Even after nearly 20 years, it is important for today, with special focus on \\"Playing It Safe\\" (He said this is sickening...) and \\"I'm a conservative (Sometimes I pause for a drink...).I don't know Iggy personally, but on the grounds of this record, I am sure we would get along pretty well. We'd probably pause for a drink together... and laugh at the half-assed conservatives who have taken the song for real.It's a great buy. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"somewhat on the mellow side...sort of","review":"Iggy Pop has put out some of the most controversial songs ever recorded to disk, and tracks like DOG FOOD, KNOCKIN' THEM DOWN (IN THE CITY) and I SNUB YOU are no exception. Sadly, those are the best three on the entire album. To be fair, it's not a bad album, but some of the songs are rooted in keyboard-driven garage rock (LOCO MOSQUITO)that lessens the impact. The two bonus tracks are pretty good, the second one an instrumental. Either way, if you're into Iggy doing garage rock, or if you wanna hear three ripping tracks that could've come straight off a Dead Boys album, then get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"backtothebeginning","review":"\\"My mommy told me if i was goody she would buy me a rubber dolly\\". A very Stooges way to start an album, which is what makes it so good. After two albums with the great David Bowie, Iggy returns to smudge it in your face rock n' roll. \\"Loco Mosquito\\" rocks hard as does \\"Dog Food\\". And \\"Play It Safe\\" should be considered an all-time Iggy classic. Iggy surrounds himself with one of the best backing bands of all time for this one. Definitely a must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scandanavian Drama","review":"Loved the books, loved the PBS Kenneth Branagh version and then discovered the Swedish TV series. I felt the Branagh series was how non-Scandanavians picture Sweden although the last 3 produced are grittier and more like the TV Series. The Swedish version is superior in reproducing Mankell's vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Satisfied","review":"We are totally happy with these vids. They have a different slant on detective work than we are used to seeing but because of that, we are enjoying them immensely. Mankell's works are excellent and, although not quite on a par with Sherlock Holmes, they are definitely worthwhile as well as thoroughly entertaining. A \\"must see\\" for anyone into the \\"Millenium Trilogy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly","review":"What's better than cozy flannel to sleep on? And these are no exception.

Quality of material is good, medium thickness, correct amount of warmth required. However after two machine washings the stitching along one of the pillowcases came undone and had to be resewn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful...then you wash them...","review":"These sheets are very nice looking and quite soft. HOWEVER, on first wash, they got all \\"pilly\\" and look like I've had them for years, not one day. They still feel nice, they just don't look as nice as they should. If you plan NEVER to wash them, they're perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"They looked great out of the package, but are completely pilled up now that they've been washed three times. I would not recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"No pilling here!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this sheet set. I have washed everything per the care tags -- basic wash/dry, no delicate cycle or dry clean -- and I have had no problems with pilling, AND these are the softest, coziest sheet set I have. It can be difficult to get cozy in a King size bed, but the fibers of this set definitely make it possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks just like my ERNIE","review":"I carry this \\"toy\\" on the dashboard of my car. He is a constant reminder of my dearly departed cat ERNIE. He is a very welcome sight. If you don't want to carry him with you in your car, you can put him beside your bed or easy chair and cuddle him.
