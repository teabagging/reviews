And Matthew has been in a series of lame movies recently (Fool's Gold, Failure to Launch, Sahara, etc.) It's such a shame that Matthew went from what I thought was a stellar performance in Contact (of course, it was truly a well written script AND I think he did lots of great things with his role) to this. It's one giant cliche, really obvious plot lines, and for no point. And don't get me wrong, I can imagine how difficult it must be to write a romantic comedy in this day and age when there's been thousands that have gone before. It's hard to be original. And likewise, it's hard for an actor to do something that hasn't been done before (or at least not done a lot of in the past). Tons of history and precedence.

I prefer the Penguin Classics version, translated by Pevear and Volokhonsky."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book EVER!","review":"Anna Karenina is the most believable and empathetic female character ever created.Tolstoy, as always, creates a complicated world of many different seductive love stories andlife-stories, all of which are woven beautifully together through Anna's eyes.The plot of _Anna Karenina_ is one that remains remarkably current, even in our changing worldand distinct culture (from that of Tolstoy's turn-of-the-century Russia). More thanjust a classic tale though, Anna is a classic character- one whom every woman can identifywith on some level. Tolstoy is a genius for being able to appropriate the minds of somany diverse characters to make everyone involved so life-like and charming._Anna Karenina_ is a book that must be read again and again. It is a book which willmean more and more to the reader throughout each stage in his/her life. And finally, it is a book whichwill never fail to entertain and move even the most jaded reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wouldnt buy it.","review":"War and peace was brilliant. Anna Karenina isn't. Her character may be complex but it's nothing extraordinary. This book is not a tragedy -- anyone as confused as anna should die asap. Her son's slow and forced forgetting of her is a lot more interesting than her but only occupies a page or two out of 600. There's only one passage here worth looking at for language's sake -- the description of what she sees when she kills herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good trans great price.","review":"Decent translation of the book and it's always a fantastic read. Picked up this copy for a friend and gave it a read through jsut to be sure it was a decent print. Much better than some of the awful translations out there and I was confident in gifting the book to someone who has never read it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading must be a passion","review":"When I first began this book, it was pretty daunting, but I have a passion for reading so I stuck to it and was really pleased whenI finished. The story is interesting and Anna is a lady before her time. There are complaints aboutthe translation, honestly, I don't get too caught up in the hype. So long as it is English, I am pretty good to go. I could care less if someone translated a Russian word wrong, trust me, I wouldn't kow either way.This is a long read, and I actually put it down for a few weeks and then came back to it, but if you have a passion for reading, and for the classics, then definitely, give this one a go."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow moving and boring.","review":"good to have the footnotes at the end of each chapter.

The strength of the Xenophobe guides is their short coverage, rather than the insights of the Culture Shock! series. I read this one in about 40 minutes, and it helped me understand some of the key issues among the Belgians. It covered current issues, with very little history, and provided enough background to appreciate some basic aspects of Belgian culture. Although a little light-hearted in its discussion, I feel comfortable passing it on to a Belgian friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually I was quite suprised.","review":"Well I was forced to sit down and watch this DVD with my niece while at my brothers house.

It gives readers a top notch education about all these group applications that are supposed to help us be more productive. Since so many of them are showing up in Netscape, Microsoft and other main-line business applications, it's great to have an easy-to-use and really right-on tool. My only complaint is that the book is so big, over 600 pages. There's just a lot of information in there, but the chapters are very well organized and focused. I highly recommend the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Completely Biased. Inaccurate. One-sided.","review":"I heard about bias in academia but that did not prepare me for this book. The bias and political agenda of the authors was so apparent it was insulting to read. They leave out information that does not support their agenda and dismiss little inconviences like the Constituion. Do not belief, for one second, that you are getting balanced information or an accurate representation of party views. This is a sophmoric demonization of everyone the authors don't agree with and the promotion to sainthood of everyone on they do agree with. This book was used for a Masters program but it will most likely be replaced. Strangely enough, most grad students want to make up their own minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent introduction in the United States Congress","review":"\\"Congress and Its Members\\" is an excellent textbook for any government student wanting a thorough introduction into the actions and events of the United States' Senate and House of Representatives.

The translation of his poems in this book seems to be very adequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reef Fishes of the Red Sea","review":"This text was a great disappointment in a number of respects. It covers only the most common of reef fishes in the Red Sea, with many omissions. The photos are small. Most are about 3\\"x2\\", with some as small as 1 1/2\\"x1\\". The photo quality varies, and a number of them are taken against backgrounds or in light conditions which obscure the fish. Some of the pictures are a frank embarrassment. For example, the Blackfin Barracuda on page 177 & Red Sea Houndfish on page 179 are nearly indecipherable. Which particular fish are given any meaningful description appears capricious, are few & far between, and the detail provided is generally very scanty. Fish with multiple possible names are often identifed using only one.In my opinion, the text by Helmut Debelius, \\"Red Sea Reef Guide,\\" with 321 pages (compared to only 192) & over 1000 (compared to only perhaps 350)large, high quality photos, and costing just $2.49 more, is a far superior value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"The video adds nothing to the Garmen instructions.

In other words the entire book can be summed up as \\"I know something you don't know...nah, nah, nah, nah, boo boo\\". If you want to write a book telling me something I don't know, that's cool...but if you just wanted to let me know that you're privy to some great secret that I'm not cool enough to be told about, then go screw yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous!","review":"Esoteric Christianity is a beautiful path...in this book the \\"lesser mysteries\\" are a balm to my soul and have helped to alleviate that disquiet voice that has so often railed against organized religion.

While some users may disagree with the latter statement, one must realize that the laity can never replace the priest and his duties to BLESS and serve his flock. Instead, a family may pray together, but begin to interact (as able) with a traditional priest and/or deacon. Try inviting a good one over for dinner and ask to bless the home-rooms and all. The replacement of the Church's traditional values and teaching began before Vatican II and we are seeing the destruction at present, from pitiful Sunday attendance to clergy abuse and lack of leadership. This book simply promotes the degradation of our traditional values-as seen in all parts of society, including many \\"Catholic\\" homes."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor vent","review":"The ventilation did not perform as well as headsweats.

Her illumination of the emerging transgender liberation movement is unparalleled and piercing, and the book remains as visionary today as it was when it was published. A 'must read' for anyone with an interest in transgender politics, it places the blame for the violent brutality inflicted on transsexuals, transgenderists and crossdressers squarely on the narrowness of our cultural gender ideals."},{"rating":"2","title":"carb","review":"This is excellent for anyone who has to count carbs, in particular Diabetics.

I EVEN PUT THEM ON A WHOLE FRESH BATCH OF GREEN BANANAS AND THEY ALL SPOILED BEFORE I COULD EAT THEM. WHEN THE BANANAS SPOILED, IT WASN'T A GRADUAL RIPENING LIKE NORMAL BANANAS, BUT THEY LOOKED LIKE REFRIGERATED BANANAS WOULD HAVE LOOKED. AWFUL PRODUCT, AND VERY DISAPPOINTING TO MY FAMILY.

When I wrote to the vendor about this, he said 'make sure to dry the fruit before it is put into the bag', which makes sense, but the fruit had been dry. Condensation formed in the bag overnight and never left. The odor of the plastic bag made the bananas smell and taste rancid. Too bad.

Very fast and brutal, very melodic, and very well produced and executed. I think a lot of people are confused on the whole black metal scene. I don't at all consider this type of music to be even closely related to black metal, except maybe for the vocal style. I am a huge fan of most types of metal, but black metal is not one of them. There are no scary satan-worshipping face-painted mongoloids in this band, just a few guys who really know how to play some kick ass death rock. This album is along the same lines as At the Gates' Slaughter of the Soul---an instant classic. Although I own all of Kalmah's albums, I still like this one the best, but Swampsongs is a very close second. This album is very typical of what a lot of Finnish metal bands sound like.(of course I mean that in a good way) So if you like Children of Bodom or Norther, I think you will definately like Kalmah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I had seen this cd many times on the shelves but disregarded it because of the cheesy death metal image (monster-like illustration on the cover, photo of long haired, black wearing, mean looking dudes standing in a dark forest or something like that, etc).

Europeans really know their stuff when it comes to Metal. The rest of the band is incredible too. Though, I've never been a HUGE fan of Death Metal vocalists, Kalmah's vocals blend in with the instruments very nicely.

A binaural beat, say at 400Hz and at 405Hz (tones you CAN hear), laced within the music causes the brain to produce the difference in values -- 5Hz -- as seen on an EEG. You are NOT supposed to be listening for it, as \\"smackpixi\\" pointed out, you are physically incapable of that.

The problem is the range that the *transmitter* has from your remote, which is about four feet. In other words, you can't use your remote more than four feet from the transmitter because it won't pick up the signal: I suppose you could place it on your coffee table or ottoman, but it needs to be plugged in and it would kind of defeat the purpose of having such a piece of equipment.

I know its not my remote because I have much better range when I had the DVD player out in the open, and I can see the IR receiver flashing on my TV 10 feet away indicating its picking up the remotes signal.This is a complete waste of money unless you intend to put the receiver on a end table right next your chair...just remember you will have to turn and point the remote directly at the receiver if you want it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Range and Performance","review":"The transmitter relies on perfect line of sight and only seems to work when within 1 foot of the Transmitter!

This makes it intermittent at best. At night is seems to be better than daytime but not perfect. I disconnected the transmitter and it still has the constant stream of bad commands coming out of it. I am sure that's the problem because the remote that comes with my DVR won't work when this unit is pointed at it (even with the transmitter disconnected), and when I cover this unit, the DVR remote works great.So, they broadcast every bit of noise at the 418 MHz range.

Only a few minor drawbacks -- it doesn't come with a remote, which would be handy, especially in the car; it only features 10 presets (other units have 30); the traffic \\"jump\\" button is flaky; the FM tuner in the crowded LA market doesn't work so hot -- a direct line is much better.Those are relatively minor criticisms (unless you don't have a direct line into your radio and have to rely on the FM tuner) for an otherwise decent unit.

Even with the addition of the external transmitter antenna hooked up, this unit barely has enough power, ( even with the external antenna less than a foot from the car's FM antenna) for the car receiver to pick up the internally generated FM signal, Any competing FM signal regardless of how faint, compromises the signal from the internal FM Transmitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satellite radio is dead","review":"I bought the Stratus to replace my Xact radio, which died after only one year of use. The stratus was dead out of the box. This makes the fourth satellite receiver I've tried. All four have experienced problems or died completely, 2 Xact, one Stratus and one XM radio. The Stratus was my last stop on this insane bus of crappy electronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall, but","review":"The kit itself is simple to install and setup took only a few minutes. However, the FM transmitter on the unit is not as good as previous units I've had as it only goes down to 88.1. I live near D.C. and it is almost impossible to find a frequency without something being transmitted on it. My old unit transmitted down to the low 87's and I had no trouble tuning in. It also seems like the transmitter is too week to transmit over even partial signals (a guess a compromise for the small size of it). So I ordered the FM Direct Adapter to see if that helps. It would have been nice if Sirius had included this in their car kit as anybody that lives near a city is likely to need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Moderately-Priced Unit","review":"This is a great starter kit for those new to Sirius like me. Setup was very easy and seems like it will stick to the dash for years. It does not come with a remote, which is fine if you're typically alone or driving with someone in the passenger's side. If you have a larger car, you might want to spring for the one that comes with it. The display is on the small side, which is why I'm giving this 4 stars.

Both times it was replaced by a reputable jewler. The third time the jewler told me the watch is dead because of water leakage into the housing. Indeed, there was rust inside the watch. Second of all, to replace the battery, you have to remove the pins from both straps - an incredible feat in itself, since the pins are very difficult to remove. Third, the wrist band is very stiff and uncomfortable. Fourth, the glass face is very reflective and it makes reading the display very difficult. Fifth, when you remove the watch and place it on any surface, chances are that you will depress the light switch on the side of the watch, and then if you don't notice it, you will drain the battery very fast.

The stylus which is only available directly from SONY currently costs $55.52 plus shipping and handling.

My father quickley went out to replace the needle, in the meantime I contacted Amazon, wanting to send back the Sony turntable. Amazon said that I had to purchase the turntable again, and then send back the damaged unit. Unable to afford to purchase another turntable, I took it to a professional to see if it could be fixed, the guy said it would cost more money to get it to work, then what it was worth.

And you had to assemble the platter - and attach the tiny rubber band that drives the platter. Just looking at that little rubber band told me I needed a turntable that will last a few years. I guess I was expecting too much for an $80 turntable. I had to send it back and get that $200 audio technica direct-drive manual turntable.

The Connoisseur required a new belt at $60 so I thought I would buy the Sony.I immediately notice a major problem - significant rumble. Annoying, but I could deal with this by applying a low frequency cut-off filter.Many transcriptions had noticeable distortion on loud passages but I put this down to a problem with the LPs. Then I re-transcribed two LPs I had previously recorded with the Connoisseur. These recordings now had significant and highly annoying distortion in loud passages. It probably wouldn't be noticeable with pop music but with loud legato passages in classical music, e.g., choruses or organ pieces, it is terrible. This is not overload as I was careful not to have line-in at too high a volume.Conclusion: this turntable has a cheap and nasty cartridge and/or pre-amplifier.

He still has a lot of vinyl that he likes to play from time to time. This turntable is a good buy. It has a built-in preamp that is pre-set for connecting to AUX jacks. It also has a switch to reset if connecting to PHONO jacks.

After about two weeks, I exchanged it - the second model I received seemed to have the correct pitch, but the hinges on the dust cover were busted out of the box (minor inconvenience) and the player skipped on 4 out of 5 records I would play (obviously, a major inconvenience) - even brand new ones.The player looks great, and the lower price is tempting, but don't buy it - I have spent more time trying to get the thing to work than I have actually enjoying vinyl records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine if your records are all perfect...","review":"I have a good-sized vinyl record collection, and I wanted to rip all that music into my computer. What I experienced with my first 10 albums is not encouraging. On about half of the albums I kept getting skips on a significant fraction of the tracks I ripped. About half the albums had one or more tracks that would skip. Sometimes 5 or 10 skips on a single track. I became suspicious because I never remembered that much of a problem with my collection, so I replayed them on my 25-year-old JVC component turntable. Most skips disappeared.The problem seems to be that there is no adjustment contols to allow changing the tracking force or the anti-skating force.Do yourself a favor.

After playing the first LP it began to drag, usually halfway through the first song on the albums. I went online and re-read the manual to see if I could make any adjustments but found nothing. So I just went back to my Marantz turntable that I bought back in 1980 and which plays fine. It has sat for two years without being played and based on some of these reviews it can be connected to the computer so I may break it out again and see if I can find some software to adjust the pitch and/or speed and just convert it to mp3's and then to CD. The Marantz is being used to convert directly to CD now. The only reason I bought it was that I assumed that any turntable built in this decade would work better than one built in the 80's but boy was I wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont do it!","review":"This table is as simple and basic as they get.

What is happening with quality control any more?From Amazon I purchased this turnatable which worked for a week. Then, everytime the needle touched down on the record, it instantly lifted back up and returned to its resting hook, then turned off.Its tough enough reaching a decision to buy a certain model or product, but to have to go thru the hassle of returning it has me soured on buying.

I felt so bad that I even purchased this refurbished as a gift, but what can I tell you, I've always trusted the Sony name and thought that this would be the same quality as I've had from the Sony name in the past.

It was difficult to determine that from the sketchy information available for this product. If you are shopping for an inexpensive turntable, you are better off to pay a little more and get the Technics (Panasonic) SL-BD20D which does have a P-mount on the tone arm, and though I admit I haven't actually auditioned that product, must sound better than this \\"bag over the head\\" piece of plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"sony turntable","review":"Product arrived intact, instructions were a little sketchy at first, but, yes, even a woman can figure the directions!

Because of his book, my christian life has been strenghthend and have myself researched Biblical prophecy and end times scriptures since I read the book. This was formerly a topic that I knew nothing about, and now have become pretty knowlegable.I strongly recomend this book to any Christian who is interested in knowing more about the end times. The only down side to his book that I found is that in time it had become dated and some of the current events that he speaks about are alomost forgotten.

In terms of its scholarship and line of reasoning it gets 0-1 stars. In terms of its entertainment value it gets 3-4 stars. The first time I read this book was about 17 years ago. Lindsey follows in the dispensationalist tradition of C.I. Scofield, a tradition of exegesis that fundamentally misreads and distorts the Biblical text. Lindsey's subjective isegesis and his arbitrary linking of texts together demonstrates the intellectual bankruptcy of apocalypticism and dispensationalist theology.On the other hand, when considered as Science Fiction, this work can be quite amusing.

I find it hard to believe that this man still has an audience after missing so many predictions over the years. Even if you believe in the \\"Rapture\\" there are much better books to read, and leaders to follow. Don't waste your time on the man who spent the late 70s and early 80s opening talks to Campus Crusade audiences with \\"There are no prophecies that need to be fulfilled before Jesus' return.

It scared the hell out of me then, because I was too young and ignorant to know any better. Having been raised a Roman Catholic, much of it had a familiar and frightening ring to it. Suffice it to say that Lindsey's take on the book of Prophecy might as well be a fantasy concocted as a science-fiction novel. The book of Revelation is essentially unintelligible to begin with - lending itself to wildly fantastical interpretation. Lindsey contributes his spin in this rather laughable book fortelling Armageddon. The basic outline has already made for a rather silly comedy/horror film.(Ghostbusters). I think this says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe anyone takes this seriously","review":"This book probably represents the darkest manifestation of the scams and snake oil American dream.

While this book once scared me when I was 12, all i can do now is laugh at the stupidty of it. Trite, simplistic, ridiculous, and insane are just some of the words that could be used to describe this book.

These events should have played out in the eighties. Instead, the Soviet bloc has collapsed, Egypt and other middle east states have made peace with Israel and completely new problems exist that were unforseen at the time the book was written.

The underlying music is very groovy, the kind of stuff that you'de want to play when you have friends over for a drink before going out. But all the \\"oow yeahs\\" and \\"oh-ohs\\" make it too distracting, almost embarrassing to play out loud. I realize that this album is a tribute to the porn industry and a few of the traks are done quite tastfully, sexy and funny.

Really a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"The writers should be run out of Hollywood","review":"This movie was a complete and total disappointment. Every aspect of the story was inane from Ryden's job search to her love life to her family's \\"adventures\\". Not only were there more groans than laughs, but the movie was pretty insulting to the audience. The characters' actions were not remotely realistic and if they were, they'd be pathetic, not loveable.I feel bad for all of the actors (particularly Bledel) who signed on to this disaster. They would have been better off reading from the phone book. Whoever was responsible for this script should be run out of Hollywood. They obviously don't belong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Movie","review":"Ryden Malby had it all figured out. Make good grades in high school, get a great college scholarship, keep the scholarship, graduate, and then work at the best publishing company in LA. Only things don't go quite as she planned. Instead of getting the job, she ends up unemployed and living with her crazy family once again.Crazy is NOT an understatement.Add on to that, a hot Brazillian neighbor and Adam, a guy who's been her best friend since freshman year, yet wants to be more. That's the plot.The plot, while all over the place, works well for this movie. You're not sure what scheme one of the Malbys will come up with next. Will it be her father's plan to make a fortune online selling belt buckles or perhaps her grandmother (played by the ever amazing Carol Burnett) wanting to take a look at caskets?

It lifted my spirits. My only wish is that it would have shown a few more of her interview struggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Script, Uninspired Direction","review":"\\"Post Grad\\" is a corny, rambling satire on today's job market, but hardly holds your attention, and if it is a comedy, I forgot to smile. The film frames a job hunt by a young college graduate Ryden Malby (Alexis Bledel) who is perky and optimistic. She always assumed she could find a job with a college diploma. She has a book publishing company as the first and only place to apply. She is among many applicants and the hard cruel world intervenes. The valedictorian of her class lands the job and Ryden's car is involved in an accident. She is forced to move back in with her dysfunctional family and look for anything to keep her afloat. In the meantime her steady comforting relationship with her best friend, Adam (Zach Gilford) comes apart. Ryden has to decide what is important to her: career or the man she loves.Overall, it is a pain to watch, the script screams for help, the talented cast cannot save it, and it drags through totally uninspired direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, enjoyable movie","review":"I thought it was a good movie and I enjoyed watching it.

In the 18th century, black and white children played together, white children often had a black woman as a \\"surrogate mother\\", and blacks and whites often worshipped together. This close interaction reinforced perceptions, values, and identities (world views) that were common between the two world view systems and, with time, the differences between the world views resulted in each world view being influenced by the other until they developed a symbiotic relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super poor quality","review":"When you hold these they feel like paper, they have no weight.

The first time we used them, we tipped them over three times within five minutes! (And we hadn't started drinking.) We purchased these because we have had other sippers (perfectly balanced ones from a quality manufacturer) that were quite nice, but broke a couple as they are very delicate, so sought replacements. We gave these away to our college-student nephew, who says he has great fun using them to pull jokes on his friends.

Them are very thin so I hope I don't break them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All A Matter of Bridges","review":"One of the main reasons why I love this film is because of the music alone. From the stirring introduction to the closing credits, this is one of the few war film soundtracks that proves to be so relevant to the story unfolding. From pomp to tragedy, this soundtrack cannot help but to inspire you and bring tears to your eyes at the same time. I have this soundtrack on vinyl, which my sister bought back in the early 80's. As a huge fan of soundtrack music, this is my very first soundtrack and very few of the many soundtracks that I've bought can compare to this one. Simply put, every track on this CD is irresistable. On most soundtracks, there are only a few good songs thrown in, while the rest are thrown in to provide the film some kind of musical background. It's truly a shame this music never quite reached the legend and fame of other classic soundtrack tunes, such as Rocky, Star Wars, Gone With the Wind, E.T., Jaws, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's been a long time!","review":"Finally! It's astounding that this remarkable score had never been issued on CD until now. I had despaired there might never be a CD release after so long a time, but here it is! I vividly remember watching the film when it debuted on TV in 1979 and being completely hooked by the main title music. Not long after, I obtained the soundtrack on vinyl and gained an even deeper appreciation for Addison's achievement. The rousing XXX Corps march in its various arrangements is the highlight, but this score is consistently inventive and memorable throughout. If you've seen the film you are probably aware it has its shortcomings, but none of them are reflected in this stirring music. This CD will be a mainstay in the collection of any soundtrack fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"What fans of the movie have been looking for!","review":"It has been a long time coming but finally there is a CD version of the soundtrack to \\"A Bridge Too Far\\". The comments of John Addison in the liner notes are a welcome addition as well as the trailer (in .mov and .mpg format).

Ryko is to be congratulated for bringing this out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk in the Fire","review":"\\"Walk in the Fire\\" is Strangeways third album and it's not a disappointment.

Some parts are a bit complex, but Ewald does a nice job of making the topic as understandable as possible. I was absolutely blown away by some of the historical points (such as findings in the 1800s about bacterial connections for major, common, chronic diseases). Ewald does say a few things that may prove to not be true (most significantly, that Lyme cannot be passed on from humans), but overall this book is incredibly enlightening. I would highly recommend this book for EVERYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"I love these books!!!

The display is way too dark when you are trying to tune in a station, but even more importantly, the display letters are so flippin' small, you need a magnifying glass to see what it says.

The good news is that they provide plenty of nudity and more often than not they have some very hot models. The perfect case in point is Christy Carrera.

But Christy makes it all worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss out! Hot Body always delivers!!","review":"Those of you who have grown up with Hot Body videos know exactly what to expect. Beautiful women in a softcore adult dvd. Full frontal and even closeups. The sad thing is that Hot Body is no longer producing new dvd's or VHS tapes and the prices are actually starting to rise. Check out ebay for some ridiculous bidding on Hot Body VHS tapes. When you find dvd's for less than $17 snatch them up. There aren't many out there and Blonde Bombshell is definitely one to grab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine, but....","review":"I bought this in like Spring of 1989 and it was recorded in late 1988.

Then two weeks later, I saw them and they played the same exact set in the same order with Michael Kiske doing some of the same introductions. My fault for buying it before I saw them, but now it is kind of like a souvenir from the show because it is very similiar to when I saw them in 89. A good cd and the last testement to that sound for Helloween as that would soon change and it was also the last release with Kai Hansen as he quit in the middle of the tour.

I finally cut the string just below the crimper but it was too short to safely knot and put back on the bow.

Its reception, if not in the same room as the base unit, was poor. From the start the battery life while in use was too short. If you plan on making many calls in one day, or one long call, this is not the phone for you. The battery would not hold a charge after only 7 months of use.

First, and only, bad Sony product that I have ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good!","review":"At first I was thrilled with my new phone. Then the battery life declined, then the deleting of phone calls on the ID got annoying then the charger decided that it just didn't want to work anymore.

I liked most of the characters except for the Hyksos. I, also thought that this book was thought out really well. The one thing that I didn't like was how Mr. Jacq would describe what the enemy would do to tourture people. I know that it might be true about what they used to do but he didn't need to be that graphic about it. There are not that many parts in the book that tell you about it, but the ones that do shouldn't be so graphic. Otherwise, I liked the courage and kindness of the main characters like Ahhotep and Seqen. I thought that they were very strong and courageous people and I like to read about people like that in my books. I also thought that the main characters were very smart and cunning. I liked the way they deceived the enemy. I read this in paperback and really liked it a lot. If you decide to read it I hope that you enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"Thompson creates a thorough, engaging, and intelligent chronicle of the life and times of Primo Levi.

We enjoyed the radiant heat that it put out when it worked, but I was disgusted that we didn't even one year out of it. After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to open up the controls and see if I could find out why it failed. I immediately noticed that the connections to the \\"tip-over\\" switch were burned, the wires were discolored, and the switch was melted slightly where the wire terminals entered the switch housing (see the picture that I included in the gallery).

The notes at the end of the book, show a good erudition and just sense of Literary Theory regarding ancient works. Ezra Pound used to talk about Beowulf and its complexities and Pound was a genius. Beowulf is indeed a difficult and marvelous poem, and for it its translation into English or any other modern language requires a serious linguistical and philological knowledge. This one that is being reviewd is a very good translation. I have several translations of this poem, but I prefer this one. I liked (I compared with the original OE text) the way in which the poem was put into modern English verses. A hard task, let me say.

The publisher is located in Gig Harbor, Washington, and - as another reviewer has noted - most of the positive reviews hail from Gig Harbor or nearby Port Orchard, or otherwise appear to be written by relatives of the publisher. One of the reviewers also runs the \\"official\\" (it's not) Calvin & Hobbes fan club website - the domain name of which just happens to be registered to the publisher of \\"Hamster Huey\\".

The author's choice of a title and pen name annoyingly similar to one well-known to Calvin and Hobbes fans (as well as the prominent review from the creator of the \\"Calvin and Hobbes fan site\\", which most suspect was created for part of this scam). I do not object to the title, but how the title is being used.

The holes the shapes fit through are too narrow for your average toddler to easily put them through. My son would get confused when he tried to put the round shape in the round hole and he couldn't easily push it through. He would then grab another piece and try to make it work, getting really frustrated in the process. I (39yr old woman) had to make sure I placed the shape in \\"just so\\" so it would fit. Pushing the shape through triggers a song (by the shape pressing a button down as it goes through the slot)about the shape or number depending on your setting. I suppose this is why the slots are so narrow. However, the design team needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. It's hard to believe this was ever tested by toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Shape Sorter","review":"This is the cutest shape sorter I have seen so far but still didn't impress me.

At first he would just open the lid and take the shapes in and out of the jar that way. It was fun for him and fine by us. At around 18 months, he started to make an effort to put the shapes through the right openings. The problem is that the shapes don't fall in easily so he'd ask for help. If I had my choice, I would have gone with a classic wooden version of this toy because the shapes are solid blocks rather than hollow and plastic. The other reason I'd go with the classic version is that the constant singing and music gets really annoying for adults. I often just turn off the music so I don't have to hear it. So overall, my son likes this toy but I would have preferred the classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star toy","review":"Don't ask me why, but this was one of our little one's absolute hands-down favorite toys from about 9 mo. through 3 1/2 yr.

He likes to push the nose which lights up and says different phrases. When it laughs, he laughs too! he also likes to take the lid on and off. I gave up trying to show him how to put the shapes through the holes b/c they are very hard to push through. he has some circles from a different shape sorter and I glanced into his playpen last night while I was making dinner and he was putting circles through the right hole! all by himself! the only complaints I have at that there are only 2 songs and you have to switch modes to hear them. AND the shapes are too big for the holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much emphasis on cookies!","review":"I was excited about getting this shape sorter because it's cute, has a lid, music, teaches shapes-- but no one mentioned how annoying this toy's emphasis on cookies is!

While it says it's for 6 month to 3 year olds, the shapes are too large to fit in the holes (specifically the triangle and star). I thought it was odd that my 3 year old couldn't do it so I attempted and had the same issue. You literally have to find the perfect angle to have the shape fit. Also, once you put the lid on the top of the jar, there's no way a child would be able to remove it. I found this frustrating as my 3 year old asked me repeatedly to open it for her. Had I purchased the gift myself I would return it. Since it's a gift, i'll let it collect dust in the off chance one of the kids will use it again.

She loved the songs and sounds (my only reason for 2 stars), but since there's only two songs they got to be incredibly redundant. The toy announces the shape as it's inserted, and will sing about numbers which is educational. The worst feature is the curved exterior. It is so difficult for little hands to insert the shapes. Even as adults we had a difficult time. We ended up donating the toy, it wasn't worth the annoyance and didn't perform it's intended purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"holes too small for shapes","review":"I bought this becasue my son loves his Fishbowl ( I think it's Fisher Price) and this is kind of the same idea with a container for things to go in and sounds when you drop things in/take them out, but I was very dissapointed that the shapes are really hard to get through their holes. Then, even if you can squeeze them through, once you get a few shapes in the jar you can't get the rest of the shapes though their holes becase the holes are at the very bottom and the shapes inside take up too much room to fit new ones in. It's cute if you just want to use it with the top hole, but the shape sorter holes weren't very well designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun, educational, durable ... but overall, TOO MUCH COOKIES","review":"I agree with the other posters in that the concept behind this toy is great: shape sorting, with the added bonus of color and number recognition. And I'm not against light/sound toys that offer reward when the task is done (ie, singing when you get the right shape in place). BUT the shapes are hard for our 17 month old to push all the way in. And the movement-activated noises are very annoying. Any time you put your hand in the center, or on the shapes, you get sound reward -- \\"yummy, cookies\\" is one. Our child doesn't yet eat or ask for cookies, so that's unfortunate. (This was a gift, I probably wouldn't have bought it myself if I'd heard the messaging.) We're pretty happy with the wooden Melissa & Doug version of this, I'd recommend it instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love this thing!","review":"We have purchased this toy for at least three children including our own.

First of all, the shapes are on the side of the cookie jar, which make it difficult for her to put the shapes in. She would have to turn the jar at an angle to get the shape in. Also, the shapes just barely fit in the holes and you have to give it a good shove to get it in. Even I found it difficult. Plus, there's a button that gets pushed down when the shape goes in, which give it more resistance. The cookie jar shape sorter is going back, and we're in the market for a good old-fashioned wooden cube shape sorter.

A definite must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another terrific thriller","review":"I just finished Wendy Corsi Staub's fantastic new novel \\"The Last to Know\\" and thought I'd check out her backlist. Wow, \\"All the Way Home\\" is another terrific thriller full of realistic characters, great twists and turns and true suspense. You won't know who the killer is until the very end and how everything ties together is very satisfying, original and well developed. This author is someone who writes in many genres and who certainly knows how to scare her audience. We are going to hear big things from Wendy, get on board now and check out her other works as well. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dopey, convuluted plot written for Nancy Drew readers","review":"Rory, the central character here, is a recent graduate of Cal Berkeley. Based on this book, she is probably the most gullible, guileless graduate of that august institution. Her italicized musings (everyone in the book thinks in italics when they are having deep, disturbing thoughts--that takes up half the book it seems) are those of a 13 year old girl. Nothing against 13 year old girls, but everyone in the book, except one character is way over 13, but that is the depth and maturity of their musings. The plot is incredibly convuluted and there are some things at the end that defy belief. Not recommended for anyone over 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, easy to install","review":"This product exceeded my expectations.

I accepted it as truth.The alleged success of Edgar Cayce's remotehealing led me to accept his other claims aboutthe mystical nature of human life, reincarnation,etc. The book made many specific predictionsabout future geological and political events forthe crucial years 1958 to 1998. Alas, as I rereadmy old copy of this book, none of the predictionshave come to pass. I am forced to conclude thatEdgar Cayce was not at all omniscient, was infact just another human with no pipeline to universal knowledge. I have no further reason to accept his statements about the nature of life and death. In fact, I have become a total skeptic on all things mystical. It will be interesting to me to see how the total failure of all the specific predictions is treated in a new edition of the book, I imagine there is a lot of tortured logic. Anyway, I gave him a 30 year test and he failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth $20","review":"The book is only 50 pages so I did not expect much, but $20 is expensive for the minimal information in the book. The author does tell you how to read option price codes and the basics of how options are priced. However, the author makes light of any risks in options trading. The author's basic message is a pep talk to trade options. The book has $5.00 worth of information. If you can buy it used for that price, buy it unless you already know the basics from your broker or a dozen other websites."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good example of why people don't read books anymore","review":"This should be an exciting read, instead it is oppressive.

The history of the building was also of interest in terms of Fire Prevention.

They both have different needs, so I wasn't sure if one, both, or neither would like it. Well, they both LOVE it. The adult cat likes catnip, so we put it in the middle where the scratcher is. She loves sitting in the middle and watching the ball light up. The little one hops around and goes crazy. When he's especially rambunctious, he'll scratch the middle a bunch, then chase the ball around while batting at it. I'd definitely recommend if you have a cat/kitten with high energy. Still, it's also a nice toy for cats who are more mellow, but like to chase things.Also, this version is less on Amazon than in pet stores. We saw this same model for $8-10 more because it had the lighted ball. I don't think the toy would be as much fun for our cats without the light, so definitely recommend going with this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the BEST toy for cats!","review":"This is truely an amazing toy for cats!

Hunters and Loggers are portrayed as evil in a way that showed the filmmakers' ignorance of hunting, logging, and the outdoors in general. I guess they thought kids wouldn't notice. Mine did.The saddest part of this whole movie is the bear itself. It was obviously fed a poor diet and was overweight and sloppy. The majority of the bear's teeth were gone and it was de-clawed. One of the worst looking specimens of a black bear I have ever seen. I will say that seeing this bear was the closest I have come to crying during a movie in a long time.Overall, I would guess the piece was put out as a pro-greenie propaganda film, and it even does this poorly. Don't even get me started on the racist angle (a Native American doing a rain dance, I'm not kidding)."},{"rating":"2","title":"bear with it","review":"um, just make sure you are not sober when you watch this and you will enjoy it a helluva lot more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"The writing style of Mr. Heller is very engaging and makes the text fun to read.

This book starts out nicely but before you know it, he is talking multi-file programs and complicated class header files, etc. This book might be suitable to someone who already knows C and whats to learn C++. Too many basic concepts are left out. One example is structures which will help in the understanding of classes. Finally, the comical chapter titles are fun to read but make it difficult to find again, material for reviewing later on.

I was less interested in the characters themselves than I was in the ideas that made up the plot, and the little quirky moments that seemed to fill the novel.Based on the reader reviews, I think that I will try Paper Grail next and see if it satisfies more by expanding on the elements that I liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashing down the hill","review":"This book started out with a bang and slowly went down from there. Blaylock had a great idea, some wonderful characters, but just dropped the ball. He had a wonderful build but then didn't know what to do with the novel and just threw a few unrelated ideas together and ended the book. Because I've heard some good things about this author I'm willing to give him another try and just put this one down as a strikeout."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish James P. Blaylock were my next-door neighbor.","review":"Magic and faith are very real in Blaylock's worlds, even in suburbanCalifornia. This is not the first of his works to pit hapless goofygood against diabolical, organized evil; but this may be the mostcomplicated story he has written. Evil, while filthy and pathetic,is just as human as Good, which itself is not without blemish. Andthe characters who come to life as representatives for various shadesof these principles are rich, lovable, and tragic.There is one character who lives in just about all of Blaylock'sstories, and that is the lovable clod -- the impractical but highlyimaginative hero who is as clumsy as his accidents are amusing. I thinkthis must be Blaylock himself, and I do wish he lived nearby... atleast around the corner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"As a fan and regular reader of Blaylock, I was a little disppointed by this book. It does a good job of being scary at times, but fails to enchant like \\"The Paper Grail\\" or to amuse like \\"The Last Coin.\\"A disturbing trend I've noticed in this book is that Blaylock writes about himself; he is the main character in all his books. While this approach was tolerable the first few times, it's getting a little old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil in Disguise","review":"A pleasant and entertaining ill-got-ill-spent story in spite of a main plot line at times diluted with irrelevant subplots.

It's about a girl whose beloved mother gets struck with breast cancer, and her world is never the same again.McDaniel writes with such flair that you can hardly bring yourself to put the book down. The ending is very sad, but also leaves you with a feeling of hope. This book teaches us that while we may not get to choose what happens to us, we do get to choose how we respond. This book reveals that people don't always get what they deserve, whether they be good or bad.If you haven't read this book yet, then I highly recommend you read it.

I took up running a few months ago, slowly building up my mileage. The incredible stories in the book show me that indeed it is possible to run 26.2 miles, or even more for ultramarathons.

When he talks of the structure of government in our colonial period, as well as the formation of the Constitution, he introduces so many indispensable anecdotes that back up his interpretation of events. You will be amazed at what Nock brings forth in this short work. This is one of the books that influenced Murray Rothbard to embark on his Conceived in Liberty series.To say this book is powerful is an understatement. Its even better the second time through. I would strongly suggest picking this book up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"In science, one of the markers for the proof of a solid theory is its power to predict outcomes. That is, if the theory is correct, it should not only explain what has already happened, but what will happen. This book has stood the test of time for this reason - Nock's predictions of the outcomes of 1930's social policies have come to pass. This book is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers the struggle between civil society and the state.","review":"I'm not going to get long winded into the specifics of why I thought this was a great book. Nock details the epic struggle between the civil society/sovereign individuals and the always expanding power appetite of the state.The work speaks for itself. Read it and come to your own conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true enemy explained","review":"In this day of ever increasing government power both in the US and elsewhere, A. Nock's book is more relevant than ever. Written in 1935 at the height of FDR's new deal and with fascist and communist running most of the world stage, Nock explains why the notion of Big Government is a threat to freedom and the individual very life. The only reason I cannot give this book 5 stars is that the print is too large for a comfortable read. But since the message is so important, that can be overlooked and thus I strongly recommend anyone interested in liberty to pick up this now classic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Principles, Bad History","review":"To begin with, Nock makes an eloquent case for natural rights liberty and the criminality of the state. His principles are wonderful, but his historical analysis is horrible. He bases most of it off the perverted works of \\"Progressive\\" historians, among them Charles A. Beard, whose \\"Economic Origins\\" serves as the main basis of his commentary on the Constitution. Together with his mistaken history, he also devolopes a misleading and destructive form of social class theory. Despite this, the last chapter and essay in the appendix serve to redeem the book somewhat. I would recommend the work as a source of strong libertarian principles and a solid indictment of the state( remember the difference between the state and government). However, I would suggest that you might wish to supplement Nock's falacious historical view with those of historians as BernardBailyn, Gordon Wood, Pauline Maier, Carl Bridenbaugh, and Forrest McDonald for a true analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad.","review":"Like most libertarian works, Nock's work brims with an absolute contempt for democracy, a total cynicism towards the possibility of altruistic virtues and governance, exaggerated rhetoric, faulty history, and incoherent moral theory. He calls Roosevelt's democratic election in 1932 a \\"coup d'etat\\" , refers to the working class voting in favor of redestributive programs as \\"subsidized voting power\\", makes a totally incoherent distinction between government and state, and glosses over the role of the public sector's in any faction of the current order that he approves of. Also, he ought to heed Bentham's description of natural rights: \\"Nonsense on Stilts.\\" Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"More neoconservative blather","review":"Who knew these extremists existed back then? The author claims the state is the enemy and free markets are your freind. Maybe he didnt see AIG coming.

It also deals with the topical issue of racial profiling. Clark's personal and professional lives intertwine to create a multi-faceted character that remains genuine.

That is interesting enough, but the real merits of this book are in the gorgeous photographs, which stretch all along the length of the Parkway and cover all seasons and moods. Organized in milepost order, they brought back fond memories of the places I've visited (Peaks of Otter, Mabry Mill) and hopes to visit all the rest someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Despite the author's intentions in writing this book, it's more that evident that he feels it is justified for minorities to carry around a huge chip on their shoulders for passed wrong doings by whites, in particular Native Americans. In direct contradiction to the book, that we should all live in peace and harmony with the earth and each other, their is an undercurrent of resentment by the author, which contaminates the intent of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet offering","review":"Tom Cowan's latest book is a delightful read, beautifully illustrating how the sacred world interweaves with the everyday. If your soul is Celtic, the prose and dream-like presentation of this book will inspire you into your own knowings. Central to the process of healing the Earth is our individual reconnection with the soul of Nature, a potent and necessary source of healing power and wisdom. Cowan describes his own healing process with humor and candor, challenging readers to take charge of their centers, walk in truth, and most importantly, to remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewed by a skeptic","review":"I've recently realized that I'm very spiritual, in a naturalistic (i.e. nonsupernatural/nonmystical) sort of way.There are very few books out there for folks like me. I've studied Buddhism (I especially like Zen), Taoism, Pantheism, and Religious Naturalism, to name a few areas that I've examined.A while back I read a book on Druids but that was before I realized my naturalistic spirituality.My ancestors are from England, Ireland, and Scotland and so I decided to get this book to learn a little bit about Celtic spirituality (I also got 'The Mist-Filled Path').I really enjoyed reading this book. I don't believe in the mystical/supernatural/superstitious elements, but I enjoyed trying to find the psychological reasoning/explanations underlying them. I found myself smiling at what I was reading on almost every page.I'm a truth-seeker and this is a beautiful little book with some nice kernals of truth hidden in it, if you're willing to hunt for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound advice","review":"Tom Cowan's Celtic Reflections is a wonderful read. Every chapter contains pearls of wisdom. The book is also written in a way that builds on concepts presented earlier to make the point later in the book. The reflections draw on Celtic traditions and myth, as well as Cowan's personal life. His explanation of spirit and living \\"in the spirit\\" was particuarly poignant. I plan read sections again to try to pull out individual practices and meditations. Although they are presented in almost every chapter, I wish there had been a summary or methodology to the techniques that were presented. Overall, though, an excellent book worthy of reading and study, whether you are into Celtic traditions or simply want to experience another way look of seeing the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"drowned hamster","review":"My hamster was able to get up & chew intot he bottom of hte bottle, resulting in a mini-flood that left him & cage & all... drenched.

The vest was hanging in the closet all the time since repair, I did not wash it, and weather conditions were great, it doesn't rain very often in our closet... The tape does not hold to the surface very well. It sticks good and beautifully at first, but it looks like you will have to check and re-stick it constantly. The good thing is it's very easy to remove without ruining the fabric, there are no glue spots or sticky stuff afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality traditional jazz","review":"If you like tradicional jazz, this is a really good pick!

If you are thinking of learning Hebrew, then this book is not for you. If you are thinking of getting a very basic overview on how the language works, then it might just suffice.

I have tried this camera with four lenses, both pro and amateur, including the new 18-200 VR, and still have yet to produce consistently sharp images. I have tried these lenses on two different D80s, and still run into the same problem. It's not motion blur, as the images are frozen, but still have an unacceptable soft-focus to them, almost as if the focal plane is out of alignment. My wife uses the D40 with kit lenses, and doesn't run into this.

I shot mostly in Auto or Potrait mode and the picture quality especially of potraits were breath-taking. People's skin and complexion were exceptionally sharp, soft and natural looking not washed out like my other point-and-shoot camera. And I absolutely love the wide angle composition that I was able to get from my 18-70mm lens so I get the people and the landscape at the same time.It's a significant premium over my Canon Powershot S3 point-and-shoot camera but well worth it.

It feels great in your hand, even better than the new D90 to me. I also have a Canon XSi which feels great in the hand too. I like the controls on the D80 better. It is more of a shooters camera than the Canon. I think they are both great cameras.All the pros and cons have been listed in prior reviews. Check out the D80 review at dpreview for all the details. The only feature on the D80 that I probably need to check on is the compressed NEF raw file format. The camera saves RAW files in a compressed format, although the details are sketchy. Nikon claims it is lossless process. I usually shoot large JPEGs with low compression - but I will update this review after I try opening some RAW shots in both Bibble & PSE to compare the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly good","review":"I's a pretty good camera other than some slight graininess and he lens had some spots on it that show up in some of the lower light pictures.

HOWEVER if you want to buy a digital Nikon SLR you have two better options: 1) at this price look around for a Nikon D90 which is already like 4 year old but it's a more advanced model; 2) buy this camera used or refurbished for half the price or less of what you find here (now above $700); with what you save you can buy a nice, good lens.(again: nothing against this camera, but really buying it new in 2012, when it's already out of production, doesn't make any sense)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera!! Upgraded from D40...","review":"When I first decided to purchase a DSLR I did a little research and ended up buying a D40 because of it's low cost and \\"easy of use\\". I quickly realized I had made a mistake and upgraded to the D80. The D40 was really more difficult to use, requiring me to access the menu every time I wanted to change a simple setting. The D40 took great photos, but it was too frustrating to use.So, I bought the D80 from Cameta Camera(highly recommend them) and it is just in a different catagory than the D40/40x/60. I'm very happy with it so far and it is well worth the difference in $$$.Initially I tried out the Canon XTi as well. The D80 seemed far superior to me and it much, MUCH nicer to hold. The XTi's grip is absolutely TERRIBLE. I recently tried out the new XSi as well, and even though it seems like an improvement over the XTi, I still prefer the D80."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...Great Camera","review":"Though this camera is priced on the high side of other cameras in its class, it will well worth the money.

She has used Nikons for decades and had some lens that would fit so we went with this camera. The one major disapointment with the Nikon product is that you can not compose a picture using the LCD screen on the back of the camera. Nowhere does Nikon tell you that this LCD is for playback ONLY. All of the Canon products have real time use of the LCD to compose pictures. Heck, even cell phones let you use their screens for real time photo composition. The lack of this function and the lack of any reference to the lack of this function by Nikon make this product unacceptable.

I'm not sure why it took so long for me to know it was reprinted, but I just found out and bought it. My initial fascination with this grand ship was sparked by this very book, and lives on today. I have many Titanic books, and though I appreciate color, nothing can top this original. It's one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarification regarding pictures","review":"The book, originally written just after the sinking of the Titanic, reflects the attitudes of the period in which it was published, especially with regard to the distinct roles of men and women. Obviously bereft of the insights derived from the discovery of the Titanic, it nevertheless raises two provocative issues: a fire in the coal bunker and unruly passengers being shot. However, I wish to clarify the matter of pictures which the mixing of reviews for two different editions has created. The text of the free public domain version is well-formatted but lacks photographs. The $.99 edition from MacMay is equally well-formatted, but it DOES have photographs. The decision, therefore, is whether the inclusion of the photos is worth spending a dollar rather than getting the text for free. I think the photos, while not spectacular, greatly enhance the presentation and would therefore recommend the MacMay edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of inaccuracies.","review":"There are some interesting technical details in this book, which might make it worth reading for a Titanic enthusiast.There are numerous contradictions in the book to known established facts.

Collapsible boats disintegrating immediately?I'm a good portion through this book, and I'm doubtful it's worth more of my time.

It's the fresh-off-the-press first stories of the passengers, the ship, the wreck.

There are some elements for adults - at least parents of children - to enjoy.One small note of caution: there's a subtle but questionable message in this movie. The wicked soon-to-be stepmother of one of the girls is driven away, giving the story its fairytale ending. As that plays out, the message is sent that its good to humiliate and embarrass those that have wronged us .

When she goes to Sebastian's school as Sebastian, she falls for one of the teammates named Duke. Things get complicated when a girl named Olivia falls for Sebastian (who is really Viola). Viola isn't interested (cuz she's a girl lol), so Olivia hits on Duke to make Sebastian (Viola) jealous.\\"She's The Man\\" is a great movie! It's funny and it has a great moral; girls can do anything guys can do, if not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest movie around.","review":"She's The Man is one of the funniest movies I've seen in several years. And they did it without a lot of crude sex gags; most of the humor is due to the hilarious performance of Amanda Bynes. She plays a girl who pretends to be a boy for the purpose of playing on a boys soccer team that's scheduled to play against her chauvinist ex-boyfriend. Yes, there have been many comedies with a similar premise (Nobody's Perfect, Ladybugs, etc.), but this one really gets the humor out of the situation without resorting to cheap sex gags (with 2 or 3 exceptions)."},{"rating":"2","title":"She''s The Man","review":"Amanda Bynes is a terrific actress and this movie is filled with laughs.

I used to show my students the Helena Bonham-Carter movie \\"Twelfth Night\\" (Also very good, very funny) after reading the play with them. As Shakespeare's humor was often lost just reading the play, watching it being acted out definitely helped students to \\"get it.\\" Amazing, but the play is still funny 500 years later. One year decided to opt for this version instead. Though not as faithful to the Bard, kids REALLY enjoyed the film, laughing at all the ensuing chaos when the twins (Viola and Sebastian) are mistaken for each other. Great acting. Very funny film in its own right (ie, you don't have to study \\"Twelfth Night\\" to show/appreciate it).If one is teaching \\"Twelfth Night\\", can't go wrong with either film, but I'm a bit more partial to this one. It's just funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amanda Bynes lights up the screen!","review":"And gives us a wonderful performance as Viola, who after the girls soccer team is cancelled; she decides to become a guy and try out for the guy's team. now, not everything is explained in this, it's not overly realistic. but it doesn't need to be. this film is inventive and has alot of twists, it's funny and I think it's worth your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"I have watched this movie a good number of times, but I still laugh every single time!!

I was worried about starting this one because I couldn't even finish the third book, \\"Scandal's Bride\\". But Demon was just right! Flick was the best heroine so far in this series. I liked the fact that she still had the innocent nature after being with Demon the first time. So often the virgin turns 180 and becomes this unrealistic sex nymph. I thought the whole Dillon and the Syndicate thing was rather pedantic. If it was such a big deal I thought that there should have been more pressure from those around them. But really it was just the General's dissapointment that spurred them. I don't hold that against the book though. There was just the right amount of sexual suspense, just the right amount of sex, just the right amount of resistance from the hero, and just the right amount of innocence from the heroine to make this an excellent story! Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At First I thought Oh No:","review":"I thought oh no not another Cynster running away straight into his fate. I was beginning to think, are all the rest going to be the same. But Laurens pulls it off.

I won't say this is one I will keep to reread, but I glad I didn't miss this one of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Read!","review":"I absolutley loved this book! It had humor, suspence, and of course the passion that these books revolve around. Stephanie Laurens (The author) has the ability to make you feel like you are the heroine in her books.

I recommend getting the whole series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snoozer...not as enjoyable as the first two novels","review":"I found myself leafing through the book to get the story to move on.

The character Dillon seemed to be a side thought. Hope the next in the series is better reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rogue's Proposal","review":"This book has it all! Romance and drama and a mystery to solve. Very good characters. They come off the page and take you back in time. Great way to spend down time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed and even a bit bored by this book.","review":"The first book in the Cynster series, Devil's Bride, was the best. The Romance was strong and while the secondary story was interesting, it didn't overshadow the love story. Unfortunately, each successive book seems to diminish in quality. I found A Rogues Proposal to have flat characters, a polt that overshadowed the romance with a mystery that seemed to never end. To make matters worse, Ms. Laurens' usually fantastic and frequent sex scenes were missing. I was hoping this book would be similar to Captain Jack's Woman, with a woman pretending to be a boy, but it lacked spontaneity of plot and the in depth charaterizations of the hero and heroine that Captain Jack's Woman had. I wish Ms. Laurens better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I have never purchased a used book that was listed Good that was in such bad shape. I had to even tape the cover and first page of the book. If this the the way this company rates their books on a regular basis I do not want to buy used books from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"After reading many favourable reviews on this book, I rushed off and bought it almost straight away. Well, I was in for a disappointment. The first half of the story moved at a very slow pace. I was bored to tears despite the mystery, which is transparent and uninteresting by the way, obligingly thrown in by the author. Paragraphs after paragraphs of lengthy exposition just went on and on. And the sex! Well, don't get me wrong. I love plenty of steamy and well written love scenes in a romance, but 10 plus pages of boring, lengthy and repititive love scenes! Give me a break. The second half was slightly better, with a little more drama between the hero and heroine, but that couldn't save the whole story from being a boring and mediocre read.If you are new to Steph. Laurens, perhaps you'll find this book not bad at all. But having gone through the whole series of the Cynster clones, I find that the overused formula in these books just doen't work for me anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet beginning/Raunchy ending","review":"Maybe I am old fashioned but I like a little romance in my romance novels. The beginning was nice, interesting characters and a promise of a good mystery. But the character get so overwrought, it was a bit to much. And whew the sex scene were absolutely raunchy! I was afraid to take the book out of the house. The mystery part totally disappeared and the book fizzled to an end. If the writer pays a little more attention to the story line she might become a first rate romance writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Devil's Bride was good, this was not. It began promising-- I love the stories of young girls loving a man from afar and him finally realizing she has grown up. However, after the first few chapters, it went flying downhill. The mysery was interesting enough, but much too much attention was given to that and not developing the romance and characters. I kept plodding on, telling myself that it will get better soon. At pg 137, I finally gave up. It was too boring for words! I skipped over 100 pages and started skimming through the rest--which didn't seem much better. I can't believe I paid for this. I am kicking myself. Laurens has proven herself as a good writer, but this one missed the mark by a LOT. If you love her, then I guess you should try it, but there are many other more worthwhile books to consume a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Having read the series in order I was really looking forward to this book, boy was I disappointed!!!!! I plowed through about three quarters of the book before finally giving up on it. The H&H were such idiots that I felt they deserved each other. I really hate when the main characters go from doing, or saying, one stupid thing after another. I gave it two stars only because I was okay with the story line in the beginning and it could have worked. There were also so many conflicting statements in the book (the heroine was so well known in the area she had lived in for 13 years and yet at a local dance she didn't know anyone around her age). I'm now starting on the next book in the series but I am starting it with the feeling, having read the first chapter, that it's not going to be much better. I really hope I'm wrong about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This has to be Laurens' worst one in the series. Besides the incredibly unlikeable heroine and arrogant hero, the plot was ultra boring. I was only about four chapters into it when I wanted to stop. Usually I give up about 3 quarters of the way through, because I like Stephanie Laurens but her books are always so wordy that I have to scan pages to get enough of an idea of the situation. But this book was so hard for me to continue, I just gave up not even a third of the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cynsters Strike Again !","review":"After I read each book in this series I have a new favorite Cynster. Now I am enthralled with Demon Harry. This a delightful story and Laurens has outdone herself in developing the characters of Flick and Demon and their romance. I think her readers will especially appreciate the humor she has instilled in her latest creation. Laurens certainly leaves us anxiously awaiting Gabriel and Lucifer's stories and just maybe ( if we are extremely lucky) she will decide to treat us to Amanda and Amelia's sagas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"After hearing so much about this writer, I was unbelievably disappointed in this book. Cardboard characters, a silly and plodding plot, purple prose, and a zillion cliches. There are some good writers still doing romances, but Ms. Laurens isn't one of them. Do yourself a favor, and give it a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"A friend of mine in high school turned me on to this band, and this album.

Castelnuovo-Tedesco's musical language is unashamedly lyrical, especially for music from the 1920's and 30's. Not the most profound music, but his tunes are always memorable and inventive. One can see why these works were so popular at their premiere. This disc is a joy to listen to, fully comitted performances and fine recording quality. Thank you to the Arman Ensemble and their world premiere recordings for bringing these works the attention they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it hadn't been cancelled","review":"I really enjoyed this series and wish it hadn't been cancelled.

Worst: The scientific background is ridiculous, nothing is close to credible. DNA-restructuring (into a triple-helix) is bad enough, but this happens via acoustic signals. Hello? Nobody seems to wonder what kind of crap they sell. The basic idea is not new, but OK. The way it is explained, scientifically, must repel anyone with a tiny bit of background knowledge. So: Save your money, rent the disks. And buy the 4400."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story idea, bad writing and acting","review":"I just bought this on a whim because I am a Brent Spiner fan and thought it can not be that bad. Boy was I ever wrong. The story is great, the acting and writing are cheesy at best. No wonder it was canceled. The lines that try to be funny fall way short and the lead (Carla Gugino) is not believable at all. She is suppose to be this genius that is the best in the world at crisis management. I find it hard to believe she could even manage a seven eleven much less this job. If they had done better casting and better writing this might have taken off. You can tell they spent a good bit on sets and effects, but I think they should have spent more in other areas and the show might have gone somewhere. Take my advice and save your money. If you must see this then rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like oil and water....","review":"What do you get when some of the Trek producers and actors make a series with the guy who made the short lived Blade TV show? One awful show. Well, perhaps that's too harsh, but I saw the shows they were trying to do, regretfully it was nothing special. It was not well written, produced, or directed. A useual cast of fine actors who had no chemistru between them.I understand that when the series was cancelled, one of the producers complained to Paramount, and the studio rep said something along the lines of \\"sorry sore loser\\" and hung up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was it cancelled?","review":"... because it was bad.Granted, it did have a pretty interesting story model and was a little more inventive then the traditional \\"alien invasion\\" stories. I'll even go so far as to say that the network probably should have tried to hang in there with it a little longer. In the interest of fairness it probably WAS cancelled too soon (it was axed REALLY fast). Having said all of that, though, it was still bad.The casting was bad, the writing was way below average, the acting was bad and after a few weeks it wasn't showing any signs of getting better.I'm just curious as to how many episodes are on this DVD. From what I understand, 'Threshold' hadn't even shot a whole season. Are they just tossing out the eight or nine that made the air? Why would anyone buy what ammounts to (at best) 30% of a season?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done","review":"Every minute characters in this series try to remind you of some plot point explained a short time ago.

Probably there was an exec there that keeped destroying the good work of other people. What I would do with a tenth of the budget of this misfire!!UPDATE: Thanks for the comments, not always my mind is at his best. The series is still pretty bad.

This series was canceled mid-season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please revive this show!!!!","review":"I don't care if it airs on SciFi instead of CBS, I don't care if it only airs in Costa Rica, I just wish they'd make MORE of this promising show so I can buy the DVDs later & watch it despite not having cable or living in Costa Rica. This story was SO titilating & I was really interested to see where it was going. I love the characters (sucker for ensemble casts) & the story line isn't dumbed down for the most part. It had so much potential. CBS really should have given this show more time. It would have been a sleeper hit like \\"The Practice\\". Instead, they kept \\"Ghost Whisperer.\\" EXPLAIN this to me, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardly given a chance to bloom","review":"I'm not a real fan of science fiction, so I was suprised to find myself enjoying the show; I only watched it to see Peter Dinklage. The show was well written, the acters were wonderful, I enjoyed where the plot was going... it's unfortunate it was cancelled before it had a chance to really show it's stuff. Obviously, the ending isn't that great, since they had to rewrite it days before filming it, but I strongly recommend the show to any sci-fi fan out there, and to many who otherwise aren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with my results","review":"My front lawn has a lot of weeds and moss and little sun so it has been very difficult to get a decent lawn, and I have been trying to establish my lawn for years. This year, I tried Jonathan Green and was very pleased. It grew really well and with very little preparation on my part. I mildly tilled the lawn with a hand tiller, threw the seed down (a lot of it) and watered regularly. One side of my lawn responded really well and I have a full lawn in less then a month. The other side of my lawn did not grow very much at all. I am investing why, but I think it has to do with the type of weed that is present on that side and not on the other (shallow rooted, fast growing curly weed). But I digress, I thoroughly approve of this product, it works better than the other products I have tried through the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, then a really awful climax","review":"I thought the main character was different and sympathetic, but that the author was too heavy handed in her other characterizations. It really went quickly downhill in the climax, as the solution to the plot problem involves us suddenly believing that the super intelligent and powerful aliens are now as gullible as a bunch of 3rd graders."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painful read","review":"I am a big Tepper fan and so was even more disappointed in this book than if it had just been some random paperback I picked up in an airport. Wanting to put it down around page 100, I kept reading, thinking it had to get better sometime, but it just got worse and worse. Strangely, Tepper has the ability to make seemingly bizarre worlds and people seem completely realitic and believable, but when she tries to write about the \\"real\\" contemporary America, the results are stilted, dull, and don't ring true. I wish I hadn't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort to read.","review":"I am new to this author, but the book looked sufficiently intriguing for me to pick up. That was a mistake. This idea has been done to death, and by far better story-tellers than Tepper. The anti-male slant it seemed to have (with the exception of a couple of characters) actually annoyed me to the point where I almost didn't finish it. Bad, non-funny, poetic justice-type jokes fill this book, and don't help it. For once I'd like a science fiction author in the 21st century to approach a heavy topic like aliens coming to Earth with a bit of seriousness and maturity, rather than with tongue-in-cheek, cutesy humor. This is the first and last book by this author I'll buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know Tepper could be so funny","review":"\\"First Contact\\" is a staple plot-format in science fiction and Tepper has given it a wonderful twist.The first Tepper novel I read was Grass. I loved it. Further reading in Tepper's works seemed repetitive. Fresco is fresh and very funny. Fresco is placed in a science-fiction universe of the now, a world we all know. Humans have sent out space exploration machines beyond the solar system and this attacts the attention of a multi-specie space confederation. It seems we are throwing garbage over the fence. First contact is not with one group of aliens, but at least five different species, all with their own agenda for using humans for their own purpose. None are totally beneficial to humanity.Yes there are flat, stereotypical characters. But there is also much wonderful social commentary, particularly on justice and theology, that can stand up to comparison with Jonathan Swift.This one gets permanent shelf space in my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again","review":"I'm getting quite tired of the polemics getting in the way of the story, the new ideas, and the characters.Whenever I read one of Tepper's new books, I have to go back to 'Grass' to get the taste out of my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough victimology!","review":"Nearly a complete waste of time.

There is nothing 'ultimate' about this package, which seems to target a low budget, backpacking type of audience. The attractions are slanted in favor of what you might call 'hippie' interests. I am left with a lot of questions and a strong feeling of disillusionment. Most of the activities can be done practically anywhere, and there is little focus on unique local entertainment, gifts or dining beyond what you find in somebody's cabin out in the boonies. I'm a middle aged boomer with an interest in comfort - not camping - and a memorable travel experience with shows and food and special gifts, and want to believe the region has something to offer my market, so I will look for more current information.

Her mother died at birth and there were many examples where her father didn't seem to care about her. Leaving her with her aunt to go out west. The second review gives more examples. A lot of her behavoir and wild antics seemed to steam from a lonely girl looking for attention from her family. No wonder Alice loved all the attention she got at as the president's daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for students","review":"----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The book covers a broad spectrum of systems issues and is a good introduction for the aspiring systems analyst.

Any person following the procedures outlined in this book would surely (and rightfully) be fired, they would never produce any thing but documentation and stick figures (product is important too!).This book tries to cover a very broad range of tools and documentation options but lacks organization and depth, you come away knowing very little about many things.This book is really very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dumbest Book I have Ever Read","review":"I love vampire books as much as the next vampire fanatic but this book is atrocious. I have never read anything as stupid... as \\"Blood Debt\\" by Tanya Huff. A vampire being haunted by ghosts of victims of mysterious murders is the lamest plotline I have ever saw. What made this book even more stupid was the rules that Henry Fitzroy and Vicki Nelson has to follow. I guess not everyone can write as well as Anne Rice, and Tanya Huff is proof of that theory however is it so hard to write decent dialogue than the ... I read in this book? Is that too much to ask for? I think I'll go read Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very bland...","review":"(Spoiler warnings)Although I enjoyed the past 4 books in this series, this book really grated on me. In the past, Victory's fights with Henry and the others were amusing and bordered at times on annoying. This time, however, they were exremely annoying.Secondly, Henry sounded more like an annoying [...] than the charming, delightful prince I'd come to love and admire.Thirdly, that a seasoned homicide policeman like Celluci would know less about forensics than an ex-policewoman was just dumb.Last, why do I have the feeling that the twist in the previous book(that is, the ending) was written so there'd be a second spin-off series? If so, clever marketing but what a horrible thing. It'd have been much better to leave Victory and Henry together, than drive them apart!At this point, I'm reading halfway through the book. I'm not even sure if I can finish it. And, I don't even know if I can finish the book without ripping the pages apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Informative and educational","review":"Essential for those of us that grew up in dysfunctional families (which is estimated to be about 85% of the population) This book covers everything from whether to answer the phone because someone else thinks you should to more serious things like leaving situations that do not benefit you.

It consists of numerous chapters that are only one or two pages long each! That alone is a very strange format, but the content tends to be very uninformative and strange. I'm definitely of the opinion that self-help theories should be elaborated on, that's why one buys a self-help book, isn't it? But the author rambles, introduces new buzzwords at will, and there is none of the sort of elaboration or system here someone who is looking for help would want.

I'm sorry but LITTLE BOW WOW comes from OHIO. He was on every since he wuz born, he knows nothin about real life. HE's been in da studio since he wuz a baby for pete's sake. Time to get real SHAD get out in da real world a learn somethin about life. Only songs to listen too are his collabos with O and CIARA, and he has one with J-Kwon on da hook, I really suggest u bootleg dis CD. Oh by da way I'm only 17 and I don't like his music, so don't think all teenagers do. HOLLA at Ya BOI"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO BAD!","review":"Alright, let's get this straight, he cannot rap, and his album is no good. The song with Omarian is very bad also, though everyone seems to like it. And earth to Bow Wow, no one takes your music seriously, and you have 0 talent. The lyrics are awful, and the beats are pretty good, but Bow Wow didn't have nething to do with that. Just pure trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruff Ruff!","review":"Man, this little kiddie rapper makes me so sick! He thinks he's so cool b/c he's getting with my baby girl, Ciara. I hate this guy! Not only that but I just listened to the album... Um... There's two good songs. One with Ciara and the other with Omarion. What a rip-off! This album blows and Bow Wow should just wash off those fake tattoos--what a friggin' poser! Somebody should just slam a basketball against his wooden head and tell him to go back to kicking it with Jonathan Lipnicki (costar in 'Like Mike')."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"I never bought a Bow Wow Album before but when his first song Bow Wow (yippe yp yippie Ya) or whatever came out I loved it and the first single off unleashed was good, but not good enough to get me to buy the Cd. This time around I got the CD cuz i was convinced he'd grown up...Not really. The three good songs are \\"Big Dreams\\" \\"Let Me Hold you\\" and \\"Like You\\". If you want a good rap CD get Tupac, Nelly, 50 Cent, G- Unit, JA Rule, Kanye West, Jay-Z, Lloyd Banks, The Game. Save yourself $12 and just download these 3 songs on ITunes or Wal-Mart because they are really good but the rest of the album sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake thug","review":"Bow wow is 18 and all of a sudden he is cursing on his records, got tattoos and trying to act like athug, but the problem is he not from the streets. But getting back to the album, the only 2 decent tracks are Let me hold you and Like you amd only because of Omarion's and Ciara's guest vocals, the 3rd single Freshazimiz is generic topic on which other people did a better job rapping, the rest of the album is garbage. How is he gonna say that that this album is on par with Illmatic i will never be able to answer, bottom line is bow wow never was a thug, if anyone is a bubblegum rapper its him, and what with all the people talking about him growing up lyricaly when he does not writes his rhymesP.S. Finally Ciara smartened up and dumped him"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than i expected","review":"now im not a little Bow Wow hater, dont get me wrong i've actually baught all his albums, and at times i've defended him. but other than like you, let me hold you, and freshazimiz, this cd is pretty wack. His worse release yet. If you've heard his other albums but haven't heard this one, trust me, you dont wanna hear it. Not Bow wow's best work, but keep tryin lil bow weezy, keep trying to hold it down in the rap game.

C'mon"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think he needs a pad and a pen.","review":"As another person mentioned, I am no where near a bow bow hater. I remember feeling some type of way about liking him when he was younger because I seldom dig commercial rap. So now he's all grown up and doing his thing. He had a couple of hits.One day I'm online reading about this guy hating on Will Smith and I later learned that this guy doesn't even write his own music. WHAT?!Are you kidding me. No matter who the remarks was to, one cannot disrespect another rapper when they don't even write their own music.After hearing that I was just done. How can you rate his music when he is not writing it? What are we rating his sound over the music because he has no connection with it.I think it was just ok.\\"Fresh as I am\\" was hot. I was really feeling that sound. I like ok, he's all grown up and showing people what he is made up but again later I learned he didn't write it....lol..that'f funny.

Freshazimiz yeah bow you real hard. You got tattoos, and grillz, if anybody is a bubble gum rapper its you. This cat comes out with the same songs on every single album he put out. you got two songs for the ladies, who only support him cuz they think he cute. you get 3 songs about him braggin bout what he got, and what you dont.

His topics might a little more mature, but trust- it's still for the kids. It's basically for the same fans he has always had, since they've grown up with him (just a little bit tho).

I would have rather had more pop songs. When I want country music, I'd like a whole CD of that. Nonetheless, this is a welcome addition to my collection for the sole purpose of making mix CDs for those long car rides. It's better than buying an entire CD of Boy Meets Girl or Taco for those two individual songs.

In roughly 700 pages, it provides a thorough introduction to linear regression and supports this introduction with exceptionally clear proofs.

As I read Chacour's thoughts on these ideas i was reminded that those who are heirs according to the promise are meant to be a blessing to all nations.

Elias Chacour shows what life can be like when people take the Gospel seriously and take Jesus at his words. This book is inspiring and demands action from Christians around the world. Chacour shows Jesus' passion for justice and reconciliation and the power that those two have when lived out. I myself am a Palestinian Christian and I find myself struggling with the same issues as Chacour. His book brings hope and a real face to a place where I felt very alone. The detailed accounts of suffering at the hands of Israel could be seen as mere propaganda if they were nor mathced with Chacours struggle to forgive.The Palestinian people will never forget, but we must forgive.

I said something \\"Zionistic\\" in nature that showed my ignorance and need of an informed and balanced view. She gently suggested I would appreciate reading some books that would broaden my view. Needless to say, I was amazed by what I found out.The book by Elias Chacour was the most personal of the first few books I read.

I think that everyone who wants to know more about Palestines should read this kind book and compare with the information comming from the media. This book is full of an objective information that inform the reader about the suffering, punishment and faithfulless situation of the people from that land. Probably, when you finished the book, \\"stones and deserts may have another meaning in life.\\" If Israel was blessed to bless all the nations, why they treat palestinians like they were treated by Nazis.

I was mesmerised by the voice of this french artist, who seems to say so much, sometimes without even using words. I thought you could get tired of listening to the same music over and over but after listening to the album on and off for the last 11 years, I find it still to be as interesting now as it was then. Tracks such as \\"Bonne anniversaire\\" and \\"Triangle\\" show how good a singer she really is, not to forget the band, who rise with the front lady to face the challenges of mixing the different styles on this absolutely brilliant album. It's a shame not more artists have as much talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reliability and service problems","review":"I would echo the words to the wise from another reviewer here. I too bought a Slimtop. After 10 months the CDRW started acting up. I rang the Sony helpline, and from the voice prompt entered the model id, whereupon the voice system told me that it was out of warranty. Note - not just my machine, about which this voice system knew nothing (unless Sony are cleverer than their consumer products of course ;-), but the *entire model* was deemed out of warranty. And there was no way I could get through the system to a human being to discuss my problem. So I wrote them an e-mail describing this voice system weirdness, and my actual hardware problem. That was six months agho. Of course, I am still waiting for a response. So, my word to the wise is : if reliability or service are criteria in your purchasing decision, avoid Sony like the plague, because you will be on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"reliability & warranty problems","review":"A word to the wise on Sony's Vaio line: I purchased one of the Sony slimline computers a year ago and had a hard disk failure within the first 9 months.

The warranty replacement was a poorly refurbished unit that was actually 'GLUED' together on a trim piece and the writing surface was marred by poor packaging. I did not accept that unit and the replacement to that unit was also a refurbished unit that remained intact for less than 6 months before faint random lines began to appear from the right edge of the tablet. Recently these lines grew very dark and to an unbearable total of 13. The tablet is now in for additional warranty service (fortunately, I purchased the extended warranty). I upgraded the PC to M/S XP pro and 512 memory. Aside from initial compatibility issues that have since been resolved, the PC has been stable... though there are dead spots on the HD for which the S/W has seemingly compensated.

I have found no way to upgrade most of the parts, because they are non-standard, and I have not been able to get through to tech support.

This is neither the best nor worst album to come of it all. On the plus side of things, tight polished production and a breezy upbeat feeling make it enjoyable to listen to. Marlon had a number 2 R&B hit with the opening track \\"Don't Go,\\" and it, along with tracks like \\"When Will You Surrender\\" and \\"Talk-2-U\\" are enjoyable, if lightweight. The stylish ballad \\"Lovely Eyes\\" has a nice \\"bedroom\\" feel to it. On the downside of things, Marlon is definitely not the most vocally talented Jackson ever, lacking the high, girlish wail of Michael or the grittiness of Jermaine, and his voice really does not noticeably stand out anywhere on the album, but aside from that, it's a fairly solid album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"From the look of the book cover, one would think that this book entailed a wild and adventoruos plot; but much to my surprise this book was just full of romance.

Once I began reading the poems it was hard to stop. As a person that was raised around the sort of subject matter in the book, several of the poems reminded me of something I had experienced in my own life. The collection of hard-life realisms will take the reader on a realistic journey through a life of drugs, alcohol, and violence and ultimately hardships on the road to recovery. I highly recommend \\"Road of Sighs\\" to anyone who may have had some of these experiences in their own life or may be just curious about the life style.

This sheet fits the toddler bed very well. The fitted end is nice to tuck over the corners at the foot of the bed.

He says he felt compelled to pursue the issue as he had become concerned that education had turned into a form of indoctrination. As a result, his writings are designed to expose some of the fallacies he's encountered. We're told \\"This movement (i.e., political correctness) has had its crosshairs trained on the very heart of American culture and the traditions (the Judeo-Christian tradition, the work ethic, the traditional family, etc.) upon which that culture was founded\\" (p. 6).His documentation is strong. His logic is solid. He makes a good case for his point of view. This is a book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pimping Poppies classic!!!","review":"Actually, the Poppies fans I know refer to the CD as This is the Day (and it's their 3rd album... the first being Now For A Feast, and the second being Go Box Frenzy).

The Poppies incorporated more sampling and a heavier beat into This is This! Many critics have described the sound of the album as \\"Doom and Gloom\\" which it hardly is. Dos Dedos Mis Amigos, their final album is the one which displays that type of sound. This is the Day...This is the Hour...This is This! is one of the most unique albums I have ever heard, by one of the most unique bands I have ever heard. Despite the fact that everyone likes to gripe about stolen lines, tunes, and so forth, whether PWEI stole any of the sounds they use is irrelevant. Stolen or not, they have incorporated them in a way never before done to create a listening experience like nothing you've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Remember back in the days when musicians would sample bits of songs and never have to worry about it? Ahh the good old days! Before techno really hit it big if you went to some of the more underground (i.e. non-yuppie) clubs you'd hear industrial music blasting from the speakers. PWEI was one of those bands. The album is a flurry of samples and other beats, guitars and any other noise they would think was cool. The result is wonderful. Not as heavy as Ministry or sinister as Skinny Puppy (think more like Meat Beat Manifesto circa 99%), this cd is what I guess you could classify as techno-industrial.

In that sense, I think this is too simple. But, it's still an interesting book for me. I bought it a year ago. Since then, I've skimmed through it about five times, usually a couple of hours each time. Each time, I'm usually able to find a concept written a certain way that helps me to intellectually connect with the principles of REBT, again. Overall, it was an easy read, but continues to have a rejuvenating effect on me, not just mentally, but also helps me to immediately go out and behave differently with everybody. It's possible that I will never pick up any of the other more serious REBT books out there, but I will continually to read this simple book once or twice a year to wake me up. It's a chance to see about life through Ellis's eyes, and I like it (even though I don't worship him as a person)."},{"rating":"2","title":"REBT - It Works!","review":"It was hard to put down the latest book by Dr. Albert Ellis, \\"REBT: It Works for Me It Can Work for You.\\" I believe that this book is one of the best books that Dr. Ellis has written. I work as a therapist and have read many of his books over the years -- using his theory to help both my clients and myself.This book offers both engaging insight into many aspects of Dr. Ellis' personal life and how he used REBT to help him cope with difficulties and challenges; as well as incredibly useful ideas and procedures for people going through disability due to illness or accident and for their helpers.He used these procedures himself to help him get through a life-threatening time in 2003.This book will greatly benefit both laypersons and therapists."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I purchased his hoping to keep rabbits and maybe squirrels from coming through my backyard fence to eat my lawn.

Although a good portion of the stories and departments focus on trapping, the excellent fishing, hunting and shooting articles should NOT be overlooked. I find this magazine to be much more appropriate for the average American and Canadian outdoors person.

If I had to choose only one outdoor sporting magazine this would be it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most soporific prestissimo ever","review":"I've just downloaded and listened to this version of Beethoven's Ninth. All you need to know is that the prestissimo, which is the exclamation point of the greatest symphony ever written, is a disaster. It almost sounds as if the orchestra is about to fall asleep. How Herreweghe thought this tempo was appropriate is puzzling. And the timpanist plays like he is struggling with the last drum roll. And I've enjoyed Herreweghe's recent Beethoven symphonies on Pentatone. They are really first class. But for the Ninth, you'd be better off getting the recent Dausgaard with the Swedish Chamber Orchestra on Simax or the Skrowaczewski with the SRSO on Oehms.

I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect recording of these lovely pieces","review":"I bought this recording really in order to study these pieces, with a view to playing them someday soon (I play the bassoon). What I really appreciate about this recording are (1) the tremendous sense of ensemble that the players have, and (2) the nice alterations in tempi between the and within the movements, from an exciting allegro that really moves along to a genuine, slower adagio. I've heard other recordings of 3 of these pieces (haven't heard another one of the Rondino), and all of them tended to sound either too fast overall (maybe to squeeze onto one LP?), or like a consort of soloists who each sound wonderful, but don't sound as much like a real ensemble as these players.

I live in a humid climate with very hot summers and find that this product - although it is a \\"gel\\" which to me suggests something cooling and refreshing - feels actually pretty sticky on my face when applying it.Once the gel is absorbed, the drier areas feel as if I put absolutely nothing on. More than once did I have to put on a second moisturizer over the Aquasource because my skin felt taut and uncomfortable.

I can recommend the fat-free beans becasue you cannot tell the difference between the fat-free and regualar.They could not be easier to make. You bring 2 1/4 cups water to a boil. (More or less water depending on whether you like your beans thicker or thinner).Dump entire package into boiling water and lower heat to a simmer.

The plot is slapdash, and while Bardot is a total babe, we don't really get much of a chance to take in her charms... she has a kooky, carefree dance scene, and wears some weird outfits during a dream sequence, but really none of it is worth sitting through the actual film."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could anyone not love Bardot ...","review":"The storyline is simple, Brigette Bardot is a school girl who imagines that her father has an exciting other life which he is keeping from her. Little does she know that he owns a nightclub in Paris and is in trouble with the law. When he has to flee town, her father entrusts her to a nightclub singer, whose life turns topsy turvy when she goes to stay with him. The story is not the focus of the film, but rather Bardot's innocence and sensuality, the way she flaunts it throughout the film, one of the few actresses who has that child/woman duality about them. Of course, Brigette Bardot is a goddess, and if you are a fan, you should not miss this movie, it doesn't require much thought but is thoroughly enjoyable ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dull Movie But a Great Bardot Feature","review":"If you're not a Bardot fan, there's no particular reason to watch this movie: the dialog doesn't exactly sparkle, the slap-stick is quite corny, the plot-line makes little sense, and the characters are likely flatter than the monitor you're using to view this. However, a young Brigitte Bardot stars in this film and manages to be effervescent, kooky and lovable all at once-- the original manic pixie dream girl, one could say! If you're a fan of hers, be sure to rent this movie. And the Amazon digital copy, by the way, actually is quite crisp and clear, with decent subtitles. It's much better than the grainy, ugly trailer makes it look!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Americana Jazz","review":"Being a guy who likes a lot of action in his jazz, I was really caught off guard by this one. The material is slow and rather mundane, but each cut is a refreshing return to American music. I don't mean country western or folk, I mean good ole, down to earth American. It's emotions are rooted in the pioneering spirit of the old west.When I was young we sang \\"songs in the round\\". A simple melody is repeated, and before it ends, it is started again, and before that one ends, it is started again, and again, and again,... And so it is with Frisell's music on this album -- a simple melody is augmented by another simple melody. And then you are drawn into Frisell's world of a gentle time; of an honest time.If you're looking for action, this is probably not your cup of tea. If you're looking for the spirit of America, this is the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is good","review":"This is very definitely an album that grows on you. At first I thought Frisell soft pedaled this one, but upon repeated listening the subtelty of his technique reveals itself. As it is, I still prefer the more upbeat numbers like Roscoe and Big Shoe. Wonderful playful quality to most of the songs, even when titled Cold Cold Ground. I get the feeling of being in a cabin in the woods, sitting by a fire, as these songs touched on feelings of solitude, with a faithful companion by your side to run your fingers through his fur from time to time, while he gnaws on an old shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"New insightful take on middle east politics","review":"Doran provides readers with a new outlook on Pan-Arabism, I found his work challenged much of the preconcieved notions in the field and hence is worth much merit.

This needless version is nothing more than a big budget splatter flick complete with bad directing, bad acting, and an equally bad script. Sick and disgusting from start to finish, this mess will only appeal to those who think Jeffrey Dahmer would have made a good babysitter. Dirty, grimy looking trash from the nastier-is-better school of film making goes on far too long, but still, this is obviously someones idea of a good time. Oh, and by the way, Leatherface shows up somewhere in the film, if you care. Worst of all: R. Lee Ermey(of \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" fame)as an obscenity spewing redneck sheriff.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it is hard to watch because it is so scary. This movie did a good job of being scary and not just gross. Wish these guys would continue making Friday the 13th movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror gone too far","review":"I decided to experiment with different genres of movies and I decided to venture into this movie. I understand that horror is about scaring you out of your wits, but seeing gore and arms flying everywhere is not the kind of scared I want to be. I want to be scared by the mind games that the director weaves into the story. It does not take much talent on the director's part to throw in as much gore as they can to get the rating of R. This story would have been much more effective if people could have left the movie and said, \\"That was really scary, although I didn't think it had to be rated R.\\" I understand that this is the DVD, but I believe that the majority of the horror films coming from this day and age are usually filled more with gore than with chilling ideas that freak one's mind out. Overall, I think this remake was an uninspired move that used gore rather than ideas to scare. Not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remake of a disappointing orginal","review":"This is just another great remake of a very unscarey orginal.

He did a fantastic job. The original T.C.M. is excellent. This new one is so terrible, that it falls just short of a teen-slasher flick. The only reason why it doesn't is because it involves characters that were once original (where's the hitchhiker?) and the story was original once. People who made T.C.M. 2003, you suck. People who liked it, you don't deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More gore does NOT make a better film.","review":"I'm a big fan of the original, but this remake just did not have the scary atmosphere of the Tobe Hooper classic we all know and love.

I for one find this to be a cheap pitiful cop out, and just silly. This movie although filmed dark and moody isn't really scary and Leatherface comes off as that weird kid in school who had a lot of acne who just finally snapped. Why filmmakers find the need to remake everything these days is beyond me, but this one was really unnecessary, the updating doesn't really help this time around. Maybe Leatherface was just crazy, why can't these villians just be sick in the head without the new personal self image troubles, c'mon people save that crap for the next Hilary Duff movie. Tobe Hooper this movie is an insult to what you created and I apologize for having even seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL FOR TRUE SCARES","review":"Stick with the original if you want to be scared. This 2003 remake provides nothing to Tobe Hooper's legendary film of the 1970's. It tries hard to scare, but it doesn't really succeed in doing anything but grossing out the viewer.One of the things that made the original film so frightening was the mystery behind Leatherface. Not knowing his origins made him even more frightening. By trying to provide explanation (a skin disease similar to leprosy), via a family of freaks, the writer and director do a disservice to the audience and deflate any tension or fear. Additionally, there are few scene involving the chainsaw. How is that possible?The only positive note in this otherwise forgettable film is the presence of Jessica Biel. Watching her poetry in motion is the only thing enjoyable about the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remake suck my ass","review":"this movie SUCKED.

When I first seen this movie I was very skeptical, after the first 15 minutes I was blown away.With a few added parts that tell more of the story the originality is tuned up and it takes you on one hell of a rollercoaster ride. In my opinion this movie sets the standard on horror movie remakes. It goes more into detail of the story but they keep it original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to be gross, but ends up being really boring","review":"The 2003 version of TTCM was a big disappointment. Sure, the visual effects are thirty years better, but the movie simply lacks a purpose. The body parts don't even look real. Of course, if the Biel character had died at the end, that would have been something. Avoid this movie at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groooooooooooosse","review":"This remake of a 1970s cult cassic is not as scary as it is compleatly disgusting. The grosse-out fest begins in the first 20 minutes when the hitchhiker pulls a pistol out of her, uh, female genitalia. Right when the chainsaw starts up a youngster gets his leg hacked off. The phsycho with a skin disorder drags him to the basment and throws a hand-full of salt on the wound. There are very few truly scary part, and most of them are the glimpes of the killer's deformed face. I could'ent feel for the charecters that this town of hicks are bent on killing. Although, Jessica Biel is really hot. If you have a weak stomach, leave this one be. If you are a horror movie buff, rent the 1970s version and hold off until this one comes on cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original","review":"That statement probably will sound like blasphemy to the purists but it's true. The new version moves A LOT faster, has more gore, and adds some new dimensions to the story. I wouldn't really say it's a remake though, it's more like re-telling a horror story thats been told 1,000 times and it changes a little bit everytime. Not having the whiny invalid brother present was very satisfying. R Lee Ermie, best hick sheriff EVER. Don't get me wrong though, the original is good too but I was almost asleep by the time the killing started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Texas Remake 2003","review":"This movie SUCKS!!! It is so dorky!

This supposedly took place back in the early 1970's. So why is Jessica Beil running around in today's styles? I mean I like looking at her as much as the next guy but is this a remake or a totally different movie? The guy that plays leatherface in this movie sucks! He isn't nearly as creepy as Gunnar Hansen was in the original. The only saving part to me was the presence of R. Lee Ermey, who everyone knows as Gunnary Sgt. Hartman from \\"Full Metal Jacket\\"People's tastes differ so I'm sure there are plenty of people who feel the remake is far superior than the original but give the people that made this movie the same budget Tobe Hooper had to work with in the original and see if it comes close.

Remake of Tobe Hooper's original cult classic and vastly inferior even to that somewhat dubious underground hit. The atmosphere is admittedly thick with doom and there are shocks and gore aplenty for those who like such things, but characterization, plot, and logic are all sorely lacking. Jessica Biel is a standout scream queen and R. Lee Ermey chews the scenery with gusto, but there aren't many other good things to say about this nightmarish movie. Basically just another teenage splatterfest, if neither the best nor the worst in that overdone genre. A great example of the barbaric nature which dominates modern horror. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remake Better Than Original","review":"I'm sorry to say it, but this remake is better than the old 1974 version. This immediately gets to the action and doesn't drag on as bad as the old one does. Leatherface seems to use his chainsaw more and also it makes you feel like he is really doing this people, unlike in the original where he starts to skin the guy, but you can't see what he's doing. Jessica Biel makes a better leading lady, she runs faster than Marilyn Burns (1974 version), who was so slow that Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface) had to start cutting tree branches to keep himself from overtaking her. Either way, I like the new version better than the old. I'm sorry to say it. I truly am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Nowhere near as good as the original.","review":"Bad movie.

While not possessing quite the same feeling of shut-in violence the original had, there is still plenty to enjoy. The story has been beefed up some(there is a baby involved, there are female members of \\"The Family\\")and it is undoubtedly more violent(unnecessarily), but in many ways retains the same feeling of being trapped in one of the most frightening places on earth. Full marks should go to Jessica Biel(utterly beautiful)for being a wonderfully convincing \\"last girl\\" & Leatherface does a sterling job.

As long as Hollywood is remaking classic films. Why don't they re do Ben Hur and the Wizard of OZ? What makes movies classic and memorable is originality.

For those who belived that it was based on a true story as mentioned in the beginning of the film \\"that's the whole point!\\" it plays into the psychological aspect.

What a terrible remake of one of the greatest horror movies of all time. It's been done before! Why do it again? You can't make movies like \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" any better by throwing millions of dollars into the production.Loud bangs and CG effects don't make a horror classic and it certainly doesn't increase the effectiveness of a classic.Supposedly this movie takes place in 1973, yet Jessica Biel prances around in today's fashion with her low rider jeans, way to play the part(note sarcasm). Leatherface, played by a no named actor brought NO effort to his part and was a bore. Gunnar Hansen was actually asked to play the part but turned it down simply because he hated the fact Hollywood was creating a remake.This movie delivers nothing new and is an insult to horror classics and fans of the genre.

He is draged into the basement, and the pyscho with a skin disorder throws a handfull of salt on the wound. There are very few truely scary moments, and most of which are the glimpes of the killer's deformed face. The acting is good and Jessica Biel is really hot, but that can't save this bloody mess.

That bit of \\"information\\" is almost as disgusting as the film itself. I wonder if the writers of this piece of trash ever investigated about ed gein. if they did, they are being hideously exploitive by depicting things he never did. if they didnt, well lets say i wouldnt be surprised.the one positive thing i have to say about this is that after i sat there watching it i had a sudden, emotionally charged desire to go outside, breathe some fresh air and frolic around a bit, to escape the grimy, disgusting vortex that is the new texas chainsaw massacre."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies i ever seen!","review":"Everyone seems to love this flick,i think it was horrible and they took what was once an original horror movie in the 70s and turned it into the typical horror movies of today.

Then the second half of the movie is jessica beil running from leatherface...the ending was even worse.Take my advice,the original was wayyy better than this,that was actually an original movie.For good horror/slasher flicks check out movies like silent night deadly night,evil dead,halloween(the first 5),and nightmare on elm street.

My bad judgement! Jessica Biel is the one responsible for all the problems. Smoke some weed? She can't! Leave a rotting corpse behind? She can't!

The acting is tres horrible too. so unbelivable. Especially when you see the rest of Leatherface's Family and the cop scene at the beggining. There is no shock value to this movie. It isn't the slightest bit disterbing. It's just a collection of murders and cruelty.SEE THE 1ST TCM.

This is just a movie in that it FEELS like *just* a movie. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre felt like reality in its gritty and almost amateurish appearance and simple plot.

Everything follows from there, and excellent advice to show you how to immediately become a reasonably good player.Mr. Short is a British Grandmaster and an excellent teacher, but like a lot of people who really, really do something well, they have a tendency to overestimate their pupils' talents....after reading this book, you will tend to be a very aggressive player (compared to other beginners).

Strange, I know, but I figured the practice couldn't hurt. As I was doing questions I realized that I was getting answers wrong that just don't seem wrong. Now I can tell that the answer key has errors in it. Further complicating things is that there are like 40 drill questions for each LSAT section, but no explanation for the answers is given.Another reason to avoid this book is the fact that it is too old. The LSAT changes and evolves over time, and a book that is a decade old will not be sufficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss the Latin Touch","review":"These selections were before my time. But I've been researching Latin music for many years now and I discovered that Xavier Cugat and his Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra made a hit with Perfidia in 1941 just before he quit RCA. Why wasn't it included in this CD? Artie Shaw was a great jazzman and he recorded a jazzy version of Frenesi. Nice of Nipper to include it. Cugat recorded the Latin version of this number. The melody actually originated in Latin America. Didn't it deserve to be included too?. Don't blame Nipper though. Nice dowg, that. I'm sure the 12-year old producers of these selections did not consult him. Othewise he'd have protested with many a WOOF!

I remember a number of times not understanding my mother and father and not knowing how to verbalize my frustrations. This book made me feel better about those strong feelings. I think too much emphasis is put on not expressing negative emotions, but the reality is that it should be perfectly fine for a kid to be angry with a parent. I think this book's message on how to work through the anger is important because often kids don't understand parental motivation. This is not a terrible message about mothers... This is a message about children learning to understand how to appreciate their parents and all the good things they provide, even if -- from time to time -- they are angry with their parents for decisions they make in order to protect them and teach them right and wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HORRIBLE MESSAGE!","review":"Why would anyone read this to their kids!!!

First, the ash and other sediments are a far cry from hard rock; it takes much less time to \\"erode\\" them than it did the Grand Canyon. Second, the volume-vs-time scale is grossly underestimated - using the correct volume for sediment removed, and assuming that the rate of removal is the same for rock (which it wouldn't be), it would still indicate a formation time for the Grand Canyon of at least a million years.

Throughout the book were found several new insights into the design and beauty of nature, and the problems with evolution. Individually, the essays were very well written, with very few exceptions. This is an excellent resource for anyone who doubts the tenability of a young earth creation.

Their testimonials are sincere, but far from convincing for anyone looking for actual scientific evidence.Ashton, like all of the other answersingenesis crowd, suffers from an all or nothing mentality when it comes to supporting creation. Either one must swallow a narrow-minded interpretation of Genesis based on flawed hermeneutics, or one must reject God.Any reader who is looking for an honest evaluation of science within a Christian context will find nothing helpful here.

This book is not it. I was a bit concerned since it originally published in 1977, but with 12 printings, I assumed it must have been updated (...wrong...) and was an interesting read (...wrong again...). There's only one illustration in the entire 400 page tome, and it's an out-of-date map.Definitely written by a scholar for other scholars.

It's an interesting story/concept, but one that is so poorly executed. It has a \\"made in the 1980's\\" feel to it--its production values are far below those typically found in movies from its time (2003). Stereotypical action flick characters, dramatic orchestral music for less-than-dramatic scenes (involving just a few dozen soldiers, rather than hundreds or thousands), cheesy dialogue.

It could be forgiven some short cuts (OK, let's make all the Brits sound like bored, pathetic actors from Stratford and 'ave all zee Frenchies talk jurshst lark Frenchies do any 'ow) but in fact the plot's virtually unitelligible and in the end you don't care if anyone escapes or not.

They are so quick at explaining how this happened I just feel that they couldn't come up with a good idea its like they talked under their breath and just hoped you really didn't hear how lame of a plotline how they discovered the wormhole.This movie just had you laughing at the cheesy lines. This should have been on SciFi Channel Saturday night movie. Its perfect for that.

But I never thought that Richard Donner, usually a fine action movie director, could make such a piece of trash like this one. It's the worst book to screen adaptation I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen a lot of bad adaptations. It's unbelievable: none of the good things in the book were translated to film; The interesting facts about medieval way of life (costumes, ancient dialects, architecture, etc), the scientific explanation for time travel, the historical facts, whatever. It looks like a episode of Fantastic Journey (the seventies tv show) only less intelligent. It's already a forgotten film. If you didn't see it, don't bother.

Even the attempt at speaking French seemed somehow out of a French 101 class in high school! The battle scenes are puppetry at best and nothing close to what a good Shakespearean play would have slapped together.

I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner. There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting. When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story. The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.

I realize that in any time travel movie there will be plot holes that the viewer must be willing to overlook - it's the nature of the beast. But since the screenplay basically butchered the book and the movie run time was less that 2 hours, it was impossible to fill up enough plot holes to make the viewer willing to \\"suspend belief\\".Now to the casting: who was the creative genius who decided to give top billing to a wet-behind-the-ears boy instead of Gerry Butler?

The best part of Crichton's novel was the explanation of time travel (or rather, parallel universe travel) -- which, while fanciful, was based on actual science. The movie completely alters and glosses over this part of the story. Then it further abandons the second most interesting part of the book (expositions on life in medieval France); also minimizes the third most interesting part (the character of Doniger, who must have been based on Bill Gates) and reduces the whole story to a corny action movie. The characters are poorly cast. Key plotlines are dropped. Overall, a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the book instead","review":"The book kept me awake far into the night with its attention to historic detail combined with high-tech plausibility.

I regret to report that I honestly can't think of one single redeeming feature in this sorry excuse of a film. A script that butchers the book, which is amazing in itself. Crichton practically writes his novels for the screen these days. Uninspired directing. In the past Donner has given us some fine work like Ladyhawk and Lethal Weapon. It was painfully obvious that the person who made this turd just did not care if it was good or not. The cast was barely adequate, with only Gerard Butler making any kind of impression. The action scenes were cable TV quality, as were the sets and costumes. How bad was this movie? Congo (another Crichton novel that was mugged by the filmakers), by comparison, was a good movie. Zero artistic effort here. Sub-zero, if there is such a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome book!...possibly the worse movie i've ever seen...","review":"Ok, I read Timeline in I think January, and was a bit anxious to see how the movie would relate to the book. Boy, what a waste of a rental...Let me tell you something...read the book, please do. Use your imagination...when you're reading the book, dont think about Paul Walker in the place of Chris...it just ruins everything. I mean, this movie was so different than the book, that they shouldn't share the same name. They DESTROYED! Chricthon's awesome book. Ya'll, really go read the book, its soo good...watch the movie afterwards and see what im talking about.

Yes, Donner was terrific with SUPERMAN, but that was really fantasy not science fiction and it was over 25 years ago!!!Another red flag is Paul Walker, another of those better than average looking below average actors that Hollywood occasionally tries to pump up into a movie star, and he's as lousy in this as he's been in everything else I've seen him in.If you want to see some good time travel science fiction, see George Pal's THE TIME MACHINE with Rod Taylor or Irwin Allens' tv show, THE TIME TUNNEL, but avoid this movie!!!Chari KrishnanRESEARCHKING"},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain bad","review":"i did not read the book, but i am sure that it was decent and fairly plausible. is that a safe assumption? well, it would not be a safe assumption to describe this movie in the same way. it seems like the actors really wanted to come across as serious, but they just didn't. to try to cram in what i'm sure was a good amount of information in the book into a two hour movie was nothing short of disastrous. and if you didn't know that there was a book, this movie is still ridiculously bad. it's the kind of movie you'd see on one of the local tv stations on an early saturday afternoon. it's a notch below B-movies. don't waste your time watching it. not even for paul walker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"this movie was alright but it could've been a lot better. i didn't particularly like the cast. this movie really shows that paul walker can't really act. there are some intense moments but they become unmemorable and fade away. it isn't even that entertaining. just a movie to watch if you're bored or if there's nothing else good to watch. let me tell you though, the book by michael crichton is VERY, VERY GOOD. i got so much more out of the book than watching this movie. the movie lacks depth and meaning while the book actually brings you back to the midieval times and makes you experience hell. it is terrifying, gripping, and interesting. the movie is...not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya, ya the book yadda yadda yadda","review":"Ok so its not as good as the book... what movie is? So that said, the movie is somewhat well shot with good attention to detail as far as the year 1357 is concerned. The acting is something to be desired overall. The conflicts are somewhat sudden and seem overly complicated. This movie is forgettable, in that once you finish watching it you kinda wake up, shake your head and find out whats for dinner.

I must say that Timeline is BAD! While bits and pieces of the movie are similar to the book, overall, this is one of the worst adaptations that I have ever seen. The main point of the story is the only thing that even comes close to the book. The rest of it, well, isn't even close.As far as entertainment value, I would have to say this movie has little. The only saving grace is the battle scene at the end of the movie. The rest of it was dry and very un-entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunk!","review":"The book is amazing but this movie is just a very disasterous adaptation of the book. The result was a movie that felt like it had nothing to do with the book and was just a forgettable hodgepodge of weak acting and awful script.A total dissapointment. Stick with your books and tell the studios to try again at adapting to this to the big screen because this 2003 version does no justice at all to the book. No wonder Crichton lamented this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could only choose negative 5 stars","review":"This is the worst time travel movie ever made and may be amongst the top 20 worst movies ever made period.

Well, I was wrong. The time travel idea has been done and redone and this movie adds nothing of value to the concept. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because Billy Connolly and Gerard Butler are excellent in their roles.P.S. Paul Walker is not an actor.

It makes the audience jump through a never ending series of ridiculous hoops to follow the \\"plot\\". I must admit I read the book before seeing the movie and this colored my expectations quite heavily. However, that being said the movie still falls short when not compared to its literary predecessor. The \\"acting\\" is laughably bad, the lines are so trite I found myself rolling my eyes every five minutes and no amount of special effects could save it from these shortcomings.P.S. Someone please beg Michael Crichton to start writing his own screenplays, or at least proofread them to avoid this horrible tripe..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A jumbled confusion of action with some beautiful panoramas","review":"This film could have been great. The incredible battle sequences at the castle and the detail on the medieval customs and architecture were wasted on the poorest adaptation of a book I have ever seen. This should have been split into two movies (ala Lord of the Rings) or at the very least run a half hour longer.Too much of the exisitng footage was wasted on implausible escapes and mindless chases, and not enough set-up was engineered to make the audience believe in time travel or what the connection was between the archeological dig and the medieval war. The concept of the little time-transport amulets idiotic and I found myself neither caring which side won (Emglish vs. French) nor understanding why they were fighting.There was nothing in this film to capture my imagination. Just a whirlwind of disjointed action sequences splendidly filmed and passably acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch This One on TV For Free","review":"Let's face it; some movies were just made to be watched on TV for free, and Timeline is one of them. If I had been sitting at home alone on a rainy day and this came on, I would have watched it and wouldn't have felt too bad. But instead I paid $4 to rent it and wish I had about 3 of my dollars back. This was a plain and simple action flick disguised as something deeper, which it wasn't. The story had potential, but too many important parts were glossed over while character development and plot development were both passed over in favor of fight scenes and more fight scenes. For a supposed \\"historical epic,\\" this one was about as shallow as they get. You'll feel like you're watching a bunch of college kids running around in costume at the Rennaisance Fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"This movie is just flat. There's nothing here to really entertain that hasn't been done before. The storyline flows rather awkwardly, and the acting is wretched.Sure, the book wasn't SPECTACULAR, but it was at least entertaining, exciting, and still somewhat original. This movie isn't any of those. It's not so bad that I regret seeing it(hence 2 stars), and I wouldn't shrink away from ever having to see it again, but I certainly wouldn't pay money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be hard to make a more useless film","review":"It is no exaggeration to say thatTimeline (Full Screen Edition)is one of the worst big-budget films in a decade.GodzillaandHulk (Full Screen Special Edition) [2 Discs] are likeCitizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)next to what has to be the worst idea Michael Chricton ever had. The story is of a group of archeologist/researchers going back in time to mid-1300s Europe, during the Hundred Years War between England and France. The plot is totally nonsensical, there is nothing approaching character development, the acting is laughable and the editing extremely choppy. I would be suprised to learn if any director/producer/writer involved in this ever got another paid job. There should be a cash reward given to anyone over 18 who can watch until the end. Even if there were, not many would want to attempt it. Timeline gives the entire action/scifi/book-to-movie genre a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to ruin a good book.","review":"What is it about Michael Crichton books that are so easy to screw up? Good movies are possible from Crichton's work, such as Jurassic Park and Andromeda Strain. From Congo to Sphere, though, Crichton's books have made horrific movies. Timeline is no exception. I consider Timeline, the book, to be one of Crichton's crowning works. This movie however, is a total wreck. The plot is lost in a sea of overworked special effects. Paul Walker was a horrible choice for his role. The plot changes lose the audience. The science of the movie seems to be lost in the rush to make a good action movie. If you want a good movie, look elsewhere, if you want a good book, read Timeline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timeline with Gerard Butler Received Broken and Glued","review":"I received three movies today and even though Timeline was in a sealed package it is cracked near the center and is tacky as it has been glued.

However after reading the book the DVD is not all that great. I recently watched the movie again, and was sorely disapointed. Michael Crichton's book was amazing. There were several details that could have been left out of the movie, however the movie could have been so much better if they chose to follow the book. Timeline is worth renting if you haven't seen it, but I would not go out and buy it. Although the one thing I enjoyed was the Scottish accents, those were awesome to listen to. If you really want a good story read the book instead of watching the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOODNESS!!!","review":"This is one of the best movies there is! I love it! The whole idea is so amazing. I saw the movie which interested me into reading the book. The book had more scenes, etc. of coarse, but I still liked the movie a lot too. I'm a huge fan of Michael Crichton, and I love all the books I've read of his: Timeline, Airframe, Sphere, Prey, and I'm about to read State of Fear.

I didn't expect the movie to be nearly as good - movies seldom are - but I didn't expect it to be terrible!From the first few minutes of the movie, I knew something was wrong. The acting seemed poor - the dialog unnatural, and they were cutting things out right and left. Not only did they cut too many scenes - they also fundamentally changed the plot.It's really disappointing when such a good book is ruined in such a poor movie. I actually had trouble watching it.Even though I am clearly biased by reading the book, other less biased people who watched it with me agreed that it was poorly done.What a shame. Don't waste your time with this one - read the book instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the critics, listen to me!","review":"I'm not a fan of Paul Walker and the movies he makes because they are usually bad and have a bad script, but this movie has changed my thoughts about him. Timeline offers great battle sequences, a more than average script, a good plot, great and realistic costumes, and great special effects. This movie is great and certainly deserves more credit. So don't listen to all the critics because not one movie is good to them.

Laughable acting, beyond stupid situations, stereotypes that would embarrass stereotypes, no logic at all and editing that left me dumbfounded. Apart from the reasonable special effects and decent locations the film comes across as a particularly poor student effort that needed a tutor to step in.Avoid at all costs and read the excellent book that at least does not make out every person from England is the Antichrist, every Scot is a 'Braveheart' and the French are poor, sweet little innocents.The only thing this disaster wins at is how many times it is possible to get the actors to say, \\"Oh my God!\\". I counted at least 30. I wish the script writer had been sent and left back in the Middle Ages. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"This movie is terrible.

However, I read the book before going to see the movie and was appalled to see just how badly they messed up the original storyline.

LET'S GO!!\\" just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered","review":"They completely destroyed an excellent book. I reread the book for the 5th time or so last week, and I couldn't get this horrible movie out of my mind. They plot was torn to shreds, they left out at least 80% of it. The book gave the characters depth, the movie didn't. The book gave plausible explanations for everything. The movie came up with some stupid explanation that had little to do with the book. In the book, they could go to anywhere they wanted, in cage-like machines that they could summon. Little pendants with a button? Phft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe everything you read--this is a decent flick!","review":"After having read some of the reviews here, I did not expect much. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie! If you like history/action/time travel movies, this one presents a very watchable story. Yes, there are some plot holes here and there, but that's not unusual. I found nothing wrong with the acting and casting of characters. Of course the book was better, as most books are, but some liberties had to be taken when paring it down for a 2 hour movie. There are things you'll pick up when you watch a second time, especially if you did not read the book first.A nice bonus is the special features--four of them about the making of the movie that are fairly comprehensive and decently interesting. All in all a worthy dvd, except for the lack of a booklet/chapter list, which is a pet peeve of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time bomb!","review":"Richard Donner beats out Ed Wood for the worst director in filmdom with this cheesy effort.The movie combines a complete lack of directorial vision with stilted acting, inane dialogue, some hackneyed, cookie-cutter thrills and an infernal, non-stop music score. The overall result is a trashy presentation of what should have been a robust and entertaining sci-fi movie. Truly third-rate!Don't hold your breath waiting for any of the elements that make the novel by Michael Chriton such an interesting and exciting read. The film bears absolutely no resemblance.Save your money AND your time folks ... buy the book instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stripped-down vehicle.","review":"The plot holes in TIMELINE are monsterous. To have sucessfully pulled off a filmed version of the highly entertaining CRICHTON novel, the final cut would've been four and a half hours long and budgeted at over a hundred mil. A mountain of useful plot info was untapped making the movie confusing for the uninitiated, and unsatisfying for readers of the book. Not a bad flick, but none too engaging either, TIMELINE is just kind of there.

The trouble with advanced screenings, you're never sure if you're seeing a final cut, a rough cut, or something which will be retooled based on audience response. Overall, my impression was that it was closer to a final cut than anything else.The plot finds several 21st century archeologists in 15th century France, on a mission to rescue their mentor. The Professor was sent back and left for dead by the Bill Gates-like mogul who stumbled upon the time travel technology.Director Richard Donner seems set on a low-tech approach to the special effects. A refreshing change in these days of everything being CGI. While a bit predictable at points, the story flows fairly well and makes for a fun time at the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool castle siege, that's all","review":"There's some cool scenes of a nighttime siege on a castle with flaming projectiles flying back and forth and some interesting glimpses of Medieval warfare--some really well-done historical recreation in that department--but the rest of the movie is just plain silly, and some of the acting is pretty bad, and a lot of the acting is really bad, and obviously the director is pretty sad if he just let slide so much bad. Probably a movie for teenage boys. I probably would have liked it when I was a teenager and lacked an age-earned discriminating eye. For teenage girls? Well, that's for a woman to say. There's a cute, although preposterous, romance mixed in. Medievalists might like owning a copy for the recreations. My copy's going to the used bookstore if they'll give me a buck for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thumbs Down!","review":"This one wins my vote for the worst movie of the year with clichés galore, a thin, predictable, and unbelievable plot, bad dialogue, and inaccurate historical facts. It's not even mildly entertaining; however it is nauseating in its cheesiness. As I watched the movie, I wished that either the French or the English would kill off all of the time traveling main characters so that the story would end. Needless to say, I couldn't sit through the whole thing. In short, don't waste your money on this one. If you must see it, rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone, Please Try This Again","review":"I read the book first and loved it so much that I purchased the DVD. But there were so many variations from the book that viewing the movie was less than enjoyable. I'm not saying that a movie needs to be exactly like the book, word for word. But the entire theme and plot was changed around. An actual father/son relationship was forged between the professor and Chris that was completely unnecessary. In fact, it added a sort of cheesiness to the movie that I couldn't overlook.I was not happy with this movie. However, I am not writing this review to bash the movie. I hope that this review and others like it would spur another writing, direction and production team (or even the same team) to film this movie again and really do the book justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who wouldn't like this movie","review":"Time travel, medieval history, no wonder I had a had time getting this movie. The action sequences are simply the best. The history side blends well with the rest of the movie without making it a university level final exam question. You can and will be facinated by the events and how NOT to trigger a change to history by accident, if you are ever transported to the past. They chose the right actors for the right parts, even the bad guys. I also believe it represents well the type of conditions lived in by the peoples at that time so pay attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low budget and cheesey","review":"The only reason I could watch a little of this was because of the eye candy: Paul Walker and Gerard Butler.

The script made little sense and had so many plot holes that it was hard to stick with it to the end. If there is a God, Paul Walkers' movie career should end here. His \\"whoa, dude\\" style of performance was completely out of place in the film, and I really doubt that he has the talent to pull off any other type of role.

But this movie was absolutely HORRID!!! The book was SO MUCH better. Now, Hollywood is pretty much known for butchering novels through movie adaptations, but this was relentless. The incredible detail and enlightening, thoughtful entertainment of Crichton's novel is WIPED OUT and PARED DOWN so that Paul Walker can have a starring vehicle. I have nothing against Paul Walker, but this just wasn't the movie for him. In fact, I envisioned a totally different cast for a story of this magnitude. This movie goes beyond oversimplification of the novel. On it's own, it's just BAD. It is a 1950's B-movie masquerading as a big budget studio production. I might have found it entertaining if it didn't try to take itself so damned seriously, which it was sort of doomed to do since it was SUPPOSED to be based on the Crichton novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THE BOOK","review":"I love the book and this its one of Mike's greatest.

Not that you actully notice anyway, until someone tells you he has been gone for 2 weeks.The characters are poorly developed, and are usually killed before you can get to know them.Those that aren't spend most of thier time climbing on buildings, and smashing up walls. One decides to rescue a French girl (Anna Friel with a very bad accent), from the nasty English who kill the French for sport (after having ran out of deer.)The film relies on non-stop action, as opposed to telling good storytelling.So for two hours the baddies chase peasants, stab people, burn houses and dangle women from battlements. All because they are English of course. Reason enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON TIMELINE!","review":"I thought the new version of The Time Machine was bad, but this far exceeds even THAT turkey.

As a parent who grew up watching Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, it is wonderful to see his legacy continuing in such a worthwhile show. Unlike Dora, Diego, or Max and Ruby, there is an authority figure with the children almost constantly and helping them learn valuable life lessons. The songs are very catchy and my 3 year old is often singing them. I have also found that this show deals with issues for young children that I can not recall being done before, ie separation anxiety. Also, Daniel stresses that you can imagine and lets you know that is exactly what he is doing.I wish there were more shows like this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the little lessons","review":"I routinely sing back the little lessons to my toddler.

She's either jealous of or jealous at the hero who spends most of his time laughing at her. The book is riddled with way too many secondary characters, and they ALL happen to be beautiful. Every one of them. I for one really like having a beautiful heroine in a romance novel but the author took this too far. To top it all of, half the book is just one big preparation/set-up for her next book in this series.This romance had very little chemistry, stilted dialog, too vast a number of dull secondary characters that will bore you to tears. The mystery..... LOL, really, too corny for words. Pass up on this snoozer of a romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a first time reader of Heather Graham and will not be ordering another of her books.

The heroine was a whiny, immature brat that you could never quite like and there were so many characters that you couldn't warm to any of them. The storyline was hokey. The dialogue was so stilted and unrealistic that I nearly didn't finish to book--and now I wish I hadn't bothered.

I cannot wait to get this book out of my personal library, and I will most likely not read the rest of this trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"This story was not vintage Heather Graham. It was a weak story line right from the beginning. It was almost as though she had to write something, and this was the result.

Even more so than the other one I read, this one was written extremely simplistically, almost on a young-adult level. I don't like this author's style of writing, at least her contemporary-romance-suspense novels. And this one had a stupid story, with no development of the characters, so I couldn't care less about any of them. The twist at the end, while a surprise to me, was, well, stupid. The character who turned out to be the \\"bad guy\\" and why he was the bad guy were contrived. It seemed like the author wrote herself into a corner and \\"had\\" no choice when it came down to who turned out to be her ultimate \\"bad guy\\" and why. I would steer clear of this author for contemporary romantic suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop everything and buy now","review":"Wow! I hope the Nilsson re-releases don't stop until the entire catalog has been covered!This is a tremendous album, mixing Nilsson's pure and perfect voice with the music and poetry of Randy Newman.

The gem of the album, though, is the previously unreleased \\"Snow\\", with its sad lyric and heartfelt vocal from Harry. The liner notes said they had recorded Newman's \\"Linda\\" as well, but it is now lost - what a shame!If you are a Nilsson fan, there's no debate: you've got to have this.

But even worse is COWBOY, which ends in a cascading cacophony-tribute to John Barry's THEME FROM MIDNIGHT COWBOY. Like Unkle Joe said, LIVING WITHOUT YOU is the clincher. The sung-by-Harry version is infinitely superior to the sung-by-Randy version due to the fact that Harry had an actual voice and could actually sing. Randy's lonely echoed piano chords are incredibly eloquent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Harry, Hate Randy","review":"I Love Harry Nilsson, but can't listen to this album because I can't stand Randy Newman. ALL of the songs were written by Randy and are well-crafted and poetic and BORing. This is really just an UNbearable Randy Newman album with the Fabulous Harry Nilsson singing lead vocals. By the time the first version of \\"Cowboy\\" ends I'm ready to kill Harry for doing an entire album of Randy's songs. By the second time \\"Cowboy\\" ends- with the alternate take-I'm ready to kill myself for buying it! My recommendations: \\"Harry\\" for pure pop genius tunesmith and excellent cover songs, \\"Nilsson Schmilsson\\" and \\"Son of Schmilsson\\" for touches of genius laced with silly humor, and \\"The Point\\" (buy the video and the CD) for a meaningful children's story narrated by Ringo Starr and sung by Harry."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Russell Targ takes what is seemingly complex topic and makes it easy to understand.I found this book fascinating and educational.

Things don't work out sometimes. They just happen and it doesn't get better. The great revelation, though, is voiced by the wife who says that for all our planning and hoping, the future has something for us that we didn't plan and THAT'S OKAY.

There are many reviews here that say this live version is better than the studio version of \\"The Wall.\\" While this sounds excellent, and it is natural to be very enthusiastic about a live performance as great as this one, I strongly disagree that it makes for better listening than than the studio album. I would rather listen to \\"The Wall\\" anyday! However, this is a superb live concert recording and it is well worth having because the concert event for The Wall is legendary in rock annals, and, after all, this is Pink Floyd - and they sound great! It's very good to hear Roger Waters giving it his all, and David Gilmour's guitar solos on \\"Mother\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" are the very stuff that rock guitar legends are made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember, it was 1979!!!!!","review":"I always love reading 1 star reviews. They have NO idea how hard it was in 1979 to recreate what was done in the studio. Using tape loops were incredibly difficult as well as the multitrack instruments. The Floyd delivered the goods on this tour!!!!! As for MLOR, Pulse, the Division Bell, and Delicate Sound of Thunder... They are good in their own right but the songs you really want to here were mostly written by Roger."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic, but still not complete....","review":"According to several Floyd biographies I have read, the Wall concert was staged and filmed twice by Alan Parker ( who directed the feature film of the same name ) for inclusion in the movie that eventually came out in 1982. That footage was never used in the film, obviously. SOMEWHERE out there in the vaults is a terrific concert just crying out to be released on DVD. This should have happened here, but didn't. Having said that, this is a terrific live album. Very well played, and it sounds good. The photos in the deluxe book I bought left me wanting more, though. I wanted to SEE the concert as well as hear it. The cynic in me makes me think that in a few years, when the money starts getting a little low the Floyd will release this one again, and give the fans the real treat of the Wall concert on DVD.

Pulse is also a very worthwhile live album although it lacks the presence of roger waters. Highlights from Is There Anybody Out There include Pink Floyd's definitive cut \\"Comfortably Numb\\", Run Like Hell\\", \\"Mother\\", and Another Brick in the Wall Pt 1\\".

For any other music fan, it's also an excelent buy. The limited edition is highly recommended. It provides interviews of the band and other members of the show, information about the concert (even blueprints of the stage), and of course, incredible pictures of one of the greatest shows ever made.The performance of the band is superb, even with the problems arised during the tour (Wright was thrown out of the band by Waters, for example).You must remember though that this concert was recorded on some tapes that has been stored for 20 years and not in the best conditions. There are a few songs that have some details in the sound.

It is obviously a well-rehearsed and planned out piece, with very little left for the improvisational capabilities of Pink Floyd, which was, at one time, very great, though not to where other bands such as the Grateful Dead excelled. However, the sheer force of the story line carried well in the live setting, and Roger asking \\"Is there anybody WEAK in the audience tonight\\" is priceless.Basically, I think if you enjoyed the Wall when it came out, you will enjoy this pieced together performance of it, it has just that much extra above the studio CDs to make it worthwhile. However, if you are entrenched in the Pink Floyd of early years, you will find this as dissapointing, if not moreso, than you might have the Wall when it came out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful what you get!","review":"The music is great, the bad rating is for Amazon.

The Wall is one the best albums in music history, but we've heard many The Walls: The original one (1979), a movie, different versions by different members from Pink floyd for more than 30 years. It's enough people. We cannot look at Pink Floyd through The Wall only and after 30 years. Will they try to come up with something new close to level of The Wall? Is it not more productive if they give a real effort for a new album instead of reissuing The Wall? Will you be giving them 5 stars for any version of The wall? Do you suggest (by giving 5 stars) that Pink floyd should continue to re- release The Wall for another 30 years? Get real, we do not need this one. Do not get me wrong. Pink floyd is my favorite band. A band which came up with many great albums is certainly capable of producing some new nice music. I'm sorry, this release is to deceive their fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, can't get much more boring than this","review":"I bought this album thinking that the songs would sound different than they did on the studio album.

I like Pink Floyd much better without the control-freak known as Roger Waters(i.e Pulse, Division Bell and MLOR.) Pulse is so much better than this that it is almost frightening. Yeah, the sound quality is good but the energy just isn't there. Hey You sounds exactly like it does on the album and so does Mother. It is just so frustrating listening to this album. David Gilmour cared about the music. Roger Waters cared about the image and the message the album had to convey. If you care about the music, pick up Pulse. You will not be disappointed.

The most valuable thing for fans might be the two booklets that come with the CD featuring numerous photos of the stage show and interviews with the major players, including all four band members.

Every sentence, nuance, and tone in the enitre work should reach into everyones hearts differently and either horrify you or enlighten you, or, I think the bands perogative was both. Don't read into the music - as John Lennon would say - Let the music feed you and think about it before you defecate it out of your big fat ars. The Wall changed my life.

And while other Floyd/Waters live concert albums such as P.U.L.S.E and In The Flesh are good albums. They lack a great deal of atmosphere. This doesn't!. The whole thing translates brilliantly.It's interesting listening to songs such as \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" which now have a completely different context to them than they had on the album.The ONLY wild card here is Comfortably Numb which isn't as good as it's studio counterpart.

The set is of amazing quality and is so unique with Roger and Dave sharing vocals on many songs. What a combination these two made. Rick Wright and Nick Mason are simply puppets and are not needed in the least. I hate to say this but the only reason that Wright and Mason are in the band is because Dave could never have been allowed to use the Floyd name without them. They are both great musicians and Rick is a great singer but the truth is that Roger and Dave are resposible for 95% of Floyds music. Get this set and enjoy.

It is not a \\"custom fit\\" at all. The plastic belt loop is impractical as well, large and cumbersome, not sleek or attractive at all. It sets the phone case well away from your body, and seems ungainly. NOT recommended at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE CASE FOR THE KRZR","review":"THIS CASE SERVES ITS PURPOSE PERFECTLY.

But if you just want to get a notion of what women's clothing was like during the dark days of the Depression, it's a good place to start. Suits, coats, dresses, evening gowns, accessories, even underwear can all be found in these pages. (Almost 80% of the book is given over to female fashion; a small section at the back offers men's and children's dress.)

(Drew Barrymore in a rubber mask = a large, deep-voiced black man???)7) Doh! Should've put this one first: Are you a teenager?If you answered \\"Yes\\" to any or all of these questions, you'll probably love this movie. If not, you'll either hate it... or you cheat on questionnaires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch it to goof on it","review":"This movie is possibly the cheesiest movie of all time. The movie steals from Mission Impossible and the Matrix while adding glamour shots that are so hokey you get a little sick to your stomach.But if you look at this movie in its proper context: A ton of money and time and effort was spent on a movie that tries to be Dumb, then maybe you can enjoy it.It's too silly, ridiculous, and cheesy to take seriously. It's impossible to care about, but fun to watch. You'll probably be making fun of the movie throughout. It bugs me to see so much time and effort be put forth for something so absolutely stupid, but some people think stupid is great.Watch it on free TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"Oh my goodness, this is even more horrible than the TV series!

But the storyline itself is hardly even there, which is very disapointing. Acting in this movie isn't very good but is good enough to pass as a character who doesn't know the camera is in front of them, but barely good enough. Directing in this movie is the only good thing that has come out of this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Michelle Yeoh does it better......","review":"Bad script, bad action, and bad acting. What were they thinking? The best thing about this film was the opening when fans got to see the stunning Jacklyn Smith -- who still looks better than all the actresses in this film. Even Michele Yeoh does all her stunts while these ladies need a wire to hoist their heavy, out-of-shape bottoms off the ground.

If you like the Power Rangers, you'll love Charlies Angels. The audience they are targeting is young boys & girls. Remember the Spice Girls?

This is the worst movie that I've EVER seen. Everyone kept telling me how good it was. I went to see it and left after the first 15 minutes. Then I went back again because I'd been told that I didn't give it enough time and I should stay for the whole show. They even paid me to go back (I wouldn't have spent my own money AGAIN).It's the most brainless and hammy movie that I've ever seen. I've heard that men really like it. My husband was the one that wanted to leave the first time we tried to sit through it. He couldn't stand the movie even though it was FULL of T & A. That's pretty bad.I was sorry to see that so many people find it enjoyable.

Perhaps that worst movie of the year!! The acting was bad, the plot was bad, the humor was a poor attempt at campy ... just a big bust. Again, another movie that throws big name actors / actress and that should be enough to carry the movie. It was nothing like the original TV series and it was not even good on it's own merit. I have watched some bad movies before ... but they are usually \\"B\\" movies and you somewhat expect that. In this case, it was as bad as most \\"B\\" movies, if not worse. I cannot understand the 4 and 5 star ratings that people give this move. It was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could go lower than one star I would","review":"The only reason to watch this movie is if you are working on being insane or just want to see beautiful women act stupid. This movie is just plain terrible, nothing good can come out of it besides a decent soundtrack. Tom Green was worse than usual, and Bill Murray's agent needs to be retired. The fighting scenes were just awful. Maybe in a japanese cartoon they would be suitable. This isn't even campy fun, it would be like attending a Wham reunion concert. I don't recommend this to anybody. Why can't they make more movies like \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\", \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", and \\"The Big Lebowski\\". Hollywood please stop with movies like these, we are smarter than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries *way* too hard","review":"This movie tries too hard to *not* take itself seriously. Obviously the TV series the movie was based on wasn't the height of cinematic perfection but was entertaining enough on a Saturday night to waste an hour. The movie spends too much time making fun of the series and not enough doing what at good movie should do which is tell a story. Some of the \\"in\\" jokes were fine but there were so many of them it was more of a distraction than funny. The action scenes tended to go over the top to the point where there wasn't even any hope of being believable. And while we are at it can we stop imitating \\"The Matrix\\" now? It's getting old.The actresses do a good job as the Angels and Bill Murray as Bosley was a good choice. Tom Green as Drew Barrymore's boyfriend was just plain annoying.This is a mildly entertaining movie that is worth renting if you enjoyed the series but nothing beyond that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"One-half hour into this movie I guessed the entire plot - what little there was of one.

I grew up in the '70s so I knew the original \\"Charlie's Angels\\" t.v. show well. I normally like Cameron Diaz as an actor, But what was she thinking in doing this film?! The plot was unstable, the acting was poor and Bosely's part,played by Bill Murray, was turned into a mockery. Drew Barrymore could have \\"produced\\" a good remake or made a decent updated one, but she did it very sloppy instead. Why, was this film allowed out on screen? Especially considering most films,even the good ones, are often shelved before their debut. They should be forced to rename the title.The music was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stay Away from this Film. Spend Your Money Elsewhere.","review":"If not one of the worst movies, near one of the worst movies I paid to see in years. Luckily, I avoided tragedies like “Battlefield Earth,�?but I digress. This movie demonstrates everything that is wrong with modern cinema, asides from the cell phone and the idiot next to you who insists on talking into it during the movie.Rather, this piece of junk, and I’m being judicious, lacks all merit. It was not original. Not simply the title, concept or execution, but right down to the action and fight scenes. These scenes were a bad mixture of Mission Impossible meets Asian Martial Art films doing wire stunts.This movie lacked any sense of theme or cohesion. One second, I’m in a disco with Cameron Diaz and next with Lucy Liu and her death muffins. And yes, I got the concept that this is meant to be a bit campy, which makes it worse! This movie keeps asking am I a big action flick or a camp film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlies Angels, A Feast For the Eyes...","review":"Being in my mid 40's I was around for the original Charlie's Angels TV show. Although the women were all very tasty, I had no use for the show. I got sick of Farah before she got sick of herself... HOWEVER, I really enjoyed the movie ! I guess the main thing was the color! COLOR COLOR ! The girls were all scrumptious and the humor was as corny as it was supposed to be. They didn't take themselves too seriously and thats what made it fun. The effects and action were Spectacularly filmed and the editing was right on the mark.

It's extremely funny and enjoyable to both men and women. I liked how the women got to kick butt this time instead of the men. Very 'Girl Power' oriented movie.This movie had a cool plot, good effects, great fight sequences, good music, humor, and great acting by Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, and Bill Murray. This DVD also had tons of great extras. Three cheers for 'Charlie's Angels'!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Over-Hyped & Disappointing Movie Of The Year 2000","review":"Please don't believe all the hype about Charlie's Angels. The movie was weak and not worthy of buying ( rent only ). The movie was very unsatisfying and typical. Basically you watch 3 barbie dolls say catch phrases and beat up soft villians. The action in the movie was not like I expected. I am tired of movies trying to be like The Matrix & Mission Impossible etc... The movie clearly did not try to bring anything new to the action scene. Crazy and stupid plot twists (just like The Matrix/Mission Impossible/Art Of War etc...) also help make this film fail to bring any originality. Please, if you have not already seen this movie and you're going to see it, don't get your hopes and expectations too high. ( Rent Only )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not but...","review":"I was expecting a LOT in this action movie. It is a nice movie. Nothing more.

I'm glad I waited to rent this, and can't imagine wanting to ever see it again. I rented both this film and the second one to watch them back to back. Neither were boring, but one film spoofing the television show would have been enough.This movie kind of reminds me of the Austin Powers kind of flick, so I suppose, if you're into that kind of movie, this one will appeal to you as well. Definitely not recommended except as a nothing better to do rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I expected the movie to be somewhat like that TV show, but this turned out to be to comical with a weak and very unrealistic story line. In my opinion this movie made woman look like they are stupid and can get by on only looks and luck.The movie is about 3 woman \\"Charlie's Angels\\" who take on a client that needs someone found. The movie takes its turns through an investigation, love plots and some rescues, but none to realistic.I think if there was a lot less comedy and more realism this movie could have been a lot better. This movie was a complete waste of time for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"It reminded me of a mix between MI2 and Austin Powers! I am so glad I didnt spend 7.00 to see this at the theatre!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spunky, but unrealistic","review":"Although three hot chicks are in three hot uniforms pretending to be superheros, something about Charlie's Angels just doesn't click. Maybe its the pale villian, who licks hair (YUCK!!!!), or the plot itself. Diaz, Liu, and Barrymore are the brought back trio from the 70's know as Charlie's Angels. Women crime fighters, with very strange methods. The Angels are given an ordinary case, but it all goes haywire, when their communicator between them and Charlie(Murray)is kidnapped. Charlie's Angels is a good one time see, but its comedy is exhausted after the first view.Special appearances from Tom Green (Barrymore's Boyfriend) and Bill Murray liven the movie up a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"See Chicken Run or Titan A.E. Instead","review":"I wasn't impressed with this video. Some of the fighting and special effects were neat (though not always believable), but the plot was unoriginal. The computer break-in scene reminds one very much of Mission Impossible (1). The storyline jumps and shifts too much for comfort, without being surprising -- as if someone up top couldn't settle on this version or that. And the girls run on sexy scenes -- sporting skimpy clothes and conveniently unzipped water suits -- instead of showing some real personality. The skin plus some questionable language makes \\"Charlie's Angels\\" unsuitable for family viewing.Too bad; the crime-fighting team, backed by an anonymous millionaire, wasn't that bad of an idea. And the way the girls obviously loved him, unseen, was cute too. The redhead's glimpse of Charlie, near the end, is poignant; you imagine she'll treasure that forever. Anyone interested in a remake?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a joke????","review":"OK, I rented Charlie's Angels cuz I heard it was funny, and I love Lucy Lui, shes a great actress. Was this a parody of the orginal Charlie's Angels? The script was poorly written, and half the technology they had could never be made. It was very unrealistic. I admit, some lines were funny, and some of the music was funny(Caviar and Blink182). I wish I could have seen more of Matt LeBlanc, Tom Green and Tim Curry. It was cool to see women superheos kick guys butts, but the script was just so poor. I would not recomend this movie to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much fun!","review":"Charlie's Angels has to be one of the most entertaining and fun movies I've seen in a long time. Imagine a Austin Powers/ Matrix/ Mission:Impossible/ TSAMary. Although it's not the greatest script ever or anything, there is not a second to bring the movie to boredom. These girls, Cameron, Lucy and Drew, are absolutely a riot. I can't wait until the sequel as this is now my most awaited DVD. Angels is nowhere near the best movie of the year, but it will easily become one of your favorites and most rewatchable movie of the year. I'll be playing this one over and over again. The films soundtrack is worth purchasing alone. Get this one. Have fun and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent (to my surprise).","review":"The only reason I saw this film was because someone else was paying for my ticket.Now, let me get something straight here.. I hate most action films, I've never seen an episode of Charlie's Angels and I had no idea what the plot of this film was. So basically, I walked into the cinema with low hopes for this film. But to my surprise, this was no boring James Bond type action movie. This was a hilarious comedy film. The movie was hardly ever serious, and when it was (serious), they'd throw in a joke or two.Go see this film! It Rules!By the way.. I saw the movie on it's second day of release in Australia, and the cinema was full.. which made the jokes more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Script was Written by 13-year old girls","review":"Look I don't understand what it is about charlies angels. I've seen the original episodes and it's just as cheesy as anything else in that era. I can accept strong women beating up bad guys, that's fine. In fact one of my favorite actresses is Michelle Yeoh. What I can't accept is how a woman who has no Skill,muscle, or physical strength can fly around kicking, and punch guys in a way I've only seen in the Matrix! Without wires there wouldn't be any fighting....The Plot and acting were awful....BR> So bottom line, Guys will like the movie because of Cameron Diaz(She's not that hot, but that's another article), And Women will like it if they need some Female action stars and don't care about Plot.

The Matrix wasn't that good to start out with and they keep using it (too much in this waste of time). I personally could never recommend this movie.

This movie sets a precedence for all bad movies to live up to. Not only was it plotless, I was unable to find any character developement. The fighting scenes would have been better choreographed by a muppetier. At least Miss Piggy has studied some martial arts. In it's defense the ladies were very sexy but Drew looked like she wolfed down a couple of cheese burgers before each take. I was happy to see George Mcfly still working and I did enjoy Cameron in her underroos. If you have no class or taste in movies you probably own this piece of art and the cheesy sound track.

Let's make a movie.\\"(Gee, I wonder if that accounts for an apparance by Tom Greene?).

I'm not even getting into the plot that much...it's what you'd expect...the Angels are hired to save the day. There's an unexpected plot twist.

The film contains about as much humanity as a video game, and is derivative from almost the entire gamut of recent blockbusters, such as \\"The Matrix\\", in terms of both visuals as well as theme.

Without it, a film fails, at least in terms of quality. Charlie's Angels is one of those films, that has everything imaginable, but a story.Charlie's Angels features three beautiful, intelligent, and charismatic women. Respectively, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, and Lucy Liu fail at these qualities. While half of what fills the screen is interesting in a music-video kind-of way, the other half made me scream, \\"What is this?!\\"I also had some other questions. Why does Sam Rockwell sing and dance? What's the deal with the impromptu race car chase? Why is Tom Green in this movie? And, if this is a comedy, why isn't it funny?Overall, Charlie's Angels is a mess and a bad movie, and not even bad in a good way.

At times, it is positively hilarious. Cameron Diaz showcases her comedic talents and is a standout. With that luminescent smile and perfect comedic timing, she is reminiscent of a young Goldie Hawn. The ever lovely and voluptuous bad girl, Drew Barrymore, is also very funny, as is the petite Lucy Liu. The droll Bill Murray is likewise perfect, and with the addition of John Forsythe, who played the original Charlie in the series, reprising his original role, the casting is flawless.While the plot is, as it is with all spoofs, silly, it is, nonetheless, action packed and highly entertaining. Its tongue in cheek action scenes, as well as the sheer campiness of the movie, keep the viewer engaged. For sheer enjoyment, watch this film. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRRREAT! 15th april 2004.","review":"I love this movie toooo bits, i have never stopped watching it since iv'e had it. The film is all mission and martial arts, so this film is great for anyone who likes that sort. It as improved alot to the older version, i watched half an hour of one once on the tele and it is boring. Comparing this to it is much better, it is a different scenery and it is great for anyone who likes lucy liu cameron diaz, and drew barrymore. I like drew barrymore, she is the best angel out of the three. Not because she is my favorite actress cos shes greatttt! the film itself subscribes how it sees on the box. A FAMILY MISSION MARTIAL ARTS FILM THAT IS GREAT FOR MOST PEOPLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great Movie! HOOOOOOOT!","review":"This is a great movie! The action is plentiful and visually effective. Speaking of visually great, check out Drew Barrymore! Ow Ow! A lot of critics said this movie was just babes with no plot. But realistically, the plot is simple, yet interesting. The angels have to find electronic equipment that is \\"Stolen\\": big twist at the end. I really recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and fun! Great gift or stocking stuffer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hot babes but not a hot movie","review":"it sparks only of teh sexual tension you get to see between the 3 leads and their prancing and their grinding of their bodys when they kick ass. but the story is way to slow and long, it seemed.

Sam Rockewell as the badguy is fun also. basically its worth while to see Diaz shaking her ass in those undies"},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many!","review":"Talk about a bad movie! Not only was the dialog terrible, not only was the acting terrible, but they stole the FX from The Matrix! Special visual effects like that work on a film like the Matrix but not on every action film. These girls are supposed to be in \\"the real world\\" and yet they are doing unbelievable stunts and fight scenes, rivaling MI1 & MI2 (another couple of bad ones). I can't blame only them alone though, it seems that all of the action films nowadays are trying to see how far they can out do Bond. Now I hear that Angels 2 is going 1 further by changing the ethnic background of Bosley. I guess the films of today don't have to follow continuity, just whatever works at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!!","review":"Horrible!

You end up not caring if any of the \\"angels\\" live or die. \\"Charlie's Angels\\" is yet another in a long list of action films where the viewer actually ends up rooting for the bad guys. With as much empahsis as they put on style in this film, it may as well been a music video. On a superficial level, this film works great, but the cutesey girls kick butt stuff was overempasisized and was not enough to carry the weight of this horrible film."},{"rating":"1","title":"UH NO","review":"Unrealistic, lack of realism, do not rent or buy, waste of money, worst movie I have seen in a long time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comedy, action and hot women","review":"It should be noted that Drew Barrymore predicted the problems with the 2000 Presidential election when she announces near the start of the movie, \\"It might be the CHAD!\\"It's hard to believe the little girl who screamed when she saw E.T. produced this, but she has assembled a cast and director who stayed true to the TV series' combination of humor, action and good-looking women. Cameron Diaz' performance as a sexy nerd is her best yet.

Just be prepared not to take it too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labeled a Comedy!?","review":"I was greatly dissapointed in this movie. It identifies itself early on of being a parody of sorts and the self-realization of the Charlie's Angels TV camp....but then doesnt execute it enough as other movies such as \\"The Brady Bunch\\" have done beautifully. The script is pretty bad, but does follow the same pattern of a typical Angels TV episode. There are a few chuckles, but overall the dialogue \\"jokes\\" are tired and predictable. The Cameron Soul Train scene is overated and lame. I was suprised how well Lucy Lui is in this film and it was nice seeing Crispin \\"George McFly\\" Glover. However, everytime I wanted to just turn the movie off, I couldnt frankly because of the pure eye candy sex appeal that is the only thing carrying this film. Overall, its a fun stupid watch, but there's nothing rewarding or memorable"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my type of coffee","review":"Unless you are teenager (13-17), you will likely be disappointed, especially, if you like movies of the James Bond type.

(Except the rare case of a Spike Jonze or David Fincher) Jokes in this \\"movie\\" fall flat, as does the wanna be \\"Matrix\\" style of fighting. I can understand the exaggerated style of fighting in a film like \\"The Matrix\\" or \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" where the film itself is pure fantasy. This movie is supposed to be set in real life. How come only the girls can do the wire flying kicks?

The acting is terrible, Drew Barrymore is a hideous pig, the Asian woman is short and odd looking next to the other actors, Diaz is borderline brain dead, the stunts could be stock footage from \\"The Dukes of Hazard\\" or \\"The Fall Guys,\\" etc. And that's what the director wants you to think. The director intentionally made a bad movie, believing that it would entertain with its rancidness. But it doesn't.

This sense of dread came about because I was actually confused by a movie based on Charlie's Angels. Characters were in places with no explanation, the bad guys suddenly had computer access and I had no clue when that happened. The friends I had seen it with also had this disoriented experience, so we chalked it up to poor editing, saving my ego. Sure enough, we were right. The DVD includes about 15 straight minutes that were edited out of the movie. These scenes are all good and really explained stuff that had happened, no idea why they were left on the cutting room floor. Anyway, the DVD version is far better than theatrical release."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP!!!!!!!!!","review":"Holy s***! How could so many people like this movie.

This is a poignant, personal account of a story that needed to be told. The reader will have feelings of rage at the way the Japanese treated the Americans and the way the American Government did NOT treat those Japanese responsible for war crimes. Very few Japanese were held accountable for their actions in the rebuilding climate of postwar Japan. I'm glad this story was told and I hope it is read by many.

Powers delivers with this collection of essays, using bone-dry wit and--well, if not an appreciation, at least attention--to how television functions in our society. Powers served as GQ's TV critic, and frequently invokes the Terkel/Hecht/Royko \\"Chicago School\\" of writing, contrasting the vivid prose against the banalities of contemporary television. Sadly, it's rare to find a well-written critical examination of our culture's dominant force. But I really can't do this book justice. Pick up a copy and see what the man has to say.

This was also Eddie Kendricks last album with the band as well. This is definitely an \\"Eddie\\" album. He sings 95% of the tracks on it.It includes a great version of \\"Smiling Faces Sometimes\\" which was a hit by another Motown group The Undisputed Truth. Their songs were getting longer and funkier at this time. They were heading into the 70's full force now. The hits kept on coming for another four years.

Some of the most timeless and definitely the most romantic music the Temps did is here. This album seems like it came from two totally different sessions. If \\"Throw a Farewell Kiss\\" does not grab you try \\"I'm The Exception To The Rule\\" And then there is \\" Gonna Keep On Tryin' Til I Win Your Love\\" The big hit \\"Just My Imagination\\" is not much better than the previous three mentioned.

I can only hear Paul's voice on \\"Just My Imagination\\" (which is BY FAR the best song on here), and that's it! Eddie Kendricks' rendition of \\"Gonna Keep On Trying...\\" is excellent, but other than that, this CD is played out. The psychedelic sound was never meant for a group of this caliber, and it really shows here. I can now see why Eddie wanted out of the group after this album. I mean, a 12 minute song, come on!

As each plan to escape meets with failure, hopes begin to sag. But when they learn that the farmer's wife wants to turn them all into pies, desperation takes hold. Then hope springs again as a flying rooster crashes into the camp. Just what happens after that will have to be discovered by viewing this gem.Once again Nick Park shows that he has an encyclopedic knowledge of films and just what really made them tick.

In the end they end up not flying out of the coop, but they build a what-looks-like an airplane, to escape the barn.My favourite part is when Rocky teaches the flock how to fly. It was so funny!

Perhaps if my expectations were lower I might have been pleasently surprised, but as it was it was actually rather tedious.

Yes, I'm aware of the big numbers the movie drew on opening weekend at the movie theaters, and I'm aware of its overwhelming popularity, but the movie didn't do a whole lot for me.I think the main problem is that the chickens have an English accent, making it hard to understand them.

Oh wait, my beloved host won't publish this unless I actually discuss the film. Ok, well, Chicken Run lacked all of the sociological depth found in Wallace and Gromit.

So, Gibson comes to the rescue as a wannabe flying rooster, ready to show his feathered friends how to hop the fence to a world where they won't get their throats cut if egg production slows down. Of course, he's a bit of a ... con artist himself with designs on a comely hen.

So the plot has multiple viewpoints and its interpretations can compare this to some situations in concentration camps, but for the most part this movie is lackluster. Yes, this animation style is creative and funny, but the story is entirely predictable and the characters aren\`t really that memmorable or engaging.There are some interesting and innovative scenes and a couple of hilarious lines enjoyable to both kids and adults, yet this picture could have been more ambitious and surprising.

I suppose in a day where computer-generated movies such as Toy Story steal the limelight, a plastecine-modeled movie seems somewhat out of place. But let me assure you, the attention to detail and wonderful animation in this movie is equal to that of Toy Story, with the added advantage of dry British humour. The British cast while unknown to the Americans, are superb, with Julia Sawalha playing the lead female role brilliantly. This is not just a British film. Mel Gibson, suspiciously included probably to appeal to a wider US audience (despite the fact he is Australian) does not ruin the film too much. The brilliantly evil, Yorkshire Pie manufacturer Mrs Tweedy, is the best bad guy in a film for years, and with humour in the film aimed at both adults (not in a bad way) and children, this film can be enjoyed by the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late Django at his finest","review":"A valuable corrective to the conventional wisdom about Reinhardt's post-war playing, which, so far from deteriorating, actually achieved deeper levels of communicative insight.

I found the story predictable and nothing but an excuse for its smutty content. It was an effort to read the entire book, and I often skipped pages. If I had not paid $15 for the book, I would have thrown it away a lot sooner.There was a day when writers possessed and applied proper grammar skills to their work; and whatever got by them was picked up by proofreaders. Did the author not hire one? Or do grammar rules not apply to smut?Among others, \\"Det. Brown... wandered if it was an on-going fee...\\" (If he were using common English, would he not have \\"wondered\\"?)

It is truly a work of art from every perspective. The influence of Bergman on these actors in the muchmore recent mystery series is quite evident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most people won't make tthrough the first twenty minutes but for those who do...................","review":"If you are not a film buff who is familiar with Bergman, you will probably not make it through the first twenty minutes of this film. However, for those who are so inclined, it is an engrossing character study that grows steadily more engaging as it goes on. I give this film five stars. For me it is one of the great ones that I will always remember and continue to ponder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Pretentious, Self-Indulgent","review":"The single virtue of this film is the physical beauty of the Swedish actors. They are obviously skilled performers and deserve a more gripping script. Otherwise, the script -which at the very best might have been a moderately successful stage play - is boring, pretentious, and self-indulgent."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even saved by a good actress","review":"While the female lead was strong, credible, and appealing, this contrived and forced movie left much to be desired. The angle of the little girl - Marianne's daughter - had undeveloped possibilities; and Marianne's retrospective suspended the pace and emotion of the movie. The actors were clearly capable and professional, but the whole effect was strained, annoying, and pretensious without any substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable.","review":"I knew people would give this five stars simply because it's Bergman and Bergman can do no wrong. I too love Bergman but this one goes beyond the pale and is sick, not to mention boring. There are no redeeming qualities about this film and the characters are simply the most unappetizing characters I can remember seeing on film. The only \\"good\\" person in the film was the poor child, Isabelle. The acting was great; that's about it.It's a case of where the emperor has no clothes. Bergman lovers refuse to recognize this where Bergman is concerned. If this were his first film, I would never have seen another Bergman film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep Pill, different name","review":"The movie is well produced (Despite most of the movie takes place in one location). I loved Lena Endre (Marianne) acting. But this is the most boring movie I have ever seen. There is not a strong infidelity issue, it is taken as a game. The husband kills himself but he also had a lover for years, and I don't see why could he do that, if it was clear he was not happy with his wife, all was a masquerade.I love foreign movies, but even though this was written by Bergman and directed by his ex-wife, Liv Ullman, it is not what I expected. I could see it again just to see Lena Endre acting, but still I would need a jar of coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic film, but DVD chapter titling a problem","review":"This film is moving and gripped me from beginning to end. I have one major gripe however about the DVD. The chapter title of the last segment, which you can read on the DVD case and when you go to \\"menu\\" and \\"chapters\\" while watching, gives away a crucial plot point. It would be much better for this to remain a surprise.If you watch this film, keep your eyes averted from the case and the chapter titles until you've finished!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful butterflies","review":"This is a beautiful!

(The stew is slightly creamy with tomatoes and savory spices. Delicious.) The best thing about them: they are soak-free!!!

I have never had experience canning with the single pc lid like these pretty jars had but I'm well versed with the english language & can read instructions pretty well. Anywho....over 50% of the lids didn't seal properly. The ones that did, only stayed sealed for a few days, and then popped. Too dang bad...these jars are meant to \\"sit there & look pretty\\", but don't expect much functional use from them. Will not buy again.

Love that the lid is ONE PIECE, and not the typical two piece, like Mason/Ball jars. Although, if you're looking to use the for canning, they DO have the 'pop-up' button on the lid, which indicates if the jar has sealed. I imagine jams/jellies would be very cute in these, too.

My only warning is that you could find it a bit heavy going, but only because it is fantastically comprehensive. This is not just a book about communication issues in Autism... it is a book about language, learning, intelligence, and culture. It is open minded and thoughtful throughout, repeatedly emphasising the two way nature of communication and not just focusing on how to make autistic people do all the work like so many books do. The book is in three parts, the first looking mainly at theories of language and intelligence, the second at language characteristics, learning styles and development in autism, and the third and final part examines strategies to enhance communication. This is not a handbook that can teach someone how to communicate better, but what it is is a thorough guide to understanding what the communication issues of autistic people are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing, familiar sounds","review":"On a visit to Portland ME, I bought Angry Salad on a suggestion from a relative.The CD is a good one.

Being a fan of the movies I instantly put it on.After listening through the album I was appaled at what Montengro had done to Morricone's classic spagetti western scores. They seem poor copies in comparison.The only reason I gave it two stars is that the main themes, for example \\"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\\", aren't as bad as the rest of the collection. The track \\"The Ecstasy of Gold\\" is appallingly bad in comparison with the original.In conclusion if you want the spagetti western themes of these three great films your better off getting the originals.

He acknowledges the terrible conditions in the coal mining industry and the misery of the miners, yet refuses to accept that these hardships justified murder, beatings and arson -- which drives the descendants of the Molly Maguires and the left-wing union extremists crazy.

I don't think I could live without one, although I have endured such a company loss for some time now. The idea that the ancient Egyptians cats are still here, secluded in an island, sounds good for a Hollywood story or a romantic novel. However, Jack Couffer documents it as a possibility in our real world. His images are very good, some of them shot like for a newspaper, others with a deep human touch. Moreover, his account comes from a man who witnessed how feral cats and humans interact like in no other place on Earth in the Lamu Archipelago, off the coasts of Africa. Perfect for cat's and animal lovers, and for anyone who likes nature photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on the Alaskan Bush","review":"Having been a pilot in Alaska for 25 years and having been lucky enough to be taught to fly by James \\"Andy\\" Anderson it was hard for me to put this book down until I was through. Once you realize how unassuming Andy is you really appreciate the experiences he has been fortunate enough to have had in a very unique place and time. His unbelievable skill has been finely tuned by many years of daily flying only a few can appreciate. I highly reccommend it to pilots and non-pilots alike. He is truly a ledgend on the Koyukuk River and Brooks Range area of Alaska."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This book is only useful if you want pretty pictures and some prose on a tiny fraction of what other books cover. I was not at all impressed. I think I'm going to sell it on eBay. We read 6 books on the Big Island before going there (I know, a little compulsive). The only two books you need are: Hawaii The Big Island Revealed by Andrew Doughty and Adventure Guide Hawaii The Big Island (Hunter Travel Guides) by Bryan Fryklund & Jen Reeder. The Fryklund/Reeder book is absolutely jam-packed with information. The Doughty is also packed with info and will have a few things the Fryklund book doesn't have, but it's main attribute is that it is an absolute joy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"I have watched the film in the spanish translation, as doubling films and musicals is the usual in Spain. The Spanish doubling has been done by the actors who have played it on stage here. If anyone has the opportunity to acquire it in Spanish I strongly recomend it. I decided to buy the English score too and it was a big surprise to me to know that the actors on the film weren't doubled but were actually singing with their own voices. I was surprised and pleased, because I feel that their performance is quite good. I agree that Ms Rossum has not the force of previous performers (the spanish singer even ameliorates it) but has a beautiful sweetness. And Butler lacks training and even a spanish girl like me identifies his accent (scottish, by the way)but nonetheless he conveys desperation, rage and tragedy to his voice in a way I would not have expected. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I have fallen in love with the entire \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" story, mainly because of the music. It is in a word, utterly amazing. I have heard both the original cast recording as well as the movie soundtrack version of \\"Phantom\\" and both are marvelous. I must say however, I find myself favoring the movie soundtrack to the original recording. This is mainly because of Butler's voice. Now don't get me wrong, Michael Crawford does an astouding job, but I love the low, rich fullness of Gerard's voice. That's what makes it for me. Emmy Rossum, and Patrick Wilson do an awsome job as well, and I love how Emmy's voice is so pure, elegant, and clear. Both are fantastic and I would reccomend either of them to anyone who enjoyed the Opera performance or the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this soundtrack kicks ass","review":"Yeah, I don't give a damn about all the Phantom die hards who think that no on else but Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman can do justice to Webber's material. You want to know something? I think Emmy Rossum breathes life into every song, and I'm glad someone else besides Warbly Brightman is singing. Rossum is terrific and not as operaish as Brightman. Also, there's no other way to look at it...Gerard Butler is hot. So's his voice. He's not Crawford, but he's young, sexy, has a good voice that works well with the material, and he's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!!!!","review":"Unlike most, I saw this movie with an open mind. From the opening, I was hooked! The music, the tempo, the actors! I was very impressed by Gerard Butler as Phantom and he does not need (nor deserve) to be compared to Michael Crawford. That is the essence of acting...each person brings something different to a character. Deal with it!Emmy was INCREDIBLE as Christine! She has such a beauty and innocence on screen that captured your heart from the moment you saw her.Patrick Wilson is FABULOUS as Raoul! He is the main reason I saw this film. Being that he was raised in and his family still lives, in the Tampa Bay area. To be completely honest, Patrick's talent stole the film (for me anyway). I beleive his voice is much stronger than Gerard Butler in some aspects and you really felt his love for Christine. Not only through his voice, but in his eyes as well.This movie and soundtrack is very well done! I'm looking forward to making this MY \\"Music of the Night\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"not fair to compare the 2004 to the broadway edition","review":"forget about comparing. just ENJOY. the 2004 soundtrack sweepsme away. sarah brightman and michael crawford WERE remarkable.so IS emmy rossum and so IS gerard butler. i must admit i prefer gerard butler. his singing and looks rate in the A-plus categories. i would have chosen the Phantom over Raoul becausethe phantom sweeps me away. and of course, emmy rossum is quitetalented. raoul is talented, too. gerard butler is superb. THE FIRST IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST!!!!what a beautiful movie and what a greatsoundtrack. i am impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music","review":"OK I understand everyone's point of view in thier comparisons between the stage production and the movie. I've heard both soundtracks. Personally I prefer the newer one because I can relate to it. Music was never about what notes a person can hit or how well trained they are. It is about the emotion it inspires. I don't feel as much in the original cast production. It just seems more realistic that the Phantom should sound more seductive to express why Christine would be torn between him and pretty boy. I really enjoyed Gerry's singng because when he sang I knew how he felt. That's the point isn't it?I prefered Emmy as well. Sarah had a tendency to make the words less understandable in order to make her training more evident.I went and saw the movie almost a week ago and still have the music there, inside my mind.I definitly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the story and thinks the Phantom should be dark and more mysterious than he was portrayed prevoiusly."},{"rating":"1","title":"An anticlimax to the \\"Phantom\\" Phenomenon","review":"The phantom was good, orchestra very interesting, Emmy Rossum - awful! Her thin, bland and breathy voice was completely incapable of doing justice to the beautiful songs she had the priviledge to sing. It isn't fair to compare her to Sarah Brightman, because, unfortunately she is not in the same league as Sarah Brightman. Her vocals are insufficent to sing the songs, and her range is not good enough to tackle the demand of the pieces. She is extremely beautiful, and sweet to watch.This soundtrack is not a good stand alone cd to listen to. The music without the movie is completely bland and mediocre. As the title states, I believe this movie and the soundtrack were a total anticlimax to entire Phantom Phenomenon. Webber should have taken the opportunity to make the film with Brightman and Crawform, who can do the beautiful music justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open hearts over closed minds","review":"So many opinions... and yet none of them wrong. For we are all entitled to our own opinions. Having the background of a first introduction to Phantom of the Opera by reading the novel by Gaston Leroux helped build the foundation I needed to enjoy the 1986 cast recording. Then after seeing the Broadway production I thought I had a pretty sound foundation of the essence of the Phantom of the Opera. Next came the movie. Up close and personal so to speak on exacting the details one could not see on a stage performance. All of these areas combined flood my mind when listening to the 2004 cast recording. Some will say one is better than the other, and that's totally acceptable; but to fully enjoy everything there is to the Phantom of the Opera. One must believe in the account. Both versions portray the story, its simply up to you to make it personal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice CD, waited longer than expected for it.....","review":"Very nice CD, but was starting to wonder how soon it would come to me.

The sets were beautiful but the lyrics nearly indecipherable and the music laughable. If you listen to this thing for 5 minutes you've heard it all.

I swear to God, about 45 minutes into the film ALW does about 8 bars of a song some of you may remember from the old Doctor Demento show called \\"Fishheads.\\" It went \\"Fishheads, fishheads, rolly polly fishheads, fishheads, fishheads, eat them up yum!\\" What ever happened to musicals like Jesus Christ Superstar, Oliver, or Fiddler On The Roof?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I am very excited for this film. I hope that it is very good. The CD on the other was not what I was expecting, but I still like it. I don't understand how all of the songs are going to play out in the film, but they are all sang well. I was very suprised that Emmy could sing. I have seen her in films before and thought she was terrible, but on this CD she can sing, the way the character is meant to sing. I thought the CD was good, but some of the vocals for certain people could have been stronger, maybe it will come across different in the film. See what you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Gerard Butler, But not this time.","review":"Let me say first that of course I love the original cast album as anyone would a classic. I also adore Gerard Butler but his voice is not clear enough for this role. Often he sounds as if his voice is about to break and that he is spitting while singing into the microphone. Broadways Sam Harris might have been a better choice or even \\"Rents\\" Christain Mena.Emily is fine in her role and her voice grows on my everyday. I also keep hearing people talk about Minnie Drivers \\"Voice\\", Its not her people-Read the label.Learn to be lonely is the worst attempt at \\"Oscar\\" I have ever heard. After 20 years could someone not come up with a better song?It's not all bad but I often find myself turning up the volume to hear the words, Vocals weak in balance with the orchestration."},{"rating":"1","title":"AIIIIEEEEEE!!

I'm just a multimedia store employee that was excited to see a promotional copy of the new Phantom soundtrack. Well...I have to say Sir Webber and others took what is considered the most famous musical and butchered it. The female voices in the movie are great. However the male voices leave more than a little to be desired.If you listen to the soundtrack you can't help but feel that the man playing the Phantom is none other than someone who smokes WAY too much. His voice is gruff and unfeeling throughout the disk. Raoul's voice however reminds one of an 80's metal band rock-ballad in his cheesy way of singing.And of course who could miss the electric waa-waa guitar during \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\"I don't think I can forgive Sir Webber for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Phantom was weak","review":"I'm really amazed at the selection Gerard Butler for the part of the Phantom. This had to be the biggest blunder in movie history. His voice is weak and limp. It has the power of a broken down Model T Ford. The rest of the cast provided a respectable performance, but if you want the true feeling and effect, buy the Soundtrack with the Original London cast. As far as the movie, do yourself a favor and go to the theater and see it live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Vs. Musical","review":"Emmy Rossum does a fabulous job for the challenging vocals in the music; however other cast members are not quite up to par. Gerald Butler pulls off the extreme acting of the Phantom, but his singing doesn't compare at all to the various actors who have played the Phantom onstage. Being from Broadway, Patrick Wilson is a sufficient Raoul. Minnie Driver is a sensational Carlotta, but I am put off by the fact that she didn't sing the part herself. The producers wanted a name, not a voice. Of course, who can compare to the early Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman, Steve Barton, and Rosemary Ashe? The answer is no one. After listening to the original cast recording all of my life, I have to be knit-picky, so I give a four out of five stars. The only real setback FOR ME was Gerald Butler's vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"This music from the new movie is soooooo good. Gerard Butler did such a good job in every song he sung. Emmy did a great job too.Also, I think a younger role for Christine was great, and a good looking phantom made it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie and soundtrack of the year","review":"I expected to enjoy the movie, despite the critics reservations, but I did not expect to be so absolutely BLOWN AWAY. Unbelievable movie-making, which resulted in an equally amazing soundtrack. Emmy Rossum is ideal as Christine, Patrick Wilson is probably the first truly enjoyable Raoul in a long time, and Gerard Butler's untrained but incredibly passionate and gorgeous voice makes this one of my new favourites.Please do yourself a favour and see this movie, and pick up the soundtrack to relive it all day long. I can only hope word of mouth places this musical into the \\"classic\\" status that it so richly deserves. Are you listening to me Academy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Italian Version AGAIN!

The music itself proves that poor judgement wrong. Even in the music, you are able to tell that the Phantom of the Opera is a dramatic love story between Christine, the Phantom, and Ralph. When I saw the movie, I bought this soundtrack as soon as possible. I love this soundtrack, and will hold it dear for as long as I have it. I would say to anyone that asks about this soundtrack, that they should get it if they liked the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom of the Opera (Original Motion Picture soundtrack)","review":"I just love the music. It has part of the story in words not sung as well so that's cool. The one thing that has nothing to do with the product is that some of the songs are sung very softly and others are really loud so have to adjust the volume continually but that's okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new sound for the Phantom","review":"What I have to say about this soundtrack will likely echo what many other have been saying: get over it Crawford and Brightman fans!!!!!!!!!!! While a HUGE fan of the original soundtrack, I have ALWAYS preferred Colm Wilkinson and Rebecca Caine (Canadian cast) in the roles of Phantom and Christine. Their voices were stronger and their performances superior.Different does not necessarily translate into 'better' or 'worse'. I am immensely impressed with the movie cast. The only complaints I have with this soundtrack have to do with editing and rewrites. Hacking up 'The Phantom of the Opera' was NOT a good way to go IMHO. And changing the lyrics in other songs...well, I just won't go there.But as far as the vocal talent goes, BEAUTIFUL! Everyone did a splendid job, and I am proud to say I am not only a fan of the original Broadway and Canadian casts, but a fan of the movie cast as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the original....Thank God","review":"I think that everyone who keeps saying crap about Emmy Rossum needs to get there facts straight about Sarah Brightman, who I am not a fan of. Andrew Lloyd Webber discovered Sarah while she was singing in a bar, not an opera house. Emmy has had so much more opera training than Sarah ever had and she doesn't sound like she has a stick up her butt. Also, Gerard Butler does a wonderful job of playing the phantom. When you hear the songs in the context of the film, the emotion is really captured in the words and the way he is singing them, unlike Michael Crawford, who just gives a flat performance.All in all, I loved the movie and the music"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Singers","review":"Overall, this soundtrack, and the movie, are a pale imitation of one of the best musicals ever. First, most of the people singing in the movie and on this soundtrack are TERRIBLE! Gerard Butler doesn't come close to having the epic range of Michael Crawford, and the supporting singers are no better. The only bright spots on this CD are Emmy Rossum, Patrick Wilson, and (of all people) Minnie Driver. Unfortunately, they are drowned out by the bad singers around them. The worst song of the lot is the title song. Butler is just horrible. Don't waste your time on this CD, buy the original cast recording instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, disgusting adaptation of Webber's Masterpiece","review":"After seeing the show eight times, from the Broadway, London, and touring productons, take it from me that the lack of musical talent in this soundtrack is an abomination. It is completely evident from the first note that this \\"phantom\\" has never taken a musical lesson in his life and his voice is straining from the part. Andrew Lloyd Webber must be deaf to clear these no-talent wannabes. Anyone who enjoyed this production needs to purchase the London cast (along with a set of hearing aids). Michael Crawford is a gift from heaven, especially compared to the movie production.Shame on the prducers for giving the green light to such a lousy portrayal of a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phantom 2004 vs Crawford and Brightman Original","review":"The artists vocals in the movie version sound weak, horrific and scratchy compared to the Original London Cast Recording. It's a shame that the talent in the new movie version just can't sing. I'm a fan of this show and purchased the 2004 CD. Side by side with the London version, if I could return the 2004 version, I would. It's a travesty that the vocals are so poor on the movie version. If you want a CD to treasure, buy one of the original London Cast Recordings and avoid the movie soundtrack completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for your Soul","review":"I found the music to be very powerful with emotion. I enjoyed watching the movie several time as did my 12 year old son. The music, although at times expressed sadness, also expressed love and passion. Great Soundtrack, Great Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recording...","review":"I have listened to the original cast recording for years and now that I've heard the motion picture version, I'll say that I like the movie version a better. Sarah and Michael are great in the 1986 original cast recording but I felt more warmth from Emma's vocals and more darkness in Gerard Butler's phantom. Emma may be softer in her performance but to me, she makes it believable as a girl who has suddenly taken center stage in the Opera. Purists will knock this movie rendition of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical in the attempt to keep the 1986 version as focus of the musical's sucess. However, some things only get better in time and for different reasons and this is one example. I highly recommend purchasing the movie version, especially the extended version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I don't like how critics grumble about this movie. It's a musical, so you kind of go see it for the music mostly. The movie is beautiful, a good adaptation of the play. Rossum has a great voice, I like her (dare I say it) more than Brightman. Butler's singing disappointed me at first, but I can see that he focuses more on the acting, the emotion, than the sound. He is also a little too good-looking to be the Phantom, but I can get over that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom of the Opera (Soundtrack and DVD) 2004","review":"I'm not a professional at the teamwork that is required to make a movie, nor what is required.

This Soundtrack, as well as the movie (DVD) were two things that I had to suffer far too much patience to be able to buy so I could listen to and watch anytime and as many times as I wanted to. It became an obsession; I wanted to find everything I could read about this movie and the actors, writers, composers, lyricists... I loved the acting, the music, the story... oh, and the choreography, the costumes. I copied the soundtrack on my work computer so I could listen to it while working. I could go on and on, but... don't take my word for it; it's only my opinion. See it for yourself. Enjoy!!

I love Michael Crawford (he is my favorite singer of all time), but Butler breathes new life into the Phantom. New, young, sexy life. Amazing! The orchestrations are great, the soundtrack is great.

For a few more dollars, you get this extened version which offers over an hour more music than the single disc. This extended version is a much better buy. Now that I got that out, let me talk about the music. The first time I heard it, I wasn't sure that it was as good as the original London cast soundtrack. However, after listening to it many times over and over, I'm now addicted to it and convinced it's better! It grew on me, and I fell in love with the new generation of the Phantom. The film was a worthy effort and did not decrease the value of Phantom at all...in fact, it increased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!!!!","review":"I love this music!!!! It's awesome. I love Emmy Rossum's voice. It's so smooth ,and her high notes go out so easly and smothly. I always wonder how she dose it . In the music you can feel their emotions and feelings.Gerald Butlers vioce is perfect as a phantom it's pretty deep and a little ferce ,but not too much, just right .I've heard other phantom of the operas' but for some reason Christine's voice is good but choppy not smooth like Emmy Rossum's. When she sings Wishing you were somehow here agian you can really feel the emoitions. Especially when she says \\" Why can't the past just DIE\\" Then when she says \\"teach me to say good bye \\" the goodbye part was so smooth and high and it was beautiful .I really like this CD. It's really awesome !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"I have seen the Play on Broadway but have come to love the 2004 movie and am alsolutely mesmerized by the CD. I found watching the movie's unfolding scenes as the Phantom's infatuation becomes an obsession to own and possess his protege and fluctuates between erotic and sensual, especially the Point of No Return song/scene where you feel the excitement and then the crashing sadness of what transpires, a haunting journey which has locked me into the music. I love listening to Butler's rendition with his \\"not so perfect\\" singing which adds to his masculinity and aloofness. His strong good looks with his mask on and his physical alure make you forget about what is behind the mask. The music lets my mind envision the scenes as it goes from song to song. You cannot try and compare this to another version--that would be unfair. You must take this one for what it is, savor it and enjoy what each artist has brought to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, YOU MUST BUT IT","review":"The movie is so good, that I wanted to just stay in the theatre and watch it over and over again. Every actor was cast well and they all sang beautifully. This extended CD is phenominal because you get to listen to all the songs and not just the selected ones. Also, there is some dialogue so you can figure out where you are in the movie. I made the mistake of listening to the soundtrack before I watched the movie, so I thought that I would not like the movie, but then I saw the movie and it all came together. The effect of the organ music in the movie gives you chills and the vocals combined with the acting leaves you in tears. This CD is an awesome accompaniment to the movie and I recommmed you see the movie and buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I actually went to see this movie in the theater.

We read the book in French and then watched some of the older film versions, and listened to the soundtrack of the original London cast. While the movie is excellent, and the music that goes along with it, I take one star off because I did not enjoy the way the music was done in the movie quite as much as I enjoyed the original way it was done in the London version when it was first on stage. The effect of the music was even more enthralling then (mind you, I never saw it performed because I was merely a child when it first came out on stage). The music from that soundtrack is more moving. But I really did enjoy the music from the movie, and I love to listen to it whenever I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would reccomend the Original Broadway Cast instead","review":"The Phantom Of the Opera can NEVER be considered bad, but the original broadway cast is significantly better. Most people say this is because of the voices, and I do agree that Michael Crawford(the original broadway cast Phantom) beats Gerard Butler by a mile, but in my opinion thats not why the OBC(original broadway cast) is so much better. In this, many of the lyrics song in the OBC are spoken on this CD, therefore sounding like a poem. Also, in this one you are un-able to hear the \\"excitment\\". Like on the OBC, you can actual hear the chandelier falling and its quite exciting.To conclude, I would definitly purchase the OBC atleast before purchasing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!!","review":"Thankfully the orchestration is absolutely beautiful. That is the only reason this review got 1 star. Other than that, the singing is, in a word, sad. All this version does is make me want to listen to the original cast recording more and more. Save your money and get the original London cast recording and hear what this music was supposed to sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shameful way to treat Lloyd Webber's masterpiece","review":"As a great phan of the stage production, I was excited about the movie adaptation - until I heard about the casting. Despite my deep reservations, I was intrigued about the quality of the movie cast - until I actually listened to the soundtrack.Admittedly Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson (as the Phantom, Christine and Raoul respectively) are not as bad as I thought they would be, but they are NOWHERE in the same league as the original stars, Michael Crawford, Sarah Brightman and Steve Barton (or for that matter any successive stage actor in any of the various productions around the world). The orchestrations are sweeping and grand, but I can't help but think what could have been if trained singers were cast in the main roles (at least the main two roles - Patrick Wilson is the only trained singer in the bunch)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite mvie/mucical","review":"The phantom of the opera is practicaly my life. My friend and I are the #1 fans of it. I think so because we do plays with it in the living room, sing to it, dance to it, buy costumes for it, and just totaly 100% fell in love with it. Also, when I found out Andrew Lloyd Webber made Cats, I had to see it. Cats became my second favorite. Phantom of the Opera has action, romance, joy, dancing, fighting, sadness, and all of the emotions packed togather in the best movie ever to be made in the universe. My friend and I know we are the #1 fans of phantom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing\`","review":"After having the soundtrack from the original cast, I really enjoyed the movie, which for me tied the music together for the first time. Unfortunately, the action of the movie evidently blunted my senses to the music. I ordered this disc with high expectations. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when I listened to the album. Realizing the intensity of feelings being protrayed in music, to me it was grating and over the top for several of the male leads. I enjoyed some of the female voices, although the sound level was a bit to low in volume for my liking. I suppose I'll have a once used copy up for sale. I'll go back to the original Broadway cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"New vs. Old, Movie vs. Play","review":"I totally agree with M. Menzer, you are right on. I've seen the movie twice and the play twice. I came into the movie very aprehensive. Yes Gerard Butler is not Michael Crawford and yes their were some parts were you were like that doesn't sound like it should. But I don't feel in this day and age Crawford could have pulled it off on screen, he's to old. Butler was amazing, his acting tremendous. Sarah Brightman amazing as she is also could not have pulled it off, she's also to old. Emma Rossum though looked the part and did a beautiful job given her age. And the orchestra phenonenal, I'm actually scared to go see it live again because of the much much smaller orchestra. Just remember when comparing voices, especially with the phantom, he was a great teacher, its never said that he's a great singer maybe think of it that way. Also, when I hear the music is still think of Crawford and Brightman, but the image I come back to is Butler and Rossum."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chandelier in pieces...","review":"Excellent if you liked the movie and are into the \\"Andrew Lloyd Webber\\" thing.Just one advice : don't listen to it in your car.Worst if you sing to it...

I was expecting only the songs. Instead, both cd's literally have \\"the movie soundtrack\\" - spoken words or dialogue are part of the tracks. It's like having the movie on cd... nice, but I rather just have the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Amazing!","review":"I was blown away by the movie and the sountrack. Emmy Rossum's voice is beautiful, vulnerable and stirring. The voice of Butler, as the Phantom, is rough and dark as this character's voice should be. I found not one thing disappointing. The music is just amazing. Listen to this sountrack and truley the phantom will be in your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turned on by Gerard Butler's performance","review":"I saw the movie and immediately ordered the soundtrack. I find this version inspiring and deeply touching, especially the sensuality and depth of love exhibited by the Phantom. Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum have such chemistry. The pleasure I experienced from this album drove me back to the theater to see the movie a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This Cd is worth every penny. I had gotten tired fo the original cast cd so much that I had gotten rid of it years ago. I liked Michael Crawford but Sarah Brightman always made me crazy.But now I have this cd and I can promise you it will not ever get sold. The voices on this cd just take my breath away especially Emmy and Gerard. They give a wonderful perfomances. We finally ahve a young and innocent Christine and a sensual and oh so angry and passionate Phantom.Being a so-so fan of the musical this soundtrack is a stunning improvment on the orignal version as is the film which I found completely engrossing. Kudos to all the performers as well as ALW and Joel S. for recreating this musical and bringing it back into my collection! It can now sit next to Jesus Christ Superstar(the only ALW musical that never got old for me.)as something to be enjoyed for many years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinema killed the Theatre star","review":"I know, i know.. a new generation and a new median of art. Year 2004 or not.. it still [...] Their voices are pitiful and the music completely overpowers whatever it is they are attempting to sing. Butler yells and Rossum is straining through out. They were even too lazy to remove the background sounds from the actual movie! are we listening to a book on tape or a soundtrack? i seem to forget! I don't care how \\"out-dated\\" Michael and Sarah's performance is.. These new \\"singers\\" are horrible!! Many have played these roles in the past and i must say, this colaboration was the worst. ALB should of left his compositions for the theatre and let Schmaucher do what he does.. direct MOVIES. Buy the original soundtrack, folks. Trust me, it's a much better investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what a love story","review":"I wasn't sure about this Movie when I bought it. Could Gerard Butler sing and be a beliveable Phantom? Wow it is the best movie I have seen in a long time, I have watched it several times and I cry each time, I love this movie so much I bought the soundtrack cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"This is without a doubt one of my favorite soundtracks/movie. A lot of people have been saying that they thought Gerald Butler's voice sounded airy or something. Honestly, I don't know why they think that, he sounds great not to mention his voice is kind of sexy! All the actors sounded great and did an awesome job.The only problem I had wasn't with the voices or anything. Did anyone else happen to notice that on the CD cover the phantom's mask is on the left side of his head, but in the movie the mask was on the right side of his head?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Purchase","review":"I bought this as a christmas gift for my girlfriend and she flipped when we listened to it. It is nice to hear the crystal clear quality that technology has offered us in this recording. The actual case includes pictures from the sets which is very neat as a collectors item. The phantom could have been more experienced in singing and sometimes Emmy Rossum's voice is too soft and airy for my taste. It also takes a little while to get used to her vibrato (It feels forced sometimes). Raouls voice is amazing, and overall, the CD is a worthy purchase especially after seeing the movie being able listen and hear the dialogue as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie of 2004","review":"This is one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years. The actors are superb in their roles and the music is to die for. Thanks, Joel, for creating such a masterpiece. I realize it's grossly underrated and panned by critics but I could care less what critics have to say about any movies. I think Gerard Butler should have been nominated for an Oscar, not because he's such a hunk, but because he really extended himself for his role as Phantom. The guy is magnificent. The only thing I could ask for would be a better ending for Phantom and Christine...lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT movie and soundtrack!!","review":"I never really enjoyed the stage version before. Actually I enjoyed \\"Jekyl and Hyde\\" more when I saw it. However, now having seen this movie, now more than once (many more times), I can tell you it all makes sense now. I can't wait till the show comes back, so I can go see and really enjoy it!!This is a great movie and great soundtrack. The talent in this movie is fantastic and even if you have not seen it, you will enjoy this soundtrack. Yet, if you see the movie, you will enjoy even more!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phantom of the Opera, Emmy Rossum","review":"The Phantom of the Opera soundtrack is beautiful. Emmy Rossum's voice is like a bell, it's so clear and sweet. The music is spellbinding and gorgeous, and very full sounding. The word to the new song, Learn to be Lonely remind me of a Bob Dylan type song, which is pretty nice. I love the arrangement on the Angel of Music track, its superb. I am a fan of Emmy Rossum's now, just from listening to this album. Emmy Rossum, Angel of Music, Snowglobe by Corinna Fugate, and Sara Brightman, always listening to those girls..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Comparison to The Original Broadway Cast.","review":"For those of you that like the movie cast, great. But I do take exception to those that pick apart Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, saying that they are \\"too old\\". Well, yeah. NOW they are!! When Sarah Brightman originated the role in 1986, she wasn't much older than Emmy Rossum! This movie should have been done in 1989-1990. Gerard Butler is no Michael Crawford, as his vocals are choppy and forced, and make me wince to listen to. Take a good, long listen to the Original, and then see what you think. The differences are like night and day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill me before I watch this again.","review":"1. They redid the orginal plot some, not that it effected the show much, but it was dispointing.2. Emmy can sing and act, but she was horribly micasted. Christine's part requires more than just hitting the notes.3. The Phantom's disfigurement looked like a sunburn. I laughed when I saw it, I mean, did they really not have the ability to make it look ugly?4.Gerald Butler has no talent. He can't sing, and the only time the part fit was when he was mad. His songs made me cry when I realized how bad the auditions must have been to cast him.5. Is it just me or does his hair change from blonde to black in some scenes?6. They took out Meg Giry's famous ending pose with the mask."},{"rating":"1","title":"singing? what singing?","review":"Emmy can't sing!!!!!!!!!!!! Sarah Brightman still looks like she is 20 yrs. old, why not cast her instead? Emmy scoops her high notes and everything else just is immature!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and go see the musical","review":"I would give this 0 stars if I could. Granted Rossum outperforms Brightman in her role as Christine Daae, the rest of the cast fails to support brillant Rossum. The movie and soundtrack fall flat because of the gravely inept rest of the cast. Honestly, what good is a handsome phantom who can't sing? Crawford is too old for the movie, alright, but there are far better singers on Broadway. Do your ears a favor - save your money and go see the musical for a true \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"I was highly disappointed with the so-called vocal \\"talents\\" of the actors in this production. I mean, you could just as easily get any tone-deaf person off the street and tell them to sing, and they would probably sound better. The vocal technique is minimal, and the sound is at best what is referred to as junior highish. Most of the time, I was left wondering if the Christine in this recording knew what pitch she was supposed to be singing. Being someone who has loved the play for years, I have to say that this is definately a low-point. Why not have Britney Spears sing the role? That would make this a tad more interesting. I am disappointed and sad. I am glad I heard the music first before I wasted any money seeing the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"what have they done to it?","review":"Whatever inspired Gerard Butler to attempt to sing? And Emma Rossum...both of them are just BLEH.Not saying that Crawford and Brightman are the best (I thought that the Phantom and Christine I saw on Braodway were so much better then them) but when Gerard Butler tries to \\"sing\\" the Phantom's solo after \\"All I Ask of You\\" has nothing musical about it and the song was nothing to scream the praises of either.If you're thinking of buying it, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible singing!!","review":"I have not seen the movie, but heard the soundtrack being played while I was shopping in a bookstore last night. The singing was so bad, that I had to find out what it was and why the store was playing it. When I was told it was the soundtrack from the recent movie, I was astounded that such awful singing was (a) filmed in a musical and (b) released in a soundtrack.I did have the pleasure of hearing Michael Crawford sing the title role several years ago when the touring show came to Milwaukee. In my opinion, he should have been in the movie.This soundtrack (and I suspect the movie as well) is nothing less than dreadful. Don't waste your time or money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What hapenned in the recording studio?!","review":"I have no doubt that this film will be a visual masterpiece, but what hapenned when they recorded this music? The voices are frequently off-key and lacking any depth. It's like they didn't stand close enough to the microphone. You can't quite hear them.And it doesn't seem to be just the voices, but also the orchestra who fails in this recording. It all seems to lack volume, depth, and grandeur.I won't even go into casting someone as the Phantom without depth of voice. It's just wrong. A large portion of the mystery and character of the Phantom lies in his powerful voice.As a long time fan of the musical I'm just disapointed in this recording. I've loved every production I've seen, and I've never seen Crawford and Brightman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishing they'd had dubbed the Principle Singers","review":"I had been waiting to see this movie. I loved the Original London Cast, seen it performed in L.A. live 4 times. But this is really terrible. Butler might do well acting the part but his singing has less to do with the POTO that has become a favorite with theater goers and has more in common with Rock version sung by Steve Harley. Though Harley sings the title song better. His breathy voice leaves much to be desired. Is this suppose to be he Angel of Music???Emmy Rossum voice is sweet and lovely but nothing impressionable. I've heard many Christine's (yes even better than Ms. Sarah Brightman) and many real opera sopranos. The vocal roles are so unique it defies the norm of musical theater. It is really such a shame that this production didn't take the time and effort to find real vocal talent, instead of finding the right face.I'll still go and watch the film, but stay clear away from this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so Disappointed","review":"As a HUGE Phantom fan, I was VERY excited for Phantom to come out. I have seen it on stage 2X and read the book many times. I am very disappointed in the Soundtrack. Gerrard butchers Music of the Night and All I Ask of You (Reprise). I actually found myself cringing everytime he sings. Emmy has a good voice but is too soft and lacks the range. Her voice is not at all strong. The only strong point is Patrick Wilson. He is the only one with an actual voice that sounds like he belongs in a musical opera. I could go on and on about how bad this, but I will not. I can't help but think that casting Gerarrd was a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I saw four different phantoms in four different performances. While each performer brought their own talents, to me, there was only one phantom, Mr. Crawford. That being said, it did not stop me from appreciating the other phantoms... with the expection of this phantom. I felt the casting was off for this movie and soundtrack and they really missed the opportunity to cast amazing talent for their vocal excellence and not their box office credibility or for whatever reason they were cast.I understand Christina's talent only came to light when her \\"angel of darkness\\" came into her spirit, however, this actress/singer did not improve, at least not to me. While the performances were okay, it was a let down to me, who appreciated the purity of the live performance.Still, I am not sorry to have experienced it, but, for me, it is a listen to once and store kind of soundtrack, while the original broadway cast or the other cast productions I listen to over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor voice for Gerald Butler","review":"I watched the DVD version of the Phantom of the Opera by Gerald Butler. Everything was good apart from the voice of the \\"Phantom\\" , the leading role in the musical. Gerald Butler, who played the phantom was quite a good actor but his voice was weak, unsupported, at some points clearly cracked and out of tunes, off rhthym, moodless and coarse. The other two leading singers who played Christine and Roul was quite good but the poor voice of the leading role completely spoils the beauty of the musical. I suggest that the movie to be remade with Gerald's voice dubbed over by Michael Crawford, who sounded 10 times nicer than him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good seller","review":"This CD did not play. I tried to contact the seller with no avail! Please do not buy from this seller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Has everything a Phantom movie fan (the recent movie) could want in terms of music and even some dialogue, sound is sharp, the songs are unforgettable, well worth the \\"extra's\\" on the extended album for a real fan as it covers some of the less central music to the movie. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Soundtrack","review":"I have always enjoyed the music from Phantom of the Opera. I own the DVD and have watched it several times and enjoy it more each time I watch it. The extended edition is just like the sounds and music in the DVD. I can listen to the entire movie and not miss what is happening and why. I think the artists in the movie and now on this CD are wonderful. Their voices and the feeling that they put into this music are worthy of this timeless masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I have seen the Phantom of the Opera on stage twice and while the film definitely isn't as good it does do the play justice. I didn't see Michael Crawford on Broadway, he was gone when I got to see it, but I did hear him on the original cast soundtrack. I thought that his voice wasn't what the phantom's voice should sound like. He sounded too whiny. I my opinion Gerard Butler does an exellent job at portraying the phantom. Emmy Rossum's voice is amazing. She is perfect as Christine. I think this is an incredible soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this new version of the Phantom!","review":"I was leery about the Phantom being done in movie form but after seeing it just fell in love with it! I was sitting there just waiting to hate it!!! Butler is an EXCELLENT Phantom and does a wonderful job of singing. He's NOT Michael Crawford for which I am glad! I wouldn't have been drooling over Michael Crawford like I did over Butler!!!! Yummy! The whole cast did an excellent job with the songs, but I could have done with out the \\"Lonely\\" song added in sung by Minnie Driver. I thought that song was unneeded and lacked quality. Overall this is an excellent rendition!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Younger is better","review":"Having been a Phantom fan for a long time I was actually pleased when I heard that they were casting younger actors for the roles. The story calls for young people.The choice of Emmy Rossum was brilliant, due to the fact that Christine needed to be naive enought to believe that it was her father's spirit that was teaching her. Gerard Butler was PERFECT as the Phantom, giving a raw sexual and sensual energy to the role that, let's face it, Micheal Crawford did not have. As for his voice, the sometimes gravily and raw tone was perfect for a role in which the character was on a knife point of sanity, and then drops off.I am hoping that people will find The Phantom of the Opera as wonderful as I did, and can't wait for the dvd to come out (with lots of expected extras.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a movie soundtrack","review":"I will say it once again. This is just another chapter in Webber's Phantom legacy. It should be accepted as just another variation (ie, The Canadian Cast) and not compared to any other version of Phantom. If nothing else, just be glad that Madonna was nowhere in sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful. Brilliant CD","review":"I have never seen the ALW's stage productin of POTO, but I have listened to the soundtrack. I love Emmy Rossum's voice way better them Sarah Brightman's (no offence to you, Sarah.) But Emmy is a lot younger them Sarah B. was, and I think that her voice better suits the part. One of my favorite tracks on this CD is \\"All I Ask of You\\", Patrick Wilson's voice, while not very strong, is very well matched with Emmy's.A lot of People thought that they should have gotten Josh Groban to play Raoul, but while he would have played his part perfectly, he has one of those face's whom you see all the time, and I just don't think that would have worked out to well.They could have dubbed his voice, but then that would have been weird, having Josh's voice coming from another person.All in all, I love this Soundtrack and Movie. And I can't wait till May 3rd, when the DVD comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Rendition of Webber's Work","review":"Upon receiving this special edition, i have opened it and immediately admired the packaging and pictures contained in the book-type packaging. It took time for me though to appreciate this new rendition for i have literally lived my life listening to Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman's trademark performances. After seeing the film in our local cinema, my perception has changed and finally appreciated the new soundtrack.Fans of the musicals may initially find it inappropriate to hear \\"Phantom's\\" younger voice and Christine's \\"less powerful\\" but heartfelt singing. But you have to be open and welcome their outstanding performances. New arrangements for some songs are positive addition to the updated romantic and somehow distinct plot.This is a great addition to everyone's collection but don't get your hopes too high. It took me time to change the music playing and voices singing in my head before i was able to appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good vocals, but lose the dialogue","review":"I doubted the movie could match the performance of Crawford/Brightman, and boy was I right. The Phantom sounds like an extra playing the fullback in a made-for-TV movie. The \\"duh\\" and growl in his voice after hearing Crawford is almost criminal. In addition, they simply lifted the soundtrack out of the movie. Each selection is a couple of minutes of dialogue followed by the musical number. I consider this a moderate waste of CD plastic. Get the broadway show recording, it's ten times the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's It?","review":"Let me get this straight-- you have your pick of all the outstanding, talented people in the world who have ever played or ever wanted to play these roles and we get... this? I was underwhelmed. I saw the move last week, and with the exception of Phantom and Christine, I loved it. The supporting actors are marvelous, Minnie Driver saves the show and the ensemble in \\"Masquerade\\" is unmatched. But Butler and Rossum make amature mistakes (simple things like lack of support through phrases and horrible diction choices) that simply cannot be ignored (believe me, I tried).In a show that is known for its music, the vocal ability should be the top priority, and we simply don't get that from this one.Stick with the Original Cast recording. They did it right the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible singing in a wonderful musical","review":"When I first learned of the castings for this film, I was very upset and disappointed, since the theatrical musical is my favorite. As time went on, I still became excited about the release of the film and thought that the visual beauty would make up for any musical limitations. Unfortunately, after listening to this soundtrack, it is so bad, so awful, so disappointing, that I don't think I could bear to sit through the movie. I have decided not to waste my time or my money and on the release of the film, I will get out the Original London Cast recording with Crawford and Brightman nd listen to that instead. Again, Andrew Lloyd Webber has taken one of his beautiful musicals, a sure can't miss, and completely ruin it on film. Please sell your rights to this project and let someone else try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Underwhelmed","review":"This was probably the most disappointing soundtrack of a musical that I have ever heard. The cast was not nearly mature enough, vocally speaking, to take on Weber's score. If I hadn't known the original soundtrack, I probably wouldn't have had the patience to sit through this entire album. I'd save your money and buy the original broadway version - now THERE'S a cast with talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I almost cried when I first heard it...","review":"I didn't cry because it was moving, I cried because it was AWFUL! Listening to a few of the stage recordings by different singers I can honestly say that all of them are better this. Gerard Butler (Phantom) and Emmy Rossum (Christine) have butchered some of broadways-best songs. Butler's voice is tolerable in 'Down Once More' and 'All I Ask of You- Reprise' but sounds completely awful in the other songs, especially 'Music of The Night'. To think that Rossum is supposed to be a better or equal singer than the woman singing for Carlotta is laughable. Rossums voice is shaky and out of tune. The only songs worth listening to are 'Down Once More', 'All I Ask of You- Reprise' and 'Masquerade'.I have been waiting to hear this soundtrack for so long and now it's just sad. I would have never thought that Andrew Lloyd Webber would butcher his own music!This could have been a wonderful soundtrack if not for the awful singing voices of Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This cd does not live up the the original cast recording. I wish I didn't buy it. I have seen the stage musical three times and anyone of those stage actors would have done a better job than anyone on this cd. The \\"actor/singer\\" cast as the Phantom is a poor choice, his singing [...] makes me cringe. I was looking forward to seeing the film. I am crossing my fingers that his singing will be better on film. The actress cast as \\"Christine\\" is a fine singer and \\"Raoul\\" does a decent job. Really a disappointment!!!

Love the fuller orchestra and the sound is amazing, but...but Gerard Butler can't really sing (I hope his acting is better than his singing).Mr. Butler sounds like he is trying too hard to sound like Crawford's phantom, and miserably fails in the attempt. Michael Crawford will forever BE \\"the phantom\\", but even Kiss' Paul Stanley did a better job with the vocals (specially the higher notes)than Gerard Butler.The rest of the cast is fairly good, but not as good as the original Broadway cast, or others I've seen on stage.I wish Amazon would've let you hear the streaming of the CD before I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butler, Rossum, and Wilson SUPERB!","review":"I must say after listening to the soundtrack prior to seeing the film, then relistening to the soundtrack afterwards...it could not be better!

I am very satisfied with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"marvellous orchestrations, disappointing singing","review":"Being a long standing fan of the stage show, I was very excited to hear 'The Phantom of theOpera' was to be brought to the big screen. I would have to say, however, that the soundtrack to the film is slightly grating. The orchestrations are beautiful and powerful, whereas the singers (with the exception of Patrick Wilson as Raoul) do not tarry well with the power of the orchestra. There are frequent flat notes (especially in 'Angel of Music'), and generally Gerard Buler's and Emmy Rossum's voices, though not unpleasant, are not powerful enough or used with enough technical control to suit the demands of the piece ( especially at the end of the title track).It would be very interesting to hear these singers sing rock or folk, which they may be more suited to, as neither is without talent.Jennifer Ellsion is a suprise gem on this recording. Although she has a relatively minor role, her voice is very pleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't purchase this over the original.","review":"When my sister requested this soundtrack, I had high hopes.

And so are the stageplay and the movie. It was in my head for months when I heard the score for the first time. I met people who have seen Phantom on stage more than dozen times. I read reviews that people watched the movie 4 or 5 times since the movie started a week ago.

I highly recommend it; top shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheated.","review":"I just received my package and I was excited to listen to my 2-disc set of the soundtrack. Unfortunately, I only received Disc 2 of the set, and the spot for Disc 1 was just left empty. I am very disappointed. I would not have paid for the product if I knew I would only be receiving one half of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerard Butler!!!!!!","review":"I will watch or listen to anything with Gerard Butler! Of course The Phantom of the Opera is wonderful, but I love the soundtrack and movie to hear him. I even watched 300 just to see the body. Listen to this all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rave for the non-drug crowd","review":"I recently saw the Blue Man Group (BMG) in Las Vegas, fulfilling a 5-year ambition to see them. Other reviews describe them well--percussive and avant garde. While taking a taxi to another venue, the cab driver challenged us (his words) to describe what BMG was about, and I was unable, until I thought about it later. To me, the group is about bringing rave culture to the mainstream, absent the drugs. The show itself is a full multimedia mind-blowing experience, one that needs to be seen to be fully appreciated. As such, the CD, while excellent to those who have seen the show, may seem cold and lacking to those who haven't. For me, it brings back fond memories of an act I truly enjoyed.My recommendation is simple--see the act first, then buy this CD. Buying the CD first will only leave you scratching your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLUE MAN GROUP POWER","review":"I have to say the Blue Man Group is the best cd I've ever heard and I am usually intrested into heavy metal music. The Blue Man Group's music just frees your mind from EVERYTHING that surrounds you, it magically just transforms you into a different world, a world of tubes and airpoles, drums and strings. I am a Blue Man fanatic and I think everyone in the world should experience the radiant energy of the Blue Man Group power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection Of Sounds","review":"I've not seen this band perform live but this is a great collection of sounds on one album. The album has no vocals but a great rhythm album with some heavy beats, something like I would expect from an album of tribal African music. Preview the sample clips and see for yourself if you're interested enough to take the plunge."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're blue cause they're super chill","review":"Who knew PVC piping could sound so good?Audio is a very listenable album whose thoroughly original beats (played on no kind of instrument you've ever heard of) range from the ultra mellow \\"Utne Wire Man\\", to the ultra catchy \\"TV Song\\" and right on to the ultra spirit raising, heart pumping, makes you want to dance in your car \\"Rods and Cones\\". No need to hit the skip button here.There are no lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool- but some are boring","review":"The CD is like many others that i own- the first five or so songs are GREAT, but then it goes downhill. Up until Rods and Cones, there are some great percussive layers, incredible riffs and simply cool, unique sounds (such as the \\"air poles\\" on Utne Live Wire) While the CD dips into mainly background music with songs like Cat Video and Club Nowhere, there are incredible songs a-plenty, like Opening Mandelbrot, Mandelgroove, and Klein Mandelbrot. Drumbone is from the intel commercials, but nonetheless ROCKS THE HOUSE. incredible music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaurav","review":"Simply Awesome... Still I am giving it a 4 because if one has seen it live and then listens to this CD one can enjoy it more.

BMG ROCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seen the Show - Must Have the CD!","review":"If you've been to the Blue Man Group Show, you know what great music they produce. Listenning to it again just brings up all the fun stuff they do on stage, and give a great rythem to the music.When I listen to this CD, I see the light and moves from the show again!If you've seen the show, you must add this GREAT CD to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Man Group...

A must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LIES","review":"I ordered a new, factory sealed cd and when it came it was open and not sealed and you could tell it was used. It was a huge mess to try and contact the company, not by phone, by email, and it was like a computer generated response because they didn't answer my questions.They claim it was imported so it wasnt shrink wrapped, etc, but it was a lie, and it was going to cost me as much to ship it back for a refund as it was for the damn thing.Needless to say, I bought it through amazon, and it came sealed and with a cover over the cd, so caiman lied from the beginning. Whenever I see a product I want to buy and see that the seller is caiman, I NEVER purchase it. Buyers beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Man Group","review":"The rhythms are totally elemental! You must respond to the music. It has an energy of it's own. I highly recommend to anyone who likes music with a with a distinctive sound and rhythm. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good stuff...","review":"...if you're in Vegas and have a chance to see the show at the Luxor, by all means do. By most accounts it is the best show of the four major cities where BMG performs.As for the music, it is pretty good stuff as far as ambient tunes are concerned. However, there are perhaps three or four tracks you can listen to with regularity, and not want to subsequently use the CD as a frisbee. This music (while not a soundtrack) is very definitely geared towards the visual effects present in the stage show, and frankly is almost identical to the show tunes.Thus several of the tracks have beats and rythms which will wear on you if you don't have the visuals to go with it. All in all a fun collection of music though. Definitely worth the money.

When I ordered the tour video, I also ordered \\"Audio,\\" and it blew me away even more! If you want something a little more raw, and with a lot more percussion, than \\"The Complex,\\" you NEED this CD! It's a little less polished and doesn't have vocals getting in the way. Make sure your subwoofer's warmed up and CRANK IT! This CD has to be on any percussion fans top 10 list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"I've been to their show in both Chicago and New York, and thought this reflected the style and energy of the live performance, without making it a true soundtrack. I agree that it needs to be cranked up to be truly appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I was really looking forward to this Audio DVD. Upon arrival I immediately had to play it and was expecting this tremmendous sound that was going to blow me away, and nice visuals to accompany the music. It just was not there. All the songs are so simmilar with the clammering of tinker toys that it almost becomes annoying, and this is coming from someone who has seen them 2X. I wish they would have had someone take pictures that were not from the 2nd balcony. If someone were to sit down to listen and watch this without having been to a performance, I am most certain they would not go. They need a better visual representation of what a performance is like. A slide show simply does not cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Man Group Audio DVD","review":"i do not like this DVD. i thought i was getting a DVD of Blue Man group showing them playing their instruments. also i thought they would show how the Blue Man Groug made their instruments, etc.. i was hopeing to see the Blue Man Group playing some of their music. well, i was so wrong. this DVd was a waste of my money and time. carol"},{"rating":"1","title":"cd/dvd","review":"items were good I thought it was a dvd of there show but its just pictures with music MY mistake I guess"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is missing...","review":"I bought Blue Man Group's second CD called \\"The Complex\\" before I bought this one. The big difference between the 2 cds is that The Complex had vocals on most of the songs. Without the vocals, like this cd, I find Blue Man Group kind of boring. I guess when you're watching their music in a live show, you get into it, but just listening to it gets boring without more mental stimulation such as vocals. I do have to give Blue Man Group that their rythms on this cd are very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Man is NOT what you think it is.","review":"The blue man group experience cannot be summed up in words. Obviously it cannot be summed up through video. This DVD is misleading in that you think you are going to see the Blue Man Group perform, but instead you find that it is a bunch of still pictures with music from there CD. I love Blue Man Group but I was very dissappointed that I could not show my friends, family and myself what an extraordanary performance these guys put on. So go out about by the CD its the same thing only you can carry it around with and its cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"Blue Man Group is a magnificent band to listen to. I like how they created their instruments to produce awesome music. I wish I could see the in person while they perform. I recommend this group that enjoys techno music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories of the show!","review":"This CD is a fantastic music CD. My favorite part is that it reminds me of seeing them in Las Vegas. Seeing it first is a definate must see -- the CD is fantastic, but knowing what the instruments were and are bring it to a whole different level! I'd rank this CD as highly as any of the Cirque Du Soleil CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Description","review":"To sum this cd up, WOW! Coming from the music I listen to(metal, hard rock), I thought i'd give them a try after seeing them on an appearance on Jay Leno. All I can say is that i'm more than impressed. Never has a cd gripped me from beginning to end the way this one did. From the opening minute of the first song to the last second of the last song, I had shivers. I highly, highly reccomend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Cow!","review":"I saw the show last week in Chicago at the Briar Street Theater. Words are inadequate to describe what I saw, felt, and heard, but here goes: I was filled with joy and awe at the talent I witnessed both in the performances, the music and the BMG message(s)-- social, political, the human condition, which are delivered sometimes subtly and not so subtly. This is unbelieveable talent, imagination and craftsmanship on a modern par with Mozart or Beethoven in its creativity, power and courage. Don't miss the show if you are able to see it, but the music on this album is amazing and not to be missed, either. What DNA has wrought!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a strange, blue world out there","review":"I saw Blue Man Group perform their \\"Tubes\\" show in New York City about two or three years ago. I sat near the sound mixing desk, and I asked the engineer if there was a soundtrack. He said they were working on it. What a rush this CD is. It captures the Blue Men and their gently weird, other-worldly experience in an hour's worth of PVC tube-bashing, zither sawing, drum pounding music. If you've seen their act, relive it with this CD. If you haven't, stop, look and listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Audio sound quality","review":"I already owned and loved the CD and after some thought, I ordered audio DVD as well, just to enjoy the tracks in better quality. The DVD contains surround (5.1) mix, 24 bit / 192 kHz, which is pretty neat all by itself. Unfortunately, couple of the tracks contain some pretty loud annoying clicks that should not be there. Also, the music is mastered quite silent with plenty of headroom, which is a good thing in general, but in here, they went too far, making the music too silent. This in turn forces replaygain in my player to switch from -6 dB to -7.12 dB because of clipping problems, which is annoying (but not technically wrong in any way). It's a minor issue all in all, but along with the clicks it mostly discourages me from adding this disc to the playlist. Not a good DVD Audio release."},{"rating":"2","title":"check it out","review":"This has to be one of the best cd's I have ever heard. The use of drums, pipes, and even pieces of metal is interesting. These up-beat and awesome songs do not need words to make them better. I would be confident when I say that these quick beats and rhythms on this cd would make it near impossible to add words to. See the show and buy the cd, they are both great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Rock N Roll, you should buy this CD","review":"Have seen the group live twice. The CD doesnt have the impact of the live performance, but then neither do U2's or anybody else. The CD is mostly simple but catchy guitar riffs snaking out like electric whips, backed by a wall of drums and drums and drums. Listening to this, you realize how much layers of fantastic percussion can contribute to rock. After you listen to this, and you listen to just about any other rock CD, you'll be going \\"Jeez... the drums really SUCK in that group! Why can't they sound more like the Blue Men!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCKS!","review":"Get this album and then wait until BMG blows us away again early 2003 with their new album \\"The Complex\\".

I enjoyed the live show alot more than the CD, but the CD is still a 5 star CD. If you havent seen these guys live, then do so, you dont know what you missing. I felt like a 34 yr old kid. I had such incredible fun, even though some lame 20+/- yr old girl setting beside me, (not my wife) was not having fun and seem to be to proper to be with us goof balls, all the more for our section to throw tons of paper in her way. If you are going to one of these shows, expect the unexpected. Its awesome. Its fun and worth every single penny and some. Im going back next month."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Percussionist's Dream","review":"This CD is absolutely Fantastic! People who have been to the Blue Man shows will spot a couple of familiar rhythms. I am glad that Blue Man decided not to have a soundtrack of the show but rather expand upon the songs heard in the show as well as add a few new ones. The overall sound is incredible and is a true delight to listen to. You got to pick this one up. It is a winner and you will not regret buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST $100 Buck I have ever spent!!!!!","review":"When I anounced that I was going to Las Vegas, everyone said that I should go see the Blueman Group. I was skeptical, especially when I saw the price of $100 bucks a ticket. But I saw the video for \\"Sing Along,\\" and I figured what the hell! I was completely blow away!!!!! This was the best show I have ever seen! After seeing it I declared that I would pay $500 bucks a ticket! When I found out that there was a soundtrack to the show, I bought it without question! I brought back so many memories of the show. The only thing I hate about it is that it makes me want to see the show again, and I live in boring Evansville, Indiana. If you like the show \\"Stomp,\\" a fan of percussion, or just enjoy weird music, then this is the album for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming & interesting","review":"Spelling Bees are only getting more and more popular each year (this year ABC will be televising it... in Primetime) and it's not hard to see why. This book is basically Spellbound in book form, which is to say, charming, sweet, fascinating and an interesting look at a great American phenomenon. I'd also recommend this book to Bee-aged readers who are intersted in learning more about it (even though this isn't really a YA book). My only complaint is that it runs a bit long and the author gets a bit too in-depth with some discussion of the history of bees, bees from the past, etc. etc. Could've used some editing, but is otherwise a sweet book. Recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and engrossing","review":"I found Maguire's book a suspenseful read about the people involved in the National Spelling Bee. It's one of those non-fiction books that tie you to your childhood interests and gives you the background on something you were only supeficially aware of. The section on the history of language and spelling is worth the price of the book in itself. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Seems like too often we read news stories describing how our country is going downhill. Reading this book has been a wonderful antidote. Mr. Maguire says: \\"... the Bee is ... downright inspirational to watch.\\"He brings the kids, the event to life. It's so refreshing to read and get to know these kids.

It's definitely quirky, dark humor, but Helena Bonham Carter is a perfect character. The soundtrack is full of Celtic (mostly Scottish/Cape Breton) music, that is a reason alone to get the movie.Any Monty Python, Terry Gilliam fans should enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where has this artist been hiding?","review":"This collection ranges from smooth jazz to a hard hitting beat with great lead guitar sounds. The tunes are catchy, well composed, and make you want to move a little, even if you are sitting down. Several tracks focus on today's current events as the artist attempts to awaken our senses and expose our feelings. I recommend this CD to a wide range of listeners because of the variety it offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutally Masterful Deathcore","review":"From the delicate keys to the pummeling squeals and growls, this album is all about the MUSIC. Unlike some deathcore bands I've heard, \\"Mortal Treason\\" actually sounds like they know what they're doing... I'd put this album nearly up with Impending Doom's \\"The Serpent Servant\\" (which happens to be my favorite deathcore album ever.)If you like your music heavy, gritty, well written and uplifting... you will LOVE \\"Sunrise Over a Sea of Blood.\\"Also Recommended:Horror-With Blood Comes Cleansing (Brutal Deathcore with Completely Scriptural Lyrics)The Serpent Servant-Impending Doom (Excellent/catchy hybrid of metalcore and death growls. Awesome lyrics and hooks.)The Physics of Fire-Becoming the Archetype (Prog/Death Metal with a retro flair. This is a good one for recovering 80's metalheads.)The Raven and the Reaping-The Famine (Technical Metalcore with a Grindcore Flair... Subpar lyrics and writing are at least mostly made up for in instrumental skill and sheer speed.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"This is one AMAZING CD. Mortal Treason deliver a brutal, beautifull, and soulfull melodic Death/Black metal assault on the senses.

I especially like the nocturnes for solo piano and \\"Sleep and Dream\\" for voice and piano. The solo piano arrangement of the second movement of the piano concerto is lovely and nearly as effective as the original. Only the Toccata is unconvincing, but I wonder how much of it is actually Oldham. Can't recommend this CD strongly enough, I refer to it constantly.

Martin Brookes does an amazing job of weaving together the history and science behind the fruit fly and making it incredibly interesting.The fruit fly has been a key player in the advancement of evolutionary biology, genetics, and developmental biology during the past century. Brookes manages to follow the story of the fruit fly from lab to lab, telling jokes and interesting anecdotes along the way.By the end of the book, the reader is convinced that the seemingly uninportant and pesky fruit fly is not only irreplacable in science, but can somehow tell us something about our own lives.I highly recommend this book not only to scientists and science students, but to the layperson who wants to learn some basic biology and some scientific history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, fun, yet informative..","review":"I'm doing research with fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) myself.

Recommend for light reading, especially if you love Ireland, as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this as much as Sarum","review":"I love Edward Rutherford's style of writing and his sagas are extremely readable and interesting. His characters are very real, and it's nice to see the families and their descendents over the years. This book details the history of the beautiful Emerald Isle from abour 450 AD to the reign of Henry VIII. What a culture these Irish people have! Their lives have never been easy on this beautiful island, and the book begins to point out where the problems that are there now stem from. It's ancient history - true, but it seems timely and important the way that Rutherford has written this book. His love for the Irish people and their culture comes through these pages, and he deals with the issues and the history in a warm and non-judgemental way. It's a long book, but it doesn't seem that once you get into the stories of the lives these people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely touches on actual history","review":"I'm not even finished reading this \\"historical\\" novel and I'm already disappointed. Perhaps I've read too much Irish history, but I was very frustrated with the way Rutherfurd barely touched on certain historical events in Ireland without elaborating, even a little.I would recommend Leon Uris' TRINITY and REDEMPTION and also Bodie and Brock Thoene's THE GALWAY CHRONICLES for much more satisfying historical fiction on Ireland.These series are quite informative, while also being riveting and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time spent to read","review":"I am a huge fan of historical novels and was most interested in reading this book.

Very thorough and informative! I'm really looking forward to reading the next one and reading his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rutherford's Ireland","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It is drivel. Apart from the colour of hair & eyes there is NO connection between any of the so-called sagas.

While the reader does a wonderful job with the changing Irish accents, Dublin vs. Leinster, Ulster vs. Munster, educated vs. \\"regular folk\\", the abridged version is even harder to follow than some have described the written. Just when you start to get to know a character, they're gone and you've jumped ahead a few hundred years and the ties between the stories are thin.Rutherfurd follows some of the styles of James Michener in that he takes a geographical place and weaves the people and history in and around it. But it doesn't work here and while I love the sound of the Irish voices, the story leaves me wishing Michener had written about Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Pot of Gold","review":"Princes of Ireland: The Dublin Saga is a disappointing, meandering and disjointed attempt to tell the story of Ireland, Dublin and its princes. But the storytelling goes all over Ireland only occasionally returning to Dublin and \\"Princes\\" is not the word I would have used for most of the mundane, ignoble characters portrayed.There are in all fairness some fine moments in the tale and there is a slight touch of magic ever so slightly glimpsed within the pages. But there is no pot of gold at the end of this tome, not-tat-tall."},{"rating":"2","title":"liked the history, hated the ending","review":"I picked up this book after having been out of the world of books for some time. I'm glad to say that my love of reading was rejuvenated by this book. I loved the sweeping history and most of the characters were engaging. I was, however, disappointed by the ending. It just fell flat. Will read more of Rutherford though. Moving on to London next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than A Sleeping Pill","review":"I've read Sarum, London, & The Forest and really enjoyed them. This book is not nearly as good. It's just plain boring. I kept reading with the hope that the book would improve in the next chapter - needless to say my hopes were dashed! I will probably give his next book a chance, after all, every author should be allowed a \\"dud\\" now and then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-researched historical fiction","review":"Although I have been aware of Rutherfurd for quite some time, this is the first of his works that I have read. I found the book to be, overall, quite interesting but perhaps somewhat awkward at times in the transitioning elements. Some of the more interesting chapters are those describing pagan Ireland, the Viking influences, and, of course, the conflict with the English. The last 75 pages or so I found to be especially captivating, but the ending was somewhat anticlimatic. A possible explanation for this is that Rutherford wants to leave us hungry for more as \\"The Princes of Ireland\\" has a planned sequel, \\"The Rebels of Ireland,\\" which has now been published. Based on my experience with \\"The Princes of Ireland,\\" I would definitely take on another of Rutherfurd's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"A must read if you are going to travel to Ireland. I went to Ireland in September and it was nice to have the back ground history of Ireland."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I found it to be a wonderful read! Epic saga, facinating historical descriptions, characters of interest. True, one does not feel passionately connected to any charcter in particular, but rather, there is a true feel for the flow of time through generations of people within a geographical area, and the development of a nation and unique culture. The connection the reader makes is to a culture and a time, rather than to individual characters. It's a bit like the feeling one had as a child when your parents told you stories of your ancestors. The description of the \\"selling\\" of Christainity to the Pagans makes me understand for the first time what I was taught about God \\"sacrificing his only son for you\\". This is the first and only Rutherfurd novel I have read. I can only say I must read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster indeed","review":"I had trouble finishing this rather boring history of Ireland. The characters are two dimensional and the whole story lacks connectedness. It was more fits and starts and then a change to a totally different time. It seemed the author was unsure if he was writing a novel or history and tried to cover too much ground at one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"About 15 years ago I read \\"Sarum\\" and after all this time I still think of it as being one of the best books I've ever read. Right up there with \\"Gone With The Wind\\" as one of my favorites. As a matter of fact, after lending my copy and never getting it back, I recently bought another copy just to have. \\"London\\" and \\"Russka\\" were almost as good, and although \\"The Forest\\" didn't quite measure up with my expectations, it wasn't a bad read. But \\"Princes of Ireland\\" lost me before the first 100 pages. I love history, and was looking forward to reading about Ireland's history, but he has made it so dull it's not worth reading. My biggest complaint is the long, long discriptive passages, and he uses words no one has ever heard of. There is a pronunciation guide in the back of the book, but, really now, who wants to consult a pronunciation guide when engrossed in a book? This is more like a textbook. I hope the sequel is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Rutherfurd's first book,Sarum: The Novel of England, is one of my favourite novels. He repeats his 'Sarum' formula of following successive generations of several families across a broad expanse of history in several further books, almost as successfully in some, and less so in later ones. Sadly, though, his book was so poor I eventually abandoned it. I don't know if Rutherfurd has been beating a dead horse, format-wise, or whether he maybe just didn't have the interest in his subject that he did in earlier works, but the end result is a sad departure from the usual standard. As disappointed as I was, however, I have not given up on this author. I have recently ordered his latest workNew York: The Noveland I am very much looking forward to seeing if he will redeem himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars, and being generous","review":"I was not a big fan of the style of this book. 150 pages of characters and storylines, then skip ahead a few hundred years and start all over with new characters with new storylines. It was kind of confusing when trying to figure out how all the characters were related.But at least for the first few hundred pages we were reading about battles and big events in the history of Ireland. The last few hundred pages were about trivial events that were only important to the characters in the story. It became more like reading a non-fiction history book. This book is rare in that it became more boring as the story went on, instead of leading towards a climactic end. I couldn't wait for it to be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princes of Ireland","review":"Sent it as a gift to my sister in Paris. It arrived promptly and she was very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top quality historical fiction","review":"Rutherfurd is a modern day Michener, and if historical fiction is your cup of tea, Rutherfurd is a worthy successor. I first read his novel, Russka, and have subsequently read all his works (Sarum, London and Prices of Ireland). Of these, Russka is still my favorite. I don't put Rutherfurd in quite the same league as Michener and Clavell, but I'd be hard pressed to find anyone better at this genre at this point in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, they can't all be winners!","review":"First, I've really enjoyed Edward Rutherford's earlier works: Sarum, London and The Forest. Unfortunately, I found his new book, Princes of Ireland, to be very disappointing. The characters seemed thin and failed to make me truly care about them as in his other books. In previous books, I eagerly looked forward to seeing the connections between generations. Seeing the differences and the similarites that really made it personal as far as demostrating the changing times. Maybe it was that in this book there was no real engaging architectural/structural focal point ie: the Tower or a cathedral to focus on. And for such a lyrical, passionate people such as the Irish, the book was very flat, hanging the plot it seemed more on politics than people. They can't all be winners! Maybe the next book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than publisher's weekly suggests","review":"Having been entertained by Rutherford's THE FOREST, I hoped for a similar page-turning saga in this work about Ireland. Some 350 dreadful pages later, I had to put the book down -- one of the few works in years I haven't been able to finish. Boring, tedious, and not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read","review":"Preparing for an upcoming Irish trip I am seeping myself with novels by the Irish and about the Irish. I had done this when I traveled to London by reading Rutherford's London on the advice of a relative. I found this Rutherford novel easier to read. In all honestly I think the first segment is the best-Deirdre was an empathetic character.After her story things slowed down a bit.I find it interesting -and I have no knowledge other than what I have read here -that Rutherford is continuing his Irish saga. While Celtic legend is a fascinating part of Ireland and its history ( I personally enjoyed the Juilene Osborne-McKnight versions)Irish modern history as demonstrated by Andrew Greeley's accounts mingled with his modern fiction in his Irish series would be an fascinating extention of the saga.I did not get bogged down in The Princes of Ireland as I did at times in London. His is an interesting perspective of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an insult to the Choral Music of Leo Sowerby.","review":"I have performed a number of choral works by Leo Sowerby, including many Anthems, Service Music and his Cantata, \\"Forsaken of Man\\" under the conductor and organist, Dr. Ronald Arnatt at Christ Church Cathedral in St. Louis, Mo. The Organ and Brass performances are adequate, but the Choral and Solo Vocal performances are only barely acceptable. Both the choral and vocal sound is very immature with the exception of the soprano solo in the final selection. Hopefully these works will receive their deserved recorded performance in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a let down","review":"I am an adamant lover of choral music. When i discovered this CD, I was ecstatic to find these masterworks recorded. It was to my utter disappointment to realize the quality of the choir on this CD. There seems to be no choral concept of proper breath support to sustain and truly evoke the beauty of the text. Pitch problems and the wobbly vibrato become tiresome after a few listens and there also exists a lack of phrasing. These elements are things you would expect to be mastered on any recording from any ensemble, even on the novice level. Only thing is that here, it is all missing. I know I may sound harsh, but when you list American church composers, Sowerby is at the top with very few others. It is only fitting that someone records his music well, it is the least that they can do. In this case, I'm not sure what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Too Tight for CD/DVDs","review":"I won't even use these if the CD or DVD is going to be used by my husband or anyone else with little patience. This is such a tight fit you are going to get finger prints all over your CD while trying to get it in and out of this sleeve. Someone with especially little patience might even break the CD while trying to force it in. Also, it is double sided so when you put the second CD in the other side that side of the sleeve crinkles up. It seems well enough made so I would have given it four stars if the CDs fit in more easily. I don't feel like returning this so I'll just use it as a single sleeve for CDs only I listen to occasionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I needed to make space and got rid of all my DVDs bulky plastic covers, so I looked for some good CD/DVD sleeves to protect them. I got my first batch of DVD sleeves at Staples, they were good but also quite expensive. Then I found those on Amazon, and figured I'd give it a try.

But the actual dimensions of the sleeves are 5.75\\"H X 5\\"W (including the title tab at the top). The Ideastream boxes are 5\\"H with the lid.

May have overrated this cd, but i've bought, heard and gotten frustrated over bad-sounding karaoke versions to know this is an excellent cd. Top Tunes really does make good cover versions. Such a pity that this brand of CDs are not sold here in Singapore. Which explains why i have to buy from Amazon.com.Speaking of which, thumbs up for Amazon!!! Amazon has made my first online transaction a very smooth and pleasant one. My stuff came within the estimated delivery time in good condition. Have definitely boosted my confidence in online shopping. Don't quite agree with the price though... But I'll certainly buy more stuff here simply because it's reliable and efficient. Way to go Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super creepy book!","review":"I got this book as a gift. It starts out really sweetly with a mother rocking her baby and singing to him how she'll love him forever. Although the baby grew to be a toddler who sometimes drove her crazy, she would still rock him and sing the song. It continues through his life phases. Eventually her son is a grown man living across town. The mom sometimes sneaks over in the night (with a ladder tied to her car), crawls through his window, and still rocks him. It wasn't a big shock that there was no mention of a spouse for either the mom or her son. This book could be subtitled...how to create an Oedipal Complex."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Creepy Children's Book","review":"I can't figure out why so many people love this book. I think it is great to install the idea that a parent's love is unconditional and forever but there a million other books that convey this message without being creepy. Let me put it this way. If my mother-in-law broke into our house in the middle of the night and tried to rock my husband to sleep, I would do one of two things. I would get her to the doctor to check for senile dementia or I would get a restraining order against her. Luckily, my mother-in-law is a lovely lady who would never do that. I also feel that it gives the message that you are not OK with your child growing up and becoming their own person. There is a Norman Bates quality to the whole thing. Skip this book and get \\"Guess How Much I Love You.\\" It has the same theme without the weirdness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disturbing","review":"This book seems not written for children but for mothers. It's one thing to give a child a book, another to actually love them. This one is disturbing because it suggests that there is an obligation for the child to take care of his mother when she gets older, that the unconditional love should be for the mother, regardless of how the child has been treated in real life. Unconditional love requires no reciprocity. It is given freely with no expectation of anything in return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Classic","review":"I loved it as a child and I love it still. When I gave birth to my son 8 weeks ago, my mother gave me a new copy to share with him. I can't wait until he is old enough for me to do so.As another reviewer noted, the boy in the story does NOT have some psycho mom crawling through his window at night. As most children will understand, that's an allegory for her love. A great way to let your children know that your love will always be with them, in a way that they can grasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"...to the point of being nauseating.

I distinctly remember sitting down to read this book to him when he was just an infant. It is sweet to staart, but as I went along through both son and mother getting older, I could see where it was headed...and it wasn't somewhere I wanted to go. It was creepy enough when the mom picks up the teenage son at night, but when she puts a ladder on top of her car and drives across town to crawl in his window to \\"hold\\" him? Too much! And I get that it's a fact of life that mothers die at some point, but I really don't want that as part of a book for my infant/toddler child. I know others see this as a \\"must-have\\" book, but I'd say it's a \\"must stay away\\" book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird, weird book","review":"I don't know what makes people think this is such a wonderful book. It's really *weird*. The mother creeps along the floor of her sons room at night to crawl into bed with him. Then, when he leaves the house as an adult, she drives across town with a ladder, and climbs up into his bedroom window at night while he's sleeping. It's CREEPY.

It's not, it's downright weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and Creepy, at the level of Fatal Attraction","review":"What did I just read?! I honestly don't know what to say. My 4-year-old was creeped out before I was.If a middle-aged man told me that his mom drove across town with a ladder, climbed in his window, watched him while he slept, and then rocked him in her lap while singing lullabies, then I would suggest that he quickly gather his wife and kids and move to an undisclosed location."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaches that moms can die!","review":"My 6 yr old son had this book read to him in Kindergarten. He came home crying and asking me questions about when I'm going to die, and how all that works. It was entirely too much for him at his age. He was so negatively affected, I had to ask the teacher to remove it from her reading list. In addition to all the other controvery surrounding this book, I say just \\"don't go there\\". No children's book should be able to provoke this much negativity and still be in print. Read \\"Guess How Much I Love You\\" or \\"Owl Babies\\" instead. Much better, feel-good books that properly illustrate parental love for a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Mom. Don't give me this book.","review":"I'm a father of two boys. Happily married. Well adjusted. But honestly, when I first read this book, I thought it was quite charming, if not a bit syrupy.But then I had a moment of clarity and realized it's a tremendously off-putting book. If this book establishes a template for what aging love is supposed to look like, I think it's quite misleading. I love my mother very much, but at no point do I want her to believe (even metaphorically) that she should climb into my window in order to show me how much she loves me.I taught high school English for 12 years and met many, many, many mothers who would read this book as a wonderful model for how they should smother their children out of an act of love.I'm surprised more people don't identify this book as truly odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I had to put this book away halfway through. It was just a disgusting piece of bad fiction.The story starts off nicely, and the song the mother sings her son is cute, but then it gets real creepy.Do people realise there are horror movies about this topic? Misery? Psycho? Would you show your children these movies, to show them how to show their love to people?Really. This is a sick, sick story disguised as a charming and endearing children's tale.Let me tell you - it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exquisitely touching tale.","review":"Robert Munsch outdid himself with this tale of a mothers love for her child. I came across this book myself when I was a teenage babysitter. Now, as an adult and a mother to four beautiful adopted children, my family has come to treasure the story of a child going through the stages of life and a mother who loves him unconditionally. If you hear anything negative about this book, I encourage you to get a copy and see for yourself. I would almost guarantee that you will become entranced and near tears when you read the words \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as you're living, my baby you'll be.\\" In a small book, we learn the lengths that a mother goes to and what she endures for her children...and that no matter what..and above all else, she loves them just the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"So glad to see I'm not alone!","review":"The first time I read this book I thought it was sweet... for the first few pages. By the time there's a picture of the mom driving with a ladder tied to the roof of her car to climb in her grown son's room my husband looked at me and asked what the heck I was reading. I could barely finish we were laughing so hard! I'm so glad to see that there are other people who find this book creepy and ridiculous! Ours is leaving the house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disturbing book","review":"I was fine until I found the mother crawling across the floor of her son's room at night. And when she began driving across town to climb into his window at night, I wondered if I was the only one who found this a rather unhealthy image. I think you can teach unconditional love without the undertones of ownership and dysfunctional attachments. I think most people just pretend the mother crawling across the floor section doesn't exist---however, I couldn't ignore it, so I won't be buying this book for any child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy and overly sentimental","review":"The book starts out sweet, but becomes very odd as the characters age. It has a geriatric mother climbing in the window of her adult son to rock him to sleep. The first time I read this book to my daughter I cried at the manipulative ending. This frightend my daughter so much that she never wanted to hear the book again. It's too weird and too sentimental. I accidentally picked up a halloween book by the same author that also had a very bizarre plot. I think he's a little off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was weird at best","review":"I received this book as a baby shower present and I really thought it was creepy. I did not care for the image of the mother literally crawling into the baby's room in the first place and it just got worse from there. Granted, no one is really going to go the lengths in this story but I still felt it symbolized an overprotective mother who doesn't know when to let go. This story doesn't portray love; it portrays obsessiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever is a Great Book. 10 Stars!","review":"I read this book so many times to my children when they were small, they loved it each time, as it showed them the stages of life in a poignant and beautiful manner. I never cried from this book, and neither did my children, although I did get choked up, with moist eyes. It also brought about more of a loving bond, that shows the circle of life, and how important unconditional love is between a parent and child.I highly recommend reading this book to a your child.

Since I am not married and do not haved children it's not one of my favorite reads. Most parents who I know, however, love it and start crying while they are in the process of reading the book. I highly suggest buying it if you are or are soon to be a parent or you know someone who is. If you aren't a parent then you need to read the book first and judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read this book a hundred times, it still gets to me!","review":"After I read this book for the first time, I gave it to my wife, who cried and said that it was depressing!

I can't think of another book that gets to me so much, is it wrong for a grown man to cry? A Masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"To the lady who suggested that this book was about something other than the love a mother has for a child; you are wrong.

I first discovered the book when my father gave it to my grandmother for Christmas about 4 years ago. Ever since then it has become my favorite Children's book.

Look more at the symbolism of a mother's (or father's) deep love for a child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic book for mothers of all ages","review":"This is a favorite book of mine to read to my children. It completely describes the unconditional love a mother feels for her children and offers a glimpse into the future when a mothers love is returned by the unconditional love of her grown son.

I highly recommend this book for every child's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever","review":"This book is a heart warming reflection of the relationship between a mother and son and how it begins, develops and changes over time. I was given this book when my son was an infant, he is now seventeen and it is still one of the most treasured books in our home library.

Weird and creepy. Talk about giving a child a complex.I did find myself laughing at the absurdity, but in a sarcastic and shocked way, not a way in which a toddler would or could ever understand.I am not sure how people find this book sentimental...If you want a sweet story for your baby, I prefer the bookGuess How Much I Love You.

But then I read it. What a horrible book. All I could think about is that it would scar him for life with a fear that his parents were going to die. Shortly thereafter, I put it in the garbage. I cannot imagine why anyone would give this book to any child. There must be a million better ways to express how much parents love their children. I thought that I was the only one who felt this way and I couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. Fortunately, I see that I am not alone in my distaste for this terrible story.

Because that's what happens in this weird & creepy book. You want to be stalked by your mother into old age? This book is seriously unhealthy. Ick. When I worked at a children's bookstore, we used to hide it from customers and put other alternatives in their hands. Plus, the illustrations are so flat out ugly. This is not about how much parents love their children (which involves letting them grow up), this is about not being able to let go. I think Munsch needs therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy Indeed!","review":"My in-laws were in town when I received this book. We all cried! It's very creepy and way too sad.

I cracked it open for the first time to read to my 6 mo. old son tonight and I am very grateful that he is still to young to understand what was going on. This book is profoundly disturbing, featuring a disgustingly codependent mother who engages in some extremely creepy behavior. The only thing I find more perplexing and disquieting than this book is the apparent love that so many people have for it. If anything, this book has shown me how NOT to behave as a parent. I can certainly love my child forever without climbing in through his bedroom window when he's an adult!I love books and have never thrown one away. If I don't like one, I donate it or give it to someone who might enjoy it.This is the first book I've ever put straight into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets me every time...","review":"This is by far the most touching, endearing, heart-felt children's book ever. I remember reading it as a child and my mother recently bought a copy for me - and boy did I cry while reading it. Very powerful and emotional, it is a true and delicate take on the cycle of life that only a brilliant writer like Munsch could pull off. Perhaps some may find it harsh, but it's not. The bond between mother and son, child and parent, is expressed with beauty and passion. If you have not shared this book with your child, don't wait. Do yourself and your child a big favor and don't hesitate to feel the incredible talent that is Munsch. This book will mean something to you and your child, and like it did with me, I will bet it stays in your hearts forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"We did not like this book, disappointed!","review":"I get what the author is trying to show in this book (unconditional love that you have for your child is endless and no matter how old they are) but I did find it a bit odd that when the child is around nine and then a teenager and then he is a man and moves out and the mom still goes to his house, physically picks him up when he is sleeping and sings that lullaby. Then when she is too old the man holds the mom and sings the lullaby. In my own opinion, I believe that the author went to an extreme to show a mom's love for her child. I have to say I feel it was a little creepy too. My children ages 4 and 2 don't really seem impressed with the book at all. They do not request it at bedtime or any other time for that matter. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Creepy","review":"This book is super creepy and weird. The mother sneaks into her adult son's bead and cradles him in her arms?

Why in the world would I want to burden a small child with thoughts of having to comfort her dying mother.I haven't thrown the book in the trash because my friend gave it to me...but my instincts tell me I should.I am amazed that others like the book and wonder how they find it suitable for youngsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"I was astonished to discover that people see this wonderful book as being about stalkers, incestuous relationships, guilt, etc., etc. NOW I know who comes up with the subjects for vile talk shows - and who watches them.Get a grip, people. This is a book about the deep, unceasing love that parents have for their children, and which they pass on through the family. Love creates love. It takes it to absurd lengths to make a point. If you're taking it literally, you seriously need psychiatric help; or maybe you've never loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird isn't the word for it","review":"I work at a children's book club and I am stunned. This is the oddest book I have ever read. I agree with a lot of the other reviewers...there is something perverse and very strange about the relationship in this book! Some people grew misty-eyed at Patch Adams, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"sob sob","review":"Who wouldn't want this book in their library. It brings tears of joy. Love this book. Every parent should receive this as a gift on the birth of their child, to keep and use as a reminder of our own aging parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book wonderful format not","review":"the story is great, but the paperback is cheap like something you might print off your home computer. I guess for the price is okay but not what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good children's book","review":"This book has been my favorite since I was a kid now my kids read it to me. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love you forever","review":"This is a great book. I have given several copies of this book to new mommies. The downside is I made the mistake of going to the authors website and listened to his reading of the story. It sounds like he is reading the funny pages. Maybe that was his intent, for it to be funny, not a sentimental one. I like the sentimental sounding version."},{"rating":"2","title":"For mothers of sons . . .","review":"Mothers of daughters say, \\"It's nice.\\" Mothers of sons are sobbing at the end! A very, very touching book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever Review","review":"This book had a lot of meaning in that it showed that the relationship between a mother and her son could go a long way. It proved to me that many times a son or daughter may not appear to be affectionate but still listen when they do not appear to be. As we found out, the son knew the words to the song and used them with his newly born daughter. Love You Forever it a heart riviting, warm story that a mother and father could share with their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal of Parental Love","review":"This is a beautiful book showing how the relationship between a parent and a child should be. Unconditional love is not present in enough families, but maybe if more people read this book, they'll be reminded of how it should be. I hope kids who read this will realize the love their parents have, but maybe they don't see because they're focused on other things. And I hope parents will be reminded of what they wanted from their own parents and how they planned things to be when they first had their child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever","review":"I would highly recommend this book. I think that this book is a great story that reminds you about the people you truly love and care about. However, as you get older, sometimes you are so busy that the person you love and care for are people you take for granted. This book reminds you that the people you love will always be there for you. This also reminds you that the people who care and love you will need you sometime, too. I would recommend this to a student of mine who is being raised by his aunt. He still communicates with his mother, but he considers his aunt his mom. I think he would enjoy this book because he loves his biological mom very much and appreciates and loves his aunt. This book is comparable to Over the Moon because Over the Moon is about a parent and how much she loves her daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You, Forever","review":"This book is a classic and a must have for all home libraries. It is a great gift for the new mom, parents of toddlers, or even a gift for your own mom or grandmom. Robert N. Munsch goes full circle with this book. Try it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Too Depressing for a Child","review":"While this book has a \\"sweet\\" premise of the circle of life, I think it is a book for an adult written as if it were a children's book. I was balling by the end of it. It is very depressing to see the man rock his dying mother. Our son was given this book as a gift and I will not keep it in his library. I think that if I actually read it to him, it would make him depressed and would conjure up ideas of his parents mortality long before he needs to think about that. I especially would not read this to a child before bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book (Love you forever)","review":"Enjoy reading the book to my grandsons. Must admit I skip the part when the little boy flushes his mothers watch down the toilet. Don't want to give them any ideas. Hehe"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 15 year old girl's perspective.","review":"I adore this book! My mom read it to me all the time when I was little. This is a wholesome book that sends a message of love, not death to a child. I'm sure there are a handful of children who focus on the ending, but not many. And the adults who focus on the ending are obviously unable to handle the concept of death. This book doesn't send a message of incest or inappropriate interaction between a mother and child. It tells the story of a loving relationship between a mother and son that lasts beyond the realm of childhood. In fact, when I have children of my own, I will buy my own copy (perhaps sooner) and read it to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever","review":"I loved the story. The predictable language is great for young children and the story is heart warming for adults. It presents the reader to the worse case scenarios of stages parents go through with their children and counter acts them with love. It's a great message to send to our young children. All too often parents do not express their love to their children as verbally as maybe they should. This story shows in an exaggerated and even unrealistic way how a mother tells her son that she loves him. Thus this book is a great introduction to the word \\"I love you\\" towards our children if it is not a word being used at home. After reading this book parents can talk to their children about not being sneaky about saying \\"I love you\\" and that despite the mistakes they do we will always love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me cry cuz it frightened me so!","review":"My friend gave me this book when my daughter was born. She said she cried every time she read it to her girls. I anxiously sat down and read it that night. I was stunned at how much I abhorred this book. A mother crawling into her son's room, climbing into his window when he's an adult... too much! It gives me the creeps just thinking about the story and the picture of him cradling her in his arms in the end. Creepy, creepy, creepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree - this book is creepy","review":"I bought this for my cousin's newborn by glancing at the top books - bought this, along with good night moon, where the wild things are, etc. I had never heard of this book, whereas the others I remember from my own childhood. Well, when I thumbed through this one, I thought the ending was super creepy. Why would the mom sneak back into her son's house, and I didn't expect to see in a book the son cradling an elderly mother. Surely a book that will lead to some psychotherapy in later life! I get the sentiment, but I suggest you look at the last few pages before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"creepy and sad","review":"Creepy I agree with all the bad reviews. The mother is sneaking in the older boy's room and then adult's house??!! Should've kept it a baby theme since it is meant for them. Also \\"as long as I'm alive\\" not only makes it obviously implied that the mom dies in the end, but what happened to always watching over your kids even when you are not alive- which would be too mature and still sad of a theme for a young childrens' book-- which brings me to- why even add \\"as long as I'm alive???????\\" How do I explain that to my kid? I think I will stick to \\"mommy and me,\\" \\"daddy and me\\", \\"mommy hugs\\" and \\"daddy hugs\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst children's book ever","review":"I have lots and lots of childrens books but this one is by far the worst. Its a good concept, but the illustration and story of the concept that parents too get old and need care is horrendous. How about easing the little ones into the reality of life?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mother's Love","review":"This story is a wonderful example of a mother's love for her children. Watching a child grow up and mature into an adult only deepens the love a mother feels. Ask almost any mother of any grown man and she will tell you that, that grown man is still her baby. There is a bond between mothers and their children that can't be broken. This book deals with that. There is also a bond fathers have with their children, and in the end when the tradition goes on and is passed on to his own daughter, the circle grows.As a parent, I choke up reading this book to my toddler. What's more this is one book I want him to appreciate through out the years and share with his own children someday.There is a bit of silliness in the fact that she still rocks her grown son, but it is still a children's book and I think it's appealing to their sense of humor at that point. The overall theme and emotions are A+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, This Book is Rather Creepy","review":"Something just seems rather disturbing about a woman who continually crawls into bed with her son throughout his childhood, to the point where she drives with a ladder to his house, when he's an adult, to stare at him while he's sleeping. Some people treat this book like it's the best kids book of all time, but there's just something bizarre about it. I think you can send the message that you'll love your kids forever, no matter what, without sneaking in to their bedroom as adults and watching them sleep. Creepy! I have 2 kids, and they both yawn with this book, too.Aside from the cryptic message of this tale, it's rather poorly written as well. The song repeated through the book doesn't even flow well or rhyme."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Love You Forever","review":"I Love this book. I bought this book for a cousin's baby shower. We were to share a favorite book from our children's babyhood with the new baby coming. I will definitely give each of my children this book when they have their own children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhhh","review":"I didn't love this book. I find it a little odd, the mother carrying around a grown man??? Maybe after a few readings I'll like it better but the overall theme of the book was a little much for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, Loving Book","review":"This is NOT a sad book, but very touching. It brought my Mother and I to tears the first time we read it 20+ years ago. Because we were shopping two hours from home, my dad refused to let us have it in the car for the drive back - he put it in the trunk so we would stop looking at it and crying! My son was very young at the time and I bought it for him. He is 27 years old and still remembers the book today. He will surely buy it for his children some day!It is poignant without being heavy. My Mom just recently bought this book for my 50-yr-old brother's birthday gift. It brought that strong blue-collared man to tears too! It says so much in so few pages. A child's book, yes, but for adults also. Every household should have this book!People who tagged this book negatively (stalking, odd, depression, mentally ill) must have truly lost touch with their emotions . . . I find nothing negative between its pages! Maybe it's my upbringing, but I have never been afraid to show emotion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids still love it!","review":"I bought this book 16 years ago (my I'm getting old!) for my first son. He thought it was so funny that the boy was flushing the watch down the toilet.My youngest child is 10 now and she still adores this book and reads it to her baby cousins. To this day the ending makes me cry though as he sings to his own child and the circle completes.The images are perfect as they portray the mischief that children get into and that regardless a parent's love is still there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best children's book for adults ever","review":"This book has touched me more than any. My youngest son is 11 and I still own this book. I cry every time I read it. It is the sweetest book ever. The bad reviews below are synical people without a heart. How someone could find this mother/son love creepy is beyond me.An extremely special book.

It brought the room to tears. I still can't read it to my son without crying and laughing. It is not a literal book that as a mom you will climb into your adult son's bedroom and rock him to sleep. It is a metaphor of how you will always be in your child's heart and the child in your heart. Those who think this is creepy are being too literal and not giving children and children's books credit for the depth they are written at. This is a beautiful simple story about love and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite childrens book!","review":"An absolutely beautiful story of a parents unconditional and undying love for a child.

I could SO relate to the mother in the book. Tender and humorous at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for children and parents alike","review":"I first heard this book used in our children's church. It kept a large group of children, ages four to ten, focused on the story and the pictures. Many of the adults in the church that day were similarily attentive. Excellent story. It left all with a timeless lesson. I have now sent to my sons to read to their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A loving book that I grew up with","review":"I grew up with my Mom reading my this book.

This is the creepiest children's book I have read yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird if you're an adult but great for a child","review":"My kids (now 3 and 5)loved this book. I laughed out loud when I read a review saying this book was strange and creepy. (The mother driving across town in the middle of the night with a ladder tied to her car has to be the creepiest part). After I first read this book, those were my sentiments exactly. However, this book is written for children and through the eyes of a child, it shows the never-ending love a mother has for her son or daughter. This book would be best purchased for kids 5 and under. After 6, I think they might think the mother in this book a bit odd."},{"rating":"2","title":"love you forever","review":"This book was a really good book because it showed the love of a mother for her son, and later on the love of a son for his mother. I liked it because it shows the special relatinnship between a mother and son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst children's book ever","review":"I have to say I agree with the prev. poster; this is just awful. Can you say \\"Norman Bates,\\" people? Mom crawling on the floor to get into the kid's room? Weird.The idea of the decrepit old mom being rocked to sleep by the grown man was so profoundly creepy I don't know where to begin. I'm surprised the next page wasn't Mom in a casket. *shudder*Yes; these are some wonderful themes of acceptance, stages of life, etc FOR ADULTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very Creepy","review":"I didn't read the reviews, and thought this book (since it's always so highly recommended)involved a mother simply rocking her baby to sleep, then singing the song to him as he got older. Instead she is sneaking into his room, then into his house (through a window) to continue to rock him- I found the book disturbing and not something I wanted to read to my daughter-- I don't think it is ok to sneak into your adult child's room, let alone break into their house, and don't find anything endearing or sweet about those actions. The song was cute, I wish the storyline was less disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read the reviews before ordering!","review":"A friend highly recommended this book which she read to her children when they were little. I decided to order it to put in a gift basket for a coworker who is having her first baby. Fortunately, I read through the book when it arrived--it won't be going in the gift basket! It is a weird, creepy, bizarre, strange story! I might add that the friend who recommended this book has grown children (late 20's) who are still living with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird and Creepy","review":"I liked the story up until the part where the mother goes across town, climbs through her adult son's bedroom window, and rocks him while singing. Then we have the next section of the story where the son has to rock her because she is too old, frail and possibly dying. Who wants to read something like that to their child as a bedtime story?My husband thinks it's a sweet book. I think it's strange. Therefore it is not allowed to be read in this house again.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for the picture book set!","review":"I reviewed and purchased children's books in a professional capacity for many years, and was actually shocked when I read this book. Other reviewers have mentioned the mother crawling in her grown-up son's bedroom window at night. Shudder. And yes! to the psychologist who mentioned this book models very poor relationships. It is also maudlin and sentimental, which could be forgiven. (In the biz we used to call guilty pleasures \\"a good read\\".) But I'm quite sure that many if not most children would find this frightening. I found it disturbing. But that's okay: I'm not 3 and likely to be scarred for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every mom with a son needs this book","review":"I've been reading this book to my son at bedtime for 3 years (he's 4 now). I've known about it for many years before I became a mother and I get choked up every time I read it to this day. My son actually chooses this one often. He identifies with the boy in the story, and is starting to understand that he's growing like the boy and will eventually become a man with his own family to love and care for. He wants his own son.:) Very sweet and endearing book.And for those who've labeled the book creepy, and I know which part they're referring to, sadly those folks have missed the most important point of the story: it's a figurative illustration of a literal love that will last no matter how old your son is. I'm certain the author did not mean for the \\"drive across town\\" part to be taken literally - give me a break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a fan...","review":"Hmmm...after hearing so much buzz about this book I purchased it for our home library. After reading it once it promptly found itself back on the shelf...I was not such a fan. It has a very sweet and tender message but I could not get past some of the subject matter. It was not exactly appropriate bedtime reading for my 3.5 year olds. I did a full review of this book on my website [...]. Feel free to check it out and leave some feedback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audience in tears!","review":"I read this book for our library read-a-thon last year. I made up a tune to the words \\"Love you forever, like you for always...\\" As I read the book outloud to my audience I sang the song each time it appeared in the text. By the end of my reading there wasn't a dry eye in the house. Everyone was so moved by this touching little story! A great book to read aloud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book for mothers - not kids","review":"This book was given to me as a shower gift by someone who really loved it and said her kids loved it.Never read this when you are pregnant and overly emotional anyway.In my opinion, it is designed more to pull on the heart strings of mothers than to appeal to children in any way. Fifteen month later, I still can't read this book without tears but I can't ever see myself reading it to my child. I would not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy!","review":"Even though it's come to my attention that the author meant this as a joke, I still couldn't help but get the creeps reading this. His 80 year old mother climbs into his bedroom and rocks her 40 year old son to sleep was...well...disturbing. I'm in the minority on this one, however. Most people find the book touching and tear-jerking so I'll just stop right here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for adult fans, not young children","review":"I can understand a lot of the positive comments about this book. This book is a real tear jerker if you are an adult, especially if you are awash in post-pregnancy hormones, missing your own deceased parent, or regretting that your baby is going to grow up and leave home one day. Buy it for *yourself* if you love it. HOWEVER: As a Ph.D. psychologist, I have to warn that you can expect this book to be very anxiety-provoking for many if not most young children. I am surprised that it was published/marketed for young kids. Children simply don't think like adults, period. Children think very literally. Most very young children also have no concept of death, aging, or the realistic passage of time. Read it to little kids only if you want them to have nightmares that involve you dying and leaving them to fend for themselves in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCARY!","review":"We recieved this as a gift for my daughter. At first, I thought it was a sweet story. That was until I got to the end of the book and the mother is going across town to break into her grown son's home to hug him while he sleeps. What was this author thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids book or screenplay for a really sick slasher movie","review":"I read this story and thought it was some sick joke. What kind of parent stalks their kid through out life? You seriously could make this into a really creepy psycho thriller. Read this book to your kid and (s)he'll learn to throw your watch in the toilet, you may sell him to the zoo, pull food out of a refrigerator, say bad words --Oh yeah there's also an image of a kid playing in a toilet. Read that to a three-year-old and see what (s)he'll pick up.Now the premise is touching --your parent will love you forever. Now hopefully that love will not cross boundaries that include breaking and entering and stalking.I seriously am surprised by the positive attention given to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever","review":"This book was amazing! I'm giving it to my Dad for helping me through college! Great gift for parents and children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't think this book is strange, I feel for your children.","review":"My parents got this book for us when we had our first child. Honestly, the first half isn't all that bad, but when the son becomes a teenager, it begins to get a little strange. Understand this, my son is three, and I hold him and tell him I love him at least once a day. However, do I plan to drive across town when he has his own house, climb into his window, and hold him while he's sleeping? NO! What in the world!Obviously there are lots of opposing views for this book, but I would encourage anyone considering this book, to find a store and read it in its entirety before purchasing.If possible, I personally would have given the first half of the book 3 stars, and the second half 0 stars. Unfortunately it's not possible, and being that it's not the worst book I've ever read, I settled for two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh!","review":"This book really gives me the creeps. We received a copy as gift and I gave it away. I know it's very popular, more so with adults than children, but I think you either love it or hate it. I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarro bedtime reading","review":"This book is equal parts maudlin and creepy. Neither of those characteristics bode well for a children's bedtime story. I suppose that for young children who don't really understand it, and only really want to be held and hear a parent's voice, the quality of the book itself doesn't matter. But in which case, you still don't need to buy this book. Pick up something nice by Shel Silverstein, Margaret Wise Brown, Eric Carle or Sandra Boynton instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very touching, but be prepared to shed a tear","review":"I ran across this in my local bookstore. I don't know why I picked it up because I haven't any children, but as I read the pages I realized that I had to purchase it for my father. You see, Father's Day was coming up and I am his only daughter. The story of the book really illustrates the circle of love ... and this theme fit so very well for my grandmother, father, and me.Well, I won't give the ending away, but know that he loved the book! He, my mother, and I sat around and cried as he read aloud from the book. It is really a very simple, but beautiful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever","review":"As a mother of two teenaged sons who will be grown and gone in the twinkle of an eye, I have always loved this book. It is not incestuous in the least and I worry about someone who thinks this way. I don't understand how a mother who has given birth, held, cared for, raised, shared all the joys, disappointments, and accomplishments of one's sons growing to adulthood can even see it in that way. No matter how old or big my sons get, I will never lose the memory of them being my babies and how they were then. Neither my husband nor I can read this book or a couple of our favorites we read to them as children without getting tears in our eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"I loved this book, my kids loved this book and my husband even liked this book. I cried when I read it the first couple of times, my husband cried too when he read it the first time. Very wonderful book about a parents love for her child. I would recommend this book to any one wanting a good book to read to their child at bedtime or any time of the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sweet, very real, so sincere","review":"This book had moments where I thought, \\"should I read this part\\" just about a bad behavior the boy did, but you quickly pick up on the unconditional love expressed in the book and that is the focal point. It goes through the love between both, and my son actually said to me a few days later..after I told him how some day I may not be able to hold him anymore, he said, \\"then I will hold you!\\" I melted!Sweet book, I just changed the one word from \\"like\\" to \\"love\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should have this book.","review":"My brother bought me this book when my daughter was born. It is one of my (and her) all time favorites. It still makes me cry to read it. I buy it for everyone I know who has a baby and everyone loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love you forever","review":"Love you foreveris an awesome book. It talks about a mother who watchs her son grow up and move out. It has a life long journey of how a mother sees her son become a man and have his own family. It has an enjoyment for the whole family. I liked this book because it is a funny story but has a morale too. I would recommend this book to parents who have newborn children. If you compare this story to another childrens book, it would get the best rated. This book brings a warm felling to all who read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still brings tears to my eyes.","review":"This was the first book I bought after the birth of my son. I absolutely love it and it brings tears to my eyes every time I read it. My son is now a teenager and he, too, is very touched by it.

It's a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I loved this book when I was a child and just had to get a new copy for my son!

I love it and give it to every child I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for those who value the emotional bond between a child and parent.","review":"This book is not for those who looks for negatives. Yes, the book is extreme and weird. However, it does describe the emotional bond between a parent and a child, uncontrollable. The seller got it to me with a protecting cardboard to avoid bending. I got the paperback edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes you cry so much, onions are jealous","review":"This is an amazing book. I cannot get through it without bawling like a baby.I have a 4 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. My daughter and now my son for that matter do not like being called a baby any more. I just tell them that no matter how big they get that they will always be my babies. They don't yet understand that the emphasis is on the word \\"my\\" not \\"babies\\".This book depicts a parent who understands her role in life: Pour your love into your child at whatever stage of life they are in.I really love Sheila McGraws's illustration. They add poignancy to Robert Munch's saga.I disagree with putting the toilet picture on the cover, though. The book is not really about the antics of the child it is about the love of the mother. If I were the decision maker (which of course I am not), I would put the picture of the mom crawling into her 2 year olds room on the cover. That picture captures the essence of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have Book for Every Child!","review":"This book is a very special book indeed. It is one every parent should read to their child and I defy any parent to get through the reading without getting teary. They are happy tears but it is definitely a book that tugs at your heart. Children appreciate the humor that is definitely targeted to their age level and parents appreciate the sentimental story line. It is a book for both parents and children. I have given this book to new parents to read to their children and they always come back and tell me how special this story is. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears","review":"As many times as I've read this it still makes me cry.

When I read the book to my 2 1/2 year old, I felt weird. First of all, the mother has a habit of 'crawling' across the bedroom floor to get to her son in the middle of the night while he's sleeping--as a baby that's fine, but when he's a grown man? And, to be rocking a grown man in his sleep??? And then, the son, now a grown man, rocks his aged mother in his arms as well. I can't do justice to how creepy I found the book. After reading it, my son pleaded with me not to read it anymore and said he found the mother in the book \\"SCARY!\\" So, I'm returning my book and the extra copy I had gotten, thinking I would keep it and give it as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever heard of THE YELLOW WALLPAPER?","review":"I'm a collector of children's books and it's pretty hard to disappoint me in this genre. But whoa, did LOVE YOU FOREVER disappoint and totally freak me out. The mother in the story must not have any family or friends that realize she needs a mental evaluation. It reminds me of the character in The Yellow Wallpaper, who loses her mind at night in a mentally ill state. Also, the illustrations are dreary and depressing, as if to help the sick little story along.LOVE YOU FOREVER gives me an uneasy feeling and a children's book should not do that. If you want to read a beautiful children's book about loving your child try 'I Love You As Much...' by Laura Krauss Melmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me. . .","review":"This book wasn't for me. . .depressed me actually.

Rather, it is a story to tell to your grandchild about how you loved their mother or dad unconditionally. The mom tells her child in a little song how she \\"Will love him forever\\" until the tables turn and her manchild has to love his mother FOREVER. I gave this book to a new grandmother for a shower present; I read it to the group and there wasn't a dry eye amongst us. It was WONDERFUL!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little odd...","review":"This story is a little odd and disturbing...the thought of the mother coming into the son's room as an adult and \\"holding him\\". It's just awkwardly written. The overall message of never ending love is understood but the author's clumsy and repetitive delivery is unbearable. A better choice: I Love You This Much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...","review":"I'm a pediatric nurse, and just came across this book on the job. I had no idea there was controversy! I was prepping a three year old for spinal surgery, and her parents were reading it to her. She seemed to like it and be comforted by it (though, to be fair, she WAS flying high on Versed at the time).Me? I was kinda squicked. Maybe I'm too midwestern for this book, or something. The mom? Creeping on her belly to the teenager's bed? Yeah. That.Two stars because the kid seemed to like it, and I guess that is the important thing. They were a very nice family, not weirdos at all, and were so happy to show the book to me...is it perhaps like a cult, and they were drawing me in?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Mom to Hate this book","review":"I find this book a tad bit freakish. Yes it starts out sweet but when your kid is a teen, adult, old man coming home to sit in your lap and nuzzle up - it's kind of freaky weird. It's toooooo involved between mom and son. And the kid does some rotten things. Plus it puts it in a kids face way to early that your mom is going to up and die one day. I may be the only mom (definately the only one i know) that hates this book. My kids don't like it either. The artwork isn't interesting and the lyrics not so rhythmic. The four copies we were given as gifts I sent right to the resale book store after trying for weeks to like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"This is the weirdest chidren's book I have ever read. I had to throw it away, could not even give it away!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Children's book!","review":"Everyone who thinks this book is creepy is reading into it too much! In fact it's creepy if you think of the actions of a mother hugging her son as \\"unhealthy\\" or \\"incest.\\" This is the problem with our society today. I am a teacher and I read this to my students, they all LOVE it and the parents do too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever","review":"This is an excellent book for any parent, especially a mother of a little (or grown) boy.

This book will touch your heart and showcase the special bond between a mother and child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching story to be loved by young & old","review":"I first heard of this book when my minister read it at one of his services demonstrating the strong love a mother has for her child. When he read it to the congregation, I had tears pouring down my eyes just listening to the words. There is a brief section in the book that has some humor where the child is grown up, and the mother is talking about sneaking into his bedroom of his new house just to \\"rock him back and forth...\\", as she had done when he was little--just a symbol of how she carries him in her heart. I bought it for my 3 1/2 year old who now asks for it to be read every night...and I still fight the tears now and then....this book is very touching and would be enjoyed by adults as well as children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible- leaves you feeling empty","review":"I was unfortunate enough to have this book read to me as a child and every time it left me feeling sad, hopeless, and scared. To an adult with kids it probably seems like a great way to remind their kids that no matter what they're special, but whenever it was read to me it left me with one message: YOU'RE MOMMY IS GONNA DIE ONE DAY!!!!!!!! AND WHEN SHE DOES, YOU'LL COPE WITH IT BY SINGING THE SAME ASSININE LULLABY TO YOUR NEW BABY!!!! The book feels bleak, surrupy, and sad for all involved. Go read kids some Chris Van Allsburg or Berinstein Bears. Stay as far away as humanly possible from this paragon of disillusionment. My 3rd grade teacher read this to me on the first day of 3rd grade. I hated 3rd grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy & sad","review":"Sad, scary, creepy. I can't believe it's so popular and that everybody doesn't have a problem with this dysfunctional mother/child relationship. The mother's actions are inappropriate and invasive and it is not surprising that once her son has reached adulthood, he has a child but, seems not to have a wife. Spooky drawings of the mother crawling around, too. Lastly, it's sad when the adoring mother is too old & sick to stalk her son. Overall, one of the wierdest & worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imagine what Freud would say!!","review":"Sorry, folks, but there are better ways to tell your children that they are loved!! I could accept the little song, but even my boys thought that Mummy's climbing into her son's room at night with a ladder was WAY weird. I bet Freud would have a hay day with this one! I got a good chuckle just thinking about it. As for the book--we will never read it again at our house. Instead, I think I will just give my kids a big hug and kiss every night and say, \\"I love you\\" before I turn off the light and close their bedroom doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, this book is going in the trash","review":"I've read many of the other reviews and I am shocked at the positive comments. The first time I read this to my son it creeped me out. The idea of the mother sneaking into her grown son's house at night...through a window! The illustration of the car with the ladder on top driving over in the middle of the night. If she hadn't crawled around the floor, or maybe if she sang the song to her grown son while she was just over visiting, or maybe if she just stroked his hair rather than picking him up bodily. I'm all for unconditional love...but yikes. This is going into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"I have to agree with the \\"creepy\\" crowd. I really love my sons, but if I ever drive across town in the middle of the night and climb in their window, someone stage an intervention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I know many people love this book, but I am definitely not one of them. I almost like the sing-song refrain (\\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always...\\"), but when I read this book, I can't help thinking the mother should be institutionalized. Crawling across her son's floor? Stalking her adult son? Really! And even that refrain, \\"as long as I'm living my baby you'll be\\"--isn't she supposed to raise her son to be an adult, not her \\"baby\\"? I read this book to my son a few times, but it has since been put away. It gives me the creeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this book so polarizing?","review":"Somebody should write an essay on why this book draws such extreme reactions, pro and con, from adult readers. When my daughter was born, three different people (all of whom I respect) gave me the book and raved about it, as did other parents I know. I thought both the text and illustrations were mawkish, plus it left me feeling a bit queasy, so I never read it to my child. Given its wide acclaim, I figured there was something wrong with me until my daughter's first Nanny (the best since Mary Poppins) said it gave her the creeps too. My question is, why are there no in-between reactions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for adults caring for a parent","review":"I sent this book to a friend who has been caring for her mother, aged 98.She enjoyed it, and shared with her brother, saying it meant more to them as adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love You Forever","review":"Love You Forever is a pretty good book. You can understand it quite well, because it is is just telling how a boy grew up and something bad happens along the lines. This book has lots of feelings on how a family member's loss is affected. The mother always looks out, going to a room and sings to him. I recommend this book to parents that have a newborn or is getting one. I would compare this book to something good and this is better than that book. That is my review and I hope you like it.Thank You!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If Satan wrote childrens books...","review":"I happened to read this story one day at the store while Christmas shopping. Holy cow! What a G.D.mess this one is!!! This story honestly and literally gave me a really disturbed feeling. And I'm a 31 year old grown man. The cover looks innocent enough like any other kids book. But once inside, you find out just how bizarre and creepy this book really is. Just really, really weird. Disturbing would be the best word to describe it. I would NOT recommend this book to ANYONE, children OR adults, unless you hate them and want them to have nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"distressing to children","review":"I do not like this book. Don't hate it, but I don't like it, either. This is my mother's favorite children's book, and I vividly recall her reading it to me for the first time when I was 3 years old. It was very distressing because I didn't want to think about my mother dying AND because my mom always cried when she read it- didn't like that, either! My older brother felt the same way. Young kids aren't good at differentiating between sad tears and happy/emotional tears. Every once in a while I would let her read it because I knew she liked it, but I did not at all. Do you really want your child to feel like they have to submit to something that distresses them just because they want to make you happy? Also now that I'm adult, I too find the whole \\"creeping into adult son's bed\\" disturbing. I didn't pick up on that as a child (and I doubt most children would), but it's the final nail in the coffin for this book in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"CREEPY","review":"I really have to agree with the other reviewers who deemed this book as creepy and a little bit frightening. In all honesty, I cannot imagine why this book was even published! Even more, why? WHY? WHY???? do readers not see that an old woman driving to her adult son's home with a LADDER on the roof of her car so that she can CLIMB INTO HIS BEDROOM WINDOW in the middle of the night to cradle him and watch him sleep isn't really weird (not to mention physically impossible)? It makes me wonder whether this was actually a joke which was mistaken for something serious, like the song \\"The Leader of the Pack,\\" or the radio broadcast of \\"The War of the Worlds.\\" Anyone have info about this theory? I received this book as a gift by a well-meaning grandmother, but if went into the trash bin after the first reading. Please spend your money on something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"got it as a gift -- am throwing it away","review":"My initial reaction to reading this book, the night of my baby shower, is 'what were they THINKING???' -- both the author and my girlfriend who gave this to me. There are other ways to show your love as a mother to your grown child rather than driving across town, using a LADDER no less to then SNEAK into your grown son's window to then rock him and sing to him. I'm sorry folks, but those of you who say this is okay are fooling yourselves. This is inappropriate, to say the very least, and doesn't belong in a children's book. The concept could have easily been presented in another manner and the book's message remain intact. Additionally, I dare to say that the issue of a parent's death is definitely not one I'd like to present to my daughter before bedtime. I disliked this book so much it went into the trash. There's too many wonderful children's books out there that present parents' unconditional love for their children without this weirdness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this very disturbing book.","review":"This book is bizarre. My wife and I heard about it at a birth class. It was recommended in connection with sibling issues. So we bought it, sight unseen. However, instead of dealing with the problems a young child might face when a new baby comes along, this book is about the weird love of a mother for her son. She may love him, but she can't tell him. She can only sneak into his room at night and rock him while saying the verse that's repeated over and over in the book. Sound innocent? She crawls into his room when he's a teenager and climbs a ladder into his bedroom when he's a grown man gone from home. This is weird behavior. The book should be called \\"My Eternal, Obsessive, Creepy Love.\\" Avoid this very disturbing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a picture of a codependent relationship, get this book","review":"I understand what the author is attempting to say, but this book is not silly or cute about the way the mother can't let go of the infantilization of her son. Max Lucado's \\"In Case You Ever Wonder\\" does a far better job of talking about the cherished relationship between parent and child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy!","review":"This book is extremely creepy! The old woman crawling through the bedroom window and over her grown son's body sleeping in his twin bed and then picking him up to rock him while he's still asleep...GROSS! Needless to say, the copy I had was thrown in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Mom Sneaks into Married Son's Bedroom!","review":"The title of this book and its cover illustration compelled me to buy it for my sons, and I was very happy with it for the first several pages. But when a woman in her, say 60s, drives across town in the middle of the night with a ladder on her car, climbs the ladder UP INTO HER SLEEPING ADULT SON'S BEDROOM, to hold him in her arms....it completely weirded me out!I mean, they could have shown him in a hospital bed after knee surgery or something if the author wanted to show that your mom will still nurture you as an adult. Why a BED has to be involved, I don't know. And why didn't she have a key to her son's house??? She is a nut, that's why. Strange...I have never thrown away a book in my life, but did with that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unconditional love lasts a lifetime","review":"Reading this book makes you realize that someone was able to put into words and pictures just how deeply the love for your children goes. My son loves to hear the mother whispering sweet nothings to her son while rocking him and loving him at every stage of his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it before buying!","review":"I bought this book because I heard it was so touching and about a mom and her little boy. I read it when I got home and went right back to return it! It was terrible.. weird... creapy...bizzare ... the whole bit! Check out \\"Guess how much I love you\\" about the two bunnies instead. I read that one every night to my 4 month old. I cried the first time I read it. It is a great, short read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I wanted to like this book, I did, but seriously, it bugs me. I know everyone else says we're over-thinking it but I'm creeped out by an old woman rocking a grown man in his sleep. And if I'm creeped out, then I'm not reading it to my child.I would also like to add that my 6-year-old niece asked my mother not to read this to her anymore because it made her sad. Then she asked about death. So this seals the deal for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy.","review":"I'm sorry, but I have to share that I think this is the creepiest kid's book I have ever read. It was given to me by a good lovely friend who cries when she reads this, so obviously everyone is different but I really think that the sentimentality in this book borders on bizarre in a very uncomfortable way. I have other Munsch books and they do not capture my child's attention either but this one is the worst. A mother who sneaks into her kid's room to recite her desperate litany/ then again as he is a teen/ again when he is living on his own and then he comes to her as she dies and then starts the cycle over with his child - almost sounds charming - but isn't. I think it is the ladder that gets me."},{"rating":"1","title":"CREEPY!","review":"I bought this book because I thought of it as a 'classic' and I remembered the refrain, \\"I love you forever. I like you for always. As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.\\", which is really sweet.When I read it, however, I was really creeped out from the point where the son is a teenager and the mom is still sneaking in his room and rocking him, onward. When she drives across town and sneaks in her grown son's window, well, that is just WAY over the top.Imagine if you (as a wife) woke up and your mother-in-law was in your bedroom holding your husband and singing to him -- that's stuff of psycho-thriller movies.Also, I don't really want my preschool age son thinking about me getting old and senile one day and him having to take care of me. That subject matter is just too heavy for him at his age, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not all that good","review":"Sorry guys, I just don't think this book is very good. I'm not sure that I can agree with the \\"incest\\" angle that some reviewers have taken, I just didn't enjoy it. FOr one thing, it's sappy. It plays on too many stereotypes. AND every woman I know has gotten at least one or two copies at their babyshower. For my money? Buy Owl Babies instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Book I've Ever Thrown Out","review":"This is the only book I've ever actually thrown in the trash. Read the reviews to judge for yourself... even the 5-star reviewers rave about how it makes them cry every time they read it. What child needs to see their mother crying all the time? Can't we just let our kids be kids without having to lay on the heavy-duty stuff? Making them think of the time when their mother will lay dying? There are better, happy ways to convey what love is without laying on the concern and guilt that this book brings. Read it for yourself if you need your own reminder about what love is... in my opinion, children don't need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"People who think this book is \\"creepy\\" are thinking about it too hard. Yes, in REAL LIFE, a mother driving to her son's house and climbing up a ladder and through his window is stalker-ish. But this is a CHILDREN's book and it's supposed to be slightly exaggerated and silly. Over the top? maybe... but there's a reason for it. It's exaggerated so even young children can understand it. If anything, it's funny, not creepy.Anyway, I remember reading this book when I was younger and loving it. I read it again today and I cried. It's a great book.

I like the book a lot it represents that no matter how old children get or how they act like when they are 2 years old and throw stuff all over the place or make a mess of everything. Their parents still love them and that some day the children will show their appreciation and love back. It also shows how some songs or traditions are passed on because at the end the son goes and sings the song to his son.

It starts off cute with a mother rocking her baby to sleep, and again when he's two, and again when he's 9.... Then a teenager. The most disturbing part was when the son grew up and moved out, and the mother drove to his house in the middle of the night and snuck in through his window and rocked this grown man while in his bed. This is very weird to me. Not at all what I was expecting and I plan to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have heeded the warnings of the 1 star reviewers!","review":"I bought this book hoping for a lovely tale of how a mother loves her child, well, forever.What I got was a weird, creepy story about a mom who can't let go.As I read through it for the 1 and only time I realized I hated this book. First, it didn't rhyme--and I like books that rhyme or have sing-songy verse. There was too much reading per page for my young children. Worst was the fact that this mom crept into her son's room while he was sleeping(even as a teenager and stalked him down at his house as a grown man) to hold him (as in picks him up) and repeats the same flat verse...\\"I love you forever, I'll like you for always (what does that mean?), As long as I'm living, My baby you'll be.\\"At the end of the book my 5yr old suggested we throw it out the window.I thought about it.But...we will donate it to anyone who'll take it.A much better book to get would be, \\"I love you through and through\\".

My children loved the book when they were little and I know they will continue loving it and love sharing it with their own families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes One Misty Eyed","review":"I realize that not everyone will like this book regardless of age, but that can be said about anything. I thought the story was lovely - a mother telling her son all throughout his life that she will always love him forever.

When advanced age and infirmity prevent her from doing this, then the son takes over the role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is a good book but the ending- you had better get a box of tissues- this is about the real \\"Circle of life\\" and how we take care of our children, and then how our children take \\"care\\" of us.Very moving and emotional."},{"rating":"1","title":"....got creepy at the end!","review":"I heard about this book through a friend and even saw it being read on an episode of 'Friends'.

After opening and reading it during a quiet moment while there, I was caught between laughter and horror (though I kept both reactions to myself) and quietly questioning the sanity of the person who gave it to us. When we got home, I shared this book with my husband, and then friends, who all had the exact same reaction. A very odd, disturbing tale of a mother who starts off fairly normal but slowly becomes the stalker of her own growing son (perhaps she was always doing this but ran out of outside targets? Hey, on that note, it never actually does mention what happened to the father...). I am at a loss as to how readers, and so many, are giving 5 stars to this paranoid, stifling tale but hey, to each his own? All I can say is that the day I find my MIL (a nice, sane lady BTW) climbing in our bedroom window to rock and cradle her son is the day I run off to call 911."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calling Mr. Freud!","review":"I purchased this book for my sons after having read the first few pages. The beginning is achingly sweet. Upon our arrival home, my wife got out the book to read to our two-year-old. The book gets strange fast. We found ourselves struggling not to react negatively when \\"Mommy\\" is shown driving across town in the dead of night with a ladder on the roof of her station wagon. Her intent? A little nocturnal Breaking and Entering into her now-adult son's home so she can rock him in her arms. Are you kidding me? Eewww. Then we continue on to the part where Mommy is now on Death's door and too weak to sneak around. So naturally, Sonny boy visits his mother to rock her in his arms. You get the impression that she then dies so he goes home to rock his infant daughter. Yikes. What a shame. This book could have been really wonderful. Instead, it went directly into the trash.

The boy grows from a 9-year-old in the 1970s or so to a teenager in the 1950s (soda bottles, a turntable, and a zig-zag sweater) to a man in the 1980s (microwave, computer). Vile and incompetent both in storyline and artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for children","review":"One of the most disturbing children's books I have ever seen. My wife purchased this after rave reviews by people we know. We both came to the same conclusion after reading it; a disturbing story about a compulsive woman that would never be exposed to our child.In my opinion, this book has a high probability of causing long lasting subconscious effects on your child. Please, carefully read and think about the message conveyed before subjecting your young ones to this. I would argue that this book is not appropriate to read to any child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, I threw it in garbage","review":"I got this book as a shower gift, and it looks so sweet. It made me cry in a BAD way, not in a sentimental way. Its weird and basically about the mother getting old and sickly and dying and leaving her son.

I actually threw it in the trash, the first time I have EVER done that with a book. The mom skulking around sneaking into the kid's room was just not right.

Many of my friends who have young children have read it and all think it is wonderful.For me, it synopsizes the depth of love you feel for your child and the ultimate reward you reap from your loved little ones.I only found one drawback. I find it hard to read out loud to my children because I cry while reading it (still!!). My husband said that he thought it was a really sweet story.I agree that some people are reading too much into some of the little touches the author adds. It's just a sweet story.This is a story to read after you've had a tough day with your little ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever","review":"I read this book to my 3 sons as they were growing up.

I thought the crawling on the floor was WEIRD, the picking him up even at 9---WEIRD, the teenage part WEIRDER and when I got to the page with the ladder on the car I stopped reading, read it to myself and then proceeded by skipping those pages to the end where he's with his own daughter. This book is just WEIRD and not appropriate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepiest Book EVER","review":"This book has always been disturbing to me. Talk about not knowing how to let go of your kids. The mother in this book is, frankly, nuts, and the son needs to get a restraining order against her.What does his wife think about the fact that his mom sneaks in his room and rocks him in the middle of the night? Is nobody else disturbed by that image?And the people who think this book is sweet--I fear for your children and the relationships you will have with them as adults. Seriously, I understand, as a parent, how you will cherish your relationship with your kids for the rest of your life. But your relationship HAS to change and mature, otherwise...Well...you'll be like creepy mom. (I will give points for the end where the son loves his mom back, that's kinda sweet...but only if you forget about all the mom-stalking during his adult years.)DO NOT GIVE THIS BOOK TO ANYONE YOU CARE ABOUT.

That should've been a sign, I guess. I read it once to my son, and half way through the story he says: \\"That mother is scary. I don't like her.\\" I agreed 100% with him. It's unnerving and creepy.

If Norman Bates were real, this book would be on his nightstand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"In this story, the mom creeps into her grown son's room and takes him out of bed and holds him?

Between my post partum hormones and the schmaltziness of this, I was a slobbering mess. I will never again read it, as it upset my daughter to see her mama upset. I also agree that this is borderline obsessive/stalkerish and brings helicopter parenting into a new light (no helicopter mom can be as hovering as this one). I understand the sentiment, but think its better for middle America than in the coasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maudlin, skip it","review":"This book was very disappointing, and quite frankly depressing for a new mother. My least favorite part was when the mother told the son you had better get here quick, and the image of him rocking what may be a dying mother was a little too much.

She told him that this was her favorite book to read to him growing up. I read this book and found it to be very disturbing. The mother creeping into the house and crawling through the window and across the floor to rock her grown son in his sleep. He obviously has a wife because he then has a daughter. How would his wife feel about this?? This is not a good story to read to your child. I would find it very unnerving if my mom wanted to read this to me. It is great to love your child unconditionally but not to stalk them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I did not like this book because it was very unrealistic.It also had too many words and we all know that a toddler would not sit through a very long book. Plus is a very emotional subject to read to a kid under the age of seven years old.I would only recommend this book for ages seven and older or if you're going to talk to a child about a relative who is dying or very sick. Personally, I would not buy this book for my three year old but is only my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"My wife and I have three children, all adult now, and throughout their childhood we constantly read to them because we wanted them to be avid readers as we ourselves are. We recently sifted through all of their childhood books, of which there are many. \\"Love You Forever\\" is probably the most memorable of them all. It is an original and profoundly touching narrative, beautifully illustrated, of the permanent and unconditional love of a parent for her or his child. (Those who find \\"creepiness\\" in it are either concrete readers or need therapy for their unresolved personal issues). As her child grows up, it is in her own mind and emotions that she continues to hold and embrace the child she brought into the world, as he and she pass through their respective stages of life. The cycle of life is then completed in the beautiful conclusion that teaches young and not so young about the essence of life. If this book is not in your children's library, then it is incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE YOU FOREVER","review":"This book was a birthday gift for my grandson. I had previously given copies of LOVE YOU FOREVER to my two granddaughters. All three children love this sweet story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent.","review":"Robert Munsch has created several masterpieces, but this one is by far the most memorable one for me. I am fairly new to this, and I think that if I had received it as a new mother, I would have sang the little song to my babies every single night. It turns out, though, that there was no need because we have our own little special something either way! :) Anyway, my youngest daughter has checked this book out from the library periodically since she was in Kindergarten and first came across it. Every single time I read this to my children, I cry. It is a beautiful story of the lasting bond between a parent and their child. And it reminds me both of how quickly time passes, and how precious it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful Book","review":"I bought \\"Love You Forever\\" for my now 8 year old son when he was a baby. It is a beautiful, poignant story that documents the profound bond that exists between mother and child. It ends by completing the circle into the next generation between father and daughter. Everytime I read this book to my son I get choked up -- and that doesn't happen often. I plan to read it to my 18 month old daughter very soon.I was both amazed and flabbergasted at how some view this book. But the world contains all types of people with their own unique ways of thinking. Perhaps people who view this book as warped or perverted are judging the book through their own warped and cynical view of the world. Or maybe some folks just take things very, very literally. At any rate, it's a shame that some just don't get it. Simply put, it's a great children's book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just slightly creepy","review":"The poem sticks with you and so I purchased this book again after having not read it for many years.

I remember him telling me that he thought it was a safe feeling to think that your mother would always love you that way, no matter how old you got or no matter how old she got. It's a beautiful book that I like to give as a baby shower gift.

I read it right there & was teary eyed with a big smile on my face... I came home & ordered a few! It's not just for those with boys, it can apply to girls too. But being a Mom to two boys, it really hit home.. the author starts off with a Mom signing to her newborn boy & then follows him throughout his life, always picking him up signing a certain little poem, even when he is an adult.. it is then the \\"boys\\" turn to hold his sick Mom & the story begins again when he is signing this poem to his baby daughter... for me, I thought of my husband who lost him Mother several years ago.. I think he will appreciate this book also... the story has beautiful meaning & great illustration.... I would highly recommend this book to one & all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"As a librarian I have tolerantly smiled as many teachers at our school rave about this book. Personally, I think it is creepy. The mother climbing into her grown son's window and putting him on her lap and the son, putting his elderly mother on his lap. If the first one happened, most sons would install better locks and an alarm system. You don't see the second one happening at nursing homes. It is demeaning and, well, just creepy and odd. It does not strike me as an expression of love. More like a personality disorder. I love Munsch's humorous stories, i.e., Stephanie's Ponytail. I share them often with my students. But I will pass on this one. The yuck factor is too high for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tear Jerker!","review":"I love this book! I have yet to get through to the very end without choking up - even after 8 months of practice!

The first time, when my wife read it, we both cried less than halfway through the book and couldn't finish it. The second time, I wanted to see if I could make it through the book. I made it further this time, but couldn't finish it either. Good thing our 9 month old doesn't understand what we're reading aloud.Read the other 1-star reviews. They're all pretty accurate. I guess the 5-star reviews aren't wrong either, but do you really want to scar your child and yourself voluntarily?It's not a bad book, actually it's very touching.

Its sweet and made me want to cry, smile and hug my children forever and ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Creepy!","review":"Wow! This is just about the creepiest kid's book I've ever read. It is especially disturbing that it has obviously been produced with such earnestness and sincerity. I especially agree with the other reviewer who stated that there is no middle ground with this book that I've ever heard of. You either LOVE it, or are very creeped out by it...I'm sorry gals, but a mother sneaking into her grown son's house and crawling across the floor in a darkened room sounds more like stalking, than unconditional love.I have read it a few times to my daughter and she likes it good enough. Of course, she is a kid, she likes EVERYTHING I read to her. Seen through her eyes, it is just a story. She doesn't have enough life experience to get creeped out by it like me and my wife do.(shiver...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is weird","review":"I thought this book was VERY strange. I do not like reading books that show kids doing \\"bad behaviors\\", I don't want to give my 3yo any ideas. And although I won't go so far as to say incest, this book did have stalker tendancies.

While I appreciate the unconditional love the mother has for her son, I found it disturbing that she would drive across town and crawl into his window to rock him while he slept, etc. I also found those illustrations bizarre. I don't think it's suitable for a child - what four year old wants to hear about his sick mother? It's more suited to touch the emotions of the reader than the listener. Perhaps an older child (teenager) would appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traumatizing book as a child","review":"Like many of the others, I found this book to be very unsettling as a child.

The artwork is amateurish at best, and the storyline itself, especially at the end, is very weird and rather disturbing. People often ask for this book, and I just don't get the appeal, particularly given how many truly excellent kids' books are out there. Unconditional love is great, but the mother climbing in her grown son's window? That's just plain weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepiest book ever","review":"I, too, am a book lover who would never throw one away, but this is the creepiest weirdest story ever.

If you enjoy a good cry, you'll even excuse the author's banal treatment.Yes, adults LOVE this book, but most kids can take it or leave it. My kids have not seemed to care much for it, and I'd rather read them books _they_ enjoy.If you'd like to read your child a book that shows a mother's love in a way children truly appreciate, try \\"The Runaway Bunny\\" by Margaret Wise Brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book for a Mother, not a child","review":"This book is read and cherished by mothers of sons. This book reinforces a mother's greatest wish. \\"I cared for him for a long time, changed his diapers, wiped his tears. Now even though he has married a woman who is not NEAR good enough for him, and whom I disregard, he will come back to me when I need him and he will change MY diapers (ewwww), and wipe MY tears. This so-called spouse he has selected might not usurp my power over him, at least when I grow old and feeble and needy.\\" THAT is the meaning of the book when I read it. I would bet that the majority of proponents of this book are females who have high hopes of reciprocity from their grown sons.Mother-love for a son is sacred, but surely defining it doesn't include crawling on her belly, or climbing ladders, or totally ignoring his wife. We are wise to seek out more healthy books with which to teach this to our children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you have negative stars?","review":"This book is just horrible.

The mother in this book understands no boundaries. It is very creepy that she sneaks into her grown son's room using a ladder after driving across town. While I understand and approve of the concept of unconditional love and being a mother myself have often told my girl that she will always be my baby, I do not believe in the extreme links this mother went to. Why does everyone ignore the obvious mental health issues?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree - this book is for warped minds","review":"I was given this book and only recently got around to reading it to my children (we have lots of books to get through!). It starts out cute, and very quickly declines in to \\"strange behaviour\\". I'm a mother of 4 children whom I love dearly, and I do NOT want them to think that I'll be sneaking in to their homes later in life whilst they sleep. How creepy is that. And I really hope my son does not grow as a man who sleeps with his teddy and sucks his thumb. I'm shocked this book was published. Hollywood could make a really creepy movie out of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just wrong!!","review":"There is something very disturbing about a mother who puts a ladder on her car and drives to her newly married son's house and climbs through his window.

It seems people either love it or hate it. Once I got to the part where the mother was stalking her grown son and cuddling with him like he was a baby, I removed it from my child's room. I find this book disturbing and an example of a competely inappropriate relationship between a parent and child. It acrually grosses me out. If you want to raise a Norman Bates, then this will give you some ideas on what to do to your kid. Otherwise, make sure that this book isn't in your kid's room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sweet childrens book....a true mothers love!!!","review":"My teacher read this to our 8th grade lit. class. She cried through the book and I wondered why as an 8th grader she was crying from reading a childrens book??? Now that I am grown and a mother of 3 children, I now understand!!!!! Something incredible happened to me---I turned into a mother and now I love this book. Always makes me tear up! My kids love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"This book is great an awesome book to enjoy with your children and others. I would tell anyone with or without children to read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disturbing","review":"Please tell me I will not become like this freaky mom. Buy \\"Guess How Much I Love You\\" and you will get the same message in a much more beautiful way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think about it too much.","review":"It's a nice little story; it will bring any parent to tears -- in a good way, because it's all about a mother's unconditional love.Just don't think about how creepy it is to have someone drive across town with a ladder to break into your house and crawl into your bedroom.Just don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll love you forever","review":"Joey from Friends can make you cry when he reads this. The only part that is slightly creepy is when Mom drives across town to see her adult son in the middle of the night. The message is sweet, though - that your baby will be your baby no matter how old they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my outlook","review":"I recently flew my two-year old nephew back East (as his parents drove) and picked this book out of the backpack my sister prepared for him. I was surprised to see that he knew the words - the rhyming is very nice - and ultimately how the book impacted me. I don't have children, but know now that I yearn for the love between a parent and a child. Reading the book to my nephew - with him curled in my lap at 30,000 feet - I knew then and there that I can't wait to be a mother. The most impressive part...he'll walk around the house chanting \\"I love you forever/I'll like you for always/As long as I'm living/My baby you'll be.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy, Weird, Strange...","review":"I thought the book was okay until it got to the part where the mom drives across town, sneaks in her sons window, and rocks a GROWN MAN to sleep. Creepy, strange & weird come to mind here. If my mother-in-law drove to our house, crawled in our bedroom window & rocked my 37 year old husband to sleep...I would have them both committed. Too strange for me. Later, the man is rocking his senior adult mother to sleep. Again, weird. I would think it was strange if my mom was rocking my Grandmother to sleep like a baby. Who does that? This is the creepiest book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated!!","review":"How this book came to be so popular is beyond me. I bought it years ago when I heard people raving about it. Please! Yes, it is natural for a mother to love her child forever and hopefully the feeling is returned, but the bizarre way parent-child love is presented in this book is unnatural and borders on a weird, unhealthy relationship!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a very sick book","review":"Love you Forever portrays a bizarre and sick relationship between a child and mother. It portrays the mothers' dependency on her child's infancy as an ideal. Where is the father? Why is this mother crawling across the floor to see her sleeping son? Why is she climbing a ladder and crawling across the son's bed when he is grown? What is the moral of this book? That a mother will always perceive her child as a baby and not as a mature adult? I cannot understand the popularity and praise of this extraordinarily disturbing book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stalk You Forever","review":"This book creeps me out so much. It creeps my 9-year-old son out as well. In fact, it's become a running joke between us that as soon as he turns 40, I'm going to go get a ladder, and he's going to get a restraining order. But maybe that's just us. There is something intensely disturbing to me about the image of an elderly mother sneaking through her grown son's second-story bedroom window to drag him, sleeping, out of bed and rock him in her lap. I don't find it funny or charming, just creepy. And please don't tell me I don't \\"get it\\". I understand what the author was going for here; I just think he missed the mark, and my son thinks so, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing book","review":"I remember reading this when I was a child and being disturbed at the thought of my parents getting old and sick, too sick to move or speak like the book-mom. Ghastly. Now I see it here while looking for a book for my new niece! No way am I going to give this one, on the off-chance that she might be upset by it the way I (and, according to other reviews here, many others) had been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy and Disturbing and Utterly Overrated","review":"This is my all time LEAST favorite children's book. The story opens sweetly but progresses into a weird stalking scenario, coupled with illustrations that project a sense of obsession and maniacal behavior and expressions. Expressing parental love is both touching and right, but this treatment of it is simply neither of those things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I made it about halfway through this book with my son before I stopped reading it. It's disturbing, in a stalker kind of way. I brought it downstairs for my husband to read, just to make sure that I wasn't reading too much into it, and he threw it away. It's creepy and unsettling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this meant for children or overly sappy adults?","review":"The little boy is throwing toilet paper around and flushing his mother's watch down the toilet. The teenager seems ignorant and tracks mud throughout the house.I'm sorry, these are not suggestions I want to give to my child. The sentiment of loving the child forever no matter what is cute, but it's creepy the way the mother goes about expressing her love for her child.And the end of the book? Well, I know reality is good to teach and we'll all die someday, but the implications of the mother dying after being too sick to talk/sing are very dramatic take a potentially sentimental story to a very sad level. I recieved this book as a gift and it is being donated to goodwill. Perhaps someone else will find the value in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the sappiest least child oriented books I've ever seen","review":"This books is for adults, not children. It is sickeningly sweet and sappily sentimental. It is designed to tug at adult heartstrings not entertain or inform children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever","review":"This is excellent book to give to new or expectant mother of a son. I still have my orignal copy and my \\"baby\\" is 24. A fun heart-tugging book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Child Should Have This Book!","review":"Wonderful book. It's just a beautiful treasure for children to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tear jerking book","review":"I go to Lancaster High School in Lancaster, Ohio. I am in a vocational class called Kindergarten Aide. A week ago we were reviewing different types of childrens books and reading them to the class.(Which is a bunch of 16 and 17 year olds) Well, I pulled this one out and read it and i swear there wasn't a dry eye in the room. (Including my teacher) I recommend that you read it) That is if you like those kinds of storys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have searched long and hard for this book and I am happy to have finally found it. The story cannot describe in any more detail the love of a mother and child. I am a mother myself, and when my daughter or son acts up, I take this book and read to them. It makes me understand the fragility of love and respect. I was never so impressed with a book as much as I am with this one. Thank you for letting me state my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell your son you love him!","review":"Many people have commented on the \\"creepiness\\" of a mother crawling across her adult son's floor to hold his sleeping body and sing to him. That strikes me as creepy, too, but what bothers me more about the book is that the mother only sings her lullaby of love after her son is asleep. It seems to be more for her benefit than his, and reading this book seems to be more for the benefit of the parent, celebrating that amazing feeling of unconditional love, than for the child. Kids need to hear that we always love them right WHEN they have trashed our bathroom and made us mad. I knew that my own mother always loved me no matter what because she told me so- not because she sang to me after I was asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"starts off ok... then gets creepy.. and why no dad?","review":"its one thing to tell kids they are loved unconditionally, but climbing up a ladder into her grown sons apt bedroom so she can hold him in his sleep is going too far, hello... there is a lovely new invention called the telephone!i dont think four year olds should have to think far enough into the future to picture their parents as infirm elderly people, that may be the reality, but isnt it the job of parents to SHELTER their children from the harsher realities of life while they are young.why is it only the mother who holds her child so devotedly? where is the father, one thing i dont like about so much childrens fiction is th lack of any fathers within the framework of the stories, let alone a loving father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy to say the least, do not buy","review":"This book made the hackles on my neck stand straight up. Absolutely creepy and odd. It is one thing to rock your sleeping baby, quite another to sneak in your grown sons house (with a ladder no less), and rock him in his bed. This book shows the exact opposite of how to be a healthy parent. Cut the creepy apron strings. DO NOT BUY !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsessive Love?","review":"Frankly, I find this book very disturbing. A mother who drives across town with a ladder tied to her car, climbs into her adult sons bedroom and crawls across the floor to sing him a lullaby is just creepy. In reality, that behaviour in a mother would cause her to be committed and that behaviour in a boy/girlfriend would result in a restraining order. No matter how well intended, I'm bothered by teaching a child that obsessiveness is love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even my 3-year-old thinks this is creepy","review":"Hard to add to what has been said in the other 1-star reviews...this book is deeply creepy and totally unsettling. Tonight my son decided he wanted to read something we hadn't read before and pulled it off the shelf. Ours was a MIL gift and, regrettably, I hadn't pre-screened it -- the title \\"Love you forever\\" seemed safe enough that I didn't think it necessary. Rats! My son sat silently as I read it and at the end his only comment was \\"Why is the mom holding the man like he's still a baby?\\" Good question. This one is going up on the high shelf of the closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Morose & Inappropriate","review":"I actually returned this book since I myself found it to be a disturbing tale. The idea of a parent dying is not something that my children need to be indoctrinated to just yet. I also think that the image of the mother crawling into the adult son's bedroom to rock and sing to him is just inappropriate. There seems to be some boundary issues at play here. Cap it off with the morose ending and I'd say you just spend $5.00 to basically feel bad. There has to be a better way to convey the extent of a mother's love without resorting to morose and guilt laden sentiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"a lot of the reviewers talk about this book like it is the Bible or something. Perhaps the Freudian overtones aren't terribly damaging to children, who do not catch the adult interpretations of this book; however, the subtle message of mother-son/father-daughter exclusivity in a family is extremely one-dimensional. I find myself rolling my eyes everytime I have to put it on the shelf for a visit because a well meaning relative gave it to us. This is not because I've never experienced unconditional love or just hate the world. I love my parents and my children, and I show that love through healthy demonstrations. I don't say that my child is zoo-like in any behavior (he isn't), nor do I creep around on floors so I can hold my adolescent son in my arms in the middle of the night. Label me unimaginative and negative; I know differently. The relationship portrayed in this book is peverse."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars","review":"If I could give this book zero stars, I would. As a daughter-in-law and devoted mother of a son and daughter, I would never give this book as a gift. I love my children desperately, and do not want them to think about Mommy dying any sooner than they have to, or to create boundary issues. Boys have a hard enough time cutting the apron strings and don't need to be made to feel guilty. I love the sentiment this book is trying to convey, but it stepped way over the boundary line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there such a thing as ZERO stars?","review":"This has got to be the freakiest children's book I have ever read. It's about a mother who can't let go of her children and who resorts to literally crawling across her son's floor in the middle of the night -- throughout his life -- just to hold him. I'd like to think that the many folks who have given this book praise are not mentally unstable, but can't help but wonder. This book is for tjose mothers trying to justify the use of their own talons in the lives of their children. It's an unhealthy demonstration of positive parent/child relationships and should not be placed in any home, much less read or even published anymore. I strongly recommend against this book -- unless of course, you're a psychotic mother is serious need of mental help. If you click \\"purchase\\", the next thing I'd recommend doing is admitting you need help and finding a psychiatrist ASAP. This is not a good book; this is a tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Litmus Test for Wackos","review":"Like many of the other 1-star reviews, I too found this book to be disturbing and mawkish. I have experienced the death of a loved one -- in fact I did so at a rather young age -- and I assure you that this book will not help a child deal with the passing of a loved one. It is insipid and creepy; it is the sort of thing that would inspire a Wes Craven film. Aside from the story-line, though, the art is amateurish and the characters have that stilted, too-real-to-be-real quality that often makes cheap dolls look so sinister. In short, it is a $20,000 therapy bill waiting to happen. If you love your children, and will love them forever, then don't inflict \\"Love You Forever\\" on them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touching...then creepy","review":"This book started off touching, if a little strange. Once the child got into his teens and the mom was creeping into the room and rocking him and singing to him, it got slightly creepy. When the mom drove over to his house when he was an adult, where he slept in a twin bed by himself, put up a ladder and broke in through his window and picked him up while he slept and rocked him and sang...that was ultra creepy.Adults might be able to pull the heartwarming message out of this story and kids might not quite understand the creepiness, but there are better stories to teach about unconditioanl love. Everyone is entitled to enjoy it if it resonates for them, but for me, it just feels silly and creepy. I would much prefer to read a book that both I and my children can enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic? Why???","review":"My sister in law gave me this book as a baby shower gift. She said she cries everytime she reads it. Matter of fact she cried telling me she cries everytime she reads it. I'm thinking, wow, this must be a good book... WRONG. I've read other reviews now that say it's creepy.. and they're right on. Can I ask one question?WHY IS THE MOTHER CRAWLING???? That's weird. Maybe when they're a baby and you don't want them to see you.. but why drive across town, breaking into your grown sons' house... then crawling across the floor? If she can handle a stick shift and a ladder, she's obviously capable of walking. And the sing-songy refrain is odd too.. 'as long as I'm living'... that's a nice thought to put in a kid's head. Hey, we're all mortal, oh yeah, and mommy will DIE one day... sweet dreams? So odd. Just couldn't get past the crawling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant topic","review":"I found this book to be unbelievably unpleasant. I can't understand why anyone would want to read it to a child, unless you know you are ready to teach your child about death. When I read it to my young child I did not know that's what it was about. The cover makes it look like a cute children's story and it is cute for a little while. Overall I would say that reading this book to a child unprepared was very upsetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"suspenseful and scary","review":"Had heard it was a great child's book, then I realized it was in fact more in the \\"Suspense/Thriller\\" genre...The scene where the mom cruises across town to stalk the son, raises a ladder to his window and sneaks into his bedroom is positively frightening - caught me offguard...well done! Not for the faint of heart..."},{"rating":"1","title":"no","review":"i hate this book ... seriously, i do. it's not about incest or whatever, it's about death ... it's telling a little kid: \\"hey, your mommy loves you a lot...and you love your mommy, right? well, shes going to die, and youre going to experience it.\\" is this something you want your kid thinking? \\"my mommy loves me ... but someday she will be dead.\\" I read this as an adult and it left me feeling like crap, thinking about it still does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever","review":"Even when you grow up, you need someone to love. Love You Forever is a great book for children because it demonstrates unconditional love.\\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.\\" Every night, that is the song that a mother sings to her son while he is sleeping. As he grows up, the mother has to drive across town to sing to her son, but there is nothing that is going to stop her from singing to her son every night.Soon, the mother gets old and sick, the story turns around, and the son sings to her, \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, your baby I'll be.\\"There is another supprise to the end of this book. I really sugest you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"The other day I was at work (I work in a daycare with preschoolers and kindergartens.) and I decided to read one of the little girls a story. I was tired of all the seasonal books my supervisor picked out so I went over to a shelf and pick out this book because it had a cute cover. I proceeded to read this story and ended up almost in tears by the end. As a mother-to-be I thought this was an outstanding book and I want my children to know that i will always love them. (I probably won't rock them to sleep untill I die, however I did learn from my little sisters that even 11 year olds want to be rocked.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I feel that the message this book intends to convey will be misunderstood by young children, especially if they see the illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, thanks.","review":"Did not care for this book at all - the premise is somewhat creepy to me. I know many of my friends love reading this to their babes, but it's not for us. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always in style","review":"This is a book to read to babies, children, adults, and your parents or friends. Whenever there is any question about the cycle of life--what goes around comes around--this is the book and the only book. Yes, it harkens back to a simpler time, but this is my standard baby's gift and seems to be universally appreciated. Note also that this is still my daughter and my favorite book to share and she is already 33."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"The first time I heard this book I was in the 3rd grade. It went straight to my heart and stayed there... Everytime I read this book I get teary eyed. It shows a strong everlasting devotion between mother and son showing that no matter how old one gets they can never get too old for their mommys love! 5 full stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh PLEASE!","review":"Another reviewer says this book should not be judged harshly becuase it is a metaphor... What small child can understand the meaning in a metaphor this drawn out? This book tries to and does illustrate unconditional love, but travels down a strange road to do so. There are much better books out there like Guess How Much I Love You."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared the living daylights out of my child","review":"This was read during storytime at our library when my daughter was 5. While I thought the story of the mother obsessed with her child was funny (as did my daughter), when it came to the end and the allusion of the mother dying, quite a few of the children were upset. Including my daughter. She was anxiety ridden for a while after hearing this and no amount of talking, consoling or explaining on my part helped.While it is a silly, fun and sweet story of how a mother loves her child no matter what, I don't think this is a good book for young children. I agree with the suggestion of going with \\"Guess How Much I Love You\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"yes, creepy!","review":"I read this before becoming a parent and found it to be very disturbing. I was 21 at the time and my boy friend's mom bought it for him for his birthday. First few pages, I was like... \\"oh sweet.\\" Then when we got to the later part of the book and I said told my BF at the time that I hope his mom was not sneaking in on us to rock him to sleep... *shudder*. This book is more for a parent who just can't let go then for explaining love to a child. I will not buy it for my daughter.

I was fine with the book until I saw the picture of her in the car with the ladder on top. I just find that creepy.

Thankfully I read through all the children's books my son receives before reading any of them to him. Crawling in your adult son's bedroom to rock him in the middle of the night. Oh my, this made me nauseous. ALL 3 went into the trash!!Please, PLEASE, read all the negative reviews before buying this book, especially for a baby shower gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom's Signature","review":"First of all, the people who are saying this book is \\"creepy\\" are taking it way too literally. It's a sweet sentimental message that parents are going to love their children no matter what- throwing things in the toilet, moving away, etc. My mom read this book to us throughout our childhood, and I never suffered any emotional trauma from it. On top of that, she gives it as a gift to expectant mothers we know. The book flips views at the end as the son goes to be with his mother when she can no longer come to see him.To this day my mom signs cards and letters to the three of us with, \\"Love you forever, like you for always, for as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"My first baby is about to have his first baby, as long as I'm living my baby he'll be.

Sick Book!","review":"It is a mother's job to let her son go when he is a grown man, not to climb up to his window to rock him in his sleep. That is sick and creepy. This woman would be every wife's nightmare, the mother-in-law rival, the one who won't let her son grow up or let him go, the mother turned stalker. This is not something a mother should be writing about her son, its her job to raise her children right and let them go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children do not like this book","review":"I remember having this book read to me often in school as a child. I remember hating this book. I hated the pictures, I didn't understand the story. I am 19 years old now and I can remember to this day how awful this book was...to a child. It's a tear-jerker for some adults and so they assume children will love it, but that's a bad assumption. I remember thinking it was potty book, that's all it ever was to me. Now one of my favorite potty books was, \\"Everyone Poops\\" by Taro Gomi. That would be a much better read and the pictures are great, very informative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"We received this book as a hand me down, I read it once and hid it (until I can donate it somewhere) so it never get read again to my children.

It alludes to the mother's death (which isn't something I am interested in explaining to my child at this stage) and, although it is the mother in this case, makes children aware of the fact that someone could sneak into their room at night. From an adult's perspective the ideas in this book could be construed as sweet and sentimental, but this is a CHILDREN'S book and for that reason I would definitely recommend that parents keep looking (personally, I am a fan of Guess How Much I Love You)."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book....might be a bit much for young kids","review":"someone got us this book as a gift for our second child we are expecting in December. my Son who is 6 wanted to read it before bed. about halfway thru the book i wanted to stop reading it as i felt it was a little Morbid but i finished the book,(saying to myself that was the first and last time) sent my little one to bed. he called me in about 3 minutes later scared and crying saying he was going to die and he wouldn't see grammy and grampie anymore...what made him think of something like that and he said he didn't know, but he has never thought of things like that before and he generally watched age appropriate TV shows... i truly think the book made him think of that... great touching books for mom's....not so good for kids.... lets just say i like to keep happy thoughts in my child's head before he goes to sleep and in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute favorite.","review":"Such a beautiful loving book. I sang the refrain to my child whenever we read the book together. It remains one of our family's all time favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I love this book! I started reading this to my son when he was first born. He turned 16 years old a few days ago and this book is still an important part of his younger years. Yes the book is a little creepy cause when the son grows up the mom still sneaks in to rock and sing to him. But it's a story of how a mom and son will forever love each other and pass that love onto future generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Story","review":"This book has always been a favorite childrens story. It is beautifully written and since it has the repetition of the chorus it becomes easy for children to learn the story. A 4-year-old child I bought this for memorized the entire story in a couple weeks and constantly begs her mom to read it again and again. Buy this book and you will not regret it. I am happy I can now share this memory with my daughter and hopefully she will develop a strong love for it and share it with her children 20+ years from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"children's book Love You Forever","review":"This book is beautiful, it brings tears to my eyes even when I just think about it!

There are way too many good books out there that cover unconditional love that this one went in my garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is a codependence nightmare","review":"Given to me as a gift, I heard many glowing reviews of this book and was told it would leave me weeping. Not only was I dry-eyed at the end, but this book left a bad taste in my mouth. A mothers love? Not quite...more like a mother-son example of co-dependence. The son comes across as a spoiled little brat that the mom \\"loves anyway.\\" She rocks him to sleep even as he becomes an adult...very healthy.

There are many ways of showing unconditional love in better ways than \\"stalking\\" the loved ones. no? And plus, I just don't like the setting with single mother and single dad. Why can a children's book depict happier and more ideal surrounding? Just for the fact that either people love this book with tears coming out or hate it to throw it away, i would not read this to my little one. There are many ways I can show her my unconditional love...

It is not a children's book. It is a book for crazy old ladies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, disturbing children's book","review":"I got this book for as a gift, and it's the most disturbing children's book I've ever read. The son goes from baby to grown man in 3 pages, and his mother ages about 3 times as fast as he does. In a few pages she's about 90 while her son is still young. Then, she calls to tell him she's dying, and he cradles her in his arms and sings to her?! There's no joy in it. It's a terrible, terrible book and I won't read it to my children. Stick with Goodnight Moon and go to bed happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"I can't understand why so many people seem to love this book so much. It starts out cute. But what is endearing about a mother breaking into her son's house, bringing a ladder fromm across town to boot? Not to mention that it is just ridiculous to think that she could lift him up. And not even wake him up. My husband and I thought maybe she drugged him. There are so many sweet books about the love between parents and children. But this is just creepy and weird."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love you forever","review":"I have never read a book that made so many grown women cry.

Although I think it is a must have for a children's library adults will not have an easy time reading this book. My four year old son likes this book and he doesn't process it the same way as I do.

This book is C-R-E-E-P-Y. \\"Love You Forever\\" could be entitled \\"The Needy Parent\\" or \\"Mama's Boy\\". It's about a mom whose s-mothering love is never-ever-ever ending, even when he becomes an adult he his still treated exactly the same as he was when he was a baby. (Why the hell is she driving over in the middle of the night to crawl into her son's window so she can hold him and sing to him like a baby? Notice no girlfriend or spouse for either of them? Wonder why!) Oh!! And bonus part, throughout the story they apparently only have one another to love...and then mom dies. But the torch is now passed to dad who will s-motherlove his daughter. Eesh. What a happy and fun story, right? Blech, \\"Guess How Much I Love You\\" is way better, non-creepy, fun book about a parent's love."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Children's story of all time","review":"I couldn't believe it when I actually saw negative reviews for this book. What the heck? I guess no matter how amazing a book is there are people out there that are just idiots.The first time I read this book was when I was pregnant with my son, and I was in the book store. It made me cry, and then when I read it to my kids I would cry each time, and now I read it to my nephew and still it brings tears. This is a classic book that will last the ages, and is a must have in your children's, grandchildrens, nieces, nephews, collection. Truly an amazing book, and for those that wrote negative reviews must have issues with actually loving your child so much you never want to let them go.Thank you so much for bringing this book to us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, not \\"creepy\\" as the oddballs say","review":"I am surprised that anyone could call this book creepy. The book is meant for a CHILD! Children want to believe their mothers will always be there for them. If you are looking at it from an adult perspective, which is ludicrous, since it is meant for children, then yes, it would be creepy, but so would A LOT of other fabulous children's books. If you look at it from a child's point of view, it is about feeling secure that mommy will always love you and care about you. All little kids want that reassurance and there is no harm in giving it to them. This book does a great job of showing how a mother will always love her baby. People that see this book as creepy actually creep me out. Maybe they need to learn the difference between a fictional child's book and adult reality. Just sayin'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book is so sweet. Every parent should have this book in their home! Every child should have the reassurance from their parents as is in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book...","review":"I am buying this book as a present for my Mother as I will be moving very far away...

It is a short and sweet story that can really touch your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Guys bawl when they read this one!","review":"I found this book by accident. I loved it so much, I bought a copy for my mother, who loved it also. My eyes well up each time I read it, because it symbolizes the wonderful love that only a family can generate. I guess some people can find reasons to fault the book...but then again some people complain when they go to Disney World, too! I just take it a face value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended - very touching!","review":"Love You Forever is perhaps the most touching book I have ever read to my children. The story is warm, humorous and ultimately quite moving. The illustrations are beautiful and add to the depth of the story. I highly recommend this book to anyone.

What where they thinking!","review":"I got this book as a baby shower gift. When my husband and I read it we didn't know what to think. Number one: I hope I am NEVER this mom in the book. Number 2: My son would have a restraining order on me if I ever behaved in this way. Number 3: It is just a dumb story!! Do not buy this book. There are MILLIONS of great children books and THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. If you want to play a practical joke on someone then give them this book and act serious. Although it might ruin your friendship it will be one funny joke!

While the toddlers loved it and were laughing, I thought this book was horrible. It was explained to me (and also in some of the positive reviews here) that it's only a metaphor. I think that is too easy of a label to stick onto something in which the author, Robert Munsch,is so obviously disturbed. I think most people agree when the Mom (now an elderly lady) drives across town with a LADDER on top of her car it truly crosses a line.I would like to ask the people who think this book is only a harmlessmetaphor in love, would you still adore this book and give it fivestars and endless kudos if the gender roles were reversed?I could've given this book 'no stars', if that wasan option. When I have school librarians and PH.D's also postingwhy they dislike this book, then I know this so-called classicis really an exercise in the warped mind of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE","review":"What is with you people ...taking this so literally?

How ludricous to have people think that she actually picks him up and rocks him, or that he does the same to her. Sheesh! Does the word \\"metaphor\\" ring any bells for you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very strange book","review":"This book was given to me as a gift when my daughter was born. I never read it until she was about 7 months old, and I won't be reading it again. It's very strange. I think it goes way beyond the idea of unconditional love. The mother is the focus, and appears to be more needy than the child. I prefer to read more light-hearted, fun stories to my daughter. This one just really creeped me out. If you want a book about unconditonal love, by \\"The Giving Tree\\" by Shel Silverstein. \\"Love You Forever\\" left me feeling like I'd exposed my kid to some over the top \\"Oprah\\" show"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little obsessive are we?","review":"Let me ask you a couple of things:1.How would you feel about your mother sneaking into your room on her hands and knees and watching you sleep and then cuddling you like a baby when you are a teenager? \\"My mom gives me reassuring hugs\\" - ok. \\"My mom rocks me to sleep and sneaks into my room\\" - wimpy and creepy2. You are about 25 yrs old. Do you think it's normal for your mother to drive out to your house with a ladder, sneak into your room via burglar style, stare at you and continue to rock you to sleep? There must've been a reason for you moving out of your house in the first place right? So she is coming back every night and has to climb through the window as opposed to the door because....why?3. Aren't there less-obsessive ways to show your kids you love them rather than scaring them into thinking you will always be there - ALWAYS.....no matter what? Why not just tell your kids \\"You can run.....but you can't hide....*evil-mom smile*\\"Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sentiment is right...","review":"but the implementation is creepy.

I gave it as Mother's Day gifts to my mother and mother-in-law. I don't have children of my own but it absolutely makes me bawl every time I read it. I had to get out a tissue just reading these reviews! It truly enforces the idea that a child learns to love others unconditionally when he is raised in a home where he himself receives unconditional love. As I get older I realize that someday I will be able to give back some of that love by caring for my parents. It's absolutely a perfect gift for anyone with children or aging parents or both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the Top Weird","review":"We received this book as a gift and my husband and daughter think its an ok book, so I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1. Personally I try to avoid reading it and find it creepy! The mother in the story only expresses her love while her child is asleep. I understand the message of the story is unconditional love and the son is aware of and moved by his mothers actions. But the book still seems to show a bizarre way to express love even if its only meant to be allegorical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say...CREEPY???","review":"As others have said, it is a very unhealthy way to portray unconditional love. The little song is cute, for a small child...but sorry, if my mom drove across town in the night and snuck in my window to rock me...I would have her committed! The end where the grown man then holds his sick mom...touching, but depressing for a child to think about.There are great books out there for children...this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"its not for children or your mother","review":"If you want a book you can read to your child, don't buy this book. Don't share this with your mother either. I left it by accident in the room that my mother sleeps in when she visits, and she asked why I left her such a depressing, creepy book. It certainly depicts a strange relationship between mother and child. Who wants to discuss death at bedtime to a child? Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Love\\" you forever?","review":"I read the book years ago, and I've read a number of the reviews, both pro and con.Mother is crawling across the floor of the son's room from the time he is about nine.

And keeps doing this until she is living across town, and then he brings a ladder.It creeps me out no matter which parent does it, but you can see why the author (a male) had to write from the mother's viewpoint.*shudder*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever","review":"I'll Love You Forever - One of the BEST Books I have ever read!

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unconditional Love","review":"Do you know how much your parents love you? Now that I am a parent, I can understand a little more about parents' unconditional love toward their children. If you have never read Love You Forever by Robert Munsch, you must read it!I recommend it to any child who doubt, if at all, their parents' love. You may want to read it if you want to remind yourself of their love. Now, if you are a parent who is burnt out by your ever-changing children, reward yourself by reading this book.This is one of the books that will bring tears to your eyes. Another book I would recommend is The Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn. This is a book about sending your child to school for the first time. You'll love this book if you liked Love You Forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewing I Love You Forever by Robert Munsch","review":"I thought this book was great to teach children about loss and the love of a mother to her child and I would recommend it to teachers. It seemed to conjure up deep emotions from many of its readers and listeners due to the sensitive subject of death. The content is good for third grade and up, however, second grade might be able to grasp the concept of loss. I Love You Forever is definitely NOT for kinder and first. I would compare this book to My Friend Rusty. This book is also about the loss of life except it deals with losing a friend rather than a mother. Make sure you have a box of tissue when you read this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love You Forever","review":"If you know a mom who has lost sight of what is really important about motherhood, this is the book you need to get them to read. As mothers we sometimes get so wrapped up in the daily activities, responsibilities, and frustrations of raising our children, that we loose sight of the big picture of what being a mom really is. This books will bring moms to tears as it forces them to think about what really matters when it comes to our kids. This book will touch the hearts of every mother. If you enjoyed this book, you will also love, \\"The Kissing Hand\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric Treatment of Mother/Son Relationship...","review":"Sorry, but I have to agree with many of the other reviewers. While I do not agree that this tale borders on perversion (as it is metaphorical rather than literal), the author's treatment of the maternal bond is so lacking in subtlety and deftness that it effectively nullifies any sentimentality which would be otherwise evoked. In sum, a sweet idea eclipsed by sophomoric execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is disturbing","review":"This book is scary sick - The picture of a grown man being held by his mother while he sucks his thumb - Wierd.there are so many good books out there, how this one ever got published is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes!","review":"Ok, i'm as sentimental as the next mother, but come on!

While I do understand the love for the song -- the \\"I'll love you forever, like you for always\\" sentiment, I was appalled the first time I saw the book. It appeared to me the mother was practically \\"stalking\\" her son. Crawling around on the floor to peer at him at night, driving by his house, then climbing a window into her grown son's bedroom. I thought that, rather than protraying the healthy kind of forever love any mother has for her child, it portrayed a desperate, sick, possessive sort of love. This mother's bizarre behavior gives me the creeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly BAD!!!!!","review":"I'm so surprised that people find this to be their favorite book!!! I just read it after a long time on the shelf to my 6 year old, having forgotten how awful it was!!!! First of all, a mother doesn't pick up a sleeping baby or toddler because they might wake up. No mother I know would crawl across her TEENAGE BOY'S FLOOR when he's sleeping and pick him up to rock him, nor would she DRIVE to her GROWN SON'S HOUSE in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, climb a LADDER to climb through his window and rock the grown man while he is sleeping! Sick and weird!!! It is some crazy codependent relationship. There are plenty of books that express the beautiful unconditional love of a parent for a child, and this is not one of them. I am always the first to cry and sentiment and sap, but this one made me feel physically ill. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creeeeeeeepy","review":"Ok, this is not touching. It's creepy.

And you know they ALWAYS have to inscribe it so I can't even return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"Sorry, but I just can't see how you can't find this book strange. I agree that it does express the attachment a mother has to her child but this goes overboard. Driving across town in the middle of the night, climbing up a ladder and into her sons bedroom reminded me of something out of Psycho or at the very least Serial Mom. What would you do if your mother did this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-Felt...Awesome","review":"I've been in the education business for many years now...from Grade school to University.

It ends with the man cradling his dying mother, chanting the same poem. This is the only book I've ever actually thrown in the trash, because I didn't want it read to my son. I want him to thrive for just a little while in the wonderful, happy world of childhood where there is no death, no guilt, no forcing of love. Give it to your graduating high school senior, if you like. Read it for yourself to make yourself cry. But PLEASE don't read to your toddler... I think it's filled with underlying love-guilt messages that are manipulative and confusing for a toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true Classic for our distorted age, indeed!","review":"My, how I was drawn-in to this lovely story about mutual love between a son and his mother. When I finished it, I thought, \\"There is something weird about this book, what is it?\\" I think many readers agree the sneaking-in-with-the-ladder is a bit much. It's just too surreal for me. Yes the sentiments are real and deep, but surely there was a better way to show this. Of course it speaks to the generation where two-parent families (mom and dad, male and female for further clarification) are a disappearing breed. No doubt many single moms (widowed, divorced, or single) would find great empathy with this. It is a touching story, but it seems to stress the finality of death a bit too existentially for me. As a high school physics and latin teacher, whose worldview has been largely fashioned by the classics and historic Christianity, I would never read this to my child. I guess I'm just too old school. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It Forever","review":"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who found this book a little bit odd/creepy/disturbing.

One year when my mom had all her daughters, sons-in-law, and grandchildren home for Christmas, she read the book aloud to everyone. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. My teenage daughter still loves this book and keeps it on her bookshelf hoping to share it with her own children someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy, creepy, creepy!","review":"I thought perhaps it was just me, but I can see from other reviews that many people agree: this book is disturbing. It portrays a stalking, dysfunctional relationship, and frankly, it kind of makes my skin crawl. Perhaps the people who think it is poignant or sweet are not paying very close attention when they read it. With so many other wonderful books out there that express the mother/child relationship, the cycle of life and death, and the idea of unconditional love, I cannot understand why anyone would purchase this or even borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychotic!","review":"This book has such a sick premise that it left me stunned. If ever an author needed to think about getting psychological help....Somebody gave this book to my granddaughter, and I had the unfortunate experience of reading it to her. Since she was only 1 1/2 yrs old at the time, it bothered me more than it bothered her, as she was too young to understand why it was so sick!A mother (who clearly needs counseling) sneaks into her son's room each night to sing him a song and hold him, even when he eventually becomes a man and moves across town! When she is sick and dying, he does the same for her and then repeats the cycle with his own baby.Don't buy this book! What was the author thinking? Speaking of \\"mamma's boy\\" fantasies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disturbing","review":"I just had to throw this book in the trash. I don't think it should be read to any child.

I love my son dearly. I love my son enough to establish healthy boundaries. I don't want to take this book too seriously, but I found it disturbing. Why is this guy in a twin bed as grown man anyway? Probably because his obsessive-compulsive mother was stalking him. Then, he starts the same thing with his daughter! Boy, is her future husband in for a surprise. I don't think it's a healthy message. The song just makes it creepier. I believe in loving your child, despite anything, throughout his or her life, I believe in kissing and hugging, I believe in affection. I do not believe in coddling grown children to the point of criminal action and inspiring an Oedipus complex.

When mother continues her serenading of the sleeping son, even into adulthood by going to his house and sneaking in the window with the ladder tied to the top of her pickup truck,....well, I just couldn't take anymore. This is not a book my child will see because the values expressed therein should not be admired or perpetuated. Even the lullaby itself is limited. Why? Because a mother's true love continues even after her death - in spirit! And why cause a child to think about mom's love ending with her death? Why cause a child to think about mom's death at all? This is simply a terrible book in all aspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have NOT received my order yet!!","review":"I wish I could say my review was good, but today is Jan. 16, 2011 and I still haven't gotten my order!!!! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"inaccurate product description","review":"this product was supposed to be in \\"good\\" shape. but it wasn't. every single page was creased. one so badly you can barely see the picture. this should have been in the description. i will not buy from this seller ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Sapfest","review":"This book is about a mother who doesn't realize her bouncing baby boy grew up into a man and has no identify other than her role as a mother. To think this womam rocked her teenage son with a nursery rhyme is creepy. To think this woman climbed into her grown son's home and into his bed to rock him to sleep borders on pyschotic and incestual. If my MIL tried climbing through our windows, she would be taken for a burglar and shot.This is a mother who clearly needed someone to shake her by the shoulders and advise the umbilical cord to her child was severed many moons ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love You Forever","review":"I contacted the seller telling him/her that it should be noted when there is a personal inscription inside the front cover.

I mean I feel that the situations in the book carry motherly love just a little far. Maybe the writting is endearing to some. As for me I found this mother to be \\"without a life\\". It made it seem like all mothers do is live for their children with no independent life of their own. As much as I love my children (boy and girl), I wouldn't want to think of them as my baby for the rest of my life. I rejoice in sharing their growth and knowledge with the world. Maybe this mom and son live on a secluded island (planet) and neither realizes that there is indeed a real world where children do grow up and parents do lead their own lives. The part where she climbs through the window really made me sick. I asked myself \\"what's wrong with this woman?\\" Then I thought, \\"Oh I get it. She climbs through the window because her son is so sick of her that he won't open the door\\". My advice to all mother's, \\"Get a life so your children will enjoy having one.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for mom-to-be","review":"This book is a great gift for any mother-to-be or anyone who is already a mother.

What a great gift. I cried the first time I read it, as well as the second time my friend read it to his own son. This book is great for any age, I'm an adult and I bought copies for my own mother, brother and sister. The pictures are unique, the message is one of love and caring, and realizing how precious life, family and loved ones truly are. In our all too busy world this book brings things into the correct perspective. My heart was truly touched by this book. Not since Charlotte's Web or the Chronicles of Narnia that I read when I was a child did a book touch me so much. No matter how many times one could read this book, it's guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye and to most importantly really make you think.

Pretty pictures with a major lack in developing the struggles of these soldiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly compelling portrayal -- fantastic soundtrack","review":"I thought Stiller gave a credible impression here. Granted it was spotty in a few places, but most of the performance was first rate. I think Stiller has a future in dramatic roles and I am glad that this roll may keep him from being type-cast.Peter Greene was creepy in a very believable way. Janeane did a fantastic job as the intimacy-challanged agent -- \\"You're coming back, right?\\" Maria Bello provided a good depth and range to her character.The movie has enough subtlety and depth that a second viewing is probably a good idea. I certainly enjoyed it more the second time. Most of the characters were acted with more restraint than we have become accustomed to and this may explain why the movie becomes more enriched with repeated viewings.But it was the music that put the hook in me. I went out and bought my first Crystal Method and first William Orbit CDs after watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An new spaniard Genius","review":"Second movie from the spaniard director Alejandro Amenabar, that this time amazes us with his creativeness, by constructing a film that moves from a romantic drama to a thriller and ends in an enigmatic sci-fi story. The movie is all on the dreams --rather say nightmares-- of young wealthy and attractive man, that never knows if what he's livng is true or is just a dream. The dreams are in this case the actions of the movie, the plot constantly moves from what he is supposed to dream to what we believe is real. So in the end we never really know if what we saw really happened or was a figment of our imagination. An advice when you watch this movie, \\"Open your Eyes\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THE BOOK! Don't see this trash","review":"The book is excellent. Mostly from the \\"tone\\" and the way that Jerry Stahl tells his harrowing and sardonic account of drug addiction.This movie doesn't have the tone right and nothing really works. It's not funny or sad just there.Ben Stiller looks a little like Jerry but can't really pull off this story.READ THE BOOK - it is a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, bad film.","review":"This movie is too ambitious, tries to say too much but with lack of real substance. The script seems to have been written by a teenager, raised by MTV culture. Certainly, Amenabar was very amused by his abilities as a writer, but only people with very little intelligence may find this film amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous ending, not worth watching!","review":"This movie was captivating and interesting for the first 3/4ths of it. It is a psychological thriller/mystery and you obviously want to find out the big explanation at the end that resolves all your questions. Well, the ending was so incredibly far-fetched and crazy that I can't believe that anyone who read the WHOLE script actually wanted to work on this movie. It ends up being a stupid \\"sci-fi\\" type ending. So, if you want to get all into a movie, only to have them resolve it with the most ridiculous scenario possible, buy this one!! ....or....DON'T."},{"rating":"2","title":"It opened my eyes","review":"I started watching this movie not knowing anything about the story or the actors at first i was like huh but then it just grabbed me what a great movie the acting is really good pennelopy cruz is going to be a great actress the only reason I have not purchased it yet is because its not on dvd yet. the story line is original something Ive never seen before great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie!","review":"It was one of the worse I've seen, so thought I would help others from going through the same thing I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"My mistake: I read the book first","review":"I feel bad about not liking this movie...

The movie can't decide if it's a comedy or a drama and it's so boring, it really doesn't matter. In the end, I got the over-stated point (drugs are bad) but I still thought the movie was pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Your Eyes","review":"Vanilla Sky was a spin-off of this one. Penolope Cruz was beautiful as always. I also think Eduardo Noriega gave a much better performance in Open Your Eyes than Tom Cruise did in Vanilla Sky. I liked this movie on VHS which is why I ordered it on dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dark","review":"Weak plot. Too dark. Feels too disjointed. What is the story trying to tell? Yes, life can be bleak but this is overboard. A pointless life is not entertaining. Watching a self-centered wretch indulge his impulses isn't interesting without showing how he mustered the resolve to change. Great cast but a disappointing movie and somewhat boring. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Believe...","review":"This was another film I had no pre-knowledge of before watching it. It was quite a nice surprise.I hadn't thought of Ben Stiller as a serious Actor. I imagined him in light comedies only, but he certainly has proven otherwise to me with his stand-out role as the talented and in-demand writer of several TV Programs in the 80's (i.e.: Alf). His career and life in general was speeding downward because of his extreme drug use (private and public).The combination of Hollywood and Celebrity Drug Abuse is perfect fodder for making of an outrageous, sensationalized epic. It takes great restraint to keep the visual extremes within the boundries of believability.I believe..."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"I almost hate to compare Amenábar to Hitchcock but it seems to fit - to a point. I didn't quite know what emotional response was appropriate when it was over, but that's one of the pleasures of this movie - if you're the sort who doesn't need everything tied up neatly and fully explained by the time the end credits roll. This is where \\"Open Your Eyes\\" deviates the most from any Hitchcock storyline (although I recall The Birds did conclude with some ambiguity).If you can get inside the story and just let it take you along, this will be a very rewarding experience. I suspect \\"Vanilla Sky\\" will only bear a superficial resemblance to \\"Eyes\\", and considering how (IMHO) Hollywood doesn't have a very good track record re-making foreign films, I don't expect much of it.One last observation; the kiss at the very end between César and Sofia has to be one of the most hauntingly beautiful moments ever captured on film; I must have replayed that a dozen times when I first viewed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abre Los Ojos","review":"I saw this movie in Madrid while doing a semester abroad there. I already had a decent understanding of spanish but wouldnt say I was fully bilingual. I saw this with about 8 other people, and I have never come out of a movie with so many friends who were equally as amazed as I was. I've tried (in vain mostly) to describe this movie to my friends ever since I saw it, the plot twists, the reality vs non-reality aspect of it, to no avail. You have to see this movie. I would honestly put this up there with Usual Suspects. And this was all while not totally comprehending everything. I loved the periodic haunting \\"Open your eyes\\" that would start a new sequence. I can not wait till this comes out!

In jail for murdering his grilfriend César tries reconstruct what happened. The viewer never really knows what is real and imagined, what is fact and what is a reconstruction. The confusion is understandable as the movie ends, with the conclusion perhaps asking more questions than it answers. You might not like the ending at all, but it is certainly very original. (This movie is in European Spanish)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish Version of Vanilla Sky","review":"This is actually the original movie from which Vanilla Sky was based on, both starring Penelope Cruz. She's a favorite of mine and I did watch both. And what makes this version even better is Eduardo Noriega who is not only incredibly handsome but an excellent actor as well. \\"Open Your Eyes\\" is story that is quite unique because it involves future technology and that is not instantly revealed in the story-telling. This film was directed by the talented Alejandro Amenabar who is also a writer and composer. He directed other films like \\"The Others\\" and \\"Agora.\\" Something about this version makes it a bit more dark and edgy than Vanilla Sky and if the viewer doesn't really mind the subtitles, it can can really pull you in. I've seen it a few times, and I've never tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-made, intelligent and challenging - grew on 2nd viewing","review":"The rare film that really grew for me on 2nd viewing.The first time around I found it mostly fascinating, but occasionally too far-fetched for it's own good.This time, not as caught up in figuring out what was going on, I was able to appreciate the subtle deeperthemes that Amenebar is addressing; What is beauty? How much of our perception of reality is accurate?How much of what we consider \`love' is narcissistic? How do we know what to trust?Multiple realities and questions of perception always fascinate me, and this was no exception. And the leadperformances were very good. Beautifully shot, and full of challenging, interesting ideas, great style andunexpected twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"After reading all the rave reviews of this film, I was severely disappointed by the anti-climactic reality of it. Part of my disappointment, no doubt, hinges on my expectations - I was expecting a clever twist-thriller similar to The Usual Suspects. Rather, it was more like a science fiction film, borrowing heavily in plot devices and scenes from Total Recall (a great film - just not what I was expecting) - derivative and lacking in originality and cleverness."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"i was bit hesitant at first...ben stiller in a heavy role such as this? but i was utterly surprised and amazed. i'm a huge stiller fan to begin with, and my appreciation of his ability to act has grown ten-fold with this flick. the movie itself is disturbing, and will stay hauntingly with you days after you see it. stiller gives one of his bets performances yet, and truly has you feeling as if you're watching this story take place in real time...right before your very eyes. the soundtrack is great too...all in all, a great movie, but please note it is not for the faint at heart. it's a smack movie...lots of shootin up, but then again, it is based on the true life, needle experiences of jerry stahl. great movie...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting thriller: the second masterpiece of Alejandro Amenabar!","review":"Where does the fantasy begin and where does it finishes? Labyrinths of the reason intersect with the game of open possibilities in this puzzled and superbly well built thriller that will burn at your eyes. To intend to describe the fabulous script would become a sacrilege, go for this one. There are fine sequences that reminds us to David Lynch. And this is by itself a remarkable point to his favor.Amenabar proves he is the most prominent and ambitious director of his generation. Prolific, ingenious and profoundly original around his narrative perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for girls","review":"I can't say enough about the American Girls books for this age and stage. This book came in very helpful when my daughter was going through a difficult time with a friend. It helped her identify what may have been going on in her friends' mind, and suggested a strategy to address it. Instead of the situation escalating, she was confident enough to work things out with her friend. This book also details when a friendship is 'toxic' so to speak, and what a 'real' friend is.

She can't understand why they would treat her poorly at times then be sweet as pie the next. This book helps you sort out who a true blue friend is. It also points out that you can have troubles with that friend too and to be patient and work it out. I like that the book also mentions how it is good to have more than one good friend.

You'd think this is a good thing, but it's really not, becuase most of the book suggests being a good friend, but what if your friend is the one that's complicating things?

Aside from the benefits of Cat6 (I can use it with the next generation of router), this is a relatively supple cable. It doesn't fight as you try to tuck it out of the way. It's also a little easier to disconnect than many snagless cables. I will fault Belkin for the package. It's one of those blister packs that requires scissors to get into. Pretty easy to slice a finger on the plastic if you're not careful. This is wasteful and not in the least necessary. But the cable's doing the job I bought it to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Great Room Fireplaces: Collection A104","review":"I've purchased 3 books from Amazon about fireplaces, since my wife and I are building a new home with a masonry fireplace in the family room. This book is a departure from the other books (such as \\"Fireplace and Mantel Designs\\") that contained real-life, color pictures of fireplaces someone would build in their home. Instead, this book contains only fireplace sketches -- no color pictures or descriptive text. These sketches are of fireplaces that would likely be placed in a fictional storybook castle moreso than a home.

After a couple months, I turned it on, left the room for a minute, and came back to find the tip melted off, hanging from a strand of what little plastic was still attached. I thought about returning it, but decided (rather stupidly, in retrospect) to continue to use it...BIG MISTAKE. It heated up way beyond what it should have, even when I put it at a \\"low\\" setting of 5. When I attempted to use it, the sizzling sound indicated to me that I had, indeed, made a mistake.

Its very clearly laid out, its fun (where a lot of Grade 2 material can be made to look pretty boring)and looks fun, and seems to cover most of the basics. It is NOT a be all and end all for a Grade 2-er, but for someone not following a set curriculum, this is a great provider of material so you know you are covering your bases.

It's delightful to find, in a work this size, words such as \\"chafurdar\\" (to wallow in the mud).

As a bonus, there are brief lists of common words and phrases at the front and back. And, to make it useful in the field, this readily fits many pockets. Best, its plastic slipcover will protect it when your pocket turns sweaty, as it so often will in the countries where Portuguese predominates. This meets my limited needs, as someone who comes across the occasional Portuguese word in passing. Many high school language students will also find that it has all the vocabulary they need. This isn't a scholar's reference, though. Translated definitions tend towards the terse, so they won't cover all usages of a term. It offers plenty if you don't need much, and that's good enough for me right now.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Travel-Sized Dictionary","review":"I lead trips to the Amazon and this is the best dictionary I've found.

In the post-Flood world, all of the animal life on land and most of the plant life had been buried, forming even then into the fossils we find today.

They will thenbring in nuclear weapons to aim at the United States. A Chinese businessman named Liu Yousbeng is the driving force behind this conspiracy.

It's extremely fast-paced, witty and highly entertaining. It's a bit more technological than his other work, and I found myself not really paying much attention to the workings of the Panama Canal. I only cared about it as it related to the story, which I guess is the point anyway. Mercer continues to develop as a character into someone you care more and more about. Harry White is the only other recurring character to make an appearance here, but he's as grizzled and smarmy as ever. Set entirely away from the United States, the exotic locals in this book really help the story to clip right along.With Clive Cussler having just announced his retirement (his next novel will be his last), lots of people will be looking for a new fix.

The action is good and the characters are likeable. The downside to this story is the length of the descriptions and the depth at which DuBrul writes.

A good kitchen also makes you happy. That was the first thing about it that I fell for.The other thing was the rest of the story besides the love for food. I felt enlightened and peaceful and sad and happy, at the same time. Life, love, loss of love, it's all here.

While reminding us of the persistence of time, the process of survival, and the unexpected relationships built along the way. The realization that life is a journey to be lived and not resolved.

The music scene was fascinating; I remember listening to Savoy Brown's recordings in my tiny apartment near the University. I thought the vocals on A Step Further were edgy, creative and powerful. At the time I was also listening to a lot of John Mayall with Eric Clapton in addition to all of the San Francisco Bands (Quicksilver, It's a Beautiful Day, etc. etc.)Now, in 2004 I am re-living my late '60's era. My mistake was not researching the vocalist on previous Savoy Brown albums. What I thought I was getting was the incredible vocal stylings of Chris Youlden. Instead, Kim Simmonds lends his talents to this album, but they just don't move me at all. I hope others will realize this before purchasing this CD. It just doesn't hold up to other recordings by SB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick A** old school blues.","review":"After two mediocre live CDs (Archive Alive, Live at the Bottom Line) this disc proves Kim Simmonds can still jam with the best of them. Most of the tunes are up-tempo blues with blistering and thoughtful guitar. New vocalist Nathanial Peterson (he's actually been touring as a member of SB for the last 3 or so years... I saw him live a couple of years back) is authentic and moving. At times he is even reminiscent of Chris Youlden (check out \\"Ain't no need to worry'). Not a bad cut on the disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry, Bob! Those 2007 remasters are much too loud!","review":"Don't throw your money away on those 2007 Japanese remasters!

This produced what is now known as \\"sphagheti westerns\\". Sergio Leone did bring interest on western films back by his own innovative ideas, but what stood out as a class apart was the music of the movies. Not all of the Italian westerns may be equally appreciated today but the score for those movies still resonates on the innumerable listeners' mind.Ennio Morricone did an awesome job in bringing out new score for western movies. Using whistles, innovative sound effects, traditional Italian wind instruments and choral works, he reshaped the landscape of western film music. The horizon of film composition was pushed to new territories for ever. This CD only captures the essence of the vast and master work that Mr. Morricone did over a long time.A MUST buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but some songs are better than others","review":"I got this album mostly for the For a Few Dollars More stuff, which is incidentally totally sweet!!

This disc features some classic moments of music from \\"Fistful of Dollars\\" and the grand epic \\"Once upon a time in the West,\\" both of which are spaghetti-western classics.But as an added bonus, there are some far rarer tracks from some Westerns that have yet to be released in the U.S. The highlights of the disc are \\"A Gringo Like Me\\" and \\"Lonesome Billy,\\" two plaintive cowboy-ballads that would give Kenny Rogers a run for his money.Yes.

The ending is unusual as to what happens to Daniel French and Trevor Davis. I truly enjoyed every minure of reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, entertaining read","review":"Interesting, well developed characters made this a good read. The \\"twist\\" wasn't a real surprise, but the author's slow reveal through Dylan's history worked well. I appreciated the way the author switched between Dylan & Claire's point of view--this can get clumsy if not done well, but it worked here.Overall this was an entertaining escape. Strong characters overcame the at times silly and contrived plot. But then it is contemporary romantic fiction, so silly and contrived plot lines are to be expected to some extent--at least these were done well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Years Too Late","review":"This album would have been a blockbuster if Nilsson and Lennon would have teamed up some years earlier, or at least sober.

I found that while Gordon Ramsay's other shows are very entertaining, what with him shouting and cursing out the staff in their kitchens, when it comes to directing an audience on how to cook a meal, he's very lacking.

Which is a key part of the sales pitch (\\"Calculates average and highest heart rate during a workout\\").-You have to position your fingers in an exact position, then press VERY hard.

Some of these, especially in \\"Film Noir\\", I will be looking for to view in the near future.

While fully capable in the realms of relaxation and mental atonement, this stuff is also really remeniscent of the psychedelia (is that a word?) of the 60's. Now I can cancel my prescription. Just pop in the dvd. Doesn't even require a computer, though I find it cool to play on my laptop too. Each program is different, and there's even a continuous play mode. It's so easy. No more light machines with all the wires and stuff. This is great. My only question is: Will there be a sequel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted more from this","review":"This looked quite promising to me, but I've used it about 5 times, and although the visual effects are cool it does nothing to help relax or focus me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no way to meditate!","review":"The colors and animation are beautiful, but farr too fast and busy to meditate or find calming.

For me at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strobe Light is Annoying at Best, Unhealthy at Worst","review":"Before I bought this awful DVD I read many of the reviews here, which all laud it to the highest and make no mention of the fact that literally every other second is a strobe light going off in your face. I see nothing calming about this whatsoever and it felt like mind-control. This is NOT a meditation. I imagine this would be a great DVD for someone on acid, but beyond that it will do nothing to center your thoughts or calm your mind. Watching it feels disturbingly like Big Brother is watching. I absolutely do not recommend this video and am disappointed that I had to spend so much money to find out this item was not at all as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Unique and Relaxing. Excellent product!!","review":"When I was doind research on mind machines and different relaxation products, I was very fortunate to stumble upon the AV3X Mind Machine, especially for such a fair price. I typically use this DVD when I want to take a nap or prepare to sleep. Even after a very stressful day, the AV3X allows me to quickly experience deep relaxation - and the whole process is effortless. All it takes is to sit back and just observe the unique audio and visual images. In no time, despite how worked up I might be, I'm able to rid my mind of stress and get some badly needed rest. The customer service is terrific also. I can tell you from personal experience that the creator and seller of this DVD cares about his customers and is a class act. I highly recommend this product, because there's really nothing else like it. Its all I expected, and a whole lot more - it really works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take your brain off the hook for awhile","review":"I've been a student of self hypnosis and relaxation techniques for a few years now and I wish I had this DVD when I started my exercises. Watching the computer generated random images and listening to the sometimes nature sounding, sometimes techno background music puts me into a somnolent state very effectively. Within the first few moments of each section, I didn't even notice the light flashes for the FFR portion of the DVD.After a hard day at the office this can really unwind the kinks that you build up. I feel refreshed and ready to do or get things done instead of playing the couch potato game. I very enthusiastically recommend this DVD if you're interested in a relaxation tool to help you. This is definitely it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Pleasant Experience!","review":"What a brilliant and awesome DVD this is! I am so impressed by this DVD~ it is incredible to view, and superbly made.

I have never seen anything like this before~ it's amazing!I would, without hesitation~ recommend the AV3X to anyone; It is well worth the price, and a small investment for how it will make you feel...it really works. The very first time I watched this DVD, I had to watch it over again. I've tried many other relaxation / unstressing tools before, but NOTHING has EVER come close to this DVD...it produces results FAST. I will definitely be using the AV3X for meditation in the future; I am so glad that I found this DVD~ I will be buying more!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AV3X is a Fantastic Way to Meditate & Relax","review":"I have been meditating with both AV3X Volume 1 & 2 for the past couple of months and I must say that this is one of the best high tech meditation DVD's I have ever come across. I look forward to meditating with the DVD's every night before going to bed. It brings an expansive, multi-dimensional awareness into my consciousness.I love the video graphics with the pulsating white light and colorful fractals and mandala's, the wonderful audio sounds of relaxing meditation music and the free Kaleidovision glasses which gives the images a glowing 3-D effect.My stress level has been reduced and I am sleeping much better.

They really do work! I run a new business and although I like it, I can get pretty stressed sometimes. I just pop in the DVD and a short time later, I am relaxed or ready for a needed nap. I am one of those people who just can't lay their head down and be asleep in 5 minutes like most people. It is a much better idea than taking any medication or alcohol to relax and much cheaper. Also, the guy who made the DVD, Chris, provides excellent customer service, which is so hard to find today. I had been sent an older version that didn't play in my computer and he called me back quickly and sent me one that would ASAP. I give my customers great service and it is refreshing to receive same. Definitely a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Visuals Are Stunning and Effective","review":"The visuals are breath taking. You can't keep your eyes off them.

It's okay in a pinch, but it has trouble removing odors from clothing such as exhaust from a lawnmower (ours mixes gas with oil and blows the exhaust all over my husband.

These are not the Kindred of the hidden Camarilla, they are the Cainites who roam the streets.The Sabbat clans and bloodlines are given here in detail, save for those already in the primary Vampire sourcebook. Also included (and excellently done) are several bloodlines designed for non-player characters. Among these is the Harbingers of Skulls, an odd group of Cappadocian Elders who escaped the Giovanni purge. Their now-forgotten legacy is only hinted at in this book, following a powerful tradition of answering one question and opening two.The overall tone of this book is moving. Like its companions, it focuses on horror. But this is a whole different horror, from being buried \\"alive\\" to torturing mortals. It's a powerful guide to the darker half of the night, and an absolutely marvelous resource to anyone running a Sabbat chronicle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things have changed for the Sabbat is a understatement","review":"When I read this book I had no intention of running a Sabbat campaign.

I tried the cooker with several different pots I might use camping, and was not satisfied. I would have had to hold the pot with one hand while the water heated, leaving only one other hand to manage adding fuel, and anything else that might come up.If I were planning to camp out of my backpack then I think I would be willing to use this little stove - but with little kids, I camp out of a car these days and I will be bringing a larger, more stable set-up.I have returned the stove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Camping","review":"Use this when i go camping. fits in my backpack well, especially like that it comes with a pouch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome stove","review":"I use it as both a wood stove and a windscreen/pot stand for my Trangia, and it serves well.

The story is set in London, England in the late 1800's. Through his acquaintances and a little wish his life is changed. Dorian's personality and manners alter drastically and thus, he begins his downfall. The novel is very descriptive and uses philosophical themes. The use of language is extraordinary and some of the things discussed in the novel really make you think. The story is very morbid and cynical, but beautifully done. At times though, the descriptions and philosophical jibber-jabber can be a bit overdone. Still, I liked this novel and would recommend it to anyone.

It repeatedly tells you to look at the man pages and other online sources for info, offering no explanations. It also tells you to ask your 'system administrator' to install or configure components. Hello! That's me. I've found much more helpful info online. Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is very good","review":"I like it very much but i would not give it 5 start because the book dont talk about the ftp server gui and other thing like telnet, or the book talk very little about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of advertising","review":"The book contains some useful examples and case studies but overall feels like advertising for author's valuation website.A lot of information is repeated in several places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreets Back for the Millennium!","review":"I absolutly love the new song.

I have 7 of the new songs already, and every single one of them is just as good or better than \\"I Want It That Way.\\" So, like I said, Backstreet's Back Again, and I know they'll be comin' back for a long time.

Well their big heads are leaking into their music in the song \\"I Want It That Way\\". In this song they say \\"Don't ever say I want that way, because I want it that way\\". Any girl who likes these boys is being completley disillusioned and this song proves it. In fact in the video they barely even shake hands with the screaming girls around them, and they only ones they go near are the pretty ones! These boys need an ego deflation and I am proud to give it to them by telling them that their new song is horrible and anyone who listens to it only does because they are \\"SOOOOOOO CUTE!!!\\".

He \\"defines\\" language, explains the connection of language and evolution, and how language is integral to intelligence and consciousness.For the uninitiated/layperson, I would recommend reading Dr. Bickerton's \\"Conclusion\\" chapter before reading the rest of the book, for in his conclusion he provides an excellent summation of his thesis and summary of what you're about to read.Rarely have I had the pleasure of reading a book of such depth and such brevity. Highly recommended!! Well done, Dr. Bickerton!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed the way I think about Psychology!!!!!","review":"I read this text for a Psycholinguistics course and was enraptured by Bickerton's concepts and approach to psychology and language from the introduction. Although I don't subscribe to all of Bickerton's assertions, I found this text to be a great breakdown of the fundamental role that this often overlooked skill of language plays in our life, beginning from the time in which it is hypothesized to have come about in our species. His viewpoints provide an interesting and thought-provoking juxtaposition to many other big cognitive psycholinguists in the field like Steve Pinker, Ray Jackendoff, and (by natural extension) Noam Chomsky. After having read this book, I have sought out more opportunities to read Bickerton's works and have not been disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish!","review":"These Diesel sunglasses are stylish, but allow too much sunlight to get in.

The rest of the series doesn't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-fi philosophy the way it should be done","review":"Hidden behind a poorly motivated story is a man's fascinating search for the meaning of life. His debates with various entities through the course of the story were interesting and smart. This book is certain to leave you thinking, and hopefully debating with your friends. On the downside, there is a large chunk in the middle of the novel where the characters live with some Fremen-inspired, Eskimo-like cavemen. Unless you enjoy reading detailed descriptions on the art of eating seal blubber, this could be a stumbling block in the otherwise smooth flow of the narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"cats quickly bored","review":"i purchased this dvd because my cats really enjoyed volume I.

I've got photos.... it's really fun to watch her. Beautiful Clear DVD. I turn the sound down sometimes as personally it's a bit much but leave the DVD looping. The fish are beautiful and even my husband is amused. It's like having a Fish Tank without all the work! Also includes other options like Mice, Bird Feeders and Gerbils.

Named Stuart Bagg by his caring adoptive family, he makes friends, copes with bullies, and longs to return to his cockroach family. This is a lively and imaginative story with an amusing cast of characters. I found it odd that the Biddle family's reaction to finding a naked boy in a closet of their home was to adopt him without contacting the authorities, but my 5th grade students didn't bat an eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoebag","review":"Out of the seventy-five books, I've read this year, counting last year altogether.

I recommend it to people that like to read fiction and well written stories. This book keeps you interested in finding out the end. In other words, you don't want to put it down.

She relies mostly on her own heavily biased opinions, when in many cases, the primary source evidence she provides clearly contradicts her. On the whole, this book does a great disservice to anyone who would ever attempt to reasonably argue any of what is covered within this book, as Juster so completely fails in arguing her thesis that one is inclined to believe that just the opposite is probably true."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book About Brigham Young","review":"This book is the summing-up of Leonard Arrington's great career as the father of the New Mormon History, that renaissance of candor during the '60's and '70's. He had full access to the massive church archives in Salt Lake by virtue of his appointment as Church Historian, something no other biographer of Brigham could get. He used this access, his training as one of America's finest historians, and his own moderate yet faithful temprament to produce the definitive book on Brigham--one that could satisfy the strictest canons of his profession and also could be faithful to his religious tradition. Arrington wrote with loving yet open eyes, and this book belongs on the shelf of everyone who enjoys Western Americana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"Not the best book on Mormonism, but very interesting and very truthful.

Unfortunantly the performance is so weak, it is impossible to tell whether or not the composition has any merit. I am reminded of a statement that Schoenberg made that his music is not modern, it is badly played.The major problem is with the chorus. I have heard high school ensembles that have performed with more polish. The quality of their sound is anemic, their intonation is off in places and their entrances are frequently ragged.Although most of the instrumental playing is good, there are some rough spots.Too bad, this work probably deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I would have hoped.","review":"I'm a musician who's on a big \\"mass kick\\" lately, and I'm a big fan of most of Maslanka's works.

But then on page 49 it stops and from page 49 to 90 the book is filled with list of our Brothers who will never come home. With all respect to our fallen brothers in arms. This information can be easily found on the Internet. I ordered the book, because I thought it would for the most part filled with stories about or from former Corpsmen. Not to be half filled with KIA information that has been available to anyone interested in finding out this information on the internet for years.

Well, imagine the orchestra and its arrangements sounding much worse, with Parker really drunk and really bored, and you'll have some idea of what this outrage sounds like.

Though I very much want another book with higher mountains in Colorado in it, I either need to take a class to learn how to use this book or buy one with a layout I prefer: individual hikes up peaks, round trip mileage and altitude gain included, and without having to do multiple cross-referencing to figure out routes and distances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap is right","review":"Unfortunately you get what you pay for.

Firstly, it covers rare but very worthy repertoire and secondly, it displays the curious voice of Arno Raunig. While I don't find Raunig's voice particularly beautiful, he has a very fine sopranist technique, despite a tendency to belt out top notes. The highlight of the recording is his high C! at the end of the Alleluja from Mozart's Exsultate Jubilate. He performs the arias without the preceeding recitatives, which is a shame especially since the recit. to 'Cara lontanano ancora' is so fantastic. He also avoids trills wherever possible, including the virtuosic beginning to the beforementioned aria. Nevertheless, his spectacular range, accurate intonation and energetic singing ensure this recording is a welcome addition for countertenor and opera seria fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider other books first","review":"If you already know precalculus at the level of a college professor, this may be the book for you.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!The plot, the setting, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!The rating could have been PG-13, as there's no serious reason really for an R rating.In short, it's a movie definitely worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, though you might want to stop short of buying it.Strongly recommended for those with a soft spot for Ireland and all things Irish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spacey must have had a double!","review":"Spacey's character moons the press near the start of the movie. However, the moon was hairless and curvy. In \\"American Beauty,\\" Spacey showed that he has a nice posterior, but it was hairy and a bit flat.

This book does not delve into the trash and gossip that often is cruelly and unnecessarily found in film star biographies. Davis looks at Linda with a caring pen and writes about her fairly. Although he writes about her personal troubles he does so gently with heart and understanding. He spent many hours interviewing her daughter Charlotte, her sisters Undeen and Monte, her brother Cal and numerous friends. This helps to give the book a personal feel that is not found in those written from archives and second hand news.

I really love the relationship she has with the townsfolk and most particularly with James, although this isn't the first book with Agatha (Staggerford) or with Agatha and James (Green Journey), it can stand alone. It's warm, it's touching, it's funny, it's sad, it's, quite simply, wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it! Please give us more about Agatha","review":"I love Jon Hassler's novels and wish he would write many more, especially if Miss Agatha is one of the characters. I find myself thinking about her all the time, wondering how she is doing, and hate to have to remind myself that she exists only in our imaginations. She is a combination of your favorite grade-school teacher, a beloved aunt or grandmother, the elderly neighbor loved by all, with a little of Aunt Bea mixed in. Read everything Jon Hassler has written. You can't go wrong with any of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!!","review":"I saw the movie made of \\"Green Journey\\", the precursor to this novel, and loved it.

Filmed in 1976, this fairly low-budget movie stars Dennis Hopper as an Irish prospector-turned-outlaw during the Australian gold rush of the 1850s-1860s. He joins forces with an aboriginal renegade (played by David Gulpilil, who would cover similar territory a year later in the film of Thomas Keneally's THE CHANT OF JIMMIE BLACKSMITH) and goes on the lam, evading psychotic former prison guards and police. This movie, with its atmospheric cinematography, innovative folk music, rather seems like the Australian answer to BAD COMPANY. Hopper is really good as the harassed Morgan (with a respectable brogue, no less) and Frank Thring (who was rewarded with the greatest closing line in any movie since CASABLANCA), probably best known for playing Pontius Pilate in BEN HUR, is a sinister magistrate who tries to give Morgan his comeuppance. Don't overlook this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong aspect ratio on Troma DVD transfer","review":"The film was originally shot in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio.

This is so jammed with variety, yet it bumps hella hard. It would be nice for some of the tracks to be drawn out a little and stand on their own, but that's what makes this so crazy.

The book provides a step-based approach to get you to the point where a company can define its EA and how to evolve it. If you are looking for technical details you are in the wrong place.

In the current (summer 2000) snowball of interest in everything surrounding XML, her book deserves to be read by anyone interested in serious XML deployment, as it covers the \\"upstream\\" issues notoriously overlooked or sidestepped in the rush to early technology deployment. She rightly laments the lack of central authorities taking a lead hand in IT design and project management but offers a way forward using the Zackman Framework and some clearly mapped out targets and milestones. Having been hooked by the strength of her arguments for \\"why?\\", I felt a little shortchanged on the \\"how?\\" but sufficiently keyed up to look further afield, largely thanks to a very comprehensive bibliography."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.","review":"I am amazed author’s writing style.

If you are interested in it you've heard it so you already have your own opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all good","review":"It's only now and then that a band makes an album that is great from cover to cover. This is one of them. If I wanted to impress somebody with this band who had never heard them before (forget I Ran) this would be the record I'd chose to showcase them. It flows perfectly and is well connected. Although \\"a light at the End of the World\\" has some better songs throughout most of the album, this one edges it out with its seemingly thematic cohesiveness. This is the Seagulls finest performance.

Originally issued in 1984, and loosely conceptual in its focus on matters of young love and identity, \\"Young Heart\\" was AFOS' most accomplished, well-produced, and stylistically cohesive effort. It didn't score the big hits that their self-entitled debut did (\\"I Ran\\" and \\"Space Age Love Song\\"), but it was a more fully developed direct descendent of that sound. A masterpiece of mid '80's New Wave, its unfortunate lack of success led guitarist Paul Reynolds to leave the band, and AFOS was never the same. They may seem like a two-hit wonder to a lot of folks, but this album suggests that this band had far more potential than was ever realized. The added remixes are a matter of taste, but they're delightfully typical of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"Don't waste your money.

But it is also very challenging to be a storyteller, especially if you are used to the less story-focused role-playing games where the DM or guide focuses on technical matters over characters or plot. This is a great book because it makes a lot of good suggestions, gives some needed guidelines, and also spends a good deal of time being honest about the storyteller's role, power, authority and the dynamics of players in this system.

Richards suspects the former Philly officer, Colin O'Shea of killing female bartenders - a crime similar to one he was suspected of back in Philadelphia. The brass and the DA aren't on board with Richards' suspicions so she enlists the help of Freeman.

As wonderful as she might be in the role of Elsa in Lohengrin, however, it borders on ludicrous to have her singing \\"I Got Rhythm\\" with a big, operatic voice. It's almost unlisten-to-able.

She placed verses from the Bible in the liner notes which was interesting as it confirmed her rebirth in Christianity which carries to her next album (Cats Without Claws).I enjoyed the danceable tracks like \\"People, People\\" and \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\". This is her best album of the 1980s in my opinion. Unfortunately, this was a Mercury (formerly Casablanca) Records album not Geffen.

Unfortunately, the end-product of this farewell isn't so pretty: although this album is actually a pure rock music project, most of its tracks aren't worth appreciating. I agree the best track is the title hit track \\"She Works Hard For The Money\\" - an excellent upbeat dance tune, a song that indeed drives home a point (that of a simple woman who works hard for her earnings, a womam whom fate and circumstance can hardy bring down). Second fares \\"People, People\\" - a superb upbeat and danceable track as well. Then we have the lovely, quiet, slow \\"I Do Believe\\" - its tempo picks up at the 2:25 minutes mark - D.

Still I dont regret buying this movie only for its topnotch bonus material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential!","review":"To understand the world, and how America can best exist within it, this movie is essential.Students all over the country should see this before they graduate."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BIG LIE","review":"Reagan' presidency was a sham. The press is so afraid of Reagans popularity they are still afaid to tell the truth about him. The Russian PEOPLE ( from the top to the bottom) ended the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a disaster and the Russian people walked away from it. Raganomics: cut taxes by 25% but did not cut middle-class programs to make up the difference. He went on the biggest borrowing binge in history. Congress autherized LESS money than Reagan asked for or his borrowing would have been even greater. Iran-Contra: he created his own secret government. Powers not given to him by our Constitution. He should have gone to prison. WHEN IS SOMBODY GOING TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT THE REAL REAGAN?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Look at History","review":"For someone who was born in the 1970s and did not understand what was happening with regards to the cold war, this was a lesson on history. I learnt a great deal about courage in times of conflict. I like the spiritual tone of the narrator. Thanks for the etras - the speeches made by Mr. Reagan. This product is worth it's price.However I would not recommend this product for classroom instruction on history as it could be understood as being biased since it carries a proamerican / prodemocracy tone. This is a product for personal viewing based on individual choice and perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding.","review":"We do not have leaders today like Ronald Reagan. He recognized the enemy of freedom, called it for what it was, and did not back down. Today, too many leaders try to appease the enemies of freedom, not recognizing that by doing so they put at freedom at risk. This movie was outstanding and reminded me of the great leader we had in Reagan, and of the precious gift of freedom. It must be protected or it may very well be lost to those forces that seek to control mankind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!!","review":"Caused tears to flow and life's real meaning to be pondered. Anyone could watch this and come away with clearer knowledge of loving one's neighbor as oneself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares whodunnit?","review":"This book is neither fish nor fowl! The stories are all short, predominantly silly & far from suspenseful. As far as writing whodunnits is concerned, Agatha Christie has nothing to worry about. History, it definitely is not! Whilst the authors do try to draw circumstances from true history, the links & threads in these stories are pathetically fanciful, bordering on the preposterous. There isn't a single story that gripped me or, in writing this review, is worthy of a positive mention. This book is neither history nor mystery. If you want either, or both, you can certainly do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"When I got the product the third disk titles were all in an asian looking language.

The only difference between this and the Least Worst Of album is the mediocre cover of Deep Purple's \\"Highway Star\\".Obviously a good listen, seeing as it's the band's famous songs, but uninspired nonetheless.

If you have to have a sampler get \\"Least Worst\\" but if you get this you'll regret it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Near Flawless Love Story","review":"The DVD case quotes the Seattle Post Intelligencer that calls this movie, \\"Terrific! A touching and near flawless love story.\\" The majority of Amazon reviewers agree, but what I saw didn't come close. It looks like a lot of people fell in love with the book or the story and didn't actually watch this film. What I saw was Vincent D'Onofrio bungling his part by being way over the top. Zellwegger, who is usually awesome, can only work with what she's given. Unfortunately, it's not enough. This movie is not the book. Forty minutes in it's still setting up the story. I found it very boring and didn't give it a chance to live up to the hype. I've wasted too much time on movies that didn't and regretted it. If you can't give me SOMETHING in the first half hour, you've blown your shot. Ah, wait. There was one thing I liked. The setting and backdrops were superb. They gave the film a definite flavor of the 30s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This was a great movie. Although just a little on the strange side. The actors and actresses were great in this movie though! It is a romance of sorts and he is an author is this movie. That is all that I'll say so I don't ruin it for ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those great stories that you don't hear enough of...","review":"This movie really got me interested in Howard in high school. (I had previously seen the Conan cartoons in grade school.)Vincent really brings this sad yet creative man to life. One of the great unsung writers in American history. Howards characterization of minorities might've been offensive, but he was also a good ole boy from Texas who managed to invent a literary artform, giving the world both Conan and Red Sonja. He saw magic and epicness in a place where the Eastern intellectuals would shun.This film is beautifully shot on what was probably a low-middle budget. Haunting score from Hans Zimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Real","review":"This is a very good movie by any reasonable standard. The story rings true, the characters are alive, and the acting is first rate. The story behind the movie is pretty touching as well.Renee Zellweger is one of the finest actresses of our time and her interaction with Vincent D'Onofrio is what makes this movie so great. Vincent D'Onofrio turns in what I consider to be his finest acting performance and Renee Zellweger is not one to be out done. Together they made this a movie of real substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad and touching story...","review":"I am not much for 'romantic' films but seeing this was based on Robert E. Howard I had to watch it. It is very well paced drama and all the acting is top notch. The only flaw I see with the movie is a bit mroe on the realtion between Robert and his mother... but that is not the focus of the film, so is forgivable. Very touching film and something I would buy if it came out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a find!!","review":"I watched this movie only because Vincent D'onofrio was in it. And am I glad that I did. I had heard of Robert E. Howard and knew he was a writer, but I didn't know anything else about him. This film shows the depth and loneliness of a man who didn't fit in with the rest of the world; and then he meets a woman who begins to understand and to love him, but ultimately cannot be with him.Vincent D'onofrio gives a wonderful impassioned performance as Howard and Renee Zellweger matches him as Novalyne Price, the woman who befriends him. This film is well worth seeing and I recommend it to everyone. It also contains the most passionate kissing scene I have every seen in a movie. I had to rewind and watch it more than once. (Actually, it was quite a number of times!!).If you're thinking of watching or buying this movie: Go for It! But beware, you will need kleenexs at the end -- I did, and I never cry at movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie with an amazing Vincent D'Onofrio","review":"I love this movie and it's very sad that \\"The Whole Wide World\\" is only available on DVD in the USA.Let me say it is Vincent D'Onofrio's best work. He is amazing, fantastic and heartbreaking as writer Robert E. Howard. You see that Vincent really loves what he is doing. He is one of the finest actors ever.As a low budget \\"The Whole Wide World\\" is wonderful filmed. Also a great work from director Dan Ireland.Vincent D'Onofrio's sister Elizabeth is seeing as the waitress in this movie.I love Vincent D'Onofrio's and director's Dan Ireland commentary. Great bonus!!!!Unfortunately there are no English and only French subtitles.After watching this movie read the books \\"One Who Walked Alone\\" by Novalyne Price Ellis and \\"Blood & Thunder\\" by Mark Finn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert E, Howard Writer","review":"Having read several of Howard's Conan books I was interested in learning something about the man. He was a brilliant story teller, but had a troubled mind. The relationship with his mother was way beyond reason. He knew she was going to die and commited suicide rather than live without her. A tragic end for a gifted artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awful, Trashy Abortion of a Little Film","review":"This is a tedious, throw-away, generic abortion of a romance movie that made me wish I had rather been cleaning my cats' litter box. The film's premise, that a woman tries to deal with a fellow who has difficult idiosyncracies, could have been handled deftly in someone else's hands, but here it comes across as profoundly and excitingly as the wallpaper that counts as film on the Lifetime Channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the rest of this film? 18 Minutes are missing!","review":"According to the Internet Movie database, the film that this DVD purports to show is 111 minutes long. According to the \\"technical information\\" on the left, however, this DVD is only 93 minutes long. What happened to the remaining 18 minutes of this film? This kind of truncation of a good film is as annoying as the dropping of the key final scene in the DVD of \\"The Big Easy.\\" Columbia Tristar should know better than to offer only about 7/8ths of a film -- particularly a film as good as this one -- and try to pass it off as the whole thing. Because this film is otherwise excellent, it should be shown complete, and I will refrain from buying this truncated version until Columbia Tristar issues it complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my lifetime top ten list!","review":"I don't know if I have the vocabulary to adequately describe the joy this movie has given me. It is note perfect. My husband has been a Robert E. Howard fan for decades. I rented the movie only because of his interest but found it absolutely riveting. I've had to rent it from a mail order company and am very grateful to Dan Ireland for posting where the DVD is available. I have already bought it.The movie does lovely justice to a Texas few see. The performances are so beautiful; each one is a gem. D'Onofrio and Zellweger have done many great roles but I think this is my favorite for each. I've worked as a psychiatric nurse and was moved at the care with which mental health issues (both Howard's and his family's) were portrayed. Overall, this movie is a diamond. Now that I know where I can buy it, I will be giving this DVD as gifts to anyone I know who loves wonderful movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Dan, Vincent,and Renee","review":"All I can say is that the other 5-star reviews are true. Whether or not you've ever heard of Robert E. Howard, this film is a beauty and a true one. As many have noted, it has one of the most perfectly heartbreaking but triumphant endings of any romantic film I've ever seen. If you are a Robert E. Howard fan, don't worry, this film does him absolute justice. But, unless you have the steely heart of Conan, you will be sobbing like a baby at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caught it on Cable - big Robert E. Howard Fan","review":"I had wanted to see this movie for a while as I am a Big Robert E. Howard fan - Conan, Solomon Kane, etc.I had also enjoyed COLD MOUNTAIN which had the same two stars - Vincent D'Onfrio and Rene Zellwiger - but not in the same scenes.It was a diverting movie with good performances and spectacular scenery. My wife wound up watching it with me. I do think that D'Onfrio overacted a bit as he was also the producer. Zellwiger gave a fantastic performance.It was NOT much for Conan fans but did have a few scenes in which D'Onfrio acted out scenes from his writing which were interesting.It is great if you are a fan of Howard, the 2 stars and also like your romance to be simple"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Film","review":"This is a great film! Will it ever come out on DVD? It deserves the best presentation possible. I'll be watching for it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie I've seen In a Long Time!","review":"I've always thought Vincent D'Onofrio was a wonderful actor... Over the years I became hooked on everything he did. The way he got into this character and the delivery of emotion that he portrayed in this movie was beautiful. This is the first movie that I've ever cried to. It touched me that much. If you want to see a GREAT movie please buy this one. You won't be dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever title or false premise?","review":"This book appears to be based on two false premises. One, the bottom line is the bottom line, if organisations manage to get more value out of their people the bottom line changes.

He created such a beautiful mix of ecletic sounds and rocking beats through out these two CDs. \\"A Grand Love Theme\\" is a sweet introduction that starts you up to ask for more. \\"Relaxin' with Cherry\\" is classic, providing deeper bass sounds, but still maintains a smooth, snappy melody. The break in the middle is irresistibly groovey. This music is so great because it is very dance provoking, but it is also extremely mellow and relaxing with its singing flute and seductive vocals and lyrics. Bravo! Vivre La France!"},{"rating":"2","title":"French Countryside Trip-Hop","review":"Kid Loco's debut solo effort is very rewarding. The middle of the album gets a little forced and odd, but the beginning and the end are fabulous. A sonic journey through love, the opening track, \\"A Grand Love Theme,\\" is astonishing in its blend of almost classical sounding melody and phat beat underneath. \\"Relaxin' with Cherry\\" has a wonderful, carefree guitar riff that relaxes you even with the quick beat lain overtop. When the beat does come in after a minute, it is one of those moments that are worth an entire album just to get to. After that, it kind of falls apart, but \\"She Woolf Daydreaming\\" picks up any and all the slack. Once you can get over the disarming love moans, it is a beautiful, enchanting song. It segues into \\"Alone Again So,\\" the end of which is fantastic. \\"Cosmic Supernatural\\" ends the album with a feeling that everything is right in the world. I do not regret the money I paid to purchase this import album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this 2-CD release, WAY better than MP3 versions released years later","review":"Don't know why Kid Loco decided to remix his music for MP3 versions.

The first CD is a real joy to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"very scholarly, detailed, and for the serious inquirer","review":"This book is detailed, has a lot of philosophical explanations for Islamic practices which is very helpful and interesting for anyone looking for more than basics.

These stories are purely great. The author is everywhere but nowhere, as it should be. When I start one I'm pulled in immediately from the momentum generated by the one before it -- Gates's voice is somehow resonantly consistent; the narrators are all the same character in a way, gay or straight, male or female, but this isn't a weakness, it's... something entirely else, to do with Gates's moral vision or something. Mordant, taut, touching, fierce, wacky, human stories. He's one of the three writers whose new books I buy immediately in hardcover and read then and there.

I spread out the white liquid with a heavy duty cleaning brush and let it dry for a few hours. I tried to just sweep it up but it wouldn't come up. I ended up using a heavy duty cleaning brush (that was dry) to get the white powder up. It really took the stain out! My only complaint is that it is VERY STRONG SMELLING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be really good","review":"I used to love this stuff but the formula was changed and it no longer works. None of their claims are true anymore. I have used this product in the past and it was wonderful. Stains (even old ones) came up and were totally undetectable. The cleanup was easy and it smelled like oranges. With the new formula the product is pretty runny, it stinks like toilet bowl cleaner and is very hard to sweep up. After you sweep it up you need to rinse to get rid of the white powder residue and discover that the oil stain is still there. I will not buy anymore of this stuff unless I hear from the company that makes it that they have returned to the old formula. Do not buy as it is no longer even close to being worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Was a great product for years.

I decided to get the 1016 over the 816 because of the overall better build quality and the HDMI. The HDMI is video pass-through only but my TV only has one HDMI input so the receiver gives me an easy switching option. I am thoroughly pleased with the features and sound of the Pioneer. It has more than enough power and the sound is very detailed and crisp. My only grip is that the receiver seems to be a bit longer in depth than most. Excellent buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget HDMI","review":"The unit I received can't seem to hold on to a HDMI connection or even establish one.According to Pioneer's documentation; HDMI input is not available until you manually configure it but after many attempts I could only manage to watch a few minutes of HD-DVD or a few seconds from my HD cable connection before a complete blackout.I didn't find this receiver to be user friendly and I suspect the unit I received was defective so I'm returning it and plan to buy a different model or brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this receiver for two reasons: it had 3 component inputs and the THX rating.First, I had to purchase a $20 3way component switch becuase the one in this reciever is junk. It has too much loss and my screen goes blank when I use it.Second, I never use the THX becuase it doesnt sound as good as the dolby settings.So basically it sucks and I would give it 0 stars if it were an option.

This is a \\"real\\" pumping iron work-out, so if you want jump up and down with light weights, buy a Firm video. But if you want a strong sculpted body then this is the video for you. My advice is to not get over zealous and try 8 lbs at first, definitely start with light or no weights to get your form correct. I hope this won't be the last video we see from Ms. McLish.

The handle is a nice wood and has a great weight to it. Easy to hold. What's neat is the way they have affixed the wires to the handle. They have it molded inside the hollow metal top of the handle with a hard plastic/silicone type substance. It's perfect for long-term, because usually these type of whisks will have a wire come loose over time. The mold however doesn't seem as though it could do that very easily.The quality is top notch.

Not sure if I am cut out for Bridge but willing to keep trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat of a disappointment","review":"I've been playing bridge at an intermediate level for many years and was interested in having a general reference as well as expanding my skills at bidding and playing. This book has two major problems for me. First, the point count system used is non-standard -- at least it is different from anything I have encountered before. Only high card points are used -- no distribution points. So point counts for standard bids are correspondingly lower and one has to remember all sorts of special cases to decide what to do.The second problem I have is the way hands are displayed. Hands are illustrated with tiny, badly printed card images, with no colors. So Hearts are hard to distinguish from Spades and Kings look alot like Jacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guide for bridge novices","review":"Don't assume this book is beneath you just because of the title. It's written by Eddie Kantar, one of the best modern bridge authors. It's a comprehensive, up-to-date guide to basic bridge bidding and play.I came across this book after playing party bridge for several years. Although much of it was review for me, I did pick up a number of pointers to sharpen my game. Kantar breaks down the bidding in a very logical fashion. As someone who has tried (and occasionally failed) to teach the game to a number of friends over the years, I appreciated his elegant approach.That said, this book is probably not the best tutorial for people who know literally nothing about bridge. There's not enough overview to provide the \\"big picture\\" for total beginners. Kantar quickly dives down into the detail of how to bid particular kinds of hands. If you've tried playing bridge even a few times, though, you should have enough context to follow along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I don't recommend this book for people who are completely new to bridge, despite the title, which suggested to me that it was appropriate as a beginning book. To give one example -- a new player needs to know how to make an opening bid. This book has a thirty page chapter on the opening bid. Once one has memorized that, then there's another thirty page chapter on responding. It would be a lot more helpful to give a few rules of thumb, then add rules a few at a time as the reader practices. One thing I learned -- don't buy a book as a beginner based upon reviews by experienced players -- they can't remember anymore what it was like to be new at the game! This book may be okay as a reference, but certainly not as a way to get started."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has helped me understand the basics","review":"I am brand new to bridge and have found this book very hellpful in understanding the basic concepts.

Normally when I buy a cd I only find 1 or 2 \\"good\\" songs on there. This cd is packed with them. The arrangements are awesome. The vocals gave me chills. All the songs are good on here but the best of the bunch are: \\"I Am Free,\\" \\"Again I Say Rejoice,\\" \\"Sing to the King,\\" \\"Strong Tower,\\" \\"How Great is Our God,\\" and \\"In Christ Alone.\\"I am not a male and have never attended a Promise Keepers conference. This music is not just for men. This is an amazing worship cd that keeps your attention from beginning to end.

Before I purchased the Connie Francis disc I had listened to the excerpt on Amazon. Although she sang the song at what seems to be a dirge tempo, I decided to give it a try. Much to my chagrin, Ms. Francis omits the second line of the bridge--to my mind the dramatic high point of the song--and then proceeds to omit most of the last quarter of the piece. I haven't listened to rest of the CD, but if \\"Hold Me\\" etc. is the piece you want, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For The Price, Clean Sound","review":"My only criticism would be to have the RCA jacks on the same side as the other connections; that would make installion easier to plan out. other wise, great sound, great power, clean and bright even at half-gain. the LCDs are a bit \\"pimp\\"y for my taste, but no biggie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Undiscovered Gem","review":"This funny, touching and thought provoking film is an Australian coming of age film, which surely is one of the best independent films of the past year. When one thinks of a coming of age movie, it typically involves an angst ridden teen, and while the excellent Khan Chittenden plays that role, it is Jean Dwight, portrayed by Academy Award nominee Brenda Blethyn, who truly comes of age. Emma Booth is a revelation, and the earnest and authentic Richard Wilson completes the ensemble cast.Brenda Blethyn turns in a bravura performance, as a stand up comedienne and single mother, struggling to balance her desire for the footlights with one foot firmly planted in smothering her children's maturation. After seeing this film, and laughing and crying, I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Australian or British tragicomedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Louise Mosrie is a name to remember!","review":"My prediction for the year 2000?..that Louise Mosrie will become a household name. A performing songwriter myself, as well as, DJ of a radio show dedicated to independent performing songwriters, and as an agent, manager, and producer, I listened to this CD with several perspective ears. It pleased all of them. The CD as a whole is a pop collective, but with the warmth of an acoustic project. The songs are very well written and draw you into their content. Mosrie's voice is nothing short of stellar and captivating. One of the best independent recordings I've heard in a long, long time. Not only do I highly recommend this CD as a MUST HAVE for any collection, but, having had the pleasure of hearing Mosrie live, I suggest going to one of her shows. Unlike a lot of artists, her live performance is as listenable as the CD.

It is outrageous that we, the consumer, have to suffer a closed system compelling us to buy their overpriced refills, but very few can get around it. Our printer costs should be almost zero but instead can be quite high, especially if you don't print that often.As for these cartridges, I do not print that much, so my costs as a function of usage are incredibly high.

The eye relief is too short, but my main complaint was that the focus is not maintained when changing the magnification setting. That is, when observing an object after properly focusing the scope, re-focusing is always required when the magnification is changed. The more the change, the more correction is needed. This is something that should not be necessary in a good spotting scope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Scope, Affordable Price","review":"This is our first spotting scope. We've used it primarily for wildlife viewing. After reading reviews of several scopes, my wife and I decided on this one due to it's focal length and reasonable price. We weren't disappointed. During a trip to Yellowstone this past June, we were able to see grizzly bears and even wolves at least a mile away. We did have a little scope envy with others who had much more expensive scopes, but not enough to justify the cost. We haven't used the little tripod that came with it, so can't comment there. We have another taller, more sturdy tripod that works very well. The 45 degree eye piece is a plus once you get used to spotting with it. Compact, lightweight, nice carry bag too. All around good deal. We have recommended this to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scope for the range","review":"With this spotting scope, you get a lot for your money. The optics are clear, the magnification more than enough for shooting range use, and the scope body rather robust. I appreciate the extendable sun-shade and the eyepiece cover. The eye relief is a bit close for comfort, especially if you're not used to such a scope. However, once you get used to it, there's really no problem.The one weakness that I can see is the tripod. It's a bit too high for using on a shooting bench. This holds true, whether the user is 5'8\\" or 6'2\\". consequently, the tripod is much too high to use when one is lying prone.That said, this is an excellent product for the price. It makes trips to the range much more enjoyable. I can now go out with buddies and easily call their shots at 100 yards, allowing for quicker corrections of aim and fewer trips down-range to check the target. It turns target shooting into more of a team sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool little scope.","review":"I wanted a good quality, but inexpensive and lightweight spotting scope and that is exactly what this is. It is quite durable as well. I am using it with a SLIK U8000 tripod and padded case. I have had it about 2 years with no problems. I use it for long range viewing and for watching wildlife. The view is clear and crisp enough for me, but will dim at high power like most zooms. This is not a problem in bright sunlight. The setup is light enough for short distance hiking. My only complaint would be that the zoom lens is not par focal. That is, it needs to be re-focused when you change power setting. That is the trade off on the price, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latter-day Godfather wheezes through the holidays","review":"This music gets an A for effort but a C- for delivery.

This book would probably have been 4-stars back in 95' when it won the Nebula. Unfortunately, this book does not stand the test of time. I almost put this down 2/3 of the way through for being too cheesy, but I'm glad I finished it. The story is kind of cool, but it could have been so much better. The main character is too perfect, aside from his judgemental snootiness. And his life is just too convenient, I mean, you're in another city, call an old friend who just happens to have nothing better to do than join you for lunch? And that's not the only thing...the world really does revolve around Peter Hobson, everything is so easy for him. Scientific inventions that go right the first time? POOF, it's like magic isn't it?

It deftly balances believable characterization with brilliant scientific exposition. This was Sawyer's first big award win (he went on to win the Hugo in 2003 for HOMINIDS), and definitely marked a turning point in his career. I've heard Sawyer say that he likes to combine the intimately human with the grandly cosmic and that's certainly what he does here, with the story of a marriage on the rocks set against the discovery of scientific proof for the existence of the human soul (and idea I was initially turned off by but that Sawyer sells very effectively). I think this was the first of Sawyer's books to be set in his hometown of Toronto, something that has become one of his hallmarks. It's not his first to also be a mystery novel (that would be GOLDEN FLEECE), but it certainly is one of the most clever whodunnit premises I've ever seen.

After reading Flashforward (also by Sawyer) and enjoying it sufficiently to look for more by the author, I happened upon Terminal Experiment. I have now had my fill of Sawyer for the forseeable future. Sawyer can't seem to decide what this book is about: mushy theistic philosopy, an affair between the protagonist's wife and her co-worker, a murder mystery, or an AI experiment (of the possibilities, the last at least had potential for an interesting plot). Unfortunately, Sawyer meanders aimlessly through all of the above story lines without addressing any one of them in an interesting way. Combine this with stilted plot, a whiny protagonist, and an uninteresting supporting cast, and you don't have much. Hard to believe this won a Nebula. It might be worth reading if you find it in the pocket of the seat in front of you on the airplane, but this book is certainly not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science fiction with a soul","review":"This book has all the hallmarks of a Robert Sawyer novel: pop culture, real places, real science and questions about God and mortality.

It will keep you enthralled from start to finish. Don't read this book on the subway or you will miss your stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and plausible","review":"A good, easy read. Set in 2011, Terminal Experiment is \\"technology based sci-fi\\" that doesn't seem so far from reality. It's Canadian milieu and evocation of life in the not to distant future are quite good. It's exploration into the mind of its hero--Peter Hobson--is fairly shallow. Likewise its theme: whether morality is changed by mortality (or immortality) is not particularly deep--though it is intriguing. Take this bookif you have an airplane ride ahead.

I like stories that explore and question various moral and ethical situations and dilemmas - I don't like being hit over the head with them. For interesting allegories, read Nancy Kress or Valerie Freireich.

One of my other favorites is \\"You Can't Take That Away from Me\\", which is jazzy, clean and smartly arranged.The old standards are very difficult for just any vocalist to sing. The standards are real music with full composition and intricate vocals and almost all of the songs from this time period (50s, 60s) are from a time when music was truly at it's best....in terms of musicianship, skill and natural talent.The band is awesome and Patti can just SING....Like Natalie Cole, Patti's voice was meant to sing the old standards and it is worth double the money to own this one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ripoff","review":"I suppose if you're going to use a stylus to write or tap on the screen of the Vaio, you're going to need something.

Advice: if you have not, first see a more standard Tosca and then take this one.As for the singers, Alagna looks more as a bon vivant (Domingo wins here, a truly heroic \\"volterian\\") but his singing is passionate, specially at third act; but just look at Gheorghiu and Raimondi... what a pair! Raimondi stands as the most lascivious Scarpia ever (Gobbi, the best one, was cinical), and Gheorghiu seems to be born to sing Floria. This portrait, along with her Violeta Valery, is outstanding.You can blame Jacquot for his arrogance, but when confronting with the intensity of Gheorghiu and Raimondi... well, this is a must for opera on DVD.After Callas/Gobbi, this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surgical Lubricant Review","review":"I had female surgery on January 11, 2011.
